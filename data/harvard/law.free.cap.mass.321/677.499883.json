Later there was a hearing under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 12, as amended, on the issue of present incapacity before a single member of the Industrial Accident Board, who found, \u201cUpon consideration of all the evidence, with particular reference to the report of Dr. Cadis Phipps, who impartially examined the employee on December 5, 1946, and expressed the opinion that there was causal relation between employee\u2019s condition and the piano lifting, I find . . . that the employee continues to be totally incapacitated by reason of his injury of October 8, 1945, and order the insurer to continue the payment of total compensation as heretofore.\u201d The reviewing board affirmed. and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>adopted the findings and decision of the single member. In the Superior Court a decree was entered ordering the continuation of payments. The insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The only question before us relates to the first paragraph of that decree, which reads, \u201cThat on October 8, 1945, the employee received a personal injury arising in and out of the course of his employment, <em>resulting in a general strain of all the intercostal muscles of his chest and myocardial </em>degeneration.\u201d The words in italics are not based on the findings of the reviewing board. It was the duty of the Superior Court, however, \u201cto render a decree in accordance\u201d with the decision of the board. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11, as amended. \u201cThis means that the \u2018decree must be that required as matter of law by the facts set forth in the decision of the board unless the decision is unsupported by evidence or tainted by error of law.\u2019 <em>Lopes\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 581, 585.\u201d <em>Whittaker\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 582, 583. The Superior Court was without power to make the findings in question. <em>Filosa\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 592, 596. That court cannot make findings the reviewing board has not made unless such findings are the result of findings which the reviewing board has made.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The decree is modified by striking out in paragraph 1 thereof the wordjs, \u201cresulting in a general strain of all the intercostal muscles of his chest and myocardial degeneration,\u201d and as so modified it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
