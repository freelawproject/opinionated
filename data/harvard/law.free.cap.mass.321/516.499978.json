At the close of the evidence the defendants filed a motion for a directed verdict. The motion was denied by the judge, and the defendants excepted to that action. The jury returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>a verdict for the plaintiff and the judge reserved leave to enter a verdict for the defendants. Thereafter he denied the defendants\u2019 motion that he so do, subject to the defendants\u2019 exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The jury would have been warranted in finding the following facts: On February 9, 1944, the defendants were the owners of the Slater Building in Worcester. The building extends along Main Street from Elm to Pearl streets in the center of the city. There is a side entrance to the building on Elm Street, which also serves as an exit. There are large offices on the first floor above the street called the Arcade. A flight of stairs runs from the Arcade to the side entrance to the building on Elm Street. There is \u00e1 step down or drop of four inches in floor level from the lobby at the foot of that stairway, \u201cand as one is leaving the building, the drop is behind a pair of wooden swinging doors with glass panels.\u201d If one walked without paying attention or \u201cunconsciously, not knowing it [the drop], . . . [he] might not see the difference in the level.\u201d This variation in level had always existed in the building. On February 9,1944, the plaintiff, after transacting some business in a public loan office on the floor of the building \u201cthe first flight up,\u201d a tenant of the building, which she had reached by a front entrance elevator, came down the stairs leading to the exit on Elm Street. From the bottom of the stairs \u201clooking out the door, the floor seemed [to her] to be the same level.\u201d There was nothing to draw attention to the \u201cdrop.\u201d \u201cThe doors stopped it.\u201d They were swinging doors, and both of them were shut when the plaintiff approached them. She pushed the door, and as she pushed it she did not see any \u201cdrop . . . and . . . was thinking it was the same level as the floor.\u201d She \u201cstarted to step, it was lower, and it was unexpected. It was such a shock . . . that . . . [she] went forward \u201d and fell and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict filed at the close of the evidence and of their motion for entry of a verdict for them under leave reserved by the judge was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"ajt-dedup-1\">It is settled that the plaintiff\u2019s rights as a business invitee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>of the tenant must be measured by the duty that the defendants owed to the tenant, <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>Merchants Cooperative Bank, </em>320 Mass. 425, 426, and cases cited, and that the only duty with respect to the common passageway and exit in question was to use reasonable care to keep them, .as parts of the building that remained in their control, in as good a condition as to safety as that in which they were or appeared to be when the relation of landlord and tenant between the defendants and the tenant began. <em>Sneckner </em>v. <em>Feingold, </em>314 Mass. 613, 614, and cases cited. In the present case, as already noted, the condition complained of had \u201calways\u201d existed. It is appropriate to.add that in <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Evangelical Baptist Benevolent &amp; Missionary Society of Boston, </em>181 Mass. 285, 286, where the personal injury was due to a fall sustained by the plaintiff while passing from one of the rooms of the Tremont Temple Building in Boston to the hallway or corridor on which the room opened, the floor of which was four and seven eighths inches above the floor of the hallway, it was held that such construction could not be said rightly to be \u201cof itself defective or negligent.\u201d To the same effect see <em>Sterns </em>v. <em>Highland Hotel Co. </em>307 Mass. 90, 92-93, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
