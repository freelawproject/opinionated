From this decree the plaintiff appeals. The evidence is not reported. The judge did not state that his findings (which appear to have been voluntary) constituted all of the material facts on which the order for decree was based. But considering the scope and extent of the findings and the fact that the parties have dealt with them as containing all of the material facts, we shall treat them on that basis. See <em>Druker </em>v. <em>Druker, </em>308 Mass. 229, 230. Compare <em>Birnbaum </em>v. <em>Pamoukis, </em>301 Mass. 559, 561-562. Thus the question is whether the decree is warranted on the findings. <em>Goldston </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>293 Mass. 253, 255. <em>Carilli Construction Co. </em>v. <em>John Basile &amp; Co. Inc. </em>317 Mass. 726, 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">The findings may be summarized as follows: Irving C. Ruby (hereinafter called the defendant) during the times here material owned all of the capital stock of the Brookline Liquor Mart, Inc. (hereinafter called the corporation), which owned and operated a so called package store at No. 1354 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston. Some of the shares stood in the names of others who held them \u201cas straws\u201d for the defendant. On or about December 10, 1944, the plaintiff, who is a real estate and business broker, asked the defendant if he wished to sell \u201chis business.\u201d The defendant told him that \u201che would sell the business for $35,000 including all the fixtures, and would take \u2018dollar for dollar\u2019 for the liquors, wines and cordials, the price being based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>cost and invoice value.\u201d It was agreed that the plaintiff\u2019s commission would be $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"AAx\">Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff brought to the defendant three men (hereinafter called the customers) who, after looking over the store, fixtures and merchandise, \u201cwere ready, able and willing to accept . . . [the defendant\u2019s] proposition to buy the business for $35,000 plus the merchandise at cost, and to take a ten years\u2019 lease of the premises which . . . [the defendant] told them he could obtain.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The customers then took the matter up with their attorney, and the defendant consulted his lawyer. \u201cIt was contemplated by the parties that the two attorneys, probably accompanied by their clients, would get together and draw the necessary agreement or agreements.\u201d It was necessary to take an inventory of the merchandise and to ascertain the invoice price of it. It was also necessary to arrange for the transfer of the shares of stock of the corporation from the various holders into the names of the purchasers. And arrangements had to be made either for the assignment of the existing lease of the premises or for a new lease. Despite the plaintiff\u2019s efforts to bring the parties together, they never met thereafter and no agreement was drawn up. Shortly after New Year the defendant, through his attorney, notified the plaintiff that he \u201cwas not willing to go through with the proposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The judge concluded \u201cthat while . . . [the plaintiff] produced customers ready, able and willing to purchase the business on the terms of . . . [the defendant], their acceptance of . . . [the defendant\u2019s] proposition, made through . . . [the plaintiff] and later by . . . [the defendant] himself, was a qualified acceptance, dependent upon arrangement of details to be made by the attorneys. In concluding a transaction involving perhaps some $70,000, the parties intended, before being bound, to put the matter in final form through some written agreement provided by their respective attorneys.\u201d The judge ruled that, inasmuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>as the plaintiff was discharged before \u201cthe customers had finally and definitely accepted the terms of the agreement in the manner above suggested,\u201d he was not entitled to a commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The decree entered in the court below was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">If the finding of the judge that the customers produced by the plaintiff \u201cwere ready, able and willing to accept . . . [the defendant\u2019s] proposition to buy the business for $35,000 plus the merchandise at cost\u201d stood alone, the plaintiff should prevail. To recover a commission a broker ordinarily is required to prove only that he produced a customer who was able, ready and willing to purchase on the seller\u2019s terms. <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Cody, </em>251 Mass. 286, 290. <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>288 Mass. 327. <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Haycock, </em>301 Mass. 594, 595. <em>Barsky </em>v. <em>Hansen, </em>311 Mass. 14, 16. <em>Magann </em>v. <em>Lawler Bros. Theatre Co. </em>312 Mass. 317. <em>Church </em>v. <em>Lawyers Mortgage Investment Corp. of Boston, </em>315 Mass. 1, 8. His right to a commission is not affected by the failure of the customer and seller to enter into a binding agreement, or by the refusal of the seller to carry out the transaction. <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Gilson, </em>176 Mass. 477, 478-479. <em>Cohen </em>v. Ames, 205 Mass. 186, 188. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Levenson, </em>241 Mass. 223, 224. <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>288 Mass. 327, 330. <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Briggs Realty Co. </em>310 Mass. 408, 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">But the finding to which we have just referred must be read in conjunction with the subsequent finding to the effect that the customers\u2019 acceptance of the defendant\u2019s offer was a qualified one, dependent upon the parties settling the details of the bargain and incorporating them in a formal agreement. The latter finding, we think, is not to be treated as inconsistent with the earlier finding and must be construed as controlling it. Inasmuch as the acceptance of the defendant\u2019s offer was qualified, it cannot be said that the plaintiff had produced a customer ready, able and willing to purchase the business on the defendant\u2019s terms. And it appears that the negotiations remained in this state down to the time of the revocation of the plaintiff\u2019s authority by the defendant. The plaintiff, therefore, has failed to establish his right to a commission. <em>Doten </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>237 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>218. <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>265 Mass. 347, 349. <em>Zakszewski </em>v. <em>Kurovitzky, </em>273 Mass. 448, 450. <em>C. F. Noyes National Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Kinnell Realty Corp. </em>277 Mass. 175, 178-179. Since there was no bad faith on his part, the defendant could, without liability to the plaintiff, discharge him at any time before the customers had unqualifiedly accepted the terms of the offer. <em>Cadigan </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>186 Mass. 7, 12-13. <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Kazajian, </em>255 Mass. 459, 462. <em>Pagum </em>v. <em>White, </em>259 Mass. 437, 439. <em>Flax </em>v. <em>Sovrensky, </em>262 Mass. 60, 62. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>285 Mass. 197, 205. In the opinion of a majority of the court the decree dismissing the bill must be</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\n<em>A firmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-15\"> The case is on the equity side of the court because the plaintiff sought to reach and apply the shares of stock owned by the defendant Irving C. Ruby in the Brookline Liquor Mart, Inc., also a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-5\"> The title to the real estate where the package store was located was in the defendant\u2019s wife. The corporation occupied the premises under a ten year lease which in December, 1944, had approximately nine years to run.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
