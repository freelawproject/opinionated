The judge found that the deed was not a forgery, and was delivered to the grantee. But he found that the delivery was subject to the agreement of the grantee not to record the deed until a certain mortgage on the premises should be discharged, and \u25a0 that said mortgage has not been discharged. From a final decree dismissing the bill, the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-17\">\u2022 ..Neither acknowledgment nor recording is necessary to the validity of a deed as between the parties to it.

Notwithstanding the agreement of the grantee not to record the deed until the mortgage should be discharged, it took effect upon the delivery. The agreement, if a condition at all, was not a condition precedent, and did not operate to prevent the passing of the title. <em>Fairbanks </em>v. <em>Metcalf, </em>8 Mass. 230, 238. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>4 Pick. 518, 520. <em>Bromley </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>155 Mass. 509, 511, 512. <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>319 Mass. 321, 324. <em>Flagg </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>2 Sumn. 486, Fed.
