The judge found that the plaintiff\u2019s workmen were negligent, and that the plaintiff was entitled to no recovery. Upon the counterclaims of the defendants, he entered a final decree awarding them damages against the plaintiff for the injury caused by the fire, with costs. There was no appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">Subsequently the plaintiff by leave of court filed a bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>of review on the ground that newly discovered evidence showed that the fire was of incendiary origin and not the result of negligence on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s workmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">On the hearing of the bill of review it was found that there was no newly discovered evidence not available to the plaintiff at the hearing of the original bill. Consequently the judge entered a final decree dismissing the bill of review. The reported evidence supports the finding of the judge. <em>Curley </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>312 Mass. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">No error appearing upon this record, the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
