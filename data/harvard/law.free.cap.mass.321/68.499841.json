Butterfield, late of Swampscott, deceased, filed a first account in which in schedule B thereof the accountant showed a. payment of .$3,336.49 to the guardian of Marion B. Butterfield who was the widow of the decedent. After hearing, it was decreed \"that item 21 of schedule B of $3,336.49 be disallowed: that the accountant be charged in schedule C with the amount of $3,336.49, arid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>as so modified said account be allowed.\u201d The executor and the guardian of Marion B. Butterfield appealed from this decree. Upon the request of the appellants, the judge filed findings of fact. The evidence is not reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">From the findings of fact, it appears that the will of Frank W. Butterfield was proved and allowed on February 10, 1944. It also appears from the findings of fact as follows: \u201cA petition for authority to waive the provisions of the will was filed in behalf of the widow, an incompetent, by her guardian, July 3, 1944, and a waiver of said will was filed in her behalf on July 18, 1944. Hearing was had on the above mentioned petition on May 18, 1945, statements and evidence were offered as to the surrounding conditions and,. thereafter, on June 5, 1945, a decree was entered as follows: 'That said guardian, in behalf of Marion B. Butter-field, the widow of said deceased, be authorized to file a waiver of the provisions of said will as prayed for in said petition.\u2019 \u201d It further appears that the only item in the executor\u2019s first account objected to was item 21, schedule B, and that ''the court finds that the waiver filed July 3', 1944, has not been approved as required.\u201d It is clear from the findings of fact that in the mind of the judge the fact that the waiver was not approved as required by law was the ground for the disallowance of item 21 of the executor\u2019s first account.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 191, \u00a7 15, provides that a waiver of a will must be filed \u201cwithin six months after the probate of the will.\u201d The waiver of the will in this case was filed in behalf of the widow on July 18, 1944, within the six months\u2019 period after the probate of the will on February 10, 1944. By G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 201, \u00a7 45 (see St. 1945, c. 338, \u00a7 2), the guardian of an incompetent widow is authorized in her behalf to waive the provisions of her husband\u2019s will, but by that section it is provided that \u201cno waiver of the provisions of a will under this section shall be valid until approved by the probate court after notice to such, persons, if any, as the court shall deem proper and a hearing thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The question for our determination, is whether, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>facts found by the judge, the waiver by the guardian of the testator\u2019s widow of the provisions of his will was approved by the Probate Court as required by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 201, \u00a7' 45. There has been no such approval unless by the decree of June 5, 1945, herein recited. Although a waiver must be filed within six months after the probate of the will, there is no requirement that the waiver be. approved within that period or that it be approved before it is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The case, therefore, turns upon whether by the decree of June 5, 1945, the waiver of the will of the testator by the guardian of Marion B. Butterfield, his widow, was \"approved\u201d by the Probate Court within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 201, \u00a7 45. We are of opinion that by this decree the waiver was \"approved\u201d by the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The guardian in her petition, described in the findings of fact as a \"petition for authority to waive the provisions of the will,\u201d represented that it was for the interest of the ward \u201cto waive the provisions of said will\u201d and prayed that \"in accordance with the provisions G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 45, she be authorized to file a waiver of the provisions of said will.\u201d The \"character of a pleading or other paper put upon the files of the court must be determined from its essential substance.\u201d <em>E. S. Parks Shellac Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>265 Mass. 108, 110. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Santosuosso, </em>302 Mass. 169, 175. It is to be assumed that the petitioner intehded by her petition \"to accomplish something and not do a futile act.\u201d <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Georgian Inc. </em>280 Mass. 10, 15. The substance of the petition is to secure action by the Probate Court \u201cin accordance with the provisions G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 45,\u201d specifically referred to in the petition. That section confers no authority upon the Probate Court to authorize a guardian of a widow to file a waiver of the provisions of her husband\u2019s will. However, it impliedly authorizes the court to approve such a waiver. The petition clearly indicates that the guardian sought action by the court under said \u00a7 45, that is, approval of the waiver, and not merely authority \"to file a waiver.\u201d The purpose of the petition was to accomplish something, that is, to secure action by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the court under \u00a7 45 \u2014 approval of a waiver \u2014 and not to do a futile act, that is, to secure authority to file a waiver. The petition, therefore, is to be interpreted as a petition for the approval of a waiver of the provisions of the will.. The findings of fact show that upon the petition the court followed a procedure proper for a petition for approval of a waiver under said \u00a7 45. The \u201ceffect and operation of the earlier dfecree are to be determined with reference to the facts found and the issues intended to be decided in that case.\u201d <em>Morehardt </em>v. <em>Dearborn, </em>313 Mass. 40, 46. See also <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>201 Mass. 370, 372; <em>Yankee Network, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>295 Mass. 56, 61. This is particularly true in the present case where the decree was that the guardian \u201cbe authorized to file a waiver of the provisions of said will as prayed for in said petition.\u201d Although the facts found upon the earlier petition do not appear, it is clear that the issue intended to be decided was that presented by the petition. As we have interpreted the petition, the issue intended to be decided thereon was whether a waiver should be approved. We conclude, therefore, that the decree constituted an approval of the waiver on file.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Since we hold that the waiver of the will has been approved and since the lack of such approval appears to have been the only ground for disallowance of item 21 of schedule B of the account, the decree disallowing that item and modifying the account accordingly must be reversed and a decree entered allowing the account as presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
