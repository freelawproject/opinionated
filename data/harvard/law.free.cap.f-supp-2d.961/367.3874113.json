LAPLANTE, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">This dispute over the scope of a professional liability insurance policy arises from a somewhat unusual set of facts, at least as far as professional liability insurance policies are concerned. Whittington Law Associates, PLLC and W.E. Whittington (collectively, the \u201cWhittington defendants\u201d) were evidently the victims of what has become known as a \u201cNigerian Check Scam.\u201d In the typical embodiment of that confidence game, \u201cthe victim is asked to accept what appears to be a legitimate check on behalf of a foreign corporation, deposit the funds, then wire some or all of the proceeds to a foreign account before the victim\u2019s bank realizes the check is, in fact, counterfeit.\u201d <em>Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co. v. Witmeyer, </em>No. lO-cv-55, 2011 WL 3297682, at *1 (E.D.Va. Jan. 6, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">That is precisely what happened here. The Whittington defendants were induced, by a \u201cclient\u201d that did not actually exist, to deposit a sizeable check into their account at Ledyard National Bank and promptly wire the bulk of the funds to a bank account in Japan. By the time Ledyard discovered that the check was invalid, the funds had already been withdrawn from the Japanese account.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">Finding itself more than $150,000 short, Ledyard commenced a state-court action against the Whittington defendants to recover that amount. The Whittington defendants, in turn, sought coverage against that action from their professional liability insurer, Attorneys Liability Protection Society, Inc. (\u201cALPS\u201d), which responded by filing this action seeking a declaratory judgment that it need not provide coverage. The Whittington defendants have counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory judgment to the contrary, and alleging that ALPS breached the insurance contract by declining to provide coverage. This court has jurisdiction of this action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (diversity).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">ALPS has moved for summary judgment on both its claim and the Whittington defendants\u2019 counterclaims. Its arguments are twofold. First, pointing out that the Whittington defendants\u2019 insurance policy provides coverage only for damages arising from \u201can act, error or omission in professional services that were or should have been rendered,\u201d it argues that the events underlying Ledyard\u2019s claim do not meet that definition. Second, it argues that even if Ledyard\u2019s claim falls within the general scope of the policy, that claim is specifically excluded by the policy\u2019s ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>elusion for the \u201cconversion, misappropriation or improper commingling\u201d of funds controlled by the Whittington defendants. The Whittington defendants have cross-moved for summary judgment, unsurprisingly taking a contrary position as to both the scope of the policy and the applicability of the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Having carefully considered the parties\u2019 submissions and heard oral argument, the court concludes that Ledyard\u2019s claim against the Whittington defendants arises from the conversion or misappropriation of funds under the Whittington defendants\u2019 control, and is therefore excluded under the unambiguous policy language. The court accordingly grants ALPS\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and denies the Whittington defendants\u2019 cross-motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">I. <em>Applicable legal standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d if it could reasonably be resolved in either party\u2019s favor at trial. <em>See Estrada v. Rhode Island, </em>594 F.3d 56, 62 (1st Cir.2010) (citing <em>Meuser v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>564 F.3d 507, 515 (1st Cir. 2009)). A fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d if it could sway the outcome under applicable law. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Vineberg v. Bissonnette, </em>548 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir.2008)). In analyzing a summary judgment motion, the court \u201cviews all facts and draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On cross-motions for summary judgment, the court applies this standard to each party\u2019s motion separately. <em>See, e.g., Am. Home </em>Assurance <em>Co. v. ACM Marine Contractors, Inc., </em>467 F.3d 810, 812 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">II. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Defendant W.E. Whittington is a New Hampshire attorney who practices law under the name Whittington Law Associates, PLLC. Late on the evening of July 24, 2011, he received an e-mail from a person claiming to be Richard Downey, an attorney with the Law Offices of Richard L. Downey &amp; Associates in Fairfax, Virginia. \u201cDowney\u201d wrote that he would be \u201csending a client over for a business litigation matter,\u201d and asked Whittington to \u201c[a]dvise of [his] availability.\u201d Once Whittington had done so, the e-mail continued, \u201cDowney\u201d would \u201chave [his] client contact [Whittington] directly with pertinent information.\u201d Whittington did not promptly respond to the e-mail, and late the following night, \u201cDowney\u201d wrote a second, identical e-mail to Whittington, sent from a different email address.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The next morning, Whittington responded to the original e-mail, advising \u201cDowney\u201d that he was \u201ccompletely available\u201d; the morning after that, he responded to \u201cDowney\u2019s\u201d second e-mail, again advising of his availability. Several days later, \u201cDowney\u201d wrote back, informing Whittington that he had \u201cforwarded your contact to my client to establish direct contact and provide pertinent information for your review.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Whittington received an e-mail from a person claiming to be Martin Joachim, a representative of Bendtsteel A/S in Frederiksvaerk, Denmark. \u201cJoachim\u201d advised that he had been referred by Richard Downey, and indicated that he would be forwarding additional information about \u201cour legal matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">In an e-mail to Whittington several days later, \u201cJoachim\u201d outlined the contours of this \u201clegal matter.\u201d According to the email, Mill Steel Supply of Manchester, New Hampshire had made only a part payment for \u201cgoods\u201d supplied by Bendtst<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>eel, with over $500,000 still outstanding. Bendtsteel wished to maintain its otherwise good relationship with Mill Steel Supply, but believed that the retention of the Whittington defendants \u201cand the introduction of legal pressure may initiate immediate payment.\u201d \u201cJoachim\u201d continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">Our expectation of your services for now will be within the scenario of a phone call or demand letter to our customer. This approach will trigger the much needed response from our customer towards payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">When all available options have been exhausted, litigation may be introduced as a last resort. We will forward the pertinent document for your review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">You may send your retainer document for the board to review as we intend to commence immediately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">After checking for conflicts of interest and conducting some internet research on Bendtsteel and Mill Steel Supply (both of which seemed, to Whittington, to be legitimate companies), Whittington advised \u201cJoachim\u201d via e-mail that he had no conflict of interest, and forwarded an engagement letter. \u201cJoachim\u201d returned a signed copy of the engagement letter (again via email), and informed Whittington that, after being notified of Bendtsteel\u2019s intention \u201cto retain legal services as regards our claim,\u201d Mill Steel Supply had promised to make payment. Following additional e-mail correspondence, \u201cJoachim\u201d informed Whittington that Mill Steel Supply had \u201cmade a part payment to you/your firm to avoid litigation,\u201d and that the payment would be sent directly to Whittington\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">On August 31, 2011, Whittington received a UPS package containing a check in the amount of $195,790, purportedly issued by Citibank, N.A. on behalf of Mill Steel Supply and payable to Whittington Law. He promptly notified \u201cJoachim\u201d of the receipt, asking whether \u201cJoachim\u201d wanted the funds wired to him and proposing that the Whittington defendants keep $2,000 as a retainer. \u201cJoachim\u201d responded, agreeing to the $2,000 retainer and requesting that Whittington ask his bank \u201cto transfer by swift to our creditor MS CAR FACTORY COMPANY LTD in CHIBA-KEN, JAPAN the sum of $188,-978.000 (USD).\u201d Wire transfer instructions were attached. The Whittington defendants immediately deposited the check into their client trust account at Ledyard National Bank, and requested that the bank wire the funds as directed by \u201cJoachim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Ledyard completed the transfer on September 6, 2011. Later that same day, Ledyard received notification that Citibank would not honor the check, and attempted \u2014 unsuccessfully\u2014to recall the wire transfer. A subsequent investigation determined that the check was fraudulent, and that \u201cDowney\u201d and \u201cJoachim\u201d were fake identities (although Richard Downey and his law firm actually existed, his website had been hacked and the e-mail was not from the real Richard Downey).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">Ledyard responded to this revelation by seizing the funds remaining in the Whittington defendants\u2019 client trust account to offset its loss. It also filed a state-court lawsuit against the Whittington defendants, seeking to recover the balance of the lost funds. The Whittington defendants duly reported the suit to ALPS, their professional liability insurer, requesting that ALPS provide them with a defense against Ledyard\u2019s action. ALPS denied coverage and filed this declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">III. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">As is often true of insurance coverage disputes, this case does not involve any real disagreement as to the underlying facts. The outcome turns instead on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>interpretation of the Whittington defendants\u2019 insurance policy, over which there is much disagreement. As noted at the outset, that disagreement concerns two clauses in particular. The first of these is the policy\u2019s coverage clause, which, in pertinent part, provides coverage for claims arising from or in connection with \u201can act, error or omission in professional services that were or should have been rendered by the Insured.\u201d Ins. Pol\u2019y (document no. 18-7) at 2, \u00a7 1.1.1 (boldface omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second is one of the policy\u2019s multifarious exclusions, for claims arising from or in connection with the \u201cconversion, misappropriation or improper commingling by any person\u201d of client funds or funds \u201cheld or controlled by an Insured in any capacity or under any authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, \u00a7 3.1.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The parties\u2019 memoranda devote considerable attention to the first clause. ALPS, noting that the policy defines \u201cprofessional services\u201d to be \u201cservices or activities performed for others as an attorney in an attorney-client relationship,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 6, \u00a7 2.22.1, argues that the policy does not provide any coverage because the Whittington defendants \u201cdid not have an attorney-client relationship with any actual client.\u201d Memo, in Supp. of ALPS\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J. (document no. 18-1) at 15. For their part, the Whittington defendants argue that an \u201cactual client\u201d is not necessary to an \u201cattorney-client relationship,\u201d and that the only requirement is an attorney\u2019s \u201cgood faith belief ... that he had entered into a legitimate attorney-client relationship.\u201d Memo, in Supp. of Defts.\u2019 Mot. for Summ. J. (document no. 21-1) at 12-13. Each side cites several cases involving similar facts in support of its favored interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">While the interpretation of the first clause is interesting \u2014 particularly in light of the divergent results reached by the cases the parties cite<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 this court need not resolve that issue. Assuming without deciding that Ledyard\u2019s claim against the Whittington defendants arises from or in connection with \u201can act, error or omission in professional services that were or should have been rendered by the Insured,\u201d such that the policy would ordinarily provide coverage against it under the first clause, that claim is excluded under the second clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">The interpretation of insurance policy language is a question of law for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>court. <em>Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Doe, </em>161 N.H. 73, 75, 8 A.3d 154 (2010). \u201cInsurers are free to contractually limit the extent of their liability through use of a policy exclusion.\u201d <em>Progressive N. Ins. Co. v. Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>151 N.H. 649, 653, 864 A.2d 368 (2005). \u201cSuch language must be so clear, however, as to create no ambiguity that might, affect the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An ambiguity exists when, considering the exclusion \u201cin its appropriate context, and construing] the words used according to their plain, ordinary, and popular definitions ... the parties may reasonably differ about the interpretation of the language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court ultimately \u201cinterprets exclusion language to mean what a reasonable person would construe it to mean.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">In full, the relevant policy exclusion provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">THIS POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY CLAIM ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH ... [a]ny conversion, misappropriation or improper commingling by any person of client or trust account funds or property, or funds or property of any other person held or controlled by an Insured in any capacity or under any authority, including any loss or reduction in value of such funds or property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Ins. Pol\u2019y (document no. 18-7) at 8, \u00a7 3.1.13. As the Whittington defendants note, \u201cthis exclusion has apparently not been reviewed by any court in a reported decision.\u201d Memo, of Law in Supp. of Defts.\u2019 Mot. for Summ. J. (document no. 21-1) at 22. That is not, however, an obstacle to its application here, as its terms are clear and unambiguous as applied to the facts of this case. Ledyard\u2019s claim against the Whittington defendants arises from the scammer\u2019s misappropriation of the bank\u2019s funds, which the Whittington defendants controlled, and thus falls squarely within this exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The Whittington defendants\u2019 arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. In their memorandum in support of their motion for summary judgment, they focus solely on whether the misappropriated funds were \u201cclient or trust account funds or property,\u201d asserting that because Led-yard \u201cis not seeking to recover\u201d such funds and \u201c[t]he $195,790 represented by the fraudulent check was simply never in the firm\u2019s [client trust] account ... the exclusion by its own terms is inapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By its own terms, though, the exclusion does not apply solely to the misappropriation of \u201cclient or trust account funds or property.\u201d It also applies to the misappropriation of, simply, \u201cfunds\u201d that are \u201cheld or controlled by an Insured in any capacity or under any authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Perhaps recognizing their oversight, in their opposition to ALPS\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Whittington defendants assert that they \u201cnever actually held or controlled the money sent to [them] by Citibank\u201d because \u201c[t]he money represented by the $195,790 check that was purported to come from Citibank ... never existed.\u201d Defts.\u2019 Memo, in Supp. of Obj. to Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J. (document no. 23-1) at 10. Ledyard\u2019s action does not, however, arise from the scammer\u2019s misappropriation of the nonexistent funds \u201crepresented by the $195,790 check,\u201d so whether the Whittington defendants actually controlled <em>those </em>funds is irrelevant. What is relevant is whether the Whittington defendants controlled the funds that <em>were </em>misappropriated, and which are the subject of Ledyard\u2019s claim against the Whittington defendants \u2014 the funds the Whittington defendants instructed Ledyard to wire to the Japanese bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">The Whittington defendants plainly controlled those funds, as their attorney con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>ceded at oral argument. To \u201ccontrol\u201d something, in the sense that term is used in the policy, means \u201cto exercise restraining or directing influence over\u201d or \u201cto have power over.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>496 (2002). The Whittington defendants\u2019 \u201cdirecting influence\u201d or \u201cpower over\u201d the funds in question is evident from the fact that the bank wired those funds at their direction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the clause refers to funds controlled by the Whittington defendants \u201cin any capacity or under any authority,\u201d a clause broad enough to encompass the Whittington defendants\u2019 status as account holders at Ledyard. Indeed, the Whittington defendants\u2019 authority, as account holders, to direct the bank how to disperse the funds at issue was the linchpin on which the scam itself turned; if the Whittington defendants had no such authority, the scam could not have been accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The Whittington defendants also argue that the exclusion is ambiguous because ALPS could have included additional language in the policy to exclude claims \u201carising out of, in connection with, or in consequence of ... the dishonoring of any financial instrument.\u201d Defts.\u2019 Memo, in Supp. of Obj. to Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J. (document no. 23-1) at 11 (quoting <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Northland Ins. Co., </em>31 So.3d 214, 215 n. 1 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2010)) (emphasis omitted); <em>see also </em>Defts.\u2019 Reply (document no. 25) at 7. Determining whether a policy exclusion is ambiguous, though, does not turn on whether the insurer might have included another, more precise exclusion. As already discussed, ambiguity turns instead on whether \u201cthe parties may reasonably differ about the interpretation of the language\u201d of the exclusion that was <em>actually </em>included in the policy. <em>Concord Gen. Mut. Ins., </em>151 N.H. at 653, 864 A.2d 368. And, for the reasons already discussed, the parties can not \u201creasonably differ\u201d as to whether Ledyard\u2019s claim falls within the scope of \u00a7 3.1.13\u2019s exclusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">As \u00e1 last resort, in their reply brief, the Whittington defendants argue that the language of \u00a7 3.1.13 quoted above does not apply at all, and that a version of the exclusion that ALPS promulgated in August 2011 applies instead. This position directly contradicts the position the Whittington defendants take in their memorandum in support of their motion for summary judgment, in which they rely upon the same version of \u00a7 3.1.13 quoted above. <em>See </em>Memo, in Supp. of Defts.\u2019 Mot. for Summ. J. (document no. 21-1) at 21-22. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>This court ordinarily does not consider arguments made for the first time in reply, <em>see Doe v. Friendfinder Network, Inc., </em>540 F.Supp.2d 288, 303 n. 16 (D.N.H.2008), a practice that is even more sensible when a party\u2019s tardily-contrived arguments are in conflict with its own earlier arguments, <em>see Beane v. Beane, </em>856 F.Supp.2d 280, 298 (D.N.H.2012). The court also does not, for that matter, consider inadmissible evidence on summary judgment, <em>see, e.g., Elmo v. Callahan, </em>2012 DNH 144 at 18, 2012 WL 3669010, and the \u201cnew\u201d version of \u00a7 3.1.13 upon which the Whittington defendants rely is unauthenticated and hence inadmissible, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 901(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The new version of the exclusion does not help the Whittington defendants in any event. That version excludes claims arising out of or in connection with \u201c[a]ny conversion, misappropriation, improper commingling or negligent supervision of client or trust account funds or property, or funds or property of any other person held or controlled by an Insured in any capacity or under any authority,.... \u201d Revised Ins. Pol\u2019y (document no. 25-1) at 8, \u00a7 3.1.13.

Reading the exclusion \u201cin its appropriate context,\u201d <em>Concord Gen. Mut. Ins., </em>151 N.H. at 653, 864 A.2d 368, though, it is apparent that the revision worked no such change.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">When the policy excludes coverage for claims arising from the insured\u2019s acts, it includes a specific limitation to that effect. By way of example, the policy contains exclusions for claims arising from or in connection with:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\"><em>An Insured\u2019s </em>activities as an elected public official or as an employee of a governmental body, subdivision, or agency thereof; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\"><em>An Insured\u2019s </em>activities or capacity as a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any regulation or order issued pursuant thereto; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">Alleged discrimination <em>by an Insured, </em>including discrimination based on race, color, creed, age, sex, nationality, marital status or sexual orientation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">Alleged sexual harassment or misconduct <em>by an Insured;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\"><em>An Insured\u2019s </em>rendering of investment advice to any person, including but not limited to advice concerning securities, real property, commodities or franchises; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\"><em>An Insured\u2019s </em>services or capacity as a broker, dealer, investment advisor, business manager, accountant, real estate broker or real estate agent[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">Revised Ins.

So the very fact that the exclusion set forth in \u00a7 3.1.13 is not limited to \u201can <em>Insured\u2019s </em>conversion, misappropriation, improper commingling or negligent supervision\u201d or \u201cconversion, misappropriation, improper commingling or negligent supervision <em>by an Insured \u201d </em>is enough to set it apart from its confederates, and to make clear to any reasonable person that the \u201cbad or negligent act\u201d need <em>not </em>be done by the insured. The phrase \u201cby any person\u201d was surplusage, and its deletion made no change to the substance of the exclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The Whittington defendants finally protest that \u201cno law firm purchasing professional liability insurance would expect that permitting its client trust account to be pilfered would not be covered.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defts.\u2019 Reply (document no. 25) at 9 (quoting <em>O\u2019Brien &amp; Wolf, </em>2012 WL 3156802 at *8). It suffices to say in response that if the plain and unambiguous language of the insurance policy excludes coverage for those acts, the insured law firm should expect just that. That is the case here, and ALPS is entitled to summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">For the foregoing reasons, ALPS\u2019s motion for summary judgment<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is GRANTED, and the Whittington defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is DENIED. The clerk shall enter judgment accordingly and close the case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\">. The policy pervasively deploys boldface type, using it for terms that are defined in the body of the policy itself, and also to emphasize certain passages of text. Instead of either copying each occurrence of boldface when quoting the policy or commenting on its omission, this order omits the boldface from any quoted portion of the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">. <em>Compare Nardella Chong, P.A. v.

(In light of these cases, the court might need to reconsider its statement that this case \"arises from a somewhat unusual set of facts, at least as far as professional liability insurance policies are concerned.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 368.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\">. As ALPS notes, several courts have concluded that one exercises control over funds by directing that they be wired. <em>See, e.g., Gould v. Georgia, </em>273 Ga.App. 155, 614 S.E.2d 252, 255 (2005) (\"[A]n individual can exercise control over funds by directing a wire transfer.\u201d); <em>Bailey v. Texas, </em>885 S.W.2d 193, 199 (Tex.Ct. App.1994) (defendant \"exercised control over\u201d bank funds by \"orchestrating] a wire transfer\u201d from one account to another). The Whittington defendants assert that these cases are inapposite because they \"have absolutely nothing at all to do with insurance\u201d and \u201cinvolve the theft of 'real' money,\u201d not \u201ca counterfeit check or the wiring of funds that did not exist.\u201d Defts.\u2019 Reply (document no. 25) at 6. This argument \u2014 which rather flippantly ignores the fact that this case also involves \u201cthe theft of 'real' money\u201d from the bank and its depositors \u2014 does not diminish these cases' instructive value as to the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \"control.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b411-11\">. At oral argument, the Whittington defendants argued that the exclusion was ambiguous as actually written, contending that the parties could reasonably differ as to whether the term \"any person\u201d referred only to persons employed by or acting on behalf of an Insured. This argument was not presented in any of the Whittington defendants' memoranda and is untimely. <em>See Johnson v. Gen. Dynamics Info. Tech., Inc., </em>675 F.Supp.2d 236, 241 n. 3 (D.N.H.2009). It is also unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b412-6\">. The Whittington defendants also argue that the addition of \"negligent supervision\u201d to \u00a7 3.1.13 (which, they say, does not bind them) \"highlights the ambiguity in the original exclusion\u201d by demonstrating that the earlier version did not exclude claims arising from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>negligence of the type alleged in Ledyard\u2019s suit against them. Defts.\u2019 Reply (document no. 25) at 8. But, as already discussed, in reviewing policy language for ambiguity, this court reviews the language of the policy as it was actually written and does not speculate about how it might have been written.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b413-10\">. This protestation, it bears noting, is in tension with the Whittington defendants\u2019 argument \u2014 discussed above \u2014 that the \"pilfered\u201d funds were not in their client trust account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b413-11\">.

As a member of the bar of this court, ALPS\u2019s counsel is expected to be familiar with and observe the local rules of this court. Counsel is reminded that pursuant to Local Rule 5.1(a), \u201d[f]ootnotes shall be used sparingly.\u201d In spite of this rule, every citation to the record or to authority in ALPS\u2019s legal memoranda is contained in a footnote, begetting around 150 footnotes total.
