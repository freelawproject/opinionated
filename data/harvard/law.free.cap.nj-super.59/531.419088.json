A fair appraisement of the testimony of the petitioner and his witness, Gary Naftalis, warrants the following determination of facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">Petitioner, a college student, about 19 years of age, was a part-time employee in a drug store owned by respondent. Selling merchandise, making deliveries, posting advertising matter on the windows of the store and odd jobs fell within the routine of his duties. On the day in question he was mounted on a ladder, changing the window signs: removing the old signs which were held in place by masking tape and replacing them with new ones. While so engaged, his acquaintance, Naftalis, happened by. The two engaged in conversation. Subsequently, Sam Skuratofsky, petitioner\u2019s assailant, came along and he, too, stopped and stood on the sidewalk, at the ladder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">The manner of Skuratofsky\u2019s arrival on the scene and the development of events at that time and thereafter are the subjects of diverse accounts by Pittel and Naftalis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">Pittel\u2019s testimony is to the effect that Naftalis was telling him about various things that had occurred at Weequahic High School, which Naftalis attended, and that there was included in this recountal the story of a fistic encounter in which someone had been \u2018beaten up.\u2019 Petitioner \u2018made a few comments about the nature of the person who had committed these particular offenses.\u2019 Petitioner said that while this conversation was going on, he was facing the window, his back towards Naftalis, and that he was unaware that the subject of his remarks had \u2018walked up in the meantime\u2019 and was standing alongside the ladder. He did not know Skuratofsky, he said, and he desisted from further remarks when he learned who he was. Skuratofsky is said to have asked whether he was a \u2018wise guy\u2019 and \u2018looking for trouble,\u2019 and these inquiries were followed by Sam\u2019s making certain \u2018insinuations,\u2019 which petitioner said he ignored because he was in no mood to \u2018start any difficulty with him.\u2019 Skuratofsky \u2018insisted on fighting\u2019; Pittel declined the challenge and continued working. Pittel related that he then picked up a razor blade to use in cleaning the window and that Skuratofsky thereupon \u2018acted as if there was some sort of aggression on my part, and he knocked it out of my hand, which I ignored.\u2019 His assailant then pulled him from the ladder, punching him as he did so. Petitioner fell to the ground and was thrashed by Skuratofsky until a policeman arrived and rescued him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">Naftalis\u2019s account of events is in a different vein. He related that while he was talking to Pittel, Sam came along on his way from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>school. <em>Sam </em>stopped to talk to them and was \u2018bragging\u2019 about how he had started a fight in the hall 'with some kid for no reason at all.\u2019 Pittel responded by saying something to the effect that, \u2018You think you are big because you do something like that\u2019; or, \u2018you think you are pretty big because you can pick on people.\u2019 Sam then invited the petitioner to come off the ladder and fight him. Petitioner replied that he did not want to fight. Sam then pulled him from the ladder and beat him. There is no mention of a razor blade in this witness\u2019s account. And it appeared on cross-examination of petitioner that a statement made by him within a month after the alleged accident made no reference to a razor blade, but it did contain the information that Sam \u2018knocked some masking tape out of my hand and told me to get off the ladder.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">It is patent to me that the truth of the matter is to be found in the recital of Naftalis. That version is strongly favored by probability. Pittel\u2019s account appears improbable. It is highly unlikely that on this open sidewalk Skuratofsky should have come upon the scene without notice of either petitioner or Naftalis. And, if his immediate arrival had gone unnoticed, it is not likely that his standing there would have escaped the attention of Naftalis, to say the least. Unlikely, too, is it that Naftalis would then have launched upon or continued with his account of Skuratofsky\u2019s fistic feat. He knew Sam. He also knew that Sam was in a \u2018rotten mood\u2019 that day. and that the subject of his aggressiveness was not the best channel into which to direct his conversation with Pittel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">As previously indicated, petitioner was close to 19 years of age. He was in freshman class in Rutgers University. He had previously attended Weequahic High School. Naftalis was about 16 years old. Skuratofsky\u2019s age is not known, but Pittel \u2018assumed\u2019 that he was a freshman in the high school. The expectable happened when Sam boasted about his fighting exploit. The more mature Pittel took him to task and upbraided him for his conduct. His censorious remarks were taken most unkindly and the eruption ensued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">In resolving the issue of Pittel\u2019s credibility I have taken into account his obvious evasiveness in parrying the efforts of counsel, on cross-examination, to inquire into previous automobile accidents in which the petitioner had been involved and the injuries or claims of injury resulting therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">The factual situation, as I have found it to be, does not constitute the attack a compensable accident, since it is clear that the battery did not arise out of or in the course of the employment. It occurred, not because of any condition imposed by, or duty performed in the course of, the employment, but solely because the petitioner undertook to impose upon his assailant his personal views concerning the latter\u2019s conduct. This was the source of the trouble. The employment had nothing to do with it, as either a sole or contributing cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">The claimant argues that his right to compensation is firmly grounded on such cases as, <em>Geltman, v. Reliable Linen Supply Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>443 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1942) ; <em>Sanders v. Jarka Corp., </em>1 <em>N. J. </em>36 (1948) ; <em>Cierpial v. Ford Motor Co., </em>16 <em>N. J. </em>561 (1954) ; <em>Giracelli v. Franklin Cleaners and Dyers, Inc., </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>590 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945) ; <em>Howard v. Harwood\u2019s Restaurant Co., </em>25 <em>N. J. </em>72 (1957). But on the facts here found the instant case is clearly distinguishable from the cases cited. The \u2018but for\u2019 or \u2018positional\u2019 doctrine for which those cases [stand] does not embrace the situation where the place of employment was merely the <em>situs </em>for a personal set-to that had its origin entirely in the discordant natures of persons who were concerned solely with a matter that had nothing to do with the employment. The employment did not give rise to this attack, nor did it expose the petitioner to danger of attack. The situation here found falls within that category of risks described by the <em>Howard </em>case as \u2018those personal to the claimant.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">In exploiting the strength of his legal position, the petitioner makes much of the fact that he was in a \u2018trapped, or target position, \u201cup a tree\u201d at the top of a ladder,\u2019 and thus unable to escape the onslaught of his assailant. But this consideration falls before the basic reasoning that whatever risk existed was generated entirely by the petitioner\u2019s personal activity. That he chose an unpropitious time and position for the airing of his personal views does not change the origin of the risk. It pertains merely to the fact that he invited, a greater risk or hazard than a less vulnerable position would have entailed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">The petition is dismissed. A judgment, consented to as to form, may be submitted by the respondent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> We are of the view that the judgment should be affirmed, and basically for the reasons set forth in Judge Lyons\u2019 opinion. Our views as to what is discussed in the next to the last paragraph of the opinion are more specifically stated hereinafter. We particularly agree with the factual conclusion of the county judge that the story told by the apparently disinterested witness, Naftalis, is more credible than that of the petitioner as to when the latter began his derogatory references to the assailant, Skuratofsky, and as to whether petitioner was holding a razor. These remarks were made by petitioner as a gratuitous commentary upon Skuratofsky\u2019s graceless boasts, and were intended to be heard by the latter. The consequent assault and injury were motivated purely by Skuratofsky\u2019s taking offense at what he regarded as a personal affront to him by petitioner. No circumstance related to the employment milieu had any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>thing to do with the assault \u2014 whether by way of motivation, making its accomplishment possible by lending it convenience, or otherwise causally contributing to its occurrence \u2014circumstances variously found in the pertinent reported cases allowing recovery. When an assault on an employee is solely the product of personal <em>animus </em>against him by the assailant, particularly where the latter is not a fellow-employee, and there is no more connection between the assault and the employment than that it occurs while the employee is at work, recovery is not allowed. Our most recent judicial notice of this principle is found in <em>Howard v. Harwood\u2019s Restaurant Co., </em>25 <em>N. J. </em>72, 84, 85 (1957), and <em>Crotty v. Driver Harris Co., </em>49 <em>N. J. Super. </em>60, 71 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958). See 1 <em>Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>(1952), \u00a7 11.20, <em>p. </em>136. In such a situation the risk cannot be said to be \u201creasonably incident\u201d to the employment and therefore the accident does not arise out of it. <em>Belyus v. Wilkinson, Gaddis &amp; Co., </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>43, 47 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935), affirmed 116 <em>N. J. D. </em>92 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1936). This is clearly the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Petitioner\u2019s attempt to relate this assault to the employment on the basis of his position on the ladder at the time it \u25a0 occurred is not effective because the evidence does not justify the inference that this was any factor in Skuratofsky\u2019s motivation or that the assault would have been any less likely or injurious had petitioner been merely standing on the sidewalk and made the same offending comment, under the same circumstances. The issue, of course, is not whether the comment justified the assault, but solely whether the episode as a whole was personal in nature as between assailant and victim and not otherwise employment-associated beyond the merely coincidental positional factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Petitioner relies upon <em>Martin v. Snuffy\u2019s Steak House, </em>46 <em>N. J. Super. </em>425 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957). The case does not help him since there the entire altercation was between fellow-employees and grew directly out of the performance of their respective duties for the common employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
