A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AD9\">Plaintiffs Eldon V. Tabor and Edward J. Callahan, rear-seat passengers in a two-door Oldsmobile convertible being driven by the defendant William O\u2019Grady, instituted this action in the Union County Court to recover damages for personal injuries sustained when the automobile collided with an iron telephone pole on Broad Street, Newark, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>on April 27, 1957. The collision was the end Tesu.lt of the reckless and grossly negligent conduct of the operator in driving, at 3 :30 in the morning, from Elizabeth to Newark at speeds in excess of 70 miles per hour. O\u2019Grady\u2019s father, the owner of the vehicle, was also named as a party defendant, but the case against him was dismissed at the conclusion of the proofs. The principal issues tried and submitted to the jury were the negligence of O\u2019Grady in his operation of the automobile and the asserted contributory negligence of the plaintiffs, who were invitees, either in failing to control or restrain the driver or in failing to remove themselves from the automobile when the opportunity presented itself. The jury resolved these issues in favor of plaintiffs, awarding damages of $25,000 to Tabor and $424 <em>to </em>Callahan.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Defendant moved to set the verdicts aside on two grounds: (1) plaintiffs, and particularly Tabor, had been guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law; and (2) the summation of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to the jury was improper, prejudicial and inflammatory. The trial judge ruled that there was evidence that Tabor had been intoxicated, that the jury could logically have concluded that he lacked the capacity to appreciate the extent of the peril to him, and that therefore he was not necessarily contributorily negligent in remaining in the vehicle. The court did not directly pass upon the propriety of the summation, reasoning that defendant\u2019s negligence was clear, the verdicts were not excessive and, as a result, \u201cthose emotional remarks had no effect upon the jury * * On this appeal, defendant challenges both of these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Plaintiff Tabor, 27 years of age on the date of the accident, left his home in Linden, N. J., at 6:00 p. M. on Eriday evening, April 26, 1957. He went to a White Castle restaurant in Linden and \u201cstayed there for a while.\u201d He then went to a White Castle in Elizabeth, his friend Bernie driving him. At about <em>11:00 </em>p. m\\, Tabor went to the Silver Moon bar in Elizabeth and there consumed a pizza pie and \u201cthree or four highballs,\u201d consisting of whisky. He left at about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>midnight and had nothing further to drink during the evening. Tabor then returned to the Elizabeth White Castle, where he met the plaintiff Callahan, the defendant O\u2019Grady, and O\u2019Grady\u2019s friend, James W. Hoey.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Prior to arriving at the White Castle on his motorcycle, Callahan had had four to seven glasses of beer. As for Hoey and the 19-year-old O\u2019Grady, they had gone for a ride with two girls in O\u2019Grady\u2019s father\u2019s car, had taken the girls home, and then proceeded to the White Castle located at the corner of Elmora and Westfield Avenues. Neither had imbibed any alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">These four young men remained at the White Castle until after 3 :00 A. m., talking, drinking coffee, and reading newspapers. Callahan went to drive home but while astride his motorcycle, it fell because the kickstand was not down. The others did not think Callahan \u201cwas in shape to drive the motorcycle home,\u201d and it was taken to a nearby parking lot and left there for the night. When O\u2019Grady offered to drive Tabor and Callahan home, all four entered O\u2019Grady\u2019s car. Hoey sat next to the driver and plaintiffs, as noted, sat in the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">O\u2019Grady did not testify, and it is uncontroverted that he drove the car at an excessive rate of speed, estimated at 70 to 75 miles per hour. Hoey remembered that, at times, the accelerator was depressed \u201call the way.\u201d O\u2019Grady ignored several red traffic lights and was going too fast to be able to stop for another. After speeding recklessly through Elizabeth, O\u2019Grady came to the beginning of Broad Street, Newark, a 25-mile-per-hour zone. In making a left turn onto that street, there was some difficulty with a hub-cap. O\u2019Grady stopped the ear next to the curb and got out. When he returned, the frantic ride continued down Broad Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">At least twice during this 10-minute, 3%-mile ride, Hoey told O\u2019Grady to \u201cslow down.\u201d The convertible top being down, he was required to speak in a \u201cpretty loud\u201d tone of voice. Hoey testified he spoke loud enough for the two men in the rear to hear him. O\u2019Grady merely replied, \u201cAre you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>chicken?\u201d to which Hoey answered, \u201cYes * * * Slow down.\u201d Tabor and Callahan did not similarly protest. At the trial, Tabor explained, \u201cBecause I heard Hoey name it to him and I* thought if it was saying anything more it would make it worse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">O\u2019Grady eventually crashed into a telephone pole on Broad Street, resulting in the injuries for which Tabor and Callahan brought this action. Tabor was taken to the Martland Medical Center. A hospital record, admitted into evidence without objection, concluded with a finding of a physician to this effect: \u201cAcute alcoholic intoxication.\u201d The record also states: \u201cPt. has strong ethenol odor on breath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">At the trial the defense offered no witnesses but relied mainly on testimony elicited from Tabor on cross-examination to support the charge of contributory negligence. Tabor testified in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">\u201cQ. When he started off from the White Castle going at 75 miles an hour, 70 to 75\u2019 miles an hour, and going through red lights did you then become concerned? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">Q. Did you then recognize that this constituted a danger to you and your life and limbs? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">Q. And what did you do about it? A. I didn\u2019t do nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">Q. In other words, you were balancing the concern that you had for your life and limb as against the discomfort or inconvenience that you have in getting back to Linden? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\"># jJs :\u00a1\u00ed * <em>% </em>:\u00a1\u00ed \u00ed\u00a18 &gt;|s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">Q. Tabor, were you drunk when you were in that car? A. No, I wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">Q. What was your physical condition? A. Well, I was drinking; I was a little bit high.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-15\">Q. You were a little bit high? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-16\"><em>$ </em>\u2756 # # * \u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-17\">By the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-18\">Q. You were in control of your faculties so that you knew you were in danger. A. Yes, that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-19\">Q. Isn\u2019t that right? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-20\">Expressed in the bribf of the defendant is the view that the trial judge erred in refusing to rule, at the close of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 caso and upon the motion for a new trial, that Tabor was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law and as established by his own testimony. It is urged that Tabor\u2019s utterances from the witness stand conclusively proved that he was fully cognizant of O\u2019Grady\u2019s reckless operation of the automobile and that he failed to act as a reasonably prudent person in not taking affirmative action to avoid the manifest danger. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument in reply, adopted by the trial judge, is that, whatever Tabor may have testified to, it was still open to the jury to find that he was intoxicated, that he did not therefore appreciate the peril, and was thus not required to remove himself from the vehicle when O\u2019Grady stopped to examine the hub-cap shortly before the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">We have concluded that it is not necessary to consider whether there was sufficient evidence of Tabor\u2019s intoxication to present a jury issue as we are satisfied that the question is not material to the issue of Tabor\u2019s negligence. The mere fact that plaintiffs, or either of them, were intoxicated does not exculpate them from the charge of contributory negligence, as we shall further develop hereinafter. Since in any event there must be a new trial in this case, see the discussion <em>infra </em>of the second ground of appeal, it is necessary to express our views on the defense of contributory negligence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\"> A passenger in an automobile must exercise such reasonable care and caution as an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under like circumstances. <em>Ambrose v. Cyphers, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>138, 150 (1959); <em>Bowman v. Central R. Co., </em>27 <em>N. J. Super. </em>370, 375 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953). The guest has the right to assume that the driver will exercise proper care and caution and, until he has actual or constructive notice that the driver is incompetent to' operate the vehicle or is operating it in a negligent manner, there is no duty to supervise the driving, to keep a lookout for danger or to warn of a danger as to which there is reason to believe the driver is aware. But while the passenger ordinarily has no duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>control or direct the driver, there is a point where passive reliance upon the driver ends and the duty to take affirmative action begins. 5A <em>Am. Jur., Automobiles and Highway Traffic, </em>\u00a7 789 (1956). When it should become apparent that the vehicle is being driven negligently, reasonable care requires that the passenger protest or remonstrate with the driver in an effort to persuade him to drive earefulfy. <em>Id., </em>at \u00a7 800. If the protests are disregarded, there is a duty to leave the car when a reasonable opportunity is afforded, if a reasonably prudent man would do so in like circumstances. <em>Id., </em>at \u00a7 802. The duty to alight is qualified by the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"> In the present case, plaintiffs, even if not intoxicated, could not at the time they entered the car reasonably have anticipated that O\u2019Grady would drive in such suicidal' fashion; O\u2019Grady was not intoxicated and there was no other basis for a suspicion that he was incompetent to drive. See <em>King v. Jones, </em>47 <em>N. J. Super. </em>279, 283 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957); <em>Orbanus v. Seder, </em>48 <em>N. J. Super. </em>512, 516 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957); compare <em>Petrone v. Margolis, </em>20 <em>N. J. Super. </em>180 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952). <em>Cf. Sothern v. Van Dyke, </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>1, 8 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1934). Moreover, there was no evidence that O\u2019Grady was not fully alert to the peril he was creating; plaintiffs were not, therefore, under <em>Ambrose v. Cyphers, supra, </em>29 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pages </em>150-151, in violation of the duty to warn of danger. As to the obligation to remonstrate, distinguishable from the duty to warn of a specific danger, Tabor could be found by a jury- to have been reasonably of the belief that any protest on his part would do more harm than good. O\u2019Grady having ignored Hoey\u2019s remonstrances, it is questionable that any 'further protest would have averted the risk, and the fact-finder could justifiably find no departure from reasonably prudent conduct in plaintiffs\u2019 remaining' silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The only remaining contributory fault with which plaintiffs can reasonably be charged is to have known and appreciated the peril and to have voluntarily chosen not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>alight from the ear when the opportunity presented itself. It is this alleged default of duty that plaintiffs assert is excused, in part, by their having been in an intoxicated state. The law in this jurisdiction is otherwise. While voluntary intoxication does not itself constitute negligence, it does not excuse acts or omissions which fail to conform to the conduct of the reasonably prudent and sober man. <em>Bageard v. Consolidated Traction Co., </em>64 <em>N. J. L. </em>316, 322-323 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1900); <em>Petrone v. Margolis, supra, </em>20 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>188; <em>Hoppock v. Easton Transit Co., </em>77 <em>N. J. L. </em>342, 343 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1909); 2 <em>Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts </em>(1956), \u00a7 16.7, <em>pp. </em>922-23; <em>Prosser, Torts (2d ed. </em>1955), \u00a7 31, <em>p. </em>127; 38 <em>Am. Jur., Negligence, </em>\u00a7 203 (1941); 61 <em>C. J. S. Motor Vehicles </em>\u00a7\u00a7 484(b), 486(c). But see <em>McMahon v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>136 <em>Conn. </em>372, 71 <em>A. 2d </em>557 <em>(Sup. Ct. Err. </em>1950). Plaintiffs\u2019 assiduous effort to prove their lack of capacity by reason of intoxication is beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">There remains to consider, however, defendant\u2019s contention that a reasonably prudent and sober person would have extricated himself from the automobile at an appropriate opportunity, and that a duty devolved upon the trial j udge so to rule as a matter of law. While mere convenience would not excuse a plaintiff from availing himself of the opportunity to leave an automobile in the face of known danger, we nevertheless conclude that - this issue, under all the circumstances here shown, was reasonably debatable and for that reason properly one for the trier of the facts. There were circumstances which, taken together, could be found to have qualified the duty to alight. It was 3:30 A. m. (when even the ordinary unintoxicated man probably would be tired and less perceptive of danger) ; there was no other apparent mode of transportation to Linden; and the ride had been in progress for but ten minutes. Moreover, it was for the jury to say that the brief stop when O\u2019Grady entered upon Broad Street afforded a reasonable opportunity to alight. Only in the clearest case of fault, where the contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>hypothesis is not fairly admissible, does the question of contributory negligence become one of law for the court. <em>Taneian v. Meghrigian, </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>267, 283 (1954). And, the reasonably careful man is not to be endowed \u201cwith attributes which properly belong to a person of exceptional perspicuity and foresight.\u201d <em>Seifel v. Sevek, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>593, 597 (1959). Eor a collection of cases on the duty to alight in various circumstances, see Annotations, 154 <em>A. L. R. </em>924 (1945); 15 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1165, 1188 <em>et seq. </em>(1951); 28 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>12, 94, 95 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">It may develop on a retrial of the cause, moreover, that even if plaintiffs are found to have acted unreasonably, recovery would not be barred therefor. It is the settled rule of this and other jurisdictions that contributory negligence is not available as a defense when the defendant has been guilty not merely of negligence but of wanton or willful misconduct. As was said in <em>Camden, G. &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. Preston, </em>59 <em>N. J. L. </em>264, 266-67 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1896) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">\u201cIn all cases where the defendant\u2019s negligence was so gross as to imply a disregard of consequences, or a willingness to inflict the injury, the plaintiff may recover, even though he was a trespasser, or did not use ordinary care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The jury should be instructed that plaintiffs\u2019 contributory negligence, if any, will not bar a recovery if the injuries were caused by the defendant\u2019s reckless disregard for their safety. <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 482; 2 <em>Harper &amp; James, op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 22.6; <em>Prosser, op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 51, <em>pp. </em>289-290. <em>Cf. Iaconio v. D\u2019Angelo, </em>104 <em>N. J. L. </em>506 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Turning to the second point of appeal, we agree with the defendant that the summation of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to the jury far exceeded the bounds of proper comment and argument. Included in the discourse were matters of evidence not in the record. Counsel for the plaintiffs indulged in unjustified aspersions on defense counsel\u2019s motives in not offering the defendant as a witness and accused his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>adversary of playing \u201ca game of checkers * * * to save a few dollars for his client\u2019s pocketbook * * The defense was unwarrantably described as being \u201creplete with misleading red herrings\u201d and as being based on trickery, shameful conduct, and the pulling of \u201cstunts.\u201d At one point the defendant\u2019s attorney was charged with poisoning the minds of the jurors. At another, he was said to be \u201cone of the most able and strategic <em>defense </em>lawyers\u201d in courts throughout the State \u201ctrying these <em>defense </em>cases\u201d \u2014 a remark which may well have conveyed to the jury the idea that the defendant had liability insurance. Near the conclusion of the summation, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel said that if the jurors were to find for the defendant, they would be \u201cgiving a medal to O\u2019Grady with an inference that he has a license to go out and drive again like a maniac.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Objection was taken to the remarks at least six times. After one of the attacks upon his presentation of the case, the defendant\u2019s attorney said: \u201cYour Honor, I can\u2019t sit here and take this. I cannot be charged with poisoning the minds of a jury.\u201d The trial judge sustained the objection, as he did others, and cautioned counsel to stop fighting until the trial was over. Ruling on another objection, the court remarked: \u201cKeep personalities of counsel out of it. I have had enough of it myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The latitude which counsel has in addressing the jury was clearly exceeded by the inflammatory and altogether improper comments cited above and others. <em>Blackman v. West Jersey &amp; Seashore R. Co., </em>68 <em>N. J. L. </em>1 <em>(Sup; Ct. </em>1902); <em>Leffler v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>370 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1938); <em>Kulodzej v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., </em>39 <em>N. J. Super. </em>268, 274 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956); <em>Canons of Professional Ethics, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15, 17, 22; Annotation, 29 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>996.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Plaintiffs argue that any impropriety in the summation was not prejudicial because the defendant was indisputably negligent and the damages awarded were not excessive. As indicated above, however, there was a close factual issue to be resolved in regard to contributory negligence, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>jury may have' been inflamed to the point that they were unable to render an impartial assessment of plaintiffs\u2019 conduct. The remarks of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel were naturally calculated to influence the jury; and where, as here, it is impossible to foretell the outcome of the case on liability, no extraneous evidence is needed to establish that the prejudicial statements actually did influence the jury. <em>Haid v. </em>Loderstedt, 45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>547, 551 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957); <em>Purpura v. Public Service Elec. &amp; Gas </em>Co., 53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>475, 482 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The judgment is reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
