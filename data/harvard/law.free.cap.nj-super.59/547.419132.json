Eor the facts and other background data we refer to the opinion of the trial court, wherein they are fully set forth. <em>Indemnity Ins. Co. of North America v. Metropolitan, etc., of N. Y., 53 N. J.

J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>97); that all that was necessary to bring Acerra within the coverage of the Metropolitan policy as an additional insured was to show that the particular <em>purpose of use </em>of the car at the time, <em>i. e., </em>to take the sales promotion party to, and bring it back from the tour of the brewery, was with the permission of the named insured <em>{ibid.). </em>Since there was no disputed question of fact concerning permission by Mrs. Calandriello for the use of the car for that purpose, the trial court held in the affirmative on the issue of coverage of Acerra as a matter of law. That the court felt that the result it reached was required as a matter of law, even if it could be concluded from the proofs that the named insured intended, and was so understood by Smith, her employee, that neither Acerra nor any one else other than Smith was to drive the car, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>patent not only from the testimony quoted above but from the court\u2019s express citation of the Louisiana case <em>[Donovan v. Standard Oil Co. of Louisiana, </em>197 <em>So. </em>320 <em>(La. App. </em>1940)] (at <em>page </em>99) for the view that \u201cthe requirement that the actual use of the automobile be with the permission of the named insured \u2018relates only to the use of the vehicle not to the identity of the person actually driving it.\u2019 \u201d Since the rendition of the decision of the trial court, however, the Supreme Court has handed down its opinion in <em>Costanzo v. Pennsylvania Threshermen, etc., Ins. Co., </em>30 <em>N. J. </em>262 (1959), construing an identical omnibus clause. Our reading of that determination makes it clear to us that it was the view of the court that coverage under such a clause requires not only permission by the named insured for the <em>use of the vehicle </em>at the time of the accident for the purposes for which it was being used when the accident occurred, but also express or implied permission by the named insured for it to be driven <em>by the individual </em>who was driving it at the time. We note the following circumstances in support of this interpretation of the <em>Costanzo </em>case. The court twice adverts to the fact that the owner \u201cneither expressly forbade nor authorized his son to permit others to operate the car\u201d (30 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pages </em>265, 269), the second time in regard to the specific question as to whether the bailee\u2019s permissive use of the car \u201cincluded authority to delegate its operation to [another] and thus make the latter an additional insured.\u201d The opinion states (at <em>page </em>270) : \u201cWe believe that the circumstances under which this car was entrusted to Sturgill, Jr., were such as to make it reasonable to say that the driving of the car by another while Sturgill, Jr., was riding therein was impliedly countenanced by Sturgill, Sr.\u201d By contrast, were the rule expressly embraced by the trial court in the present case the same as that espoused by the Supreme Court in <em>Costanzo </em>it would not have been necessary for the court in that case to go beyond the finding that the use of the car for a social engagement with sailor-associates of the son was for a purpose within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the permission given by the father (named insured) \u2014 thereby automatically extending the coverage of the policy to the driver, regardless of whether the operation of the vehicle by that individual was with the express or implied permission of the father in any other sense. The conclusion of the court lucidly communicates its meaning and intent: \u201cWe conclude that Nicolosi [the driver] was using the automobile with the permission of the named insured and therefore was an additional insured under the omnibus clause of the policy\u201d (at <em>page </em>210). <em>Cf. Baesler v. Globe Indemnity Co., </em>57 <em>N. J. Super. </em>386 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959), certification granted 31 <em>N. J. </em>551 (1960). (Our discussion in that opinion of the facts of the present case as reported in 53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>90, <em>supra, </em>was, of course, without benefit of the transcript of record herein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">We thus conclude that under the rationale of <em>Costanzo </em>it is necessary for a factual determination to be made in the present case as to whether Acerra was driving the car with the express or implied permission of Mrs. Calandriello, a fact not resolved by the trial court, as already noted. This issue is not necessarily to be determined in the negative because of the testimony of Mrs. Calandriello quoted above. There is an open factual question from her testimony whether she was, or reasonably should have been understood by Smith to have been, positively forbidding his permitting the operation of the car on the particular occasion by any one at all other than himself \u2014 even a customer of her business like Acerra, under all the circumstances disclosed by the proofs; and, if that question is answered negatively, whether the circumstances in fact indicated implied permission for Acerra to drive the car at the time. We think it preferable that these issues of fact be decided by a judge hearing the testimony, rather than by this court on the printed record before us. The cause will have to be remanded to permit such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Indemnity also argued before the trial court that Metropolitan was estopped to deny liability because of having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>undertaken the defense of the ease at the first two trials. This question was considered unnecessary of determination by the trial court in view of its decision in favor of Indemnity on the ground aforementioned. This issue likewise can be more effectively dealt with at the trial level, and its determination, if it becomes necessary, is remitted for the retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">We find it unnecessary to discuss the contention briefed by Indemnity (apparently not raised below) that the provisions of the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Law, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39:6 \u2014 61 <em>et seq., </em>require that Metropolitan\u2019s policy be construed to cover decedent, Acerra, and his estate, as we regard it as patently without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial conformably with this opinion, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
