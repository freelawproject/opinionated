J. S. A. </em>34:2-21.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">A petition was filed on behalf of the infant in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division demanding workmen\u2019s compensation benefits and, as appellants say in their brief, \u201cAfter hearing in the Division, \u2018judgments\u2019 were entered in favor of the infant. The Division found that the infant had sustained permanent orthopaedic injuries amounting to 25% of the hand and had also sustained neurological sequelae as a result of the accident equaling 2% of partial total. These judgments are presently being paid as provided for by statute * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The infant and his mother, individually and as guardian <em>ad litem, </em>instituted the above entitled common law action for negligently causing the infant\u2019s injuries. The Superior Court, Law Division, entered summary judgment in favor of defendant upon the authority of <em>Damato v. DeLucia, </em>110 <em>N. J. L. </em>380 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Appellants contend that <em>Damato </em>was incorrectly decided and, in any event, it is no longer the law because of the various amendments of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act which have been adopted since <em>L. </em>1924, c. 159, which was the statute construed in the <em>Damato </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">We find no merit in these contentions. We consider <em>Damato v. DeLucia </em>to be sound, and as pertipent and controlling today as it was when it was decided.
