HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Kenney Quinard Williams (\u2018Williams\u201d) appeals his conviction of possession of burglarious tools, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-94. He argues that (1) the trial court erred in construing the statute to include a plastic bag as a larcenous \u201cimplement,\u201d and (2) the statute is void for vagueness under the United States and Virginia Constitutions. For the reasons that follow, we agree with Williams that a plastic bag is not an \u201cimplement\u201d as contemplated by the statute, thus we reverse his conviction and need not address the constitutional validity of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The facts of this matter are not in dispute. On July 3, 2005, Williams entered a sporting goods store while shopping at a mall in Chesterfield County. Williams remained in the store briefly, then left. Williams returned a short while later, sat down next to a stack of boxes, removed a plastic bag\u2014with a shoe store\u2019s logo\u2014from his pants, placed a boxed pair of shoes into the bag, and left the store without paying for the shoes. When Williams was apprehended in the mall, he admitted to stealing the shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The Commonwealth charged Williams with petit larceny and possession of burglarious tools, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-96 and 18.2-94, respectively. Williams pled guilty to the petit larceny charge and not guilty to the charge of possession of burglarious tools. Prior to trial, Williams filed a motion to dismiss the burglarious tools charge, asserting that the statute was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The trial court denied this motion. Williams stipulated to the facts offered by the Commonwealth during the motion to dismiss, but argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>that the evidence was insufficient to convict because a plastic bag was not an \u201cimplement\u201d as contemplated by the statute. The trial court disagreed and convicted Williams of possession of burglarious tools, ruling that a plastic bag constituted an \u201cimplement\u201d under the statute so long as it was used with intent to commit larceny. Williams now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On appeal, Williams concedes that he had the requisite criminal intent, but argues that a plastic bag is not an \u201cimplement\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-94. On brief, the Commonwealth argues that Williams\u2019 conduct violated Code \u00a7 18.2-94 because he used the shopping bag with the intent to steal the shoes. However, this argument presupposes that the plastic bag satisfies the definition of implement, a term that is not statutorily defined. Thus, our task is to determine whether the General Assembly intended an ordinary bag to constitute an \u201cimplement\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-94. Because this is a question of law involving the construction and application of Code \u00a7 18.2-94, we review the trial court\u2019s determination <em>de novo. See Ainslie v. Inman, </em>265 Va. 347, 352, 577 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Although commonly referred to as \u201cPossession of burglarious tools,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-94 is somewhat broader than its title implies. In pertinent part, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">If any person have in his possession any tools, implements, or outfit, with intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny ... he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony. The possession of such burglarious tools, implements, or outfit ... shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">This statute does not prohibit \u201cthe mere possession of \u2018any tools, implements, or outfit,\u2019 \u201d as \u201c[s]uch articles \u2018may be, and usually are, designed and manufactured for lawful purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 1, 3, 509 S.E.2d 510, 511 (1999) (quoting <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 790, 75 S.E.2d 482, 486 (1953)). Instead, \u201c[t]he gravamen of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>offense arises from the possessor\u2019s \u2018intent to use\u2019 these \u2018common, ordinary\u2019 objects for a criminal purpose specified by statute, burglary, robbery or larceny.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u201cGenerally, the words and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994). \u201c[T]he language of [ ] a penal statute should be given a reasonable or common sense construction, consonant with the objects of the legislation.\u201d Norman J. Singer, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 59:6 (6th ed. 2001). \u201cIndeed, when determining the boundaries of such a statute, \u2018the plain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction____\u2019 \u201d <em>Law v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 154, 158, 571 S.E.2d 893, 895 (2002) (quoting <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">However, \u201c[t]his general rule applies except when the language of the statute is ambiguous or would lead to an absurd result.\u201d <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 449, 455, 634 S.E.2d 310, 313 (2006). In such an instance, \u201c[t]he meaning of doubtful words in a statute may be determined by reference to their association with related words and phrases.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>219 Va. 374, 389, 248 S.E.2d 124, 132 (1978). \u201cThus, when general words and specific words are grouped together, the general words are limited and qualified by the specific words and will be construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects identified by the specific words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 248 S.E.2d at 132-33. Moreover, \u201c[w]e \u2018assume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 255, 261, 590 S.E.2d 563, 566 (2004) (quoting <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Properties, Inc., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The terms \u201ctools,\u201d \u201cimplements,\u201d and \u201coutfit\u201d are not defined statutorily.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Implement has several different noun meanings, some more specific than others. Generally defined, an implement is \u201can article [ ] serving to equip[.]\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1134 (1993). \u201cImplement applies to anything, usu[ally] a contrivance, necessary to effect an end or perform a task[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>More specifically however, according to <em>Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>587 (3d ed. 1969), an implement is \u201c[a] tool, instrument, utensil, or machine for carrying on work, particularly a machine for agricultural work. A thing necessary to a trade and without which the work cannot be performed.\u201d Similarly, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dic</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>tionary </em>754 (6th ed. 1990) defines implements as \u201cthings as are used or employed for a trade, or furniture of a house. Particularly applied to tools, utensils, instruments of labor; as the implements of trade or of farming.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The generally accepted definitions of \u201ctool\u201d are (1) an instrument (as a hammer or saw) used or worked by hand, and (2) an implement or object used in performing an operation or carrying on work of any kind. <em>See Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 2408; <em>see also Moss, </em>29 Va.App. at 4-5, 509 S.E.2d at 511-12 (finding that keys were \u201csomething [ ] used in performing an operation or necessary in the practice of a vocation or profession\u201d). Similarly, the commonly accepted noun definitions for the word \u201coutfit\u201d are (1) the materials, tools, or implements comprising the equipment necessary for carrying out a particular project, and (2) wearing apparel designed to be worn on a special occasion or in a particular situation. <em>See Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 1601; <em>see also Mercer v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 380, 385, 512 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1999) (holding that \u201cwearing apparel designed to be worn in a particular situation\u201d constituted an \u201coutfit\u201d as envisioned by Code \u00a7 18.2-94).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Clearly, the terms \u201ctool,\u201d \u201cimplement\u201d and \u201coutfit\u201d have somewhat different but overlapping meanings. The Commonwealth urges this Court to construe \u201cimplement\u201d broadly, implicitly arguing that almost any item used with the requisite intent, but not qualifying as a \u201ctool\u201d or \u201coutfit,\u201d constitutes an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>\u201cimplement\u201d for the purposes of the statute. Assuming that the Commonwealth is correct in asserting that, in the abstract, the term \u201cimplement\u201d is more general than the terms \u201ctool\u201d and \u201coutfit,\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s argument ignores the principle of statutory construction stated above. That is, when general words and specific words are used together, the general words are limited and qualified by the specific words. <em>See United Airlines, </em>219 Va. at 389, 248 S.E.2d at 132-33. Moreover, as our Supreme Court reiterated recently, \u201c[t]he use of such expansive definitions of a word in a penal statute is contrary to our well-established principle that when a statute \u2018is penal in nature, it must be strictly construed against the state and limited in application to cases falling clearly within the language of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 45, 52, 645 S.E.2d 470, 473-74 (2007) (quoting <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983)). Thus, we are obligated by principles of statutory construction to limit the meaning of \u201cimplement\u201d according to the more specific words contained in the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In fact, we note that when the word \u201cimplement\u201d appears in the Virginia Code, it frequently appears in conjunction with specific words denoting equipment or machinery related to an occupation or profession. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-325(3)(b) (defining \u201cgambling device\u201d as \u201c[a]ny machine, apparatus, <em>implement, </em>instrument, contrivance, board or other thing\u201d); 34-26(7) (exempting \u201c[tjools, books, instruments, <em>implements, </em>equipment, and machines ... necessary for use in the course of the householder\u2019s occupation or trade\u201d from creditor process); 59.1-352.1 (defining \u201cdealer\u201d as \u201ca person engaged in the business of selling ... farm, construction, utility or indus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>trial equipment, <em>implements, </em>machinery, attachments, outdoor power equipment, or repair parts\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Moreover, and in contrast to the statute at issue here, Code \u00a7 18.2-325(3)(b) includes the phrase \u201cother thingts]\u201d in its definition of \u201cgambling device.\u201d Clearly this is a \u201ccatch-all\u201d phrase, designed to include items that cannot be categorized under the more specific terms, such as \u201cimplement,\u201d that are contained within the statute. Code \u00a7 18.2-94 contains no such phrase, and we decline to hold that the term \u201cimplement\u201d is such a phrase for the purpose of the statute. In fact, we hold to the contrary. Because the General Assembly failed to include such a general term, and because we assume that the General Assembly chose its words with care, <em>Alger, </em>267 Va. at 261, 590 S.E.2d at 566, we hold that the definition of implement must be defined more narrowly than the Commonwealth argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that in context, the legislature intended the term \u201cimplement\u201d to refer specifically to items associated with devices, instruments, equipment or machinery as they relate to an occupation or profession, but which are used to facilitate the commission of a burglary, robbery or larceny. <em>See United Airlines, </em>219 Va. at 389, 248 S.E.2d at 132-33. So construed, we conclude that \u201cimplement\u201d means a device, apparatus, instrument or equipment used in a trade, vocation or profession, or an \u201cobject used in performing an operation or carrying on work of any kind[, such as] an instrument or apparatus necessary ... in the practice of [a] vocation or profession[.]\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 2408. Based on this definition, we hold that an ordinary plastic bag, such as the one at issue here, is not an \u201cimplement\u201d as proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-94 because it serves no particular purpose in furtherance of a trade, occupation, profession or work.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Furthermore, a construction of the term \u201cimplement\u201d along the lines suggested by the Commonwealth would lead to \u201cabsurd results.\u201d <em>See Washington, </em>272 Va. at 455, 634 S.E.2d at 313. For example, one obvious result of accepting the Commonwealth\u2019s argument would be that every concealment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>of merchandise in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-103, regardless of the item\u2019s value, would also constitute a Class 5 felony under Code \u00a7 18.2-94 because any and every item used to accomplish the element of concealment from public view, such as a purse, coat or a pocket, would also constitute a \u201clarcenous implement.\u201d Had the General Assembly intended such a result, they would have punished the crime of concealment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Our holding today is not inconsistent with prior opinions of either this Court or of our Supreme Court which hold that inherently innocent items can be \u201ctools, implements, or outfits\u201d used for burglarious or larcenous purposes under Code \u00a7 18.2-94. <em>See Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 528, 290 S.E.2d 865 (1982); <em>Moss, </em>29 Va.App. 1, 509 S.E.2d 510. Specifically, in <em>Carter, </em>the defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and did not contest whether the screwdriver, an innocent item, qualified as a tool or implement under the statute. Although this holding presumed that the screwdriver was one of the items prohibited by the statute and did not address the question in its analysis, as noted above, a screwdriver is obviously not inconsistent with the accepted definitions of the term \u201ctool.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In <em>Moss, </em>this Court found that vending machine keys were necessary to a vocation, and thus, qualified as a tool under the statute. <em>Moss, </em>29 Va.App. at 5, 509 S.E.2d at 512. And in <em>Mercer, </em>29 Va.App. at 385, 512 S.E.2d at 175, we held that \u201c[a]n item of clothing ... altered to facilitate shoplifting can [ ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>be considered wearing apparel <em>designed to be worn in a particular situation[,Y </em>and thus constituted an \u201coutfit\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-94. (Emphasis added). Our holding today reiterates what we implicitly held in Moss and <em>Mercer. </em>That is, as long as the inherently innocent item meets the general definition of the word, if coupled with the requisite intent it can become a larcenous \u201cimplement,\u201d \u201coutfit,\u201d or \u201ctool\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-94. However, in the present case, we hold that a plastic bag such as the one used by the appellant does not meet the general definition of \u201cimplement,\u201d and thus, even if used with the requisite intent, as is the case here, cannot become a larcenous \u201cimplement\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Our holding is also consistent with the statutory history of Code \u00a7 18.2-94. When first adopted in 1878, the statute then proscribing the possession of burglarious tools referred to \u201ctools, implements, or [] outfit[s] <em>known, as burglars\u2019 tools, implements, or outfitfs] ....\u201d Burnette, </em>194 Va. at 787-88, 75 S.E.2d at 484 (quoting 1877-78 Va. Acts, p. 288) (emphasis in original). In 1919, the General Assembly revised the statute and omitted the italicized words, but the revisers\u2019 note expressly stated that \u201c \u2018no material change ha[d] been intended.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788, 75 S.E.2d at 484 (quoting Code \u00a7 4437 (1919)). Thus, the statute\u2019s legislative history indicates that the General Assembly, by referring to \u201ctools, implements, or [ ] outfit[s] <em>known as burglar\u2019s tools, implements, or outfit[s],\u201d </em>intended to proscribe the possession of items commonly <em>associated </em>with the commission of burglary, robbery, or larceny, not merely items that could <em>possibly </em>be used for these purposes. We conclude that an ordinary plastic bag is not an item commonly associated with larceny, and as such, find further support for our holding that a plastic bag is not an \u201cimplement\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">For the reasons stated, we hold that a plastic bag is not an \u201cimplement\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-94. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court and vacate Williams\u2019 conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Because we reverse on this basis, we need not reach Williams\u2019 constitutional challenge to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-6\">. In disagreeing with this analysis, the concurrence gives primacy to the second sentence of the statute and reasons that Code \u00a7 18.2-94 applies only to <em>burglarious </em>tools, implements or outfits, namely, items used for forced entry into buildings or other structures and would hold that possession of \"tools, implements or outfits\u201d used to commit a larceny or robbery are not punishable under the statute unless they are also of utility in committing a burglary. However, we do not read <em>Burnette </em>to support such a construction. Moreover, in <em>Moss, </em>we specifically noted that although \"Violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-94 are sometimes referenced generally as 'possession of burglary tools[,]\u2019 ... the statute criminalizes possession of \u2018tools, implements, or outfit[s]\u2018 with the intent to commit any one of three offenses, burglary, robbery or larceny.\u201d <em>Moss, 29 </em>Va.App. at 3 n. 1, 509 S.E.2d at 511 n. 1. Furthermore, in <em>Mercer v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 380, 385, 512 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1999), we held that a pair of pants altered to facilitate shoplifting constituted an \"outfit\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-94. In doing so, we acknowledged that \u201c[a] pair of pants is not necessarily \u2018burglarious,\u2019 that is, it is not an item commonly used to break into a structure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that the appellant could still be convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-94, if the Commonwealth proved that \"appellant possessed these pants with the intent to use them to commit larceny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The concurrence \"disagrees\u201d with our holdings in <em>Moss </em>and <em>Mercer </em>and would have us ignore them. This we may not do even if we agreed with the analysis of our colleague, as we are bound by prior panel precedent under the interpanel accord component of the <em>stare decisis </em>doctrine. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 425, 430, 478 S.E.2d 539, 541 (1996) (\"[W]e hold that a decision of a panel of the Court of Appeals becomes a predicate for application of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>until overruled by a decision of the Court of Appeals sitting <em>en banc </em>or by a decision of this Court.\u201d). \"This principle applies not merely to the literal holding of the case, but also to its <em>ratio </em>decidendi\u2014the essential rationale in the case that determines the judgment.\u201d <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 73-74, 577 S.E.2d 538, 540 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\"><em>. </em>Although they are not defined statutorily, in context the terms are used as nouns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\">. In <em>Moss, </em>the defendant argued that he could not be convicted for possession of burglarious tools because keys were not \"tools\u201d or \"implements\" as contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-94. 29 Va.App. 1, 509 S.E.2d 510. This Court determined that the keys satisfied the definition of tool that was provided by the defendant. Specifically, this Court found that the keys were \u201c \u2018something [] used in performing an operation or necessary in the practice of a vocation or profession.' \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, 509 S.E.2d at 511 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>1243 (1985)). Although we declined to address whether the keys constituted an implement, this Court took note of the defendant\u2019s proffered definition of implement as \"things as are used or employed for a trade, or furniture of a house. Particularly applied to tools, utensils, instruments of labor; as the implements of trade or of farming.\" <em>Id. </em>at 4, 509 S.E.2d at 511-12 (citing <em>Black's Law Dictionary </em>754 (deluxe 6th ed. 1990)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">.

We noted that all of the tools were of the type that can be used in the \"construction trade\u201d as \u201cprying implements or tools that could be used to forcibly open vending machines or other structures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161, 543 S.E.2d at 618. On appeal, we found that the combination of tools was \"innately burglarious,\u201d giving rise to the rebuttable presumption not in issue here, that the defendant possessed the tools with the intent to use them to commit a burglary, robbery, or larceny. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b392-6\">McCLANAHAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZC\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">I concur with the result but cannot join in the majority\u2019s analysis. I believe the legislative history of Code \u00a7 18.2-94<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 75 S.E.2d 482 (1953), mandate a more narrow holding in this case. This history and the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of Code \u00a7 18.2-94\u2019s predecessor clearly limit the proscription of this statute to the unlawful possession of <em>burglarious </em>tools, implements or outfit. Thus, I do not agree that the statute can be read to include \u201clarcenous implements,\u201d i.e., non-burglarious implements, as the majority holds.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">When the predecessor to Code \u00a7 18.2-94 was first adopted in 1878, the last two sentences of the statute provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">\u201cIf any person have in his possession any tools, implements, or other outfit known as burglars\u2019 tools, implements, or outfit, with intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny, he shall be deemed guilty of a felony [and imprisoned not less than 5 years nor more than 18 years]. The possession of such burglarious tools, implements or outfit, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-10\"><em>Burnette, </em>194 Va. at 787-88, 75 S.E.2d at 484 (quoting Va. Acts 1877-78, p. 288) (emphasis omitted). The statute also included the punishment for common law burglary and the definition of the same. <em>Id. </em>The statute was subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>incorporated in the Code of 1887 without change. <em>Id. </em>at 788, 75 S.E.2d at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">In 1919, the statute was revised by transposing the sentences setting forth the punishment for and definition of common law burglary, and omitting the phrase, \u201cknown as burglars\u2019 tools, implements, or outfit,\u201d in the next to the last sentence of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 788, 75 S.E.2d at 484. The Code revisors\u2019 note explained, however, that \u201c \u2018no material change\u2019 \u201d to the statute [had] been intended by those revisions. <em>Id. </em>(quoting 1919 Code Revisors\u2019 Note to Code \u00a7 4437). The Supreme Court also reasoned in <em>Burnette </em>that no change had been effected by the deletion of that phrase \u201csince the word \u2018burglarious\u2019 used in the last sentence adequately expressed the idea.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>With those revisions, the General Assembly has not changed the last two sentences of the statute since 1919, except for making the crime a Class 5 felony, and codifying it separately from common law burglary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Based on this statutory history, and the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the statute in <em>Burnette, </em>I conclude, and would therefore hold, that the elements of the statutory crime proscribed in Code \u00a7 18.2-94 consist of the following: (1) possession of burglarious tools, implement or outfit, and (2) an intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny therewith. <em>See Burnette, </em>194 Va. at 792, 75 S.E.2d at 487 (reciting elements of crime where defendant charged with possession of burglarious tools); <em>see also </em>1-12 Virginia Model Jury Instructions-Criminal Instruction No. P12.400 (This instruction for a crime charged under Code \u00a7 18.2-94 begins: \u201cThe defendant is charged with the crime of possession of burglarious [tools; implements; outfit] with intent to commit [burglary; robbery; larceny].\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In this case, the record makes clear appellant possessed a plastic shopping bag he intended to use in the commission of a crime. There is simply no evidence, however, that appellant possessed the bag as a <em>burglarious </em>tool, implement or outfit, when he entered the sporting goods store, located in a shopping mall and open to the general public, and therein committed petit larceny by stealing a pair of shoes, which he concealed in the plastic bag.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This is not to say, however, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>plastic bag could never be a burglarious tool, implement or outfit. Therefore, I disagree with the majority\u2019s overly broad holding that \u201ca plastic bag is not an \u2018implement\u2019 as contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-94.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">I concur in reversing appellant\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-94, but on the more narrow basis that the facts in this case do not support a finding that the plastic bag in appellant\u2019s possession was a burglarious tool, implement or outfit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b392-11\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-94 provides in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">If any person have in his possession any tools, implements or outfit, with intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny, upon conviction thereof he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony. The possession of such burglarious tools, implements or outfit by any person other than a licensed dealer, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b393-5\">. <em>Burnette </em>involved a constitutional challenge to the statute. The defendant argued that because the word \u201csuch\u201d in the last sentence referred to the tools, implements or outfit in the preceding sentence, the statute was overbroad in that it made the \"mere possession of common, ordinary tools of a trade or calling, by one other than a licensed dealer, <em>prima facie </em>evidence of intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Burnette, </em>194 Va. at 787, 75 S.E.2d at 484. Rejecting this argument, the Supreme Court explained that the presumption only applied when \"the tools found in the possession of persons charged with violating the statute are <em>in fact </em>such tools as are <em>commonly used in breaking and entering.\" Id. </em>at 788, 75 S.E.2d at 484 (emphasis added). In other words, the presumption attaches \"only to such offending articles <em>innately burglarious </em>in character.\u201d <em>Hagy v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 152, 158, 543 S.E.2d 614, 616 (200l) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). In all other cases, when those are not the facts, the presumption cannot be invoked by the Commonwealth in proving intent to use the burglarious item(s) to commit the crime. <em>Burnette, </em>194 Va. at 790, 75 S.E.2d at 485-86. <em>Compare id. </em>at 791-92, 75 S.E.2d at 486-87 (presumption supporting conviction where defendant was in possession of combination of tools commonly used in commission of burglaries); <em>Nance v. Commonwealth, </em>203 Va. 428, 430-31, 124 S.E.2d 900, 902-03 (1962) (same); and <em>Hagy, </em>35 Va.App. at 156-58, 543 S.E.2d at 616-17 (same); <em>with Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 528, 532, 290 S.E.2d 865, 867 (1982) (screwdriver that \"could be used in a break-in\u201d was only tool in defendant\u2019s possession, and conviction was without benefit of presumption).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\">. In the Code of 1950, the statute as it appeared in 1919 was codified at Code \u00a7 18-159. Then in 1960, the statute was amended and recodified, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>with common law burglary set forth under Code \u00a7 18.1-86 (now Code \u00a7 18.2-89), and the \"Possession of burglarious tools, etc.\u201d provisions set forth under Code \u00a7 18.1-87 (now Code \u00a7 18.2-94).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\">. Accordingly, I must also disagree with those parts of both <em>Mercer v. Commonwealth, 29 </em>Va.App. 380, 512 S.E.2d 173 (1999), and <em>Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 1, 509 S.E.2d 510 (1999), cited by the majority, in which two panels of this Court have construed Code \u00a7 18.2-94 as applicable to the possession of non-burglarious tools, implements or outfits. As with the majority, I disagree with their reading of the relevant statutory history and <em>Burnette, </em>which is controlling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\">. I also note that Code \u00a7 18.2-94, entitled \"Possession of burglarious tools, etc.,\u201d is codified under Chapter 5, Article 2 (Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-89 through 18.2-94) of Title 18.2 addressing \"Burglary and Related Offenses,\u201d whereas the general larceny statutes are set forth in Chapter 5, Article 3 (\"Larceny and Receiving Stolen Goods\u201d). <em>See Hawkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 261, 269, 497 S.E.2d 839, 842 (1998) (\"A title may be read in an attempt to ascertain an act\u2019s purpose, though it is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>part of the act itself.\u201d (citing <em>Miller v.
