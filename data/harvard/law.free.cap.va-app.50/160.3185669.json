ELDER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Allen Lewis appeals from a decision terminating his parental rights to his daughter, V.L. On appeal, he contends the circuit court improperly exercised jurisdiction over the matter following entry of a nonsuit at the request of the Culpeper County Department of Social Services (DSS). He argues that DSS was instead required to refile in the juvenile and domestic relations district court. He also contends that DSS failed to file a foster care service plan documenting that termination of his parental rights was in V.L.\u2019s best interests. We conclude the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the petition filed after DSS\u2019s nonsuit. Thus, we vacate the order terminating Lewis\u2019s parental rights to V.L. and dismiss the petition. Because we dismiss, we do not consider Lewis\u2019s claim that the foster care plan DSS filed failed to document that terminating Lewis\u2019s parental rights was in V.L.\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">BACKGROUND <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">V.L. was born on January 24, 2005, at a time when her older brother, A.L., was already in the custody of DSS and living in a foster home. V.L.\u2019s mother, Sally Butler, had left a court-ordered substance abuse program approximately two months prior to giving birth to V.L. and voluntarily relinquished custody of V.L. to DSS two days after V.L.\u2019s birth. The foster care plan prepared by a DSS case worker on January 28, 2005, indicated Ms. Butler signed a permanent entrustment agreement with DSS and \u201cwishe[d] to see [V.L.] placed and adopted by the same foster family that is caring for [A.L.],\u201d Ms. Butler\u2019s older child. The plan noted that at the time Butler entrusted V.L. to DSS, \u201cservices were available\u201d to Butler but \u201cshe chose not to receive them by leaving her treatment program.\u201d It also noted that when V.L. was born, Butler tested positive for cocaine and admitted to hospital personnel that she used cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, and alcohol while pregnant with V.L. As to Lewis, the plan indicated only that \u201c[f]ather was incarcerated[;] therefore he did not take part in the planning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">On July 1, 2005, DSS filed in the juvenile and domestic relations district court (J &amp; DR court) a petition for the involuntary termination of Lewis\u2019s parental rights to V.L. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>August 23, 2005, the J &amp; DR court granted DSS\u2019s petition terminating Lewis\u2019s parental rights, and Lewis appealed. At a hearing in the circuit court on January 3, 2006, on appeal of case number \u201cJ &amp; DR 2005-C-174,\u201d DSS moved to nonsuit the termination petition. The trial court granted the request and entered an order to that effect on February 10, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">On February 9, 2006, DSS filed a new petition for involuntary termination of Lewis\u2019s parental rights, indicating Lewis was an inmate at Haynesville Correctional Center and had \u201ca projected release date\u201d of June 15, 2007. DSS filed that petition in the circuit court rather than the J &amp; DR court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Lewis, through his guardian <em>ad litem, </em>moved to dismiss the termination petition filed in circuit court, alleging that pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-241, the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court was the only court with jurisdiction over the termination petition following DSS\u2019s nonsuit. He argued that although Code \u00a7 16.1-244 provides the J &amp; DR court and the circuit court with concurrent jurisdiction in certain matters, it did not cover termination proceedings and that, pursuant to the nonsuit statute and Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(5), the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court was the only court with original jurisdiction over a termination petition, even following a nonsuit in the circuit court. The circuit court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Lewis also objected to the termination proceedings on the ground that no foster care plan had been filed that \u201cdocumentad] termination of [Lewis\u2019s] parental rights as being in the best interests of the child.\u201d He argued the foster care plan of January 28, 2005, was \u201can appropriate foster care plan for [Sally Butler, V.L.\u2019s mother],\u201d but was \u201cnot an appropriate foster care plan that deals with [Lewis\u2019s] rights.\u201d The court treated the objection as a motion to strike DSS\u2019s evidence and denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The trial court ultimately ruled that clear and convincing evidence supported termination based on both (1) what it found to be Lewis\u2019s failure, without good cause, to remedy substantially the conditions that led to or required V.L.\u2019s foster care placement notwithstanding appropriate efforts, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>(2) the prior termination of Lewis\u2019s residual parental rights to another of his children, V.L.\u2019s older brother, A.L.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court also noted the uncertainty that Lewis would be able to assume care for V.L. even upon his release from incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">ANALYSIS: JURISDICTION FOLLOWING NONSUIT</p>\n<p id=\"Atl\">Code \u00a7 8.01-380 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A73\">After a nonsuit no new proceeding on the same cause of action or against the same party shall be had in any court other than that in which the nonsuit was taken, unless that court is without jurisdiction, or not a proper venue, or other good cause is shown for proceeding in another court, or when such new proceeding is instituted in a federal court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atd\">Lewis contends that the circuit court lacked authority to act on DSS\u2019s termination petition filed February 9, 2006, because, under the language of Code \u00a7 8.01-380, \u201cthat court [was] without jurisdiction.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-241 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">Except as hereinafter provided, each [J &amp; DR] court shall have, within the limits of the territory for which it is created, exclusive original jurisdiction ... over all cases, matters and proceedings involving:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">A. The custody, visitation, support, control or disposition of a child:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">\u00ed\u00a1\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">5. Where the termination of residual parental rights and responsibilities is sought. In such cases jurisdiction shall be concurrent with and not exclusive of courts having equity jurisdiction [e.g., circuit courts], as provided in \u00a7 16.1-244.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Code \u00a7 16.1-244 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[njothing contained in this law shall deprive any other court of the concurrent jurisdiction ... to determine the custody, guardianship, visitation or support of children when custody, guardianship, visitation or support is incidental to the determination of causes pending in such courts.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-244(A). In a suit for divorce, for example, an issue of \u201ccustody, guardianship, visitation or support of children\u201d might qualify as incidental. <em>See id. </em>(setting out impact of circuit court\u2019s exercise of this \u201cincidental\u201d jurisdiction in divorce suit on juvenile court\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Interpreting the interplay between Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241 and - 244 in <em>Willis v. Gamez, </em>20 Va.App. 75, 455 S.E.2d 274 (1995), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">[Ajlthough concurrent jurisdiction to terminate parental rights might exist in some cases, the record does not establish the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction in this case. Even if we assume that a termination of residual parental rights involves the \u201ccustody, guardianship, visitation or support of children,\u201d the record in this case does not establish that a cause was pending in the circuit court to which the father\u2019s petition would be \u201cincidental\u201d to a determination of that cause [sic].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 80, 455 S.E.2d at 277; <em>see Church v. Church, </em>24 Va.App. 502, 505-08 &amp; n. 2, 483 S.E.2d 498, 499-501 &amp; n. 2 (1997) (reversing trial court\u2019s conclusion that Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241(A)(5) and 16.1-244 gave court granting divorce jurisdiction to terminate parental rights in same proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Similarly, nothing in the record in DSS\u2019s case against Lewis concerning V.L. indicates that any cause was pending in the circuit court to which the termination of Lewis\u2019s parental rights to V.L. might be \u201cincidental.\u201d The only proceeding ever pending in the circuit court was the termination petition itself. Thus, the circuit court had no jurisdiction to entertain DSS\u2019s new termination petition unless some sort of \u201cresidual\u201d circuit court jurisdiction survived the granting of the nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>DSS contends that when Lewis noted his appeal of the J &amp; DR court\u2019s ruling on the first termination petition, the circuit court\u2019s acquisition of jurisdiction to try the matter <em>de novo </em>constituted the acquisition of original jurisdiction and that the ability to exercise this original jurisdiction survived DSS\u2019s taking of the nonsuit. It cites <em>Thomas Gemmell, Inc. v. Svea Fire &amp; Life Insurance Co., </em>166 Va. 95, 184 S.E. 457 (1936), for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">We disagree that <em>Gemmell </em>supports such an argument. <em>Gemmell </em>involved a nonsuit taken following a <em>de novo </em>appeal. The Court noted that a nonsuit \u201cis unsuited to pure appellate procedure\u201d but explained that a nonsuit might nevertheless be taken in a <em>de novo </em>appeal because \u201c[a] court which hears a case <em>de novo ... </em>acts not as a court of appeals but as one exercising original jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97-98, 184 S.E. at 458. The Supreme Court did not hold that a court hearing an appeal <em>de novo </em>may exercise original jurisdiction following a nonsuit even though it lacked original jurisdiction in the first instance. We are aware of no case or statute that would support such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Under settled principles,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cAn appeal which brings up the entire cause for trial <em>de novo </em>in the appellate court operates to annul the [district court\u2019s] judgment, in the absence of a statute providing otherwise.\u201d 2 R.C.L., p. 118.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201cWhere the effect of an appeal is to transfer the entire record to the appellate court for a retrial as though originally brought therein, the judgment appealed from is completely annulled, and is not thereafter available <em>for any </em>purpose.\u201d 16 R.C.L., p. 406.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 99, 184 S.E. at 458 (emphasis added). Similarly, the taking of a nonsuit as to a cause of action not only \u201ccarries down [the] previous rulings and orders in the case\u201d but also \u201cleaves the situation <em>as if the suit had never been filed.\u201d </em>6A Michie\u2019s Jurisprudence, <em>Dismissal, Discontinuance and Non-suit </em>\u00a7 30, at 216 (2001) (emphasis added); <em>see also Dalloul v. Agbey, </em>255 Va. 511, 515, 499 S.E.2d 279, 282 (1998) (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>entry of nonsuit order rendered \u201ccase ... concluded as to all claims and parties\u201d). And as the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Gemmell, </em>\u201c \u2018[t]he right of the plaintiff to take a nonsuit or a dismissal of his suit extends to the appellate court on appeal from a decision of a magistrate and trial <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d </em>166 Va. at 99, 184 S.E. at 458 (quoting 6 <em>Encyclopedia of Pleading and Practice, </em>p. 867). Thus, absent some controlling authority to the contrary, where a plaintiff who prevailed in the district court takes a nonsuit in the defendant\u2019s <em>de novo </em>appeal in circuit court, the combined effect of the principles applicable to nonsuits and <em>de novo </em>appeals is to nullify the entire suit as if it had never existed in either court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Here, DSS has cited no statute or case decision, and we have found none, that we interpret as either preventing Lewis\u2019s <em>de novo </em>appeal from annulling the J &amp; DR court\u2019s ruling or reviving that ruling when the circuit court granted DSS\u2019s request for a nonsuit. Further, the nonsuit statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-380, expressly provides that a new proceeding following a nonsuit may not be filed in the court in which the nonsuit was taken if \u201cthat court is without jurisdiction.\u201d As the Virginia Supreme Court has recognized, \u201cthe purpose of the limitation contained in Code \u00a7 8.01-380(A) [is] to prevent a plaintiff from \u2018forum-shopping.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore v. Gillis, 239 </em>Va. 239, 241, 389 S.E.2d 453, 454 (1990). The statute contains no indication of legislative intent to override other statutory provisions delineating the subject matter jurisdiction of various courts. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-380(A) (\u201cAfter a nonsuit no new proceeding on the same cause of action or against the same party shall be had in any court other than that in which the nonsuit was taken, <em>unless that court is without jurisdiction </em>____\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>cf. Conner v. Rose, </em>252 Va. 57, 58, 471 S.E.2d 478, 478-79 (1996) (holding that where plaintiff took nonsuit in general district court in action seeking damages of $4,000 and refiled in circuit court against same defendant on same cause of action but sought damages of $11,000, an amount in excess of district court\u2019s jurisdictional limit, circuit court was proper forum for second action).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>On these facts, the circuit court had jurisdiction only over the <em>de novo </em>appeal of a termination ruling made in J &amp; DR court. Following Lewis\u2019s appeal and DSS\u2019s nonsuit, the J &amp; DR court\u2019s underlying termination ruling ceased to exist and did not provide a basis for the circuit court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the termination petition filed therein on February 9, 2006. Thus, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to issue the order terminating Lewis\u2019s parental rights to V.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">For these reasons, we hold the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the petition filed after DSS\u2019s nonsuit and erred in terminating Lewis\u2019s parental rights. We vacate the order terminating Lewis\u2019s parental rights to V.L. and dismiss the petition. Because we dismiss, we do not consider Lewis\u2019s claim that the foster care plan DSS filed failed to document that terminating Lewis\u2019s parental rights was in V.L.\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\">. Both DSS and the child's guardian <em>ad litem </em>contend this Court should not consider the appeal because Lewis failed to include all relevant material in the appendix, particularly the foster care service plan and the transcript of the trial court\u2019s ruling from the bench. However, because the relevant evidence and transcript are part of the record on appeal, we consider Lewis's questions presented. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:25(c), (h) (providing that the \"appendix shall include\u201d specified items and that \"[i]t will be assumed that the appendix contains everything germane to the question presented\u201d but that \"[t]he Court of Appeals <em>may ... </em>consider other parts of the record\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also Patterson v.
