PETTY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">A jury convicted Jeffrey Hairston of five counts of indecent liberties with a person with whom he had a custodial relationship in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1, and five counts of carnal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>knowledge, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-63. Hairston challenges his convictions, arguing that the trial court erred when it quashed his subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>seeking the victim\u2019s counseling records from Dr. Sue Bendewald and her employer, Whole Counsel Associates. For the reasons stated below, we disagree with Hairston, and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below, and grant to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from the evidence. <em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 915, 434 S.E.2d 675, 676-77 (1993). So viewed, the record shows that Hairston issued a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>seeking the victim\u2019s counseling records from Dr. Bendewald. Specifically, Hairston requested \u201ccopies of all notes, including but not limited to progress notes; copies of all therapy reports, copies of all evaluations and diagnosis; records of all statements made by [the victim].\u201d The subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>was supported by an affidavit, and Hairston properly noticed the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney. The Commonwealth moved the trial court to quash the subpoena <em>duces tecum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">At a hearing addressing the motion to quash, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney explained that Dr. Bendewald had called him about the subpoena because \u201cshe was concerned that the subpoena did not comply with the HIPAA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requirements of giving notice to the victim and [giving the victim] an opportunity to move to quash\u201d the subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>The Commonwealth also argued that the subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>was a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d and was improper under our decision in <em>Farish v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 627, 346 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>736 (1986). The trial court quashed the subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>Following a jury trial, Hairston was convicted and sentenced to a total of forty years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We hold that the trial court correctly quashed the subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>because it did not comply with Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03, which governs the privacy of health records in Virginia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We analyze the trial court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute <em>de novo. Ainslie v. Inman, </em>265 Va. 347, 352, 577 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\n<em>A. Application of Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">In coming to this conclusion, we must initially determine whether Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03 pertains to the subpoena at issue before us. The statute recognizes a patient\u2019s right of privacy in the content of his or her medical records. Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03. Subsection A of the statute states, \u201cexcept when permitted or required by this section or by other provisions of state law, no health care entity, or other person working in a health care setting, may disclose the records of a patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Subsection B of Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03 defines \u201chealth care entity\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>a \u201chealth care provider.\u201d In turn, \u201chealth care provider\u201d is defined as one of \u201cthose entities listed in the definition of \u2018health care provider\u2019 in \u00a7 8.01-581.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The term \u201chealth care provider\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1 includes clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, and professional counselors.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Subsection D carefully delineates under what circumstances a health care entity may release health records, including, as pertinent to this case, \u201c[i]n compliance with a subpoena issued in accord with subsection H.\u201d Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03(D). Subsection H applies very broadly, stating that <em>\u201cno </em>party ... to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>criminal ... action or proceeding shall request the issuance of a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>for another party\u2019s health records [or those of a nonparty witness] ...\u201d unless that party complies with the requirements of Subsection H. Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03(H) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We conclude that Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03 applies in this case. Dr. Bendewald was employed by a counseling center, and the type of records sought from her related to her counseling sessions with the victim, a nonparty witness in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03(B) (defining \u201chealth record\u201d as \u201cthe substance of any communication made by an individual to \u00e1 health care entity in confidence during or in connection with the provision of health services ...\u201d and \u201cpsychotherapy notes\u201d as \u201ccomments, recorded in any medium by a health care provider who is a mental health professional, documenting or analyzing the contents of conversation during [counseling]\u201d). Thus, Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03 applies to the subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>B. Hairston\u2019s Subpoena Duces Tecum</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">Next, we address whether Hairston met the statutory requirements for a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>seeking medical or counseling records. Our review of the record indicates that, instead of complying with the specific requirements of Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03, Hairston only complied with the general requirements of Rule 3A:12(b): it was supported by an affidavit and it properly noticed the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, when seeking medical or counseling records, counsel must comply with the applicable, specific privacy provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03, as well as the general requirements of Rule 3A:12(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">This Court has never explicitly addressed whether subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>must comply with Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03; however, the plain language of the statute requires that they do so. When interpreting a statute, we must \u201capply the plain language of a statute unless the terms are ambiguous, or applying the plain language would lead to an absurd result.\u201d <em>Boynton v. Kilgore, </em>271 Va. 220, 227, 623 S.E.2d 922, 925-26 (2006) (citations omitted). We are also responsible to \u201c \u2018ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature\u2019 \u201d which is \u201cusually self-evident from the words used in the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227, 623 S.E.2d at 925-26 (quoting <em>Chase v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>266 Va. 544, 547, 587 S.E.2d 521, 522 (2003)). This statute is not ambiguous, and the application of its provisions will not lead to an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">On the contrary, Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03(H) clearly sets out specific conditions for the issuance of such a subpoena, including: (1) providing a copy of the subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to a nonparty witness; (2) providing a nonparty witness with a \u201cNotice to Patient,\u201d informing the witness of his or her right to file a motion to quash with the clerk of court; and (3) providing the health care entity a \u201cNotice to Providers,\u201d advising the entity that if it receives notice of a motion to quash or if it moves to quash, it must provide the records to the clerk of court in a sealed envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The General Assembly clearly expressed its intent that \u201cnonparty witnesses,\u201d like the victim in this case, be notified that their medical records are being sought in discovery, that they receive information concerning their right to move the trial court to quash the subpoena seeking those records, and that health care entities be instructed on how to protect their patients\u2019 privacy during a legal proceeding. It is apparent from an examination of the subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>included in the record before us that Hairston made no attempt to meet the requirements of Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03(H). The subpoena does not include any of the required notices, and the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>reveals that Hairston did not notify the victim that he was seeking her counseling records, as required by the statute. Based on these facts, we conclude that the trial court was correct in quashing the subpoena <em>duces tecum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\n<em>C. Relationship between Rule 3A:12(b) and Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Finally, we address the relationship between Rule 3A:12(b) and Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03. Code \u00a7 8.01-3 empowers our Supreme Court to prescribe the rules of practice and procedure for the courts of this Commonwealth; however, it also provides, in pertinent part, that the General Assembly \u201cmay, from time to time, by the enactment of a general law, modify or annul any rules adopted or amended pursuant to this section. In the case of any variance between a rule and an enactment of the General Assembly such variance shall be construed so as to give effect to such enactment.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-3(A), (D). Further, our Supreme Court has determined that \u201cthere is no variance\u201d between a rule and a statute when both \u201cprovisions seek to promote\u201d the same policy. <em>Waterman v. Halverson, </em>261 Va. 203, 206-07, 540 S.E.2d 867, 868-69 (2001); <em>cf. Capelle v. Orange County, </em>269 Va. 60, 65, 607 S.E.2d 103, 105 (2005) (noting the basic principle of statutory interpretation that when one statute addresses a subject in a general manner and another addresses a part of the same subject in a more specific manner, the two statutes should be harmonized, if possible, and when they conflict, the more specific statute prevails).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Here, we determine that there is no conflict between Rule 3A:12(b) and Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03. Like the provisions at issue in <em>Waterman, </em>these provisions both seek to promote the same policy: here, the orderly issuance of subpoenas <em>duces tecum. </em>Thus, we read the rule and the statute in harmony, and conclude that while the statute in no way \u201cnullifie[s] or invalidate[s] any portion of the rule,\u201d <em>Waterman, </em>261 Va. at 207, 540 S.E.2d at 869, the statute creates a specific procedure that parties seeking medical or counseling records must follow. We therefore conclude that even when, as here, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>complies with Rule 3A:12(b) and follows the form of the sample subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>included in the appendix to the rules of court, it will not be sufficient to request medical or counseling records in light of Code \u00a7 32.1-127.1:03.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">For the reasons discussed in this opinion, the trial court correctly quashed the subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>seeking the victim\u2019s counseling records. We affirm Hairston\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\">. HIPAA refers to a federal statute, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d <em>et seq. </em>HIPAA does not govern the issuance of subpoenas under state law, but Virginia has enacted its own statute governing the privacy of health records. The Virginia Health Records Privacy Law, as discussed <em>infra, </em>specifically discusses the requirements for obtaining medical or counseling records pursuant to a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>and was cited in the parties' briefs and at oral argument in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\">. Because we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision on these grounds, we need not discuss whether the subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>properly sought relevant information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b113-7\">. We also note that Hairston conceded at oral argument that Dr. Bendewald is a health care provider within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">. Rule 3A: 12(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">Upon notice to the adverse party and on affidavit by the parly applying for the subpoena that the requested writings or objects are material to the proceedings and are in the possession of a person not a party to the action, the judge or the clerk may issue a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>for the production of writings or objects described in the subpoena.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
