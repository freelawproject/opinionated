FRANK, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">John Wilson Roulhac, Jr., appellant, was convicted in a bench trial of possession of cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250. On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, as the police did not have reasonable suspicion to detain or pat him down. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">On August 22, 2006, Portsmouth police officers Worley and Candelario were riding patrol on High Street when Worley observed appellant and another individual conduct a \u201chand to hand transaction\u201d in which it \u201cappeared that they may have transferred something.\u201d Worley testified, \u201cbased on my experience of when you see a hand to hand transaction, that means that usually they are transferring something.\u201d Officer Worley was unable to ascertain the nature of the item that was possibly exchanged. He further indicated that he did not know if the individuals had committed a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The officers stopped their vehicle and approached the two men on foot. Officer Candelario spoke with appellant and determined that there were no outstanding warrants for him. He informed appellant he was free to go.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Worley talked to the other man. As appellant was about to walk away, Officer Worley approached appellant, and without blocking his path notified appellant \u201cthat there was a high [terror] threat alert. And I asked him if he had any rocket launchers, hand grenades, any terrorist plans or terrorist papers in his pockets.\u201d Worley then asked appellant for consent to search. Appellant declined the invitation to be searched. He said he did not possess any of the items Worley had mentioned, and then reached into his pockets. Although Worley never observed a gun, or anything that appeared to be a gun, on appellant\u2019s person, Worley grabbed appellant\u2019s hands and patted him down for weapons. When asked if appellant had any noticeable bulges that appeared to be weapons, Worley replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure of that.\u201d Worley testified that he knew appellant had no gun, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know if he had a knife or something in that pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Worley described appellant as wearing layers of clothing. \u201cFor August that was kind of unusual to have that, those layers of clothes on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Worley testified he patted appellant down for his safety. He indicated patting a suspect down was standard procedure, \u201cwhen someone reaches in their pocket around me, yes, I usually do that, yes, put my hands on them.\u201d As a result of the pat down, Worley recovered a smoking device containing cocaine residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Appellant filed a motion to suppress, arguing that Worley had no reasonable suspicion to detain him and pat him down. The court overruled appellant\u2019s motion and found appellant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u201cOn appeal from a denial of a suppression motion, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 101, 103, 582 S.E.2d 448, 449 (2003).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">An appellant\u2019s claim that evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment \u201cpresents a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal. In making such a determination, we give deference to the factual findings of the trial court and independently determine whether the manner in which the evidence was obtained [violated] the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-8\"><em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 193, 202-03, 609 S.E.2d 612, 616 (2005) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 568, 573, 570 S.E.2d 836, 838 (2002)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">Police-citizen confrontations generally fall into one of three categories. First, there are consensual encounters which do not implicate the Fourth Amendment. Next, there are brief investigatory stops, commonly referred to as <em>\u201cTerry\u201d </em>stops, which must be based upon reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is or may be afoot. Finally, there are \u201chighly intrusive, full-scale arrests\u201d or searches which must be based upon probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-9\"><em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc) </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">\u201cLaw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by approaching individuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to them if they are willing to listen.\u201d <em>United States v. Drayton, </em>536 U.S. 194, 200, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 2110, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002). In addition, \u2018\u201c[a]n encounter between a law enforcement officer and a citizen in which the officer merely identifies himself and states that he is conduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>ing an ... investigation, without more, is not a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment but is, instead, a consensual encounter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Londono v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va. App. 377, 399, 579 S.E.2d 641, 651 (2003) (quoting <em>McGee, </em>25 Va.App. at 199, 487 S.E.2d at 262). Likewise, \u201cinterrogation relating to one\u2019s identity or a request for identification by the police does not, by itself, constitute a Fourth Amendment seizure.\u201d <em>INS v. Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 216, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 1762, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 (1984). Such encounters are consensual. \u201cFourth Amendment scrutiny is triggered, however, the moment an encounter \u2018loses its consensual nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 86, 88, 414 S.E.2d 869, 870 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u201cIn order for a seizure to occur, an individual must be under some physical restraint by an officer or have submitted to the show of police authority.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 49, 54, 480 S.E.2d 135, 137 (1997) <em>(en banc) </em>(citing <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 628, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 1551, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991)). An encounter between a police officer and a citizen becomes a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes \u201c \u2018only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave,\u2019 \u201d <em>Baldwin v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 191, 196, 413 S.E.2d 645, 648 (1992) (quoting <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980)), because the citizen\u2019s freedom of movement was being restrained by the use of physical force or show of authority, <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. at 626-27, 111 S.Ct. at 1550-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Among the factors which determine whether an officer \u201cby means of physical force or a show of authority\u201d would cause a reasonable person to feel seized, <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 553, 100 S.Ct. at 1877, are the \u201c \u2018threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Londono, </em>40 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>at 398-99, 579 S.E.2d at 651 (quoting <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Here, the initial encounter between Officer Worley and appellant was consensual and engendered no Fourth Amendment interest. Worley merely approached appellant and inquired whether appellant had any knowledge of terrorist activity. Worley did not make any threats or demands, draw his weapon, or engage in any other form of aggressive behavior. However, once Worley grabbed appellant\u2019s wrist, appellant was seized for Fourth Amendment purposes. <em>See Payne, </em>14 Va.App. at 89, 414 S.E.2d at 870 (\u201cThe consensual aspect of this encounter disappeared, however, when defendant refused [the officer\u2019s] request to open his fist, and she \u2018grabbed\u2019 his arm. Under such restraint ... defendant was then \u2018seized\u2019 by the officer.\u201d). <em>See also Duhart v. United States, </em>589 A.2d 895, 898 (D.C.1991) (holding that once the officer grabbed accused by the wrist, the initial consensual encounter escalated into a seizure).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Worley\u2019s use of physical force is clearly one of the criteria recognized by <em>Mendenhall </em>in evaluating the non-consensual nature of a police encounter. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877. It follows that when Worley grabbed hold of appellant\u2019s wrist, appellant would not have felt free to leave. We therefore find that appellant was seized at the time Officer Worley grabbed his wrist.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Having found the appellant was seized at the time Worley grabbed appellant\u2019s wrist, we next determine whether the officer had reasonable grounds to believe appellant was armed and dangerous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\u201cBefore [an officer] places a hand on the person of a citizen in search of anything, he must have constitutionally adequate, reasonable grounds for doing so. In the case of the self-protective search for weapons, [the officer] must be able to point to particular facts from which he reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and dangerous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><em>Lett v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 191, 195, 372 S.E.2d 195, 197 (1988) (quoting <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 62, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1902, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968)). The circumstances that a court can consider when determining whether an officer had reasonable suspicion include the nature of the area in which the stop occurred, the time of day, the conduct and demeanor of the suspect, and the type of offense that the officer was investigating. <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va. App. 782, 791-92, 595 S.E.2d 30, 35 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The facts here do not give Worley an objectively reasonable basis for suspecting that appellant was armed and dangerous. Indeed Worley testified it was his standard procedure to grab an individual\u2019s arm when the individual reaches into his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Our decision is controlled by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Payne, </em>14 Va.App. 86, 414 S.E.2d 869. In <em>Payne, </em>an officer observed defendant \u201criffling through a wallet.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 414 S.E.2d at 869. The officer approached defendant and inquired if the wallet belonged to him. <em>Id. </em>As defendant was handing the wallet to the officer, the officer noticed that defendant\u2019s \u201cleft fist was tightly closed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendant twice refused the officer\u2019s request to open his fist. <em>Id. </em>Believing that the defendant may have a weapon in his hand, the officer grabbed the defendant\u2019s arm causing defendant to open his hand and reveal his cocaine. <em>Id. </em>This Court held that \u201cthe facts ... did not give [the officer] an objectively reasonable basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>suspecting that defendant was armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 414 S.E.2d at 870. In considering that defendant never held his hand in a threatening manner and that there was no indication that the fist contained a concealed weapon, this Court stated that \u201c[u]nder such circumstances, defendant\u2019s hesitancy to open his hand did not create a \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 that he possessed a weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 414 S.E.2d at 870-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">We find no meaningful distinction between refusing to open a closed fist and placing one\u2019s hand into pockets. In either case, that fact, without more, does not give an officer a reasonable basis to seize the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The Commonwealth argues that Officer Worley\u2019s observation of a possible narcotics transaction generates a concern for the presence of weapons. We are mindful that this Court has previously acknowledged that suspicion of narcotics distribution gives rise to an inference of dangerousness. <em>See Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 53, 67, 354 S.E.2d 79, 87 (1987) (holding that even though the officers who detained Williams had no information that he was armed, they acted reasonably when conducting a protective pat-down search for weapons in light of the fact that they had a reasonable suspicion that Williams was presently engaged in narcotics distribution); <em>see also Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 692, 701 n. 3, 636 S.E.2d 403, 407 n. 3 (2006) (noting \u201cit is reasonable for an officer to believe a person may be armed and dangerous when the person is suspected of being involved in a drug transaction\u201d). However, such are not the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">This record is silent as to appellant\u2019s involvement in criminal activity, much less his association with drug distribution. When Officer Worley was asked if he observed the individuals \u201cpresently committing any crime,\u201d his response was a clear \u201cNo.\u201d Worley testified that he witnessed a small item transfer between the two individuals, yet he never identified the specific nature of the item, stating only that it may have been \u201ca lighter, a cigarette or maybe a narcotics [sic].\u201d Thus, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>find the record does not sufficiently establish that Worley had a reasonable suspicion to believe appellant was involved in drug distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In addition, Worley acknowledged that he did not see appellant with a gun or anything that looked like a gun. There is nothing in the record to suggest appellant appeared nervous or behaved in a threatening manner in placing his hands in his pockets. We also note that Worley never asked appellant to remove his hands from his pockets or attempted to secure his own safety by less intrusive means. <em>See Mejia v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 749, 755, 441 S.E.2d 41, 44 (1994) (noting that officer seized appellant without first having attempted \u201ca less intrusive alternative or explaining why such less intrusive means were impractical\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">On these facts, we hold that Officer Worley had no basis to reasonably believe that appellant was armed or dangerous. <em>See Mejia, </em>17 Va.App. at 755, 441 S.E.2d at 44 (finding no reasonable basis for seizure when sole reason for taking hold of appellant was appellant\u2019s posture in preventing officer from exiting his police vehicle after being summoned by the officer to the vehicle); <em>but see Walker, </em>42 Va.App. at 791, 595 S.E.2d at 35 (\u201cGiven the place [high crime area], time [11:00 p.m.], appellant\u2019s secretive behavior, and his demeanor, the officer had objective facts sufficient to give him reasonable suspicion to stop appellant and investigate his actions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Without consent or reasonable suspicion that appellant was armed, Officer Worley had no lawful authority to grab appellant and to pat him down for weapons. <em>Payne, </em>14 Va.App. at 90, 414 S.E.2d at 871. The trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-9\">. Appellant does not contest the validity of this encounter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-9\">. We note that at oral argument, the Commonwealth conceded Worley grabbing appellant\u2019s arm was a seizure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-10\">. We find that Officer Worley seized appellant solely for the purpose of patting him down for weapons. To that end, we need not address whether appellant was properly detained pursuant to a <em>Terry </em>stop. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>Hayes v. Florida, </em>470 U.S. 811, 816, 105 S.Ct. 1643, 1647, 84 L.Ed.2d 705 (1985) (holding that an officer who develops reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot may stop a person \u201cin order to identify him, to question him briefly, or to detain him briefly while attempting to obtain additional information\u201d to either dispel or confirm his suspicions).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
