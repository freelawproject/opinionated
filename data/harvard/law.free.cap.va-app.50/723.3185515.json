McCLANAHAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">UPON A REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">A jury convicted Rodney William Lightfoot of three counts of robbery, three counts of using a firearm in the commission of a felony, and being armed while entering a bank with the intent to commit larceny. At trial, Lightfoot made a <em>Batson </em>motion in response to the Commonwealth\u2019s use of peremptory strikes to remove two African-American women from the venire, which the trial court denied. <em>See Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). Lightfoot contends the court erred in ruling that he failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination under <em>Batson. </em>A panel majority of this Court agreed with Lightfoot and reversed the decision of the trial court. We granted a petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of the panel decision. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Three African-Americans, one male and two females, were included in the venire of twenty potential jurors (after three individuals were released for cause). Using two of its four peremptory strikes, the Commonwealth struck the two African-American females from the venire after completion of <em>voir dire. </em>One was Wanda Mead. The record does not reveal the identity of the second African-American female. The African-American male remained on the jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">During <em>voir dire,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Commonwealth asked, <em>inter alia, </em>if any of the potential jurors had friends or relatives who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>been charged with crimes in the past. Two individuals on the venire responded affirmatively, Mead and Thomas Ewing, a Caucasian. Mead stated that a family member had been charged with a traffic offense. Ewing explained that his daughter had been charged with a felony. Like Mead, Ewing was subsequently struck by the Commonwealth. Additionally, in response to a follow-up question by the Commonwealth, an unidentified female on the panel indicated familiarity with one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">A number of potential jurors also gave affirmative responses to questions by Lightfoot\u2019s counsel, indicating a potential for bias. Some of those respondents are unidentified from the record. One unidentified individual stated that he or she went to high school with Lightfoot. Mead also revealed at that time she had visited someone in jail or prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">After <em>voir dire </em>was completed and the parties exercised their peremptory strikes, Lightfoot made a <em>Batson </em>motion on the grounds the Commonwealth had used two of its four strikes to remove two of the three African-Americans. In further support of the motion (apart from simply pointing to these numbers), Lightfoot\u2019s counsel asserted that the Commonwealth did not question either of the two African-American women, whom it struck, and that neither of them responded during <em>voir dire </em>to any of the questions posed by the parties\u2019 respective counsel or the trial court. Such circumstances, according to Lightfoot, indicated the Commonwealth improperly struck these two African-Americans based on race.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The Commonwealth denied the assertion of Lightfoot\u2019s counsel that the two African-American women did not respond to questioning during <em>voir </em>dire, pointing specifically to Mead\u2019s affirmative response to the prosecutor\u2019s questioning, along with Ewing, resulting in both being struck by the Commonwealth. The trial court agreed with the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>wealth, finding that Lightfoot\u2019s counsel was \u201cnot correct\u201d in that assertion. The trial court also ultimately agreed with the Commonwealth that Lightfoot had not established a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination under <em>Batson </em>\u201cbased on what [his counsel had] articulated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A1c\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The United States Supreme Court held in <em>Batson </em>that the peremptory exclusion of a potential juror based solely on the juror\u2019s race \u201cis purposeful discrimination and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 423, 435, 587 S.E.2d 532, 542 (2003). Under <em>Batson\u2019s </em>three-step test, a defendant asserting such a violation initially \u201cmust show that the individual \u2018is a member of a cognizable racial group,\u2019 <em>Yarbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 388, 394, 551 S.E.2d 306, 309 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1060, 122 S.Ct. 1925, 152 L.Ed.2d 832 (2002) (quoting <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96, 106 S.Ct. at 1723), and \u2018make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the peremptory strike was made on racial grounds.\u2019 <em>Jackson, </em>266 Va. at 436, 587 S.E.2d at 542.\u201d <em>Juniper v. Commonwealth, </em>271 Va. 362, 407, 626 S.E.2d 383, 412 (2006). \u201c[If] a <em>prima facie </em>case is put before the court, the burden shifts to the prosecution \u2018to produce race-neutral explanations for striking the juror.\u2019 The defendant can then argue that the prosecution\u2019s explanations were purely a pretext for unconstitutional discrimination. <em>Jackson, </em>266 Va. at 436, 587 S.E.2d at 542.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under each of <em>Batson\u2019s </em>three steps, however, the \u201cburden of persuasion \u2018rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. California, </em>545 U.S. 162, 170-71, 125 S.Ct. 2410, 2417, 162 L.Ed.2d 129 (2005) (quoting <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>The trial court\u2019s finding in the instant case that Light-foot failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under step one of <em>Batson </em>\u201cis entitled to great deference\u201d on appeal. <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 654, 674, 529 S.E.2d 769, 780 (2000) (applying deferential standard of review to <em>Batson\u2019s </em>step one determination (citing <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98 n. 21, 106 S.Ct. at 1724 n. 21)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, this finding will not be reversed unless we determine it is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 459, 462, 442 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1994) (citing <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991)); <em>see United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>Escobar-de Jesus, </em>187 F.3d 148, 164 (1st Cir.1999) (\u201c[T]he district court\u2019s ruling [under step one of <em>Batson </em>] on this fact-sensitive question must be upheld unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d), <em>cited with approval in Johnson, </em>259 Va. at 674, 529 S.E.2d at 781; <em>United States v. Lane, </em>866 F.2d 103, 105 (4th Cir.1989) (applying clearly erroneous standard to step one determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">\u201cTo establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, the defendant must ... \u2018identify facts and circumstances that raise an inference that potential jurors were excluded based on their race.\u2019\u201d <em>Juniper, </em>271 Va. at 407, 626 S.E.2d at 412 (quoting <em>Yarbrough, </em>262 Va. at 394, 551 S.E.2d at 309); <em>see Johnson, </em>545 U.S. at 168, 125 S.Ct. at 2416 (\u201cFirst, the defendant must make out a <em>prima facie </em>case \u2018by showing that the <em>totality of the relevant facts </em>gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 93-94, 106 S.Ct. at 1721) (emphasis added)). This means the defendant may not rely on \u201csome magic number or percentage to trigger a <em>Batson </em>inquiry.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 176, 182-84, 380 S.E.2d 1, 4-5 (1989); <em>see United States v. Sangineto-Miranda, </em>859 F.2d 1501, 1521 (6th Cir.1988) (\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Batson </em>to consider all the facts and circumstances means that we cannot lay down clear rules as to the specific numbers or percentages that will constitute or refute a <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d), <em>cited with approval in Johnson, </em>259 Va. at 674, 529 S.E.2d at 781. Consequently, the \u201c[m]ere exclusion of members of a particular race by using peremptory strikes \u2018does not itself establish ... a <em>prima facie </em>case under <em>Bat-son.\u2019 \u201d Juniper, </em>271 Va. at 407, 626 S.E.2d at 412 (quoting <em>Yarbrough, </em>262 Va. at 394, 551 S.E.2d at 309). \u201c[S]o too, the mere inclusion of [a particular race] on a jury does not automatically preclude a finding of a <em>prima facie </em>case.... \u201d <em>Jackson, </em>8 Va.App. at 183, 380 S.E.2d at 5. In other words, the trial court must make a \u201ccase-by-case determination whether the facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 380 S.E.2d at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In this case, we cannot say the trial court was clearly erroneous in its determination that Lightfoot failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case under Batson\u2014i.e., finding that the relevant facts and circumstances did not give rise to an inference the Commonwealth was engaged in purposeful racial discrimination when it struck the two African-American women.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\n<em>(i) Mead</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">As to Mead, the record amply supports the trial court\u2019s ruling. Lightfoot identified no facts or circumstances for the strike from which a discriminatory motive could be inferred. Indeed, the only reason apparent from the record for striking Mead is the same race-neutral reason that would explain the strike of Ewing, a Caucasian. They were the only two potential jurors who responded affirmatively when the Commonwealth asked if anyone on the venire had friends or relatives who had been charged with crimes in the past. In addition, Mead stated during defense counsel\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>that she had visited someone in jail or prison. It is well established that a court considering a <em>Batson </em>motion at step one \u201cmay consider apparent reasons for the challenges discernible on the record, regardless of whether those reasons were the actual reasons for the challenge.\u201d <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>421 F.3d 503, 515 (7th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). \u201cThis consideration of \u2018apparent reasons\u2019 is in fact nothing more than a consideration of \u2018all relevant circumstances\u2019 when determining whether an inference of discrimination is established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516; <em>see Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 336-38, 356 S.E.2d 157, 170-71 (1987) (finding no <em>prima facie </em>case where it was \u201capparent\u201d from record that Commonwealth\u2019s subject strike was based on race-neutral information revealed during <em>voir dire); see also Wade v. Terhune, </em>202 F.3d 1190, 1198 (9th Cir.2000) (finding no <em>prima facie </em>case where \u201crecord con-tainted] entirely plausible reasons, independent of race,\u201d for peremptory strike); <em>Johnson v. Campbell, </em>92 F.3d 951, 953 (9th Cir.1996) (relying on \u201cobvious neutral reason for the challenge\u201d in finding no <em>prima facie </em>case); <em>Capers v. Single</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number><em>tary, </em>989 F.2d 442, 446 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201cWhen combined with the number of black jurors not challenged by the state, the existence of plausible, racially neutral bases for the state\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges, apparent on the record, is sufficient to nullify any inference of discrimination that otherwise might be drawn from the number of strikes used to remove black potential jurors.\u201d); <em>Washington v. Wright, </em>78 Wash.App. 93, 896 P.2d 713, 720 (1995) (explaining that \u201capparent nondiscriminatory reasons [for state\u2019s peremptory strikes] are important because they mitigate against finding a pattern of strikes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Furthermore, none of the prosecutor\u2019s questions or statements during <em>voir dire </em>\u201cindicated [he] was of a mind to discriminate in [his] exercise of peremptory strikes,\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>259 Va. at 674-75, 529 S.E.2d at 781, which tends to \u201crefut[e] an inference of discriminatory purpose,\u201d <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96-97, 106 S.Ct. at 1723 (explaining that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s questions and statements during <em>voir dire </em>examination and in exercising his challenges may support or refute an inference of discriminatory purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\n<em>(ii) Unidentified Africanr-American Woman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">As to the other African-American woman struck by the Commonwealth, Lightfoot does not present a sufficient record upon which we can determine whether the trial court committed the alleged error. The record does not reveal her identity, nor does it reveal her responses, if any, during <em>voir dire. </em>We can discern from the record, however, that during <em>voir dire </em>a number of unidentified potential jurors responded affirmatively to questioning, providing race-neutral reasons for striking those respondents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Any one of those respondents may have been the unidentified African-American woman. Once again, evidence in the record of \u201centirely plausible reasons, independent of race,\u201d for exercising a peremptory strike implies that racial bias did not motivate the prosecutor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>thus negating a claim of purposeful racial discrimination under step one of a <em>Batson </em>challenge. <em>Wade, </em>202 F.3d at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Lightfoot has thus failed in his \u201cburden of producing a record that supports a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination\u201d in the Commonwealth\u2019s peremptory strike of the unidentified African-American woman. <em>Johnson, </em>259 Va. at 674, 529 S.E.2d at 780; <em>see also Commonwealth v. Williams, </em>262 Va. 661, 669, 553 S.E.2d 760, 764 (2001) (\u201c[On appeal], the circuit court\u2019s judgment is presumptively correct and the burden is on the appellant to present a sufficient record to permit a determination whether the circuit court committed an alleged error.\u201d (citing <em>Justis v.

A proponent of a peremptory strike sometimes proceeds to step two (offering an explanation for the strike) before the trial court makes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>step one determination, at which time the court makes a step two ruling without having decided if a <em>prima facie </em>case was established under step one. On appeal, such a case is reviewed under step two of <em>Batson, </em>without regard to whether a <em>prima facie </em>case was made, because that issue is deemed waived. <em>See Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 359, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 1862, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991); <em>Faison v.

(The reasons given were the same as those apparent on the record for striking her. <em>See infra, </em>Part II(B)(i)). The prosecutor did so in the context of asserting that Lightfoot had made no step one <em>prima facie </em>showing, and the trial court made the step one determination, which was dispositive. Therefore, our review is necessarily limited to that step one determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\">. Lightfoot contends on appeal he established a <em>prima facie </em>case of both racial and gender discrimination in the Commonwealth\u2019s exercise of peremptory strikes to remove the two African-American women. <em>See J.E.B. v.
