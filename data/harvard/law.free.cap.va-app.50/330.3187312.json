ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">A jury convicted John Robert Lay of statutory burglary and abduction. On appeal, Lay challenges only his burglary conviction. He claims the jury instruction given in his case limited the prosecution\u2019s theory to an actual breaking with physical force against the entry portal. From that premise, Lay asserts that the evidence\u2014even viewed in the light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>favorable to the Commonwealth\u2014does not support that theory. We disagree with Lay\u2019s first premise and, thus, need not address his second.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2008). Examining the evidence through this evidentiary prism requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">So viewed, the evidence at trial showed that a woman, an Indonesian national, returned home from the grocery store. As she was standing on her front porch with grocery bags, a man she did not know approached her and said he needed to borrow her phone. Testifying through an interpreter, the woman stated that, at the door of her home, \u201che forced me and I was opening the door because I was frustrated, I didn\u2019t know what to do at that time because he forced me, and he was carrying my bags and he was going in.\u201d Without any request to do so, the man picked up her grocery bags and abruptly entered the home as the woman opened the door. Asked whether she invited Lay into her home, the woman said she \u201cdidn\u2019t let him through, but he was forcing himself.\u201d She was \u201cso frightened, and he was forcing himself to go into the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The man, later determined to be Lay, then \u201cplaced his body in front of the door\u201d and said he was a police officer. He did not use the phone but instead asked the woman whether she was \u201cillegal.\u201d When the woman \u201ctried to run away,\u201d Lay raised his knee to prevent her from leaving. Keeping her wits about her, the woman called out her renter\u2019s name even though she knew he was not there. The ruse worked, and Lay hastily left.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>A detective interviewed Lay shortly after the incident. Lay initially tried to persuade the detective that his encounter with the victim was an effort to help the police investigate Hispanic gang crime. Lay later confessed that on three prior occasions he had approached women while claiming to be a police officer investigating illegal aliens. He admitted his intent in those prior encounters was to solicit sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, Lay moved to strike the burglary charge. Assuming the prosecution was asserting only a constructive breaking theory of burglary, Lay\u2019s counsel discussed the attributes of a <em>prima facie </em>showing of constructive breaking and argued the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction. The trial court denied the motion, and Lay rested without presenting any evidence. The Commonwealth and Lay offered identical instructions on the breaking element of the burglary charge. The agreed-upon instruction defined \u201cbreaking\u201d as the \u201cuse of some force, however slight, to gain entry.\u201d Va. Model Jury Instruction No. 12.600, at 12-49 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">During their deliberations, the jurors asked the trial court to define \u201csome force, however slight\u201d in the breaking instruction. They further asked: \u201cMust there be physical or can it be intimidation or other emotional means?\u201d With the agreement of the Commonwealth and Lay, the trial court did not directly answer the question but instead directed the jurors to rely on the instructions they had been given. The jury found Lay guilty of statutory burglary under Code \u00a7 18.2-92 and abduction under Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">A \u201cbreaking\u201d under burglary law can be \u201ceither actual or constructive.\u201d <em>Bao Quoc Doan v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 87, 99, 422 S.E.2d 398, 404 (1992). Actual breaking requires the use of physical force, often against some structural aspect of the entry portal. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, 221 </em>Va. 872, 876, 275 S.E.2d 592, 594-95 (1981). \u201cMerely pushing open a door, turning the key, lifting the latch, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>resort to other slight physical force is sufficient to constitute this element of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 876, 275 S.E.2d at 595 (quoting <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>132 Va. 521, 523, 110 S.E. 356, 357 (1922)).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">On the other hand, constructive breaking can include fraud, threats, trickery, conspiracy, or some other nefarious conduct designed to prompt the victim to let the burglar inside. <em>See id. </em>at 876, 275 S.E.2d at 594; <em>Bao Quoc Doan, </em>15 Va.App. at 99, 422 S.E.2d at 404-05 (distinguishing \u201cphysical force\u201d from \u201cthreats, fraud or conspiracy\u201d and finding either category sufficient to prove a breaking). When an intimidated or defrauded victim \u201copens the door and the thief enters, such entry will amount to breaking in law; for which some have given as a reason, that the opening of the door by the owner being occasioned by the felonious attempt of the thief, is as much imputable to him as if it had been actually done by his own hands.\u201d <em>Clarke v. Commonwealth, </em>66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 908, 912 (1874) (citing 1 <em>Russell on Crimes </em>792). Constructive breaking principles thus recognize that, while the burglar may not technically use actual, physical force to gain entry, \u201cthe law will not suffer itself to be trifled with such evasions.4 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>226 (1769).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Lay does not contest these settled principles. He simply assumes the jury instruction defining \u201cbreaking\u201d in this case limited the jury\u2019s factfinding to the presence or absence of actual, physical force against the entry portal. Upon that assumption rests his question presented: \u201cWas the evidence sufficient to prove an actual breaking when entry was made without the use of force against any object attached to the premises and used for security?\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2. We do not answer this question, however, because we disagree with the assumption underlying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Nothing in the text of the instruction in any way qualified the concept of force. The instruction required only a showing of \u201csome force, however slight.\u201d Va. Model Jury Instruction No. 12.600, at 12-49. As the jurors\u2019 question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>suggested, \u201csome force, however slight\u201d could be understood to include actual as well as constructive force. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>673 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201cforce\u201d to include both actual and constructive force).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor does the instruction say that the force must necessarily be directed against an \u201cobject attached to the premises and used for security.\u201d <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2. It merely stated that force be used \u201cto gain entry.\u201d Va. Model Jury Instruction No. 12.600, at 12-49.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Force includes \u201c[pjower, violence, or pressure directed against <em>a person or thing.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, </em>at 673 (emphasis added). Given the lack of any further qualifications, the \u201cto gain entry\u201d phrase in the instruction permitted the jury to find Lay guilty if he forced the victim to open the door no less than if he forced the door open himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In short, we see no reason to test the sufficiency of the evidence under an actual breaking theory of burglary law because we see no reason why the jury instruction precluded the jury from finding a constructive breaking\u2014a theory of liability wholly unaddressed by Lay\u2019s question presented.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Finding Lay\u2019s question presented self-defeating, we affirm his conviction for statutory burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\">. <em>Accord Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 31, 34, 630 S.E.2d 291, 292 (2006) (observing that, in sexual offenses, \"we have repeatedly held that \u2018force\u2019 includes both actual and constructive force\u201d); <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 936, 946, 45 S.E.2d 167, 171 (1947) (\"Under the law two types of force, active and constructive, are recognized.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">. Other model instructions make an effort to separate actual from constructive breaking principles. See, e.g., 4 Ronald J. Bacigal &amp; Joseph S.
