On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>precluding him from presenting a \u201csettled insanity\u201d defense, and in \u201cgranting the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed jury instructions and refusing [his] proposed instructions as to the allocation of the burden of proof with respect to [his alternate] insanity defense.\u201d Finding no error, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u201cUnder familiar principles of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party that prevailed below.\u201d <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 543, 586 S.E.2d 876, 877 (2003). Consistent with this principle, the evidence shows that on September 24, 1985, appellant shot his estranged wife eight times, causing permanent injury. Appellant fled the scene before police and medical personnel arrived. His vehicle was found abandoned two weeks later at the Norfolk Naval Base.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Almost seventeen years later, on May 1, 2002, appellant was arrested in Florida, where he had been living under an assumed name. He was eventually returned to Virginia to stand trial for the malicious wounding of his estranged wife and for use of a firearm during the commission of a felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Appellant filed a notice with the trial court on July 2, 2003, that he intended to present a \u201csettled insanity\u201d defense, alleging that his \u201cactions were the result and/or product of a mental disease or defect produced by long-term substance abuse, ... including, but not limited to, alcohol and xanax abuse.\u201d On February 22, 2005, one day before appellant\u2019s scheduled jury trial, the Commonwealth made an oral motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude appellant from presenting expert testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>mony and other evidence in support of such a defense. The Commonwealth argued that appellant should not be permitted to present a \u201csettled insanity\u201d defense to the jury because he had conceded that he did not suffer from a permanent mental defect or disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Appellant acknowledged that his \u201ccondition [had] abated over a period of time when he stopped drinking, stopped using [] drugs, [and] had some treatment for his liver----\u201d However, he argued that the defense of \u201csettled insanity\u201d in Virginia \u201cdoes not depend for its legal efficacy upon whether the defendant\u2019s insanity is temporary, intermittent, or permanent.\u201d Relying on <em>Herbin v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 173, 503 S.E.2d 226 (1998), he asserted that the duration of his mental defect or disease is immaterial so long as his long-term substance abuse produced a mental defect or disease that met Virginia\u2019s definition of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The trial court rejected appellant\u2019s argument, ruling that \u201csettled insanity [ ] is not recognized [in Virginia] as a valid defense unless it\u2019s permanent.\u201d Thus, it held that \u201cbecause [appellant\u2019s] condition was not permanent, he does not currently meet the standard to be declared insane. He cannot avail himself of the settled insanity defense.\u201d The trial court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">all the parties agree that [appellant] is no longer suffering from any condition that would meet the legal definition of insanity. He is, thus, asserting a temporary settled insanity defense or as [the Commonwealth] stated ... a settled insanity in remission type of defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">:jc * <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">The [S]upreme [C]ourt has clearly said that to be acceptable [the settled insanity] has to be permanent....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">$ ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">[Appellant\u2019s] condition cannot be permanent as required by case law if it no longer exists ... [and][i]f it\u2019s not permanent, then it\u2019s temporary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Appellant\u2019s trial was subsequently continued to allow appellant to prepare an alternate defense. At trial, appellant did not deny shooting his estranged wife, but entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity due to involuntary intoxication. At the close of all the evidence, he proffered jury instructions A through E, allocating to the Commonwealth the burden of proving his sanity. The trial court refused appellant\u2019s proffered instructions, concluding that his instructions were contrary to established law. The trial court then instructed the jury in accordance with the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered instructions, which placed on appellant the burden of proving his insanity at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The jury rejected appellant\u2019s alternate defense of insanity by reason of involuntary intoxication, and returned a guilty verdict for both charges. The trial court imposed the jury\u2019s sentence verdict of a total of 15 years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AEk\">\n<em>A. \u201cSettled Insanity\u201d Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">On appeal, appellant first contends that the trial court erred, as a matter of law, when it granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>precluding his proffered evidence of \u201csettled insanity\u201d from being presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\u201cIn Virginia ... insanity is an affirmative defense that the defendant must establish to the satisfaction of the fact finder.\u201d <em>Shifflett v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 760, 769, 274 S.E.2d 305, 310 (1981). To present evidence of insanity to the fact finder, an accused must first make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that his evidence meets the requirements of the affirmative defense. <em>See White v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 619, 629, 636 S.E.2d 353, 358 (2006) (no error in refusing to allow evidence of \u201csettled insanity\u201d defense to be admitted for jury\u2019s consideration because accused\u2019s proffered evidence insufficient to establish prima facie defense of insanity). \u201cPrima facie evidence is \u2018[ejvidence that will establish a fact or sustain a judgment unless contradictory evidence is produced.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>626, 636 S.E.2d at 357 (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>598 (8th ed.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u201c \u2018Virginia law recognizes two tests by which an accused can establish criminal insanity, the <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>Rule and the irresistible impulse doctrine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 261, 277, 511 S.E.2d 439, 446 (1999) (quoting <em>Godley v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 249, 251, 343 S.E.2d 368, 370 (1986)). Under the <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>Rule,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">\u201cit must be clearly proven that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\"><em>Price v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 452, 457-58, 323 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1984) (quoting <em>M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, </em>10 C. &amp; F. 200, 8 Eng. Rep. 718, 722-23 (1843)). The irresistible impulse defense is available \u201cwhere the accused\u2019s mind has become \u2018so impaired by disease that he is totally deprived of the mental power to control or restrain his act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Godley, </em>2 Va.App. at 251, 343 S.E.2d at 370 (quoting <em>Thompson v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 704, 716, 70 S.E.2d 284, 292 (1952)).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u201cIt is well settled in Virginia that, \u2018except in cases of first degree and capital murder, where proof of voluntary intoxication may negate deliberation and premeditation, such intoxication, whether from drugs or alcohol, is no defense to a criminal charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Herbin, </em>28 Va.App. at 183-84, 503 S.E.2d at 231. However, common law has long recognized that the long-term, chronic, and habitual abuse of alcohol or drugs will support a defense of insanity where such abuse creates a mental defect or disease that meets the requirements of either of Virginia\u2019s insanity tests. <em>See White, </em>272 Va. at 626, 636 S.E.2d at 357; <em>Little v. Commonwealth, </em>163 Va. 1020, 1024, 175 S.E. 767, 769 (1934). <em>See also Gills v. Commonwealth, </em>141 Va. 445, 450-51, 126 S.E. 51, 53 (1925); <em>Boswell v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 860, 872 (1871); <em>Herbin, </em>28 Va.App. at 184, 503 S.E.2d at 231. This common law exception to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>general prohibition of voluntary intoxication as a defense to a criminal charge is known as the doctrine of \u201csettled insanity.\u201d <em>Herbin, </em>28 Va.App. at 184, 503 S.E.2d at 231 (citing <em>Arey v. Peyton, </em>209 Va. 370, 375, 164 S.E.2d 691, 695 (1968)). <em>See also Bieber v. People, </em>856 P.2d 811, 815 (Colo.1993) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cThe doctrine of \u2018settled insanity\u2019 draws a distinction between voluntary intoxication, universally recognized as not constituting a defense, and \u2018insanity\u2019 arising from long-term use of intoxicants but separate from immediate intoxication.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Appellant argues the trial court erroneously ruled that the applicability of the \u201csettled insanity\u201d defense is limited to mental defects or diseases that are permanent in duration. He asserts that our decisions in <em>Herbin </em>and <em>Vann v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 304, 313 n. 3, 544 S.E.2d 879, 883 n. 3 (2001), \u201cimpl[y] that it is not the length or duration of the actual mental disease or defect induced by long-term alcohol/substance abuse, but <em>the nature and quality of its effect </em>upon the defendant\u2019s mental processes ...\u201d that is dispositive to determining whether an accused may present a \u201csettled insanity\u201d defense to the fact finder. (Emphasis in original). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u201cFrom its inception to the present, the settled insanity doctrine has been consistently characterized as a state of mind resulting from \u2018long-continued,\u2019 \u2018habitual,\u2019 \u2018prolonged,\u2019 or \u2018chronic\u2019 alcohol or drug abuse leading to a more or less permanent or \u2018fixed\u2019 state of insanity.\u201d <em>State v. Sexton, </em>904 A.2d 1092, 1102 (Vt.2006) (citations omitted). <em>See, e.g., </em>A. Levine, Note, <em>Denying the Settled Insanity Defense: Another Necessary Step in Dealing with Drug and Alcohol Abuse, </em>78 B. U. L.Rev. 75, 78 (1998) (\u201cThe long-term, consistent abuse of drugs or alcohol may result in permanent mental disorders that are symptomatically and organically similar to mental disorders caused by brain disease. Courts have labeled this condition as \u2018fixed\u2019 or \u2018settled\u2019 insanity, because the disorder remains even though the defendant is not under the influence of the intoxicants.\u201d); J. Dressler, <em>Understanding Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 24.05[B], at 329 (3d ed. 2001) (\u201cHabitual use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>intoxicants can result in permanent brain damage, resulting in a substance-induced mental disorder that persists, i.e., the disorder remains even when the actor is not under the influence of intoxicants.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">The underlying rationale for the \u201csettled insanity\u201d doctrine is generally explained as an acknowledgement of \u201cthe futility of punishment, since the defective mental state is permanent,\u201d or, more commonly, as a compassionate concession that at some point a person\u2019s earlier voluntary decisions become so temporally and \u201cmorally remote\u201d that the cause of the offense can reasonably be ascribed to the resulting insanity rather than the use of intoxicants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-6\"><em>Sexton, </em>904 A.2d at 1102 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Consistent with this characterization of the doctrine of \u201csettled insanity,\u201d our Supreme Court \u201chas repeatedly held that voluntary intoxication is not a defense unless it produces a permanent insanity in the defendant.\u201d <em>Downing v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 717, 722, 496 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1998). <em>See, e.g. White, </em>272 Va. at 626, 636 S.E.2d at 357 (\u201cWe adopted the common law distinction between temporary intoxication and permanent insanity long ago.\u201d); <em>Little, </em>163 Va. at 1024, 175 S.E. at 769 (\u201cVoluntary drunkenness, where it has not produced permanent insanity, is never an excuse for crime----\u201d); <em>Gills, </em>141 Va. at 450-51, 126 S.E. at 53 (same); <em>Boswell, </em>61 Va. (20 Gratt.) at 872 (\u201cIf permanent insanity be produced by habitual drunkenness, then, like any other insanity, it excuses an act which would be otherwise criminal.\u201d). Thus, it is well settled that, in order to present a \u201csettled insanity\u201d defense in Virginia, an accused must make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that at the time of the offense he (1) suffered from a mental defect or disease of the mind, (2) that is traceable to long-term, chronic, and habitual alcohol or drug abuse, which (3) resulted in a permanent insanity as defined by Virginia law. <em>White, </em>272 Va. at 626, 636 S.E.2d at 357. Our decisions in <em>Herbin </em>and <em>Vann </em>do not deviate from this binding precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>In <em>Herbin, </em>we affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the appellant\u2019s proffered jury instructions on insanity because, \u201c[although [the] appellant produced evidence of long-term and severe drug abuse, he did not present any evidence that he was suffering from any mental disease as a result of this drug abuse.\u201d 28 Va.App. at 184, 508 S.E.2d at 281. Absent evidence that the appellant \u201cwas laboring under a diseased mind,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 188, 503 S.E.2d at 231, it was unnecessary for us to address the issue of whether the alleged mental defect or disease was permanent in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Similarly in <em>Vann, </em>we concluded that the trial court did not err in rejecting appellant\u2019s irresistible impulse defense because he did not present any expert testimony regarding his mental state at the time the offenses were committed. The appellant\u2019s failure to meet his burden of proving that his \u201cmental state met the appropriate legal definition of insanity at the time the offense was committed,\u201d 35 Va.App. at 313 n. 3, 544 S.E.2d at 883 n. 3 (citing <em>Gibson v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 412, 417, 219 S.E.2d 845, 849 (1975) (emphasis in original omitted)), rendered any discussion of the duration of his alleged mental defect or disease immaterial to our decision to affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u201c \u2018Faithful adherence to the doctrine of judicial restraint provides a fully adequate justification for deciding [ ] case[s] on the best and narrowest ground[s] available.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anzualda v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 764, 789-90, 607 S.E.2d 749, 762 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Air Courier Conference v. Am. Postal Workers Union, </em>498 U.S. 517, 531, 111 S.Ct. 913, 922, 112 L.Ed.2d 1125 (1991) (Stevens, J. concurring)). Discussion of whether Herbin\u2019s or Vann\u2019s alleged mental defects or diseases were permanent in nature was unnecessary to the holding in each case, and as such would have been dicta. <em>See Lofton Ridge, LLC v. Norfolk S. Ry., </em>268 Va. 377, 383, 601 S.E.2d 648, 651 (2004). The absence of such discussion, therefore, does not imply that we no longer adhere to the binding precedent established by the Supreme Court in <em>Boswell, Gills, Little, </em>and reaffirmed in <em>White. See Newman v. Newman, </em>42 Va.App. 557, 566, 593 S.E.2d 533, 538 (2004) <em>(en </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>banc) (\u201cDicta cannot \u2018serve as a source of binding authority in American jurisprudence/ \u201d (citation omitted)). Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s assertion that our holdings in <em>Herbin </em>and <em>Vann </em>changed the legal requirements of the \u201csettled insanity\u201d defense in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Appellant argues in the alternative that even if we affirm our ruling in <em>Downing, </em>that voluntary intoxication does not constitute an affirmative defense unless it produces a permanent insanity, the Supreme Court recently interpreted the \u201cpermanent\u201d requirement of \u201csettled insanity\u201d broadly to include intermittent episodes of insanity induced by chronic intoxication occurring over a significant period of time. Specifically, he contends the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>White </em>defined \u201cpermanent\u201d as requiring the accused to \u201c \u2018show that his long term and continued use of intoxicants produced a fixed and settled frenzy or insanity either permanent <em>or intermittent.\u2019 \u201d </em>272 Va. at 627, 636 S.E.2d at 357 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Kiley v. State, </em>860 So.2d 509, 511 n. 3 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Our reading of <em>White, </em>however, shows that appellant\u2019s argument is without merit. The permanency of the appellant\u2019s alleged insanity was not before the Court in <em>White. </em>Rather, the Court considered whether the appellant\u2019s proffered evidence of his cocaine abuse was sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>defense of insanity. In concluding that the appellant\u2019s daily use of cocaine for at least three months prior to his arrest did not \u201cdemonstrate long-term, chronic, and habitual abuse,\u201d 272 Va. at 629, 636 S.E.2d at 358, the Court held that \u201csettled insanity\u201d must \u201cbe produced over a significant period of time [to cause a mental disease],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 627, 636 S.E.2d at 357. To illustrate the principle that long-term, chronic, and habitual abuse was needed to cause mental disease, the Court cited multiple cases from other jurisdictions. The language in these citations, upon which appellant relies in support of his position that \u201csettled insanity\u201d may be \u201cintermittent,\u201d constitutes nothing more than dicta, and, therefore, these citations \u201cha[ve] no binding <em>stare decisis </em>effect.\u201d <em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Wilson, </em>46 Va.App. 500, 507, 619 S.E.2d 476, 479 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>(2005) (citing <em>Newman, </em>42 Va.App. at 566, 593 S.E.2d at 538). Consequently, we find nothing in <em>White </em>that indicates the Supreme Court intended to broaden the scope of the \u201csettled insanity\u201d defense to include \u201cintermittent\u201d mental disease, which it clearly rejected in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err, as a matter of law, in ruling that the defense of \u201csettled insanity\u201d is not available to an accused unless he can make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that he suffers from a mental defect or disease, traceable to long-term, chronic, and habitual alcohol or drug abuse, that is permanent in duration. As appellant conceded his insanity was not permanent, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by precluding him from presenting evidence to the jury in support of a \u201csettled insanity\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\n<em>B. Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Appellant next contends the trial court erroneously adopted the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed jury instructions, refusing his proffered instructions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> regarding the allocation of the burden of proof for his alternate insanity defense of involuntary intoxication. Specifically, he argues that Instruction No. 16, and by association Instruction Nos. 17, 19, and 20, unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to him regarding his lack of <em>mens rea. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u201cThe purpose of any jury instruction is to inform the jury of the law guiding their deliberations and verdict.\u201d <em>Keen v.

In order to be found not guilty on the ground of insanity due to involuntary intoxication, the defendant must prove by the greater weight of the evidence that he was insane due to involuntary intoxication as defined in Instruction No. 19 when the crimes were committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u201cIn Virginia, every man is presumed to be sane until the contrary is made to appear and when insanity is relied upon as a defense in a criminal prosecution, it must be proved by the defendant to the satisfaction of the jury.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 316, 322, 157 S.E.2d 185, 189-90 (1967). <em>See also Vann, </em>35 Va.App. at 312, 544 S.E.2d at 882 (\u201cThe burden of proving insanity rests on the individual asserting it as a defense.\u201d). The United States Supreme Court recently approved this allocation of the burden of persuasion with respect to the defense of insanity in <em>Clark v. Arizona, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2709, 165 L.Ed.2d 842 (2006). In <em>Clark, </em>the Court held that a state \u201cmay [choose to] place the burden of persuasion on a defendant to prove insanity as the applicable law defines it, whether by a prepon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>derance of the evidence or to some more convincing degree.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 126 S.Ct. at 2731. As Justice Rehnquist explained in his concurrence in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975), \u201cthe existence or nonexistence of legal insanity bears no necessary relationship to the existence or nonexistence of the required mental elements of [a] crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706, 95 S.Ct. at 1893. Therefore, allocating the burden of proof to an accused with respect to his insanity defense does \u201cnot effect an unconstitutional shift in the [] traditional burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of all necessary elements of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, Virginia\u2019s allocation of both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion with respect to the affirmative defense of insanity is constitutionally permissible, and we reject appellant\u2019s claim to the contrary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">As Instruction No. 16 is an accurate statement of law, we conclude the trial court did not err in refusing appellant\u2019s proffered instructions. <em>See Gaines, </em>39 Va.App. at 568, 574 S.E.2d at 778 (\u201c When granted instructions fully and fairly cover a principle of law, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing another instruction relating to the same legal principle.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Stockton v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 145, 314 S.E.2d 371, 384 (1984))).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\">. The record reflects appellant retired from the Navy in 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-9\">. Prior to returning to Virginia, a Florida court convicted appellant of two felonies in connection with his false identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b176-9\">. Appellant\u2019s proffered instructions A through E placed the burden of persuasion on the Commonwealth to prove his sanity. For example, proffered Instruction No. B provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">All persons are presumed sane. However, if the evidence causes you to have a reasonable doubt concerning the defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offenses, then the presumption of sanity vanishes and the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was sane at the time of the offense.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b178-9\">. Appellant conceded at oral argument that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Clark </em>governed our resolution of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
