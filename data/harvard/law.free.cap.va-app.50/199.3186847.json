Hoffman, t/a Hoffman Construction Company (\u201cHoffman\u201d), and the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund (\u201cthe Fund\u201d) appeal the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission\u2019s award of temporary total disability benefits to James M. Carter, Jr. (\u201cCarter\u201d). Hoffman and the Fund argue that (1) Hoffman is not subject to the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) because it regularly employs fewer than three employees, (2) Carter did not sustain a compensable injury by accident, and (3) Carter is not disabled. For the following reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s findings that Hoffman was subject to the Act and that Carter sustained a compensable injury by accident, but we reverse the commission\u2019s finding that Carter suffered a continuing disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Carter, the party prevailing below. <em>See R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). So viewed, the evidence established the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>A. <em>Carter\u2019s Exposure to Dust</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">On June 30, 2005, Carter was performing demolition work on plaster walls inside a house in Weems, Virginia. Carter worked as a laborer and carpenter\u2019s apprentice for Hoffman at the time and had done so for approximately one year. One window and at least two doors were open, and a fan was operating as well.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, when Carter and his coworker Barry Fletcher (\u201cFletcher\u201d) began to tear down the walls, \u201cit got really cloudy in [the house] from the dust,\u201d because \u201cthe stuff was really thick in the air.\u201d Although respiratory masks were available, Carter chose not to wear one. After working three to four hours, Carter noticed \u201ca lot of dust and stuff in [his] nostrils[,]\u201d and he began \u201ccoughing the stuff up pretty much.\u201d The following day, Carter continued \u201ccoughing up [ ] milky phlegm[,]\u201d and left work at 1:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Carter was unable to speak with his doctor\u2019s office until the following Tuesday, when he learned that they would require an $85 payment for a consultation. Unable to make this payment, Carter went to the emergency room at Rappahannock General Hospital on July 6, 2005, where he saw Dr. Virginia Gale (\u201cGale\u201d). Gale noted a normal chest x-ray, prescribed medications, and reported that Carter had experienced \u201cshortness of breath and coughing for the last five days\u201d after being exposed to plaster walls and asbestos.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gale also noted that Carter had coughed up sputum, sometimes tinged with blood, for the past several days and that Carter experienced chest pains, which worsened when Carter breathed or coughed. Gale attributed Carter\u2019s condition to \u201cchemical inhalation,\u201d and recommended that he take five days off work.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Carter again saw Gale on July 13, 2005. Gale noted a second normal chest x-ray, advised Carter to take an additional five days off from work, and suggested Carter follow up by seeing his family doctor, as well as a pulmonary consultant.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Carter next sought treatment at the Northern Neck Free Health Clinic (\u201cthe Clinic\u201d) on July 21, 2005. Carter again complained of a severe cough, stating that he sometimes coughed up blood-tinged phlegm. The treating physician noted exposure to asbestos, plaster, and sheet rock, and diagnosed chemical pneumonitis. Feeling no improvement, Carter returned to the Clinic on August 4, 2005. The Clinic excused Carter from work throughout this period. The Clinic continued to excuse Carter from work until a subsequent visit on May 2, 2006, in which Clinic personnel recommended in writing: \u201cNo work until condition resolves (may be permanent).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Carter\u2019s medical records last indicate that he received a medical examination on August 23, 2005. The last entry in Carter\u2019s records was made on August 24, 2005, indicating that Clinic staff reviewed Carter\u2019s records on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Nurse practitioner Christina Slavin (\u201cSlavin\u2019\u2019) of the Clinic stated on a questionnaire dated December 12, 2005 that Carter\u2019s respiratory condition was \u201cpossibly\u201d caused by the incident on June 30, 2005, but a pulmonary consultation was necessary to be certain.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She also confirmed his inability to work. Gale opined in a written statement dated February 17, 2006, that \u201cfrom all of the information presented to [her], it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>certainly seems that [Carter\u2019s] condition was caused by the work situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Hoffman hired a physician named Dr. Michael D. Mandel (\u201cMandel\u201d) to review Carter\u2019s medical records and provide a written opinion of Carter\u2019s condition. Mandel concluded that it was impossible to diagnose Carter with chemical pneumonitis based on the information available to his treating physicians at the time. Mandel stated that a pulmonologist would need to perform more tests in order to properly make this diagnosis. Mandel further concluded that based on Carter\u2019s normal chest x-rays, and the negative results of other tests done in the emergency room, Carter in fact did <em>not </em>have chemical pneumonitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">B. <em>Hoffman\u2019s Employment Practice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Dennis Bebe (\u201cBebe\u201d) was Carter\u2019s supervisor at the Weems job site on June 30, 2005, and Carter worked with Bebe \u201cevery day from the time [he] began.\u201d Hoffman was also present at the site on most days during Carter\u2019s employment. Martin Ward (\u201cWard\u201d), another carpenter\u2019s helper, worked for Hoffman as an employee during the month of June 2005. During Ward\u2019s employment, Hoffman hired three subcontractors, \u201cso it was a total of [ ] eight people.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the time of the incident on June 30, 2005, Fletcher, Carter\u2019s coworker, had worked for Hoffman for approximately eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Bebe described himself as a freelance carpenter who frequently works for Hoffman Construction. Hoffman described Bebe as an independent contractor, not his employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">C. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Carter filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with the commission. Hoffman filed numerous defenses, including: (1) Hoffman was not subject to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because it did not regularly employ three or more individuals, (2) Carter did not sustain a compensable injury by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>accident, and (3) Carter was not disabled. Because Hoffman did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance, the Fund joined with Hoffman and asserted the same defenses against Carter. The presiding deputy commissioner rejected Hoffman and the Fund\u2019s defenses, and awarded Carter temporary total disability benefits from July 6, 2005 through February 28, 2006, and beginning May 2, 2006, continuing until Carter\u2019s condition improves. The full commission, by opinion dated October 20, 2006, affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision. Hoffman and the Fund now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Hoffman and the Fund argue, as they did to the commission, that (1) Hoffman is not subject to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because it does not regularly keep three or more employees in its service, (2) Carter did not sustain a compensable injury by accident, and (3) Carter is not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In reviewing a judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, we \u201c \u2018determine whether credible evidence supports the Commission\u2019s finding ... and, if such evidence exists, [we] sustain the finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perry v. Delisle, </em>46 Va.App. 57, 63-64, 615 S.E.2d 492, 495 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Celanese Fibers Co. v. Johnson, </em>229 Va. 117, 121, 326 S.E.2d 687, 690 (1985)) (omission in original). As a result, \u201cwe do not judge the credibility of witnesses or weigh the evidence on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 615 S.E.2d at 495 (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, we are bound by the commission\u2019s factual findings supported by credible evidence, despite the fact that there may be evidence to support a contrary finding. <em>See Watkins v. Halco Eng\u2019g. Inc., </em>225 Va. 97, 101, 300 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">A. <em>Hoffman\u2019s Employees Regularly in Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Hoffman and the Fund first argue that Hoffman is not subject to the Act because Hoffman does not regularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>keep three or more employees in its service.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">All employers and employees in Virginia are \u201cconclusively presumed to have accepted the provisions of [the Act].\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-300(A). Excluded from this presumption, however, are \u201c[e]mployees of any person, firm, or private corporation ... that has regularly in service less than three employees in the same business within this Commonwealth____\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101. In other words, if an employer has three or more employees \u201cregularly in service,\u201d it is subject to the Act and responsible for providing workers\u2019 compensation benefits to qualifying employees. If an employer has fewer than three employees \u201cregularly in service,\u201d it is not subject to the Act and has no obligation to provide its employees with workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, an employer can defeat a claim for workers\u2019 compensation if it is able to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it \u201chas regularly in service\u201d fewer than three employees in Virginia. <em>Craddock Moving &amp; Storage Co. v. Settles, </em>16 Va.App. 1, 3, 427 S.E.2d 428, 430 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">However, we have held that \u201can employer [who] regularly employs three or more persons to carry out the established mode of performing the work of the business, [] should remain subject to the provisions of the Act even if ... the number of his employees temporarily falls below three.\u201d <em>Cotman v. Green, 4 </em>Va.App. 256, 259, 356 S.E.2d 447, 449 (1987). An employer is considered to have \u201cregularly in service\u201d three or more employees \u201cif the recurring periods of employing\u201d three individuals is \u201cthe rule and not the exception.\u201d <em>Osborne v. Forner, </em>36 Va.App. 91, 96, 548 S.E.2d 270, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>272-73 (2001). In determining whether an employer is subject to the Act, the commission must examine \u201c[t]he number of persons used to carry out the established mode of performing the work of the business[,]\u201d and focus ultimately on \u201cthe character of the business\u201d rather than \u201cthe character of the employment relationship.\u201d <em>Cotman, </em>4 Va.App. at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Thus, in order to defend itself from a claim on the grounds that it is not subject to the Act, an employer must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) it had fewer than three employees \u201cregularly in service\u201d in Virginia at the time of the alleged incident, and (2) at the time of the alleged incident, the employer\u2019s \u201cestablished mode of performing business\u201d regularly required fewer than three employees. <em>Perry, </em>46 Va.App. at 65, 615 S.E.2d at 496. This requirement \u201cavoids adverse effects from unusual, temporary conditions[,]\u201d which could make \u201cemployer\u2019s status [] fluctuate between being subject to the Act and exempt from the Act.\u201d <em>Cotman, </em>4 Va.App. at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 448-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Whether an employer regularly employs fewer than three employees is a factual determination made by the commission. <em>See Bass v. City of Richmond Police Dept., </em>258 Va. 103, 114, 515 S.E.2d 557, 563 (1999). Likewise, whether an employer\u2019s \u201cestablished mode of business\u201d requires three or more employees is a question of fact to which we give great deference on appeal. <em>See Osborne, </em>36 Va.App. at 97, 548 S.E.2d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Here, the commission found that Hoffman proved neither that he regularly kept fewer than three employees in his service, nor that the nature of his business entailed the service of fewer than three employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record contains credible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>evidence that supports the commission\u2019s findings. Hoffman admitted that he had two employees on June 30, 2005. Earlier that month, when Ward was working, Hoffman had three employees. Ward testified that during his brief employment at Hoffman, Hoffman hired three subcontractors, \u201cso it was a total of [] eight people.\u201d Because employees of Hoffman\u2019s subcontractors are treated the same as Hoffman\u2019s own employees under the Act, <em>see Smith v. Weber, </em>3 Va.App. 379, 381, 350 S.E.2d 213, 214 (1986), the burden rested with Hoffman to prove the number of employees the subcontractors employed. Hoffman produced no evidence in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The record also contains no evidence that Hoffman\u2019s business practices had changed after Carter\u2019s injury so that the business could function with fewer than three employees. The commission found that Hoffman did not rebut Carter\u2019s evidence, and thus did not meet his burden of proof. Because the record contains credible evidence supporting the commission\u2019s determination, we hold that the commission did not err in finding Hoffman subject to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">B. <em>Injury By Accident</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Hoffman and the Fund next argue that the commission erred by finding that Carter sustained an \u201cinjury by accident,\u201d which the Act requires for Carter to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-300(A). In order to prove an injury by accident, Carter must prove: \u201c(1) an identifiable incident; (2) that occurs at some reasonably definite time; (3) an obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body; and (4) a causal connection between the incident and the bodily change.\u201d <em>Chesterfield County v. Dunn, </em>9 Va.App. 475, 476, 389 S.E.2d 180, 181 (1990). Whether Carter sustained an injury by accident is an issue of fact. <em>See Grayson Sch. Bd. v. Cornett, </em>39 Va.App. 279, 288, 572 S.E.2d 505, 510 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">1. An Identifiable Incident and Sudden Structural or Mechanical Change</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The Act requires proof of \u201can identifiable incident or sudden precipitating event [that results] in an obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>sudden mechanical or structural change in the body.\u201d <em>Morris v. Morris, </em>288 Va. 578, 589, 385 S.E.2d 858, 865 (1989). In contrast, \u201ca gradually incurred injury is not an injury by accident within the meaning of the Act.\u201d <em>Dollar General Store v. Cridlin, </em>22 Va.App. 171, 175, 468 S.E.2d 152, 154 (1996) (citing <em>Middlekauff v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>247 Va. 150, 154, 439 S.E.2d 394, 397 (1994)). \u201cThough an injury by accident must be \u2018bounded with rigid temporal precision,\u2019 ... an injury need not occur within a specific number of seconds or minutes ... but instead, must occur within a \u2018reasonably definite time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brown v. Caporaletti, </em>12 Va.App. 242, 243-44, 402 S.E.2d 709, 710 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In <em>Southern Express v. Green, </em>257 Va. 181, 509 S.E.2d 836 (1999), a case factually similar to this one, the Supreme Court of Virginia reiterated the parameters of \u201cinjury by accident.\u201d In that case, the claimant suffered from chilblains<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> after spending over four hours in a walk-in cooler of the convenience store in which she worked. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 509 S.E.2d at 837. The Supreme Court held that this four-hour exposure to the cold constituted an identifiable incident or event \u201cbounded by rigid temporal precision,\u201d and not an injury resulting from \u201crepetitive trauma ... or [ ] cumulative event[s,]\u201d as the employer argued. <em>Id. </em>at 189, 509 S.E.2d at 840-41 (citations omitted). Because the claimant\u2019s condition was not an \u201c \u2018injury of gradual growth ... caused by the cumulative effect of many acts done or many exposures to conditions prevalent in the work,\u2019 \u201d the Supreme Court held that the claimant\u2019s condition was related to an \u201cidentifiable incident\u201d sufficient to prove an injury by accident. <em>Id. </em>at 189, 509 S.E.2d at 841 (quoting <em>Aistrop v. Blue Diamond Coal Co., Inc., </em>181 Va. 287, 293, 24 S.E.2d 546, 548 (1943)).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In the present case, Carter testified that he worked three to four hours when he noticed \u201ca lot of dust and stuff in [his] nostrils!,]\u201d and he began \u201ccoughing the stuff up pretty much.\u201d He continued coughing and left work early the next day, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>went to a physician at the first available opportunity. Therefore, we hold that the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that Carter\u2019s exposure to plaster dust was \u201cbounded by rigid temporal precision,\u201d and thus constituted \u201can identifiable incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">During his first consultation with Dr. Gale, Carter indicated that he was coughing up \u201cmilky phlegm,\u201d and he complained of shortness of breath and chest pains when he breathed or coughed. Based on his symptoms, Gale diagnosed Carter with chemical inhalation. Mandel\u2019s opinion merely rules out the possibility that Carter had contracted chemical <em>pneumonitis. </em>It does not rule out the possibility that Carter may have sustained some other form of respiratory injury. Moreover, we have never held that a claimant was required to prove a particular type of injury or diagnosis, <em>see Dollar General Store, </em>22 Va.App. at 177, 468 S.E.2d at 154, and the record contains sufficient evidence from which the commission could find that Carter suffered a sudden structural or mechanical change in his body, specifically, a respiratory injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">2. Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Hoffman and the Fund next argue that the evidence did not establish a causal connection between Carter\u2019s exposure to dust and his physical condition. Carter bore the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, a causal connection between the work-related incident and the bodily change. <em>See Dunn, </em>9 Va.App. at 476, 389 S.E.2d at 181. Thus, Carter was required to prove that his condition resulted from his on-the-job exposure to the dust.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of a claimant may [ ] be considered in determining causation, especially where the medical testimony is inconclusive.\u201d <em>Dollar General Store, </em>22 Va.App. at 176, 468 S.E.2d at 154. However, \u201c[w]henever a physician\u2019s diagnosis flows from an assumption that rests upon a faulty premise, such as misinformation provided by a claimant, the commission may refuse, and often will be required to refuse, to attribute any weight to that opinion.\u201d <em>Sneed v. Morengo, Inc., </em>19 Va.App. 199, 205, 450 S.E.2d 167, 171 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Here, Hoffman and the Fund argue that Dr. Gale\u2019s medical opinion stemmed from inaccurate information provided by Carter. Gale\u2019s reports indicate that Carter was exposed to asbestos and insulation. Because the deputy commissioner specifically found that Carter did not prove he was exposed to these substances, Hoffman and the Fund reason that the commission should not have considered Gale\u2019s report as evidence of causation. However, nothing in Gale\u2019s report indicates that exposure to asbestos or insulation was the controlling factor in her diagnosis. Gale\u2019s opinion was that Carter had experienced \u201cchemical inhalation,\u201d not \u201casbestos inhalation\u201d or \u201cinsulation inhalation,\u201d and she mentions Carter\u2019s exposure to plaster dust on more than one occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Hoffman and the Fund also argue that Dr. Gale\u2019s opinion, in which she states that, \u201cfrom all of the information presented to [her], it certainly seems that [Carter\u2019s] condition was caused by the work situation[,]\u201d is too indefinite to support the finding that Carter\u2019s condition was caused by his exposure to the plaster dust. Furthermore, Hoffman and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Fund note that Slavin stated that Carter\u2019s condition was only \u201cpossibly\u201d caused by his exposure to dust. As finder of fact, the commission is entitled to weigh the evidence, and give more weight to Gale\u2019s opinion. In our view, Gale\u2019s statement that it \u201ccertainly seems\u201d that Carter\u2019s condition was related to his exposure to dust is sufficient to prove causation by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the record contains credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding that Carter suffered an \u201cinjury by accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">C. <em>Disability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Hoffman and the Fund\u2019s final argument on appeal is that the commission erred in finding that Carter suffered a continuing disability.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c[A] party seeking [workers\u2019] compensation bears the burden of proving his disability and the periods of that disability.\u201d <em>Marshall Erdman &amp; Assocs. v. Loehr, </em>24 Va.App. 670, 679, 485 S.E.2d 145, 149-50 (1997). Furthermore, \u201c[t]here is no presumption in the law that once a disability has been established, a claimant will be assumed to remain disabled for an indefinite period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679, 485 S.E.2d at 149. Whether Carter suffered a continuing disability is also a question of fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">In <em>Loehr, </em>the claimant presented to the commission a letter from his treating physician. The letter was ten months old at the time of his hearing before the deputy commissioner and seventeen months old at the time of his hearing before the full commission. The letter indicated that the claimant\u2019s physician had previously placed him on light duty, restricting the claimant\u2019s lifting to forty pounds or less. It also stated that, as the claimant\u2019s condition improved, \u201c[the physician] would progress [the claimant] to full duties.\u201d Nothing in the letter indicated the occasion upon which the physician had last treated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>claimant, how long the physician expected the disability to continue, or when, if ever, the claimant would receive additional medical evaluation. <em>Id. </em>at 680, 485 S.E.2d at 150. Because the record lacked evidence of a continuing disability and contained credible evidence that the claimant was expected to return to full duties, we affirmed the commission\u2019s finding that the claimant was not entitled to continuing disability benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Here, Carter presented a slip from the Clinic that read: \u201c[n]o work until condition resolves (may be permanent).\u201d Unlike the letter submitted in <em>Loehr, </em>this slip does not suggest that Carter is expected to recover. However, Carter\u2019s slip is similar to the letter submitted in <em>Loehr </em>in that it did not give any estimate as to how long Carter\u2019s condition was expected to continue, other than the vague assertion that it \u201cmay be permanent.\u201d Likewise, the slip did not indicate when, if ever, Carter would undergo his next medical examination. Furthermore, the record contains no evidence that Clinic personnel examined Carter or even reviewed his medical records after August 24, 2005, the date of the final entry in Carter\u2019s medical charts. The slip was purportedly issued by Clinic personnel on May 2, 2006, almost nine months after Carter\u2019s last recorded examination. The hearing before the deputy commissioner did not occur until June 20, 2006, and the full commission review did not take place until approximately four months later. The only additional evidence Carter presented in this regard was his own testimony that no doctor had released him to light duty work, which is essentially a restatement of the information contained in the disability slips. Based on our review of the record, we hold that there is no credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding of disability from May 2, 2006 and continuing. Accordingly, we reverse the commission on this issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the commission\u2019s findings that Hoffman is subject to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and that Carter sustained an \u201cinjury by accident.\u201d However, we reverse the commission\u2019s finding that Carter suffered a continuing disability.

The commission reached this decision under the rationale that Hoffman\u2019s normal business practice was to keep three employees and a number of statutory employees in its service. Because the commission had found Hoffman subject to the Act without discussing Bebe, the commission found it unnecessary to decide whether Bebe was an employee of Hoffman; it considered the question moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">.
