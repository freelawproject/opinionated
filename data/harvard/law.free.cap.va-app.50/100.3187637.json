Father argues that the Norfolk Circuit Court erred 1). \u201cby not extending full faith and credit to the Minnesota judgment that concluded Virginia had exclusive jurisdiction over the child custody proceedings between the parties,\u201d 2). \u201cin declining to exercise jurisdiction over the issue of custody, visitation and support of the parties\u2019 children,\u201d and 3). \u201cin conditioning its decline of jurisdiction upon initiation of a child custody proceeding in the White Earth Tribal Court.\u201d Finding father\u2019s arguments without merit, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to decline jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Mother and father lived in Norfolk with three of their children throughout most of 2003. At the beginning of November 2003, mother left Virginia and went to live on the White Earth Band of Ojibwe reservation located within Minnesota.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mother is a member of this tribe, and, therefore, the children have been declared tribal members. Mother and the children apparently have remained on the reservation since November 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Father filed petitions in the Norfolk Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (Norfolk JDR Court) requesting custody of the children. The Norfolk JDR Court entered a temporary custody order giving custody of the children to father on December 1, 2003. On January 13, 2004, the Norfolk JDR Court denied and dismissed father\u2019s petition, vacated and terminated the temporary order, and removed the matter from the docket. That action was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">On December 4, 2003, White Earth Indian Child Welfare filed an Emergency Removal and Hold petition with the White Earth Band of Ojibwe Children\u2019s Court (White Earth Court), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>asking that temporary physical custody of the children be given to the maternal grandparents. The White Earth Court entered an order on December 22, 2003, making the children temporary wards of that court and giving physical custody of the children to the maternal grandparents. On January 23, 2004, the White Earth Court entered another order, retaining the children as wards of the tribal court, but returning them to mother\u2019s care, and ordering that father have no contact with the children, mother, or the grandparents. The White Earth Court order states that father \u201cwill need to petition this court for visitation\u201d with the children. That order was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On May 4, 2005, mother filed for divorce in a Minnesota state court. Father argued in those proceedings that the Minnesota courts did not have jurisdiction to determine child custody issues between these parties, contending that the Virginia courts had \u201cexclusive and continuing jurisdiction\u201d and, alternatively, that Minnesota should decline to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to its Statute \u00a7 518D.208, based on mother\u2019s \u201cabsconding\u201d with the children from Virginia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Minnesota Court found that the Norfolk JDR Court order of January 13, 2004, that dismissed father\u2019s petition for custody was \u201cunclear\u201d regarding whether that court intended \u201cto decline further jurisdiction over child custody.\u201d The Minnesota Court concluded that \u201c[ajbsent a decline of jurisdiction by that jurisdiction, the Commonwealth of Virginia has continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>jurisdiction over the issue of child custody in this matter.\u201d The Minnesota Court also found that both Minnesota and Virginia would be inconvenient forums for any custody litigation, but that mother\u2019s \u201cconduct is sufficient to warrant her bearing the burden in this matter.\u201d The Minnesota Court then refused to exercise jurisdiction over child custody issues \u201c[ajbsent a decline of jurisdiction\u201d by the Virginia courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Father then filed new petitions for custody of the children in the Norfolk JDR Court. On June 1, 2006, that court again declined to exercise jurisdiction over this matter. Father appealed the Norfolk JDR Court\u2019s decision to the Norfolk Circuit Court. On September 6, 2006, the Norfolk Circuit Court entered an order declining to exercise jurisdiction over custody of the children. The Norfolk Circuit Court found \u201cthe best interests of the children dictate that the custody issue be resolved by the White Earth Tribal Court. That Court has access to the most current information concerning their welfare and needs, and it is also the most convenient forum in which this issue can be resolved.\u201d The Norfolk Circuit Court also noted that father should initiate a custody proceeding in the White Earth Tribal Court within sixty days of entry of the Norfolk Circuit Court order. This September 6, 2006 order is the subject of this appeal by father.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Appellant\u2019s arguments are interconnected. Essentially, he argues that, because Virginia entered the first order affecting custody of the children, Virginia retained exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over their custody pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-146.13(A). He contends that the Minnesota Court agreed that Virginia still has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction; therefore, the Norfolk Circuit Court should have given foil faith and credit to that Minnesota Court finding and should have exercised jurisdiction over this issue. He also argues that the White Earth Court is not an appropriate forum as that court does not have jurisdiction over non-Native American petitioners. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>We need not determine whether Virginia still has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the custody of these children, either under Code \u00a7 20-146.13<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or under the principles of full faith and credit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even assuming that Virginia has jurisdiction over the custody of these children, either under the Code or by application of full faith and credit to the Minnesota order, appellant\u2019s argument fails because he misconstrues the ruling of the Minnesota Court and misunderstands Code \u00a7 20-146.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">First, the Minnesota Court explicitly found that <em>\u201c[ajbsent a decline of jurisdiction </em>by that jurisdiction, the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>of Virginia has continuing jurisdiction over the issue of child custody in this matter.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This holding, if binding on the Virginia courts, does not preclude the Norfolk courts from declining jurisdiction over custody. In fact, the order explicitly notes that the Virginia courts can decline jurisdiction. In short, even if the Minnesota order were binding on Virginia courts, that order by its explicit wording allows Virginia to decline jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Second, the Norfolk Circuit Court order is consistent with the Minnesota decree as the holding of the Minnesota Court\u2014that Virginia has continuing jurisdiction\u2014certainly also allows the Virginia courts to decline to exercise that jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-146.18. Code \u00a7 20-146.18 permits a Virginia court to decline the exercise of its jurisdiction over a child custody matter such as the one before us. Therefore, even if Virginia has jurisdiction over this custody case, a court can refuse to exercise that jurisdiction \u201cif it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is a more appropriate forum.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.18 (footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Code \u00a7 20-146.18(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this Commonwealth shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to present evidence and shall consider all relevant factors, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">1. Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">2. The length of time the child has resided outside this Commonwealth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>3. The distance between the court in this Commonwealth and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">4. The relative financial circumstances of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">5. Any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">6. The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">7. The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">8. The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">When reviewing a determination made pursuant to this section, we consider whether the trial court abused its discretion in making its ruling. <em>See Middleton v. Middleton, </em>227 Va. 82, 96, 314 S.E.2d 362, 369 (1984) (applying the abuse of discretion standard); <em>Mubarak v. Mubarak, </em>14 Va.App. 616, 619, 420 S.E.2d 225, 227 (1992) (discussing <em>Middleton). </em>We find no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">The evidence is clear that the children have been out of Virginia for several years, living over 1,000 miles from Norfolk. Mother and the maternal grandparents are within the jurisdiction of the White Earth Court. The Virginia courts have no outstanding order determining custody of these children, whereas the White Earth Court issued the only existing order relating to custody of these children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mother did initial<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ly take the children to the White Earth reservation, but she did not hide them there. Father has known where the children are. He did not appeal the 2004 decisions of the Norfolk JDR Court and the White Earth Court. Neither party has significant financial resources. Although there may be some witnesses in Virginia who can testify about the children\u2019s past, all of the current information regarding their care, education, relationships, and other matters is located in and around the White Earth reservation. In addition, the Norfolk Circuit Court consulted a judge of the White Earth Court regarding these children. Based on this information, we cannot find that the Norfolk Circuit Court abused its discretion in refusing to exercise its alleged jurisdiction over these custody matters.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Finally, father argues in support of his third Question Presented that the Norfolk Circuit Court should not have deferred to the White Earth Court because the tribal court \u201chas no jurisdiction over [father], who is not a member of the tribe nor does he reside within the exterior boundaries of the reservation.\u201d This argument is defaulted for several reasons. First, father did not raise this specific issue before the Norfolk Circuit Court. Although he endorsed the final Norfolk Circuit Court order \u201cSEEN AND OBJECTED TO,\u201d we have consistently held that such an objection is insufficient to preserve a specific argument absent some indication in the record that the specific objection was made. <em>See Herring v. Herring, </em>33 Va.App. 281, 286, 532 S.E.2d 923, 927 (2000) (\u201cOrdinarily, endorsement of an order \u2018Seen and objected to\u2019 is not specific enough to meet the requirements of Rule 5A:18 because it does not sufficiently alert the trial court to the claimed error.\u201d). We find no specific discussion of this point before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Norfolk Circuit Court. Therefore, father did not preserve this argument for appeal. Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Furthermore, father fails to comply with Rule 5A:20(d), which requires that a party present on brief the legal principles and relevant authority for each question presented. Father presents no authority to support his position that the White Earth Court can exercise jurisdiction only over tribal members or people residing within the reservation. Father refers to the White Earth Band of Ojibwe Child/Family Protection Code, Chapter II, \u00a7 1, but that section allows the tribal court to exercise jurisdiction over \u201cfamily [that] may wish to make itself subject to the jurisdiction of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe\u2019s Children\u2019s Court.\u201d Father presents this Court with nothing that suggests he cannot petition the White Earth Court for custody of his children. In fact, the White Earth Court noted in its January 23, 2004 order that father \u201cneed[ed] to petition this court for visitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">We find that the Norfolk Circuit Court acted entirely within its authority when it declined to exercise jurisdiction over the custody petition filed by father. That court did not abuse its discretion when it deferred to the authority of the White Earth Court. We, therefore, affirm the Norfolk Circuit Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-9\">. Mother was pregnant in November of 2003. She gave birth to a fourth child after leaving Virginia. Although this child has never been in Virginia, no party has questioned the Commonwealth\u2019s jurisdiction to determine this child\u2019s custody. Given our findings here, we will not address jurisdiction over her custody separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\">.

Code \u00a7 20-146.13(A); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.38 (listing the purposes of the Act); <em>see also Middleton v. Middleton, 227 </em>Va. 82, 99, 314 S.E.2d 362, 371 (1984) (noting that the form of an order is relevant when deciding whether a court made an initial child custody determination as defined by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), the predecessor to the UCCJEA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\">.
