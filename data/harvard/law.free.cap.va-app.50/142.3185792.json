BEALES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">Anselmo M. Rozario (appellant) was convicted by the Chesterfield County Circuit Court, sitting as the fact finder, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>contempt of court under Code \u00a7 18.2-456.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that the trial court should not have considered the results of an Alcosensor test as evidence that he appeared intoxicated before the trial court. He also argues that, if the Alcosensor test results were not admissible, then the evidence was insufficient to convict him of contempt. A panel of this Court in a memorandum opinion found the evidence was insufficient to convict appellant of contempt. <em>Rozario v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 1433-05-2 (Va.Ct.App. Nov. 14, 2006). The Commonwealth petitioned for review of this case <em>en banc, </em>which was granted, and we stayed the mandate of the panel. After consideration by the full Court and for the reasons stated herein, we now affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">On February 7, 2005, appellant appeared in the General District Court for Chesterfield County on a traffic offense. Based on appellant\u2019s bloodshot eyes and the odor of alcohol emanating from him, the general district court judge asked the bailiff to take appellant and have him undergo an Alcosensor test, which came back with a reading of .107% blood alcohol content (BAC). The general district court convicted appellant of contempt pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-456.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Appellant appealed the conviction to the Chesterfield Circuit Court. The general district court, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-459,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> submitted to the circuit court a \u201ccertificate of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>conviction and the particular circumstances of the offense\u201d with the record from the general district court. The certificate read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">On February 7, 2005 while holding traffic court, I noticed Mr. Anselmo Rozario when he appeared in front of me with bloodshot eyes and an odor of alcohol about him. I had my deputy test him and the reading was .10. I then gave him ten days in jail for Summary Contempt of Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The Commonwealth introduced this certificate and rested its case. Appellant then introduced the Alcosensor certificate, showing the .107 BAC results of the Alcosensor test.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The circuit court found appellant was in contempt of the general district court on February 7, 2005, and sentenced him to ten days in jail with five days of that sentence suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">THE ALCOSENSOR RESULTS</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">First, appellant asks this Court to find that the trial court inappropriately considered the results of the Alcosensor test. We find the trial court properly considered the Alcosensor results.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Appellant did not object to the admission of the general district court certificate filed pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-459, which referred to the Alcosensor test. Appellant himself introduced the Alcosensor certificate. In addition, he did not ask that the trial court limit its consideration of the Alcosensor certificate when he introduced the document. Appellant cannot ask for the admission of evidence and then complain when the trial court considers it. <em>See Billips v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 278, 295, 630 S.E.2d 340, 348 (2006) (\u201cIt is well settled in Virginia that an appellate court will not \u2018notice error [that] has been invited by the party seeking to take advantage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>thereof on appeal.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 399, 400, 177 S.E.2d 637, 638 (1970))).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">As appellant introduced the Alcosensor certificate himself (without asking the trial court to limit its consideration of the document) and he did not object to the introduction of the certificate from the general district court, we find the trial court did not err in considering the results of the Alcosensor test.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">SUFFICIENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Appellant\u2019s second Question Presented asks, <em>\u201cIn the absence of evidence of the results of the chemical test for blood alcohol content, </em>was the information contained in [the court\u2019s] Statement of Facts sufficient to support the Circuit Court\u2019s finding of guilt?\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The trial court did not err in considering the evidence placed before it, as we discussed <em>supra. </em>Therefore, because the results of the chemical test for blood alcohol content were properly admitted and considered by the trial court, appellant\u2019s sufficiency argument is moot as the argument\u2019s very premise\u2014that the Alcosensor results were admitted in error\u2014 is untrue. <em>See, e.g., Midkiff v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 1, 3 n. *, 286 S.E.2d 150, 151 n. * (1982) (explaining that Midkiffs constitutional argument was premised on a finding that good faith was not an element of Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1; therefore, as the Court found good faith was an element of that statute, his constitutional argument was moot). We cannot consider moot arguments on appeal, <em>see Commonwealth v. Harley, </em>256 Va. 216, 219-20, 504 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1998) (noting that appellate courts do not consider moot issues), and so we do not address appellant\u2019s sufficiency question.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">We find the trial court did not err in considering the Alcosensor evidence. The remaining question is moot. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Therefore, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-456 reads, in pertinent part, \"The courts and judges may issue attachments for contempt, and punish them summarily, only in the cases following: (1) Misbehavior in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-9\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-459 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">Any person sentenced to pay a fine, or to confinement, under \u00a7 18.2-458, may appeal therefrom to the circuit court of the county or city in which the sentence was pronounced.... If such appeal be taken, a certificate of the conviction and the particular circumstances of the offense, ... shall forthwith be transmitted by the sentencing judge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the clerk of such circuit court, who shall immediately deliver the same to the judge thereof. Such judge may hear the case upon the certificate and any legal testimony adduced on either side, and make such order therein as may seem to him proper.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b191-5\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AgT\">with whom ELDER and CLEMENTS, JJ., join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Anselmo M. Rozario appealed to the circuit court from an order entered by a judge of the general district court convicting him of summary contempt and imposing a sentence of ten days in jail. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-456, 18.2-458, and 18.2-459 (authorizing district court judges to punish contempt and providing that such convictions can be appealed to circuit court). Rozario contends the circuit court judge erred in ruling that (1) the district court judge properly relied upon the results of an Alcosensor testing device and (2) the evidence was sufficient to prove an act of contempt. I would hold the district court judge erred in relying on the Alcosensor test results and the evidence was insufficient to prove contempt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">I disagree with the majority opinion\u2019s ruling that Rozario invited the error that he now complains of by introducing into evidence in the circuit court the Alcosensor Worksheet, which the district court judge relied upon and put into the district court file when he convicted Rozario of summary contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">In the circuit court, the trial judge considered Rozario\u2019s appeal at a trial without a jury. In a fairly perfunctory proceeding, the prosecutor offered as evidence a document styled \u201cStatement of Facts,\u201d which the circuit court judge apparently accepted as \u201ca certificate of the conviction and the particular circumstances of the offense\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-459. The document, which was signed by the district court judge, reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">Statement of Facts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">On February 7, 2005[,] while holding traffic court, I noticed Mr. Anselmo Rozario when he appeared in front of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>me with bloodshot eyes and an odor of alcohol about him. I had my deputy test him and the reading was .10. I then gave him ten days in jail for summary contempt of court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arb\">The prosecutor offered no other evidence in his case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In a motion to strike the evidence for insufficiency, Rozario\u2019s attorney argued that nothing in the district court judge\u2019s statement indicates Rozario \u201cdid anything to obstruct the court,\u201d that the alcohol test result was inadmissible because it was obtained from an Alcosensor device, that the district court judge had improperly relied upon the test result, and that the evidence failed to establish Rozario obstructed the administration of justice. When Rozario\u2019s attorney made this argument, the circuit court judge had no basis to know from the prosecutor\u2019s evidence the source of the district court judge\u2019s finding because the district court judge\u2019s statement did not disclose the type of \u201ctest\u201d he had ordered. The \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d merely recited tersely that the district court judge \u201chad [a] deputy test [Rozario] and the reading was .10.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Specifically noting that \u201cnothing in this certificate ... says anything [about an Alcosensor],\u201d the circuit court judge observed \u201cit just says ... he took a test and the reading was .10.\u201d The circuit court judge then acknowledged \u201cthere\u2019s [a document] in the [district court\u2019s] file, but that\u2019s not in evidence.\u201d After Rozario\u2019s attorney and the prosecutor disagreed about whether another prosecutor had agreed to stipulate as evidence the \u201cAlcosensor IV Worksheet\u201d that was in the district court\u2019s file, the circuit court judge overruled the motion to strike the evidence. Rozario\u2019s attorney then offered as evidence a copy of the \u201cAlcosensor IV Worksheet,\u201d which was in the district court\u2019s file and which the district court judge relied upon in finding \u201cthe reading was .10.\u201d Rozario\u2019s attorney offered no other evidence, rested his case, and renewed his motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The prosecutor did not dispute that the district court judge had based his recitation of facts upon the result of an Alcosensor test. Although the district court\u2019s file contained the \u201cAlcosensor TV Worksheet,\u201d the prosecutor simply opted not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>to present it as evidence. When Rozario\u2019s attorney proffered the Alcosensor Worksheet, he expressly argued it was the basis for the district court judge\u2019s finding and said the judge improperly used it at the summary contempt proceeding. In other words, Rozario argued at trial, as he does now, that the district court judge improperly relied upon an Alcosensor test result to determine Rozario\u2019s alcohol level, which was reported in the \u201cStatement of Facts.\u201d Before issuing his ruling, the circuit court judge ordered briefing of the issue. Each party filed a memorandum discussing the propriety of the district court judge\u2019s use of the Alcosensor test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u2018While the doctrine of invited error remains good law, it simply has no application where, as here, the record shows that a party clearly objected to a specific ruling of the trial court to which error is assigned on appeal----\u201d <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 576, 582, 570 S.E.2d 863, 866 (2002) (citing <em>Wright v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>245 Va. 160, 170, 427 S.E.2d 724, 729 (1993)). \u201cIn order for a procedural waiver to apply, the record must show that a litigant invited a trial court to commit error, either by failing to object or by agreeing to the ruling.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Kendrick, </em>254 Va. 206, 208 n. 2, 491 S.E.2d 286, 287 n. 2 (1997). Waiver does not apply, when, as in this case, the circuit court judge was fully aware of the objection. <em>Id. </em>The error to which Rozario objected was the district court judge\u2019s reliance upon an Alcosensor testing device to establish the level of alcohol in Rozario\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">As his sole evidence in the circuit court, the prosecutor relied on the district court judge\u2019s \u201cStatement of Facts,\u201d presumably as the certificate of conviction prepared in accordance with Code \u00a7 18.2-459.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The certificate was deficient, however, because it failed to indicate the basis for the test result. By offering the worksheet as an exhibit, Rozario\u2019s attorney proffered the underlying additional facts concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u201cthe particular circumstances of the offense,\u201d which were absent from the district court judge\u2019s statement of facts. By-noting the document was in the file but not in evidence, the circuit court judge essentially invited Rozario\u2019s attorney to put the document in evidence to provide proof to support this claim of error. Merely placing in the record a document that constitutes the basis for the judge\u2019s prior ruling does not constitute invited error when the party has made his objection clear. <em>See WJLA-TV v. Levin, </em>264 Va. 140, 159, 564 S.E.2d 383, 395 (2002) (holding that by \u201cmerely proffering or agreeing to an instruction consistent with the trial court\u2019s prior ruling,\u201d a party does not waive its objection to that ruling). Significantly, the Commonwealth did not assert in its initial brief to this Court or at the oral argument before the panel that Rozario has waived the issue. Although the Commonwealth makes this argument for the first time on this rehearing en banc, the Commonwealth acknowledges that Rozario\u2019s attorney argued \u201cbefore the trial court that the test result should not have been used in the general district court.\u201d Indeed, as indicated above, Rozario\u2019s attorney made this precise argument, causing the circuit court judge to respond that the worksheet, which the district court judge relied upon, had not been placed in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d prepared by the district court judge expressly recites that the district court judge \u201chad [his] deputy test [Rozario] and the reading was .10.\u201d This establishes that the deputy used a device of some type to test Rozario. Although the general district court\u2019s file contained evidence of the type of device used, the prosecutor was content to leave this evidence unproved and to rely upon the circuit judge\u2019s statutory authority to \u201chear the case upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>certificate [of conviction].\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-459. By tacitly asserting the \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d was the certificate, the prosecutor proceeded without divulging the details of \u201cthe particular circumstances of the offense\u201d as relied upon by the district court judge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">If Rozario\u2019s attorney had not placed the Alcosensor IV Worksheet into the circuit court\u2019s record, this appeal would likely be subject to dismissal for failure to provide this Court with a complete record to decide the claim of error. <em>See LeMond v. McElroy, </em>239 Va. 515, 521, 391 S.E.2d 309, 312 (1990) (holding that \u201cthe responsibility for presenting an adequate appellate record is upon the appellant who seeks reversal of the decision below\u201d); <em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 189, 194, 390 S.E.2d 782, 785, <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>240 Va. ix, 396 S.E.2d 675 (1990) (holding that \u201can appellant has the primary responsibility of ensuring that a complete record is furnished to an appellate court so that the errors assigned may be decided properly\u201d). In other words, if Rozario\u2019s attorney had not introduced into evidence the Alcosensor IV Worksheet, he would have been precluded from asserting on this appeal that the test result reading of \u201c.10\u201d recited in the district judge\u2019s \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d was the reported result of an Alcosensor device. By placing in the record the factual predicate that underlay the district court judge\u2019s conclusory finding that the \u201ctest ... reading was .10,\u201d Rozario\u2019s attorney properly made a record to support the claim that the district court judge relied upon an improper testing device. By offering the worksheet as evidence, Rozario\u2019s attorney merely put before the circuit court judge the particulars of the \u201ccircumstances of the offense,\u201d which were omitted from the \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d prepared by the district court judge and were necessary to establish his claim of error. For these reasons, I would hold Rozario is not procedurally barred from raising his questions presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The circuit court judge ruled that the result of the Alcosensor test was properly considered by the district court judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>and that the recitations in the \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d were sufficient to prove contempt under Code \u00a7 18.2-456.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">On brief, Rozario presents the following matters for our consideration in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\"><em>ASSIGNMENT OF </em>ERROR<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">1. The Circuit Court of Chesterfield County improperly convicted Appellant of summary contempt of court because the evidence introduced by the Commonwealth at trial was legally insufficient to support a conviction pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 18.2-456.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">\n<em>QUESTIONS PRESENTED</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">1. Did Judge Laney, in General District Court, and Judge Gill, in Circuit Court, improperly rely on the results of a chemical test for blood alcohol content in finding that Rozario was intoxicated in Judge Laney\u2019s court on February 7, 2005?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">2. In the absence of evidence of the results of the chemical test for blood alcohol content, was the information contained in Judge Laney\u2019s Statement of Facts sufficient to support the Circuit Court\u2019s finding of guilt?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Rozario contends the district court judge and the circuit court judge \u201cimproperly relied upon inadmissible and unrelia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ble results of an Alcosensor test to find appellant guilty of summary contempt.\u201d In the circuit court, Rozario argued in his brief in support of his motion to strike the evidence that the record contained no \u201cassurances of reliability ... with the preliminary breath test, and this lack of reliability limits [its] use to pre-trial questions addressing the presence or lack of probable cause for an arrest.\u201d On appeal, he also argues \u201cthe Commonwealth introduced no evidence that the test given Rozario was reliable\u201d and, thus, the district court judge erred in using the test results to establish the level of alcohol in his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In <em>Santen v. Tuthill, </em>265 Va. 492, 578 S.E.2d 788 (2003), the Supreme Court ruled that the trial judge properly refused to permit proof of the results of \u201ca preliminary breath test ... using a [police] \u2018department ... issued ... alcosensor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 578 S.E.2d at 789. The Court held that \u201cthe numerical result of [the] prehminary breath test was [not] based on an adequate factual foundation,\u201d because there was no evidence the device had been regularly calibrated. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 578 S.E.2d at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">As in <em>Santen, </em>nothing in evidence provided information about the reliability of the particular device the deputy used to test Rozario or the validity of the results. Importantly, the record does not reflect the device\u2019s maintenance, the calibration of the device, its maintenance records, or the accuracy of its results. <em>See id. </em>As a matter of fact, the Alcosensor IV Worksheet contains the following items to be completed: \u201cDATE OF LAST ACCURACY CHECK_\u201d and \u201cWAS CHECK WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS__\u201d Neither of these items was completed by the person who administered the device and the designated spaces were empty. Thus, I would hold that the judge improperly relied upon the Alcosensor test results in this case in finding Rozario was in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Even assuming the district court judge did not err in relying upon the result of the Alcosensor test, I disagree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the majority\u2019s contention that Rozario\u2019s second question presented depends upon him prevailing under the first question and, therefore, is moot. Rozario fairly raised the question of the sufficiency of the evidence independent of the question concerning the use of the Alcosensor test results. Rozario has satisfied the principle that appeals \u201cought to assign clearly and distinctly all the errors relied on for a reversal of the case, so that the opposite party may know what questions are to be raised in the appellate court.\u201d <em>Orr v. Pennington, </em>93 Va. 268, 269-70, 24 S.E. 928, 928 (1896); <em>see also Kirby v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 440, 444-45, 570 S.E.2d 832, 834 (2002) (stating that the purpose of assignments of error is to direct opposing counsel and the court to the issues that the appellant claims as error). The Commonwealth\u2019s understanding of the scope of the second question presented is apparent in its first brief (filed before the panel that considered this case), which addressed the sufficiency issue as an issue independent from that of the Alcosensor test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Supposing that the judge erred in relying upon the results of the Alcosensor test, Rozario argues on appeal, as he did in the circuit court, that the evidence was insufficient to prove summary contempt. Fairly understood, Rozario contends the evidence was insufficient in any event because he expressly argues that \u201ceven if (the Alcosensor results] were properly admitted, ... there is no evidence in the record ... to sustain a conviction for ... \u2018misbehavior in the presence of the Court, or so near thereto as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1)). Responding, the Commonwealth contends the evidence was sufficient to prove contempt because Rozario\u2019s appearance caused the district court judge \u201cto stop the proceeding for the administration of an Alcosensor test to confirm the presence of alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 18.2-456 provides that \u201cjudges may issue attachments for contempt and <em>punish them summarily, only in the cases following: </em>(1) misbehavior in the presence of the Court, or so near thereto as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice.... \u201d (Emphasis added.) Reversing a conviction for summary contempt, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Court of the United States held that before a judge may invoke \u201cthe drastic procedures of the summary contempt power ...[,] there must be an actual obstruction of justice.\u201d <em>In re McConnell, </em>370 U.S. 230, 234, 82 S.Ct. 1288, 1291, 8 L.Ed.2d 434 (1962); <em>see also Salyer v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 662, 664, 166 S.E.2d 110, 111 (1969) (holding that the evidence must prove \u201ca clear and present danger to the administration of justice\u201d). Thus, inappropriate or ill-mannered conduct that does not \u201cobstruct or interrupt the administration of justice\u201d is not misbehavior that can be punished. Indeed the Supreme Court has often stated that \u201c[tjrial courts ... must be on guard against confusing offenses to their sensibilities with obstruction to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Brown v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 148, 153, 78 S.Ct. 622, 626, 2 L.Ed.2d 589 (1958); <em>In re Little, </em>404 U.S. 553, 555, 92 S.Ct. 659, 660, 30 L.Ed.2d 708 (1972). Put another way, \u201c[disrespectful conduct is not contemptuous.\u201d <em>United States v. Lowery, </em>733 F.2d 441, 446 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Furthermore, the record must contain evidence of the conduct that is the basis for the contempt finding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">The record in such cases must contain more than the bare <em>conclusion </em>that the defendant\u2019s conduct was insolent, insulting, boisterous or the like. The actual facts upon which the court based its final conclusion must be set out. Such <em>conclusions </em>alone will not support a criminal contempt adjudication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\"><em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 392, 397, 345 S.E.2d 5, 8 (1986) (citation omitted). Because summary contempt \u201cis a proceeding \u2018to preserve the power and vindicate the dignity of the court,\u2019 it is criminal and punitive in character, and the guilt of the alleged contemner must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Weston v. Commonwealth, </em>195 Va. 175, 184, 77 S.E.2d 405, 410 (1953) (quoting <em>Local 333B, United Marine Div. of Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 773, 779, 71 S.E.2d 159, 163 (1952)).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Although the evidence was sufficient to prove that Rozario consumed alcohol at some time before appearing in the gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>al district court, the evidence must establish an actual obstruction of justice and, thus, must prove more than an odor of alcohol emanating from his body and bloodshot eyes. This evidence proved nothing about Rozario\u2019s conduct, speech, mannerisms, or behavior in the courtroom and was insufficient to prove Rozario obstructed or interrupted justice. Likewise, evidence that Rozario\u2019s alcohol level was \u201c.10\u201d was not, when added to the judge\u2019s observations, proof of intoxication because it did not prove that Rozario had consumed a sufficient amount of alcohol to affect his speech, disposition, manner, movements, or behavior. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 4.1-100 (defining intoxication, for purposes of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, as \u201ca condition in which a person has drunk enough alcoholic beverages to observably affect his manner, speech, muscular movement, general appearance or behavior\u201d). Indeed, in the circuit court, the prosecutor \u201cconcedefd] the evidence in this case would be insufficient to convict [Rozario] of being drunk in public.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>401 F.3d 588, 597 (4th Cir.2005) (noting that the court\u2019s \u201cresearch has uncovered, and the Government has cited, no published opinion of the Virginia appellate courts finding probable cause for public intoxication based solely on glassy, bloodshot eyes and the strong smell of alcohol\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The provision of Virginia\u2019s contempt statute which was employed in this case is similar to the Pennsylvania statute at issue in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Falwell v. Di Giacinto, </em>324 Pa.Super. 200, 471 A.2d 533 (1984), where the court reversed a criminal contempt conviction under circumstances analogous to this case. When the defendant appeared in court after having consumed four beers and having a strong smell of alcohol, <em>id. </em>at 534-35, the trial judge convicted him of summary contempt for \u201c \u2018misbehavior ... in the presence of the court, thereby obstructing the administration of justice,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 536 (quoting 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 4131, <em>renumbered to 42 </em>Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 4132). Reversing the conviction, the appeals court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">[M]erely being under some influence of liquor will not by itself constitute contempt. The drunkenness must be such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>that it obstructs the administration of justice, which means that it must interfere with or disrupt the orderly process of the court.... The record does not show that defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol before coming to court in any way caused delay or disruption of the hearing, which would constitute a contumacious obstruction of the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 587 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In a similar circumstance, a trial judge in Maryland convicted a defendant of criminal contempt because he had \u201ca strong odor of alcohol\u201d and a .20 reading on a passive breath test. <em>Cameron v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 600, 650 A.2d 1376, 1378-79 (Ct.Spec.App.1994). Reversing that ruling, the appeals court held that the evidence failed to prove the accused\u2019s \u201cbehavior ... was ... contemptuous on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1381. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction because no evidence proved the accused was \u201cdisruptive of the proceeding\u201d or \u201crebellious, ... insubordinate, ... willfully disobedient or openly disrespectful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the defendant\u2019s conduct did not obstruct the court in the discharge of its duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">These decisions are more persuasive than the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court which expressly declined to address the appellant\u2019s contention \u201cthat his behavior did not fall within any of the five categories listed in [Ark.Code Ann.] \u00a7 16-10-108(a),\u201d the Arkansas summary contempt statute. <em>Burradell v. State, </em>326 Ark. 182, 931 S.W.2d 100, 102 (1996). Upholding the conviction for criminal contempt, the Supreme Court of Arkansas declined to apply its statute and held that Arkansas courts have the inherent power to punish any \u201cbehavior[, which], standing alone, [is] a mark of disrespect to the court and the legal process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102. The court found cases from other states \u201cdistinguishable, although they involve similar fact situations,\u201d because Arkansas \u201cempowered ... judges with greater authority to preserve and protect the dignity of their courtrooms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103. The court specifically distinguished its power from other jurisdictions where, for example, the \u201claw required \u2018misbehavior ... obstructing the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>tion of justice\u2019 before a contempt citation could be issued,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Di Giacinto, </em>471 A.2d at 536), or \u201ca charge of contempt could only be supported by a willful attempt to show disrespect,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citing <em>Bethard v. District of Columbia, </em>650 A.2d 651, 653 (D.C.1994)). Unlike Arkansas, our Supreme Court long ago held that our summary contempt statute is a declaration of Virginia\u2019s public policy and that courts must apply the statute in determining whether the behavior at issue is punishable as summary contempt. <em>Weston, </em>195 Va. at 182-84, 77 S.E.2d at 408-09. <em>See Yoder v. Commonwealth, </em>107 Va. 823, 57 S.E. 581 (1907) (reversing a conviction for summary contempt where the trial judge failed to adhere to the provisions of the summary contempt statute); <em>see also Holt v. Virginia, </em>381 U.S. 131, 85 S.Ct. 1375, 14 L.Ed.2d 290 (1965) (reversing a conviction for summary contempt under Code \u00a7 18.1-292(1), the predecessor to Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In this case, the judge convicted Rozario of summary contempt under Code \u00a7 18.2-456 for \u201c[misbehavior in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice.\u201d The summary contempt statute undoubtedly authorizes judges to protect against actual obstructions in the courtroom. I would reiterate, however, an observation we made in <em>Carter:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">We do not here lose sight of the fact that frequently a reading of the cold record does not accurately portray the actual conduct of the parties, their witnesses or their counsel. For that reason it is of utmost importance that as near as possible the record recites the facts or contains the evidence to support the conclusions of the trial court. <em>See Harvey v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 433, 436-37, 164 S.E.2d 636, 638 (1968) (showing the need for the record to prove guilt).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">2 Va.App. at 399, 345 S.E.2d at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The record here discloses no physical impairment attributed to Rozario that delayed, interrupted, or obstructed the court proceeding. The district court judge\u2019s decision to cause a deputy sheriff to test Rozario for alcohol was not based on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>interruption of the court proceeding or shown to be caused by anything other than his bloodshot eyes and body odor suggesting consumption of alcohol. The \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d provided no indication of the manner in which Rozario interrupted the proceedings or lacked capacity to rationally respond in the courtroom. Without some indicia of proof of the manner in which Rozario\u2019s conduct was detrimental to the proceeding or obstructed the administration of justice, the evidence was insufficient to prove the elements of contempt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>(holding that the record failed to contain facts sufficient to support the conviction for criminal contempt).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">For all of these reasons, I would hold the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for summary contempt. Therefore, I would reverse the conviction and dismiss this prosecution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\">. When a defendant appeals to the circuit court from a conviction in the general district court of summary contempt, the following procedure applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A47\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>If such appeal be taken, a certificate of the conviction and the particular circumstances of the offense, together with the recognizance, shall forthwith be transmitted by the sentencing judge to the clerk of such circuit court, who shall immediately deliver the same to the judge thereof. Such judge may hear the case upon the certificate and any legal testimony adduced on either side, and make such order therein as may seem to him proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR\">Code \u00a7 18.2-459.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b196-12\">. This Court has not always been consistent in differentiating between \"questions presented\u201d and \u201cassignments of error.\u201d In numerous appeals, we have recognized and addressed issues presented by \"assignments of error.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Black v.

The Commonwealth argues Rozario \"caused the <em>court </em>to interrupt the proceedings to determine if the court\u2019s conclusion that Rozario was intoxicated was correct.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This assumes a fact that precisely exposes the evidentiary deficiency in this case. Nothing Rozario said or did caused an interruption. At some time before arriving in court, Rozario consumed alcohol, a lawful substance. The judge's desire to quantify the level of alcohol in Rozario\u2019s body cannot be the basis for the claimed contemptuous behavior when the record failed to prove Rozario, himself, did anything to cause an interruption or delay. <em>See e.g., United States v. Snider, </em>502 F.2d 645, 658 (4th Cir.1974) (holding that the defendants\u2019 failure to rise from their seats and stand, \"accompanied only by such interruption of proceedings as are thought necessary by the district judge to explain the consequences of contempt and cite the alleged contemnor for his actions,\u201d was not \u201cmisbehavior\u201d that would support a finding of contempt).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
