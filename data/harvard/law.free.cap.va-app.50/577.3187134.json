On appeal, Raab claims the evidence obtained by the arresting officer should have been suppressed because the officer had no legal basis to detain him. After a panel of this Court rejected this argument in <em>Raab v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 638, 644 S.E.2d 78 (2007), Raab asked us to reconsider the matter <em>en banc. </em>Having agreed to do so, we now affirm Raab\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Under settled principles, we address the legal issues arising from a suppression motion \u201conly after the relevant historical facts have been established.\u201d <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 168, 171, 622 S.E.2d 771, 772 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc). On appeal, the facts developed in the trial court must be reviewed \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Kyer v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 473, 477, 612 S.E.2d 213, 215 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">So viewed, the evidentiary record shows that a police officer patrolling Ocean View Avenue at about 12:40 a.m. noticed a few vehicles in a restaurant parking lot. The restaurant had \u201cclosed\u201d and was \u201cshut down\u201d for the night, with all lights turned off. Posted signs warned that the \u201cparking lot was for patrons only\u201d and that \u201ctowing was enforced.\u201d In prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>patrols, the officer had seen vehicles parked there after the restaurant had closed. Adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay shoreline, the parking lot was sometimes used after hours by people going to the beach despite the patrons-only restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">When the officer pulled into the lot, Raab began backing his vehicle out of a parking space. As he had on previous occasions when he suspected unauthorized vehicles in the restaurant parking lot, the officer stopped Raab \u201cto inquire why he was there after the business was closed.\u201d The officer immediately noticed an odor of alcohol coming from Raab. His eyes were glassy and red. Raab said he had just gone \u201cfor a swim,\u201d but his hair and clothes were dry. After Raab failed various field sobriety tests, the officer arrested him for driving under the influence. A later breath test showed a .15 blood alcohol content, nearly twice the legal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In the trial court, Raab moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that the officer unlawfully stopped him. Raab\u2019s counsel acknowledged the officer \u201ctestified very credibly.\u201d Counsel also admitted the restaurant was closed and its lights were off. He then cited the general trespassing statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-119, arguing that there can be no reasonable suspicion of trespassing here because the posted signs did not expressly say \u201cno trespassing.\u201d Only a \u201cclear marking of no trespassing,\u201d counsel continued, meets the \u201cstandard for being able to enforce the no trespassing law or the trespass offense.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we would have a case,\u201d he conceded, if the posted signs had been \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The trial court denied Raab\u2019s motion to suppress. Because the posted signs specifically forbade access to \u201canybody but patrons,\u201d the court held, the officer could reasonably suspect Raab of trespassing given that the restaurant had closed and turned off its lights. In response to this ruling, Raab entered a conditional guilty plea stipulating to the sufficiency of the evidence and reserving his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">While an arrest requires probable cause, a mere investigatory stop requires only a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that criminal activity \u201cmay be afoot.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989), and <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). The likelihood of criminality \u201cneed not rise to the level required for probable cause, and it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard\u201d applicable in other contexts. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 122 S.Ct. at 751 (citing <em>Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. at 7, 109 S.Ct. at 1585); <em>see also Whitfield v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 358, 361, 576 S.E.2d 463, 464-65 (2003) (summarizing standard as a reasonable suspicion the individual \u201cmay be involved in criminal activity\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The possibility of an innocent explanation for the suspicious conduct does not necessarily forbid an officer from making a brief, investigatory stop. <em>See Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274, 122 S.Ct. at 751 (rejecting the \u201cdivide-and-conquer analysis\u201d). <em>Terry </em>itself involved an officer observing Terry and his companions \u201crepeatedly walk back and forth, look into a store window, and confer with one another.\u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274, 122 S.Ct. at 751. \u201cAlthough each of the series of acts was \u2018perhaps innocent in itself,\u2019 \u201d collectively they were suspicious enough that a reasonable officer had grounds to stop Terry and his companions for purposes of investigating the situation further. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880-81). Reasonable suspicion \u201cneed not rule out the possibility of innocent conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277, 122 S.Ct. at 753 (citing <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 125, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676-77, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000)). \u201cThus, there may be circumstances where wholly lawful conduct might justify the suspicion that criminal activity \u2018may be\u2019 afoot.\u201d <em>Richards v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 612, 617, 383 S.E.2d 268, 271 (1989) (citations omitted). As one commentator has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">The possibility of an innocent explanation does not deprive the officer of the capacity to entertain a reasonable suspi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>cion of criminal conduct. Indeed the principal function of his investigation is to resolve that very ambiguity and establish whether the activity is in fact legal or illegal\u2014to \u201cenable the police to quickly determine whether they should allow the suspect to go about his business or hold him to answer charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">4 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 9.5(b), at 482 (4th ed.2004) (citations and footnote omitted). Given this practical focus, the Fourth Amendment bars only investigatory detentions based upon \u201cinarticulate hunches\u201d devoid of any arguably supportive factual basis. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Equally true, the absence of probable cause plays no role in the <em>Terry </em>analysis. Given its animating principle of reasonableness, \u201cthe Fourth Amendment does not require a policeman who lacks the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest to simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a criminal to escape.\u201d <em>United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, </em>473 U.S. 531, 544, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 3312, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985) (quoting <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 145, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972)); <em>see also Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 552, 554, 231 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1977). To be sure, a \u201cbrief stop of a suspicious individual, in order to determine his identity or to maintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining more information\u201d may represent the most reasonable response an officer can give under the circumstances. <em>Simmons, </em>217 Va. at 554-55, 231 S.E.2d at 220 (quoting <em>Adams, </em>407 U.S. at 146, 92 S.Ct. at 1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">In this case, the factual circumstances justified a reasonable suspicion that Raab may have been trespassing. Code \u00a7 18.2-119 criminalizes trespass by those who go on the property of another \u201cwithout authority of law\u201d after \u201chaving been forbidden to do so\u201d by a lawful possessor. The warning can be \u201ceither orally or in writing\u201d or by \u201ca sign or signs\u201d posted by the lawful possessor. Code \u00a7 18.2-119. Nothing in the statute or in any interpretative caselaw requires, as Raab argues, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>posted signs use the expression \u201cno trespassing\u201d or similar talismanic warning forbidding access.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Here, the posted signs warned that permission to use the parking lot was reserved \u201cfor patrons only\u201d and added that non-patrons could expect a \u201ctowing enforced\u201d response by the restaurateur. No facts suggested Raab was a patron. At 12:40 a.m., the restaurant had closed and all of the lights were off. A restaurant closed to patrons cannot be patronized, particularly one with its lights off during nighttime hours. It reasonably follows that Raab was likely a non-patron subject to the restaurant\u2019s patrons-only restriction on access to the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Maybe so, Raab contends, but it is also possible he could have been the last employee leaving the restaurant that night turning off the lights on his way out the door. We do not deny this possibility. Truth be told, for all the officer knew, Raab could have been the restaurant owner himself calling in license plate numbers to the towing company. That the suspicion of trespassing could have been factually wrong, however, does not make it legally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The suspicious individuals walking up and down the sidewalk in <em>Terry, </em>after all, could simply have been innocuous, albeit overly energetic, window shoppers. But that hypothesis did not invalidate the <em>Terry </em>stop. <em>See Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. at 9-10, 109 S.Ct. at 1586-87 (noting <em>\u201cTerry </em>itself involved \u2018a series of acts, each of them perhaps innocent\u2019 \u201d that nonetheless warranted further investigation when viewed collectively (citation omitted)). Under the Fourth Amendment, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not whether particular conduct is \u2018innocent\u2019 or \u2018guilty,\u2019 but the degree of suspicion that attaches to particular types of <em>noncriminal </em>acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 109 S.Ct. at 1587 (emphasis added). And, in answering that inquiry, \u201ccommon sense and ordinary human experience\u201d take precedence over legal abstractions and rigid criteria. <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 685, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 1575, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Raab rejects this reasoning, arguing it has been displaced by a contrary view adopted in <em>Ewell v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 214, 491 S.E.2d 721 (1997). We disagree. In that case, an officer stopped a vehicle driving out of a residential apartment complex shortly after midnight. Unfamiliar with the vehicle or its driver, the officer noticed that the vehicle had been parked in an area known for drug dealing. Though a sign posted at the entrance of the apartment complex barred trespassers, nothing suggested the driver was a trespasser. <em>Ewell </em>held no reasonable suspicion of trespassing could arise under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We fail to see how the residential apartment complex in <em>Ewell </em>can be sensibly analogized to a closed, unlit commercial restaurant. Apartment complexes do not close for the night. Residents and guests come and go as they please. Restaurants, on the other hand, can and do close to <em>everyone. </em>Patrons do not come and go from a closed, unlit restaurant in the middle of the night. That fact alone, coupled with the patrons-only restriction, suggested Raab had no authority to be there. The holding in <em>Ewell, </em>therefore, warranted a different conclusion because it rested on fundamentally different circumstances\u2014providing an apt illustration of the general rule that, \u201cbecause the mosaic which is analyzed for a reasonable-suspicion or probable-cause inquiry is multifaceted, \u2018one determination will seldom be a useful precedent for another.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number><em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 698, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1662, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Because the trial court did not err in denying Raab\u2019s motion to suppress, we affirm his conviction for driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\">. On brief, Raab contends the officer never explicitly testified that he stopped Raab to investigate a possible criminal \"trespass\u201d\u2014his point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>being that an articulable suspicion under <em>Terry </em>must be specifically articulated by the officer from the witness stand. Not so. \"An action is \u2018reasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer's state of mind, \u2018as long as the circumstances, viewed <em>objectively, </em>justify [the] action.' <em>\u201d Brigham City v. </em>Stuart,-U.S.-,-, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 1948, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006) (emphasis in original and citations omitted). \"It is important to remember that 'we are not limited to what the stopping officer says or to evidence of his subjective rationale; rather, we look to the record as a whole to determine what facts were known to the officer and then consider whether a reasonable officer in those circumstances would have been suspicious.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Consequently, the \"police officer conducting a stop is not required to 'precisely and individually articulate the facts that added up to suspicion in his mind.' \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-11\">. The same can be said of <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 407, 551 S.E.2d 606 (2001). The suspicion of trespassing was found unreasonable in <em>Harris </em>because the evidence merely showed \u2018\u2018three persons standing and conversing near an apparent bus stop adjoining a public street at midday\u201d in an apartment complex that forbid trespassers. <em>Id. </em>at 416, 551 S.E.2d at 610-11. The only circumstance suggesting the three were trespassing (in the middle of the day at an apparent bus stop) was that the police officers were not familiar with any of them. The facts of <em>Harris, </em>like <em>Ewell, </em>cannot be usefully analogized to a suspected trespasser seen after midnight in a parking lot of a closed, unlit commercial restaurant in which access has been expressly denied to anyone but patrons.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b629-8\">HUMPHREYS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXh\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Because I believe that <em>Ewell v.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">\u201cA police officer may stop and detain a person \u2018for purposes of investigating possible criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ford v.

In my view, appellate courts have occasionally blurred the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>tinetion between probable cause to support an arrest or search and the much lesser standard of reasonable suspicion that a crime has occurred, is occurring, or is about to occur, thereby constitutionally justifying a brief investigative detention. Nevertheless, we are bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Ewell </em>and <em>Harris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In the present case, a police officer spotted three vehicles in the parking lot of a restaurant at 12:40 a.m. The restaurant \u201cappeared\u201d to be closed for the evening, and had a \u201cpatrons only/towing enforced\u201d sign posted. The restaurant was not in the officer\u2019s normal patrol area, and the officer did not testify as to whether he knew what time the restaurant closed. The officer testified that he pulled into the lot to inquire why the individuals were in the parking lot after hours. As the officer pulled in to the parking lot, \u201c[he] scanned the parking lot real quick and [Raab\u2019s] vehicle was backing out from the spot where he was.\u201d The officer then pulled up and parked perpendicular to Raab\u2019s vehicle to prevent him from exiting the lot in order to investigate Raab\u2019s reason for being on the property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth argues, and the majority holds that the officer in this case had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to believe that Raab was trespassing. Because of the precedent set forth in <em>Ewell </em>and <em>Harris, </em>I must disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In <em>Ewell, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court held that a police officer was not justified in stopping and detaining the operator of a vehicle that he suspected of trespassing. The officer worked part-time as a security guard for an apartment complex when he was off-duty. <em>Ewell, </em>254 Va. at 215, 491 S.E.2d at 722. He was \u201cemployed primarily to enforce the complex\u2019s policy against trespassing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At the entrance to the complex, there was a \u201cten-by-five foot, lighted sign stating \u2018no trespassing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The officer testified that, \u201che was familiar with most of the complex\u2019s residents and their automobiles,\u201d and \u201cwas concerned because it was [12:30 in the morning] and the car was parked in front of an apartment suspected of \u2018high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>narcotics\u2019 trafficking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 491 S.E.2d at 722. \u201cAdditionally, the operator of the car attempted to leave the parking lot immediately upon [the officer\u2019s] arrival in his marked vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the officer recognized neither Ewell nor her vehicle, he stopped the vehicle \u201cto inquire whether its operator was trespassing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court held that the officer\u2019s perceptions and suspicions were no more than a hunch, falling short of the reasonable, articulable suspicion required for a stop. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 491 S.E.2d at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In <em>Hams, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court held that a police officer was not justified in conducting a non-consensual stop of an individual that the officer believed was \u201cpossibly trespassing\u201d at an apartment complex. <em>Harris, </em>262 Va. at 410, 551 S.E.2d at 607. The officer was familiar with most residents of the apartment complex and their regular visitors because he had \u201cworked for two and one-half years in a drug elimination program\u201d at the complex. <em>Id. </em>A \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign was posted on at least one of the buildings in the complex. <em>Id. </em>The officer observed three men standing near a bench that had previously been used as a bus stop which was a \u201cshort distance\u201d from the \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign. <em>Id. </em>The officer conducted a non-consensual stop of the men because he did not recognize them as residents or regular visitors of the complex and believed they were \u201cpossibly trespassing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Citing <em>Ewell, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia held that the officer \u201clacked a sufficient reasonable, articulable suspicion\u201d that the individuals were trespassing. <em>Id. </em>at 417, 551 S.E.2d at 611. The Court compared the factual situation in <em>Harris </em>to that in <em>Ewell, </em>noting that \u201ceach officer had no more than an \u2018unparticularized suspicion or \u201chunch\u201d \u2019 that criminal activity was afoot. As such, each officer\u2019s subjective belief that the individual might be a trespasser was not sufficient to warrant a non-consensual investigatory detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416, 551 S.E.2d at 611 (quoting <em>(Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The majority attempts to distinguish the instant facts from those in <em>Ewell. </em>The distinction the majority makes between this case and <em>Ewell </em>or, for that matter, <em>Harris </em>is, in my view, one without a difference. In essence, the majority holds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>because an apartment complex does not close and a restaurant does, it is more reasonable to assume that Raab was not lawfully in the parking lot. In other words, the majority holds that Raab\u2019s mere presence in the parking lot of a closed restaurant at 12:40 in the morning is a sufficient \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting that Raab was trespassing. The majority reasons that because \u201cno facts suggested Raab was a patron,\u201d and because \u201ca restaurant closed to patrons cannot be patronized ... [i]t reasonably follows that Raab was likely a non-patron subject to the restaurant\u2019s patrons-only restriction on access to the parking lot.\u201d Although this may be true, this singular fact, applied against the precedent set forth in <em>Ewell </em>and <em>Harris, </em>is insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding of reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In <em>Ewell, </em>the officer conducting the stop was familiar with most residents of the complex, and their vehicles, but he did not recognize Ewell or her car. He knew that the apartment in front of which the car was parked was a high drug-trafficking area. Furthermore, when the officer arrived in a marked car, Ewell immediately attempted to leave. Based on his knowledge and the attendant circumstances, the officer had several reasons to believe that Ewell was trespassing. However, the Virginia Supreme Court found that these facts were insufficient to support a reasonable suspicion that Ewell was trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In <em>Harris, </em>the officer making the stop was also familiar with the location where the stop occurred. He had been involved in a drug elimination program at the apartment complex for over two years. The officer knew most of the residents and their regular visitors but did not recognize Harris. The officer saw Harris and two other men loitering near a bus stop that was no longer in use. In other words, the bus stop was closed. Based on that knowledge, the officer believed that Harris was \u201cpossibly trespassing.\u201d However, the Virginia Supreme Court held that the facts were insufficient to support a reasonable suspicion that Harris was trespassing. In both <em>Ewell </em>and <em>Harris, </em>the Supreme Court held that the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>tion available to the officer could give rise to no more than a \u201chunch\u201d that the suspected individuals were trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In this case, the officer\u2019s only basis for reasonable suspicion was that Raab was leaving the parking lot of an apparently closed restaurant. However, unlike in <em>Ewell, </em>there is no evidence that Raab\u2019s attempt to leave was in response to the officer\u2019s arrival. Furthermore, unlike the officers in both <em>Ewell </em>and <em>Harris, </em>the officer here was not particularly familiar with the location of the stop. The restaurant was not in the officer\u2019s \u201cnormal patrol\u201d area. The record also does not indicate what time the restaurant closed or that the officer had that information available to him. When the officer arrived, Raab was pulling out of his parking spot and the two other vehicles were apparently preparing to leave as well.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As such, it is equally likely, in viewing the totality of the circumstances, that Raab was the restaurant\u2019s owner, an employee, or a late departing patron and, thus, lawfully on the premises. Thus, it is apparent that the officer here had even less reason to be suspicious of criminal activity than the officers in <em>Ewell </em>and <em>Harris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Because an officer\u2019s familiarity with the residents of a complex, and the presence of drug-trafficking, coupled with the defendant\u2019s attempt to leave the complex upon the officer\u2019s arrival, is insufficient to support a finding of reasonable suspicion, <em>see Ewell, </em>254 Va. 214, 491 S.E.2d 721; <em>Harris, 262 </em>Va. at 410, 551 S.E.2d at 607, I do not believe that the facts in this case rise any higher than a similar \u201chunch.\u201d Accordingly, I would hold that under <em>Ewell </em>and <em>Harris, </em>the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress, and I would reverse and remand for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">.
