On appeal, Pierce argues that the trial court erred in allowing testimony that Pierce had been previously convicted of perjury. Pierce contends that this error can never be harmless, and, thus, her conviction must be reversed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we hold that the trial court erred in admitting testimony regarding Pierce\u2019s conviction for perjury, but that the error was harmless. Thus, we affirm Pierce\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below, giving it the benefit of all reasonable inferences. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). So viewed, the evidence established the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">On July 22, 2005, the Portsmouth Police Department conducted surveillance on Pierce\u2019s home at 2210 King Street because of complaints regarding narcotics activity. Officer J.C. Knorowski (\u201cKnorowski\u201d) saw Pierce, who was sitting on the front porch, empty the tobacco from a cigar, replace the tobacco with marijuana, and smoke the cigar. Pierce did this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>twice. A man approached the porch and smoked one of the cigars with Pierce.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Following Knorowski\u2019s observations, Detective Grover (\u201cGrover\u201d) and Detective Lipscomb (\u201cLipscomb\u201d) knocked on the back door of the house while other officers knocked on the front door. When the officers knocked, someone attempted to leave the house through a rear window. The officers entered the house, \u201cfroze\u201d it, and brought everyone out to the front porch. Grover and Lipscomb left to secure a search warrant. \"When they returned, they executed the warrant and recovered marijuana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Grover arrested Pierce and interviewed her. Grover told Pierce that an officer had observed her smoking marijuana, to which she stated, \u201cI did that.\u201d However, she denied knowing about anything else going on in her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">A grand jury indicted Pierce for possession of marijuana \u25a0with intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1. At trial, Grover described his initial encounter with Pierce. The prosecutor, the trial court, and Grover had the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">[TRIAL COURT]: Do you know what\u2019s up on High Street in the 2200 Block?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">[GROVER]: Yes. Right across from that would be the BP station at the corner of Martin Luther King Highway and High Street and the Essex Food Mart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">[THE COURT]: Yes, I know where you are talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASP\">[PROSECUTOR]: Is it fair to say it\u2019s a high crime area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-3\">[GROVER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Is it fair to say it\u2019s an open-air drug market?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-12\">[GROVER]: Yes. I\u2014at the point where I told her that there was no way she wouldn\u2019t know, that she couldn\u2019t know what was going on [inside her house] from the observations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>and the smells and everything else that was in her house, Miss Pierce said I swear on my kids\u2019 [sic] life that she didn\u2019t know what was going on, and at that point I said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you get charged and convicted of perjury[?]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Defense counsel promptly objected and moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion, stating that it would allow the statement because \u201cwe don\u2019t have a jury ... [and] it\u2019s part of the interrogation process as to what was going on.\u201d The conversation continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: You said she had been convicted of perjury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">[GROVER]: I said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you get charged and convicted of perjury? That\u2019s lying.\u201d Miss Pierce said, \u201cYeah, but that was just in court,\u201d and at that point I was pretty disgusted and I just ended the interview and walked out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Defense counsel again renewed his motion for a mistrial, which the court denied. Pierce never testified in her defense, and, ultimately, the trial court convicted her of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1. In finding Pierce guilty, the trial court noted that \u201cif there was any doubt in the Court\u2019s mind ... the testimony of Miss [Kisha] LeBray makes it pretty clear that this defendant was at least a co-possessor of the items.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial judge remarked further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">To tell you the truth, I was sitting here listening to the Commonwealth\u2019s case and I was saying Boy, this is going to be close. Then Miss LeBray took the witness stand and while she was testifying I was thinking Boy, I bet if [the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney] knew she was going to say what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>she was saying, he\u2019d have called her as a witness [for the Commonwealth],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The trial court sentenced Pierce to three years in the penitentiary, with two years and nine months suspended. Pierce now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">A. <em>The Admissibility of the Perjury Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">\u201cGenerally, proof tending to show an accused committed other crimes at other times is incompetent and inadmissible for the purpose of showing commission of the particular crime charged.\u201d <em>Woodfin v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 89, 95, 372 S.E.2d 377, 380 (1988) (citing <em>Kirkpatrick v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970)). However, \u201csuch evidence is admissible \u2018if it tends to prove any relevant element of the offense charged\u2019 or if \u2018the evidence is connected with or leads up to the offense for which the accused is on trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95, 372 S.E.2d at 380-81. Evidence of other crimes or convictions may also be admitted for the purpose of, among other things, impeaching the credibility of a witness who has placed their credibility in issue by testifying, including a criminal defendant. <em>See Hackney v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 288, 293, 504 S.E.2d 385, 388 (1998) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201cNevertheless, evidence of other crimes is permitted only when \u2018the legitimate probative value outweighs the incidental prejudice to the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Woodfin, </em>236 Va. at 95, 372 S.E.2d at 381 (quoting <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 497, 502, 303 S.E.2d 890, 893 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">In this case, Grover testified about his conversation with Pierce, specifically her acknowledgement of having previously been convicted of perjury. Pierce\u2019s perjury conviction was not relevant to prove motive, intent or any element of the offense charged. In short, Pierce\u2019s propensity to lie under oath had nothing to do with the crime for which she was being tried, possession with intent to distribute. In context, the only purpose possibly served by such testimony would be to impeach Pierce\u2019s credibility. Pierce, however, had not testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>fied and, consequently, her credibility was not in issue. Therefore, this record supports no appropriate exception to the general rule prohibiting the admission of previous crimes into evidence. As such, we hold that the trial court erred in allowing testimony regarding Pierce\u2019s prior conviction for perjury and we must now determine whether the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">B. <em>Harmless Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">A non-constitutional error is harmless \u201c[w]hen it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-678. \u201c \u2018[A] fair trial on the merits and substantial justice\u2019 are not achieved if an error at trial has affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201c[T]he harmless error doctrine enables an appellate court or a trial court when considering a motion to set aside a verdict to ignore the effect of an erroneous ruling when an error clearly has had no impact upon the verdict or sentence in a case.\u201d <em>Hackney, </em>28 Va.App. at 296, 504 S.E.2d at 389. \u201cAn error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Lavinder, </em>12 Va.App. at 1006, 407 S.E.2d at 911. \u201cFurthermore, in a bench trial, the trial judge is presumed to disregard prejudicial or inadmissible evidence, and this presumption will control in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 892, 902, 421 S.E.2d 455, 462 (1992) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The analysis of this issue is controlled by our decision in <em>Cole v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 113, 428 S.E.2d 303 (1993). In <em>Cole, </em>the trial court admitted evidence, over the appellant\u2019s objection, that the appellant had two prior convictions for grand larceny. <em>Id. </em>at 115, 428 S.E.2d at 305. On appeal, we upheld the admission of the first conviction but held that the trial court erred in allowing evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>second conviction. <em>Id </em>However, we held that the error was harmless because the trial judge, as opposed to a jury, sat as the finder of fact. <em>Id </em>at 116, 428 S.E.2d at 305. Specifically, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">\u201cA judge, unlike a juror, is uniquely suited by training, experience and judicial discipline to disregard potentially prejudicial comments and to separate, during the mental process of adjudication, the admissible from the inadmissible, even though he has heard both.\u201d <em>Eckhart v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981). Consequently, we presume that a trial judge disregards prejudicial or inadmissible evidence. <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 892, 902, 421 S.E.2d 455, 462 (1992) <em>(en banc). </em>Finally, \u201cthis presumption will control in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>[Id] ... </em>This is not to say that the admission of improper evidence in a bench trial may never result in reversible error. Where the record makes clear that the judge considered such inadmissible evidence in adjudicating the merits of the case, reversal would be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-6\"><em>Id </em>In this case, as in <em>Cole, </em>the trial court improperly admitted evidence of the appellant\u2019s prior conviction. Under <em>Cole, </em>that error is harmless unless \u201cthe record makes clear that the judge considered such inadmissible evidence in adjudicating the merits of the case____\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>There is no evidence in the record to clearly indicate that the trial court relied on the improperly admitted evidence in deciding the case. In ruling on the objection, the trial court made clear that it gave little or no weight to the prior conviction. In allowing the evidence, the court noted that \u201cwe don\u2019t have a jury\u201d and that the statement was just \u201cpart of the interrogation process.\u201d The trial court made no mention of the prior conviction when making its final ruling in the case. In fact, in ruling on the issue of guilt, the trial court made it clear that it was the testimony of another witness that convinced him that Pierce was guilty of possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">It is also clear that the improperly admitted evidence did not affect Pierce\u2019s sentence. Prior to sentencing Pierce, the trial court ordered a pre-sentencing report pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-299. Under Code \u00a7 19.2-299, \u201cthe court may, or on motion of the defendant shall, before imposing sentence direct a probation officer of such court to thoroughly investigate and report upon the history of the accused, <em>including a report of the accused\u2019s criminal record </em>.... \u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, at the time of sentencing, Pierce\u2019s criminal record was properly before the court in the pre-sentence report. Because the evidence of the conviction was properly before the court during the sentencing phase of the trial, it does not matter that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence during the guilt phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court erred in admitting Grover\u2019s testimony regarding Pierce\u2019s perjury con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>viction. However, we hold that the error was harmless and we affirm Pierce\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-11\">. This Court denied Pierce\u2019s appeal with regard to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction for possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-13\">. The officers recovered three plastic bags of marijuana. The bags contained the following amounts: 0.17 ounce, 7.30 ounces, and 0.58 ounce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b658-10\">. LeBray, Pierce\u2019s cousin who was called to testify by the defense, testified that the marijuana was on top of Pierce's dresser in her bedroom. And although Pierce never admitted to LeBray that the marijuana was hers, LeBray testified that she never saw anyone else in actual possession of the marijuana. Moreover, LeBray testified that no one in the house told the officers that the marijuana belonged to someone other than the owner of the house. Pierce was the leaseholder at the address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\">. It is clear that there is tension between our decisions in <em>Cole </em>and <em>Craddock v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 402, 429 S.E.2d 889 (1993), but that tension is not irreconcilable. We agree with the dissent that even in a bench trial, \" \u2018when the trial judge erroneously and unconditionally admits prejudicial evidence, we cannot presume that the trial judge disregarded the evidence he ruled to have probative value.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 213, 223, 429 S.E.2d 229, 235 (1993)). We also agree that we must presume that, by admitting inadmissible evidence, the trial judge implicitly considered that evidence for an improper purpose. <em>Craddock, </em>16 Va.App. at 407, 429 S.E.2d at 892. However, that presumption is not irrebuttable. The primaiy question in any harmless error analysis is whether an error \u201chas had no impact upon the verdict or sentence in a case.\u201d <em>Hackney, </em>28 Va.App. at 296, 504 S.E.2d at 389. Thus, we must, as <em>Cole </em>mandates, determine whether \"the judge considered such inadmissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>evidence in adjudicating the merits of the case.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>16 Va.App. at 116, 428 S.E.2d at 305. When, as in this case, a judge clearly articulates the reasons for his decision, and the improper evidence is not among those reasons, it is clear that the improper evidence did not impact the verdict and the presumption is overcome.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b663-6\">ELDER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUl\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">I join the majority\u2019s holding in Part II.A. that admission of evidence of appellant Sandra Pierce\u2019s perjury conviction was error. However, I believe the decision in <em>Cole v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 113, 428 S.E.2d 303 (1993), relied upon by the majority in Part II.B. to conclude the error was harmless, compels a contrary result in light of our interpretation of it in <em>Craddock v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 402, 429 S.E.2d 889 (1993). I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial, and, thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">In Virginia, non-constitutional error is harmless \u201c[w]hen it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-678.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">\u201cIf, when all is said and done, [it is clear] that the error did not influence the [fact finder], or had but slight effect, ... the judgment should stand____But if one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened -without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected....

In <em>Cole, </em>the evidence erroneously admitted was the fact that Cole had previously been convicted for grand larceny. 16 Va.App. at 115-16, 428 S.E.2d at 305. The <em>fact </em>of Cole\u2019s prior convictions was admissible at his robbery trial for impeachment purposes, and evidence of <em>the identity and nature </em>of the prior offenses was harmless, we held, because Cole had already \u201copened the door\u201d by \u201cvolunteering] the name of one of the felonies for which he had been convicted\u2014grand larceny\u2014without being asked to do so by the Commonwealth.\u201d Id. at 115, 428 S.E.2d at 305. Thus, the erroneously admitted evidence of Cole\u2019s second prior grand larceny conviction was merely cumulative of the undisputed evidence, first volunteered by Cole, that he had a first prior conviction for grand larceny. <em>See, e.g., Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 639, 113 S.Ct. at 1722, 123 L.Ed.2d at 373-74 (addressing \u201charmless-if-cumulative\u201d analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The majority\u2019s application of <em>Cole </em>fails sufficiently to consider the impact of both Cole\u2019s decision to testify in his bench trial for robbery and Cole\u2019s \u201copening] the door\u201d to cross-examination about the identity and nature of his prior convictions for theft by volunteering testimony that he had been convicted for grand larceny. We made clear the impact of these factors in <em>Craddock, </em>16 Va.App. 402, 429 S.E.2d 889. <em>Craddock </em>involved a prosecutor\u2019s reference in closing argument to the defendant\u2019s earlier rejection of a plea offer. <em>Id. </em>at 403-04, 429 S.E.2d at 890-91. The defendant twice objected and pointed out the prosecutor was arguing facts not in evidence, but the trial court overruled those objections. <em>Id. </em>We concluded both that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper and, \u201cbased on the record, that the trial judge clearly failed to recognize the impropriety of these remarks because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>he twice failed to sustain appellant\u2019s objections thereto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406, 429 S.E.2d at 892. We explained further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">This case is clearly distinguishable from our recent holding in <em>Cole v. Commonwealth, </em>in which the challenged evidence concerning a prior conviction was admissible as it pertained to credibility. In <em>Cole, </em>there was no evidence that the trial judge considered the challenged evidence for any reason other than its proper purpose. We emphasized, however, that <em>Cole </em>did not hold that \u201cthe admission of improper evidence in a bench trial [could] never result in reversible error.\u201d [16 Va.App.] at [116], 428 S.E.2d at 305. The facts in this case present just such an example. Here, the challenged information could not properly have been introduced into evidence for any purpose and should not have been included in the prosecutor\u2019s argument. Therefore, <em>we must presume, based on the trial judge\u2019s failure to sustain appellant\u2019s objection, that the [inadmissible] information ... was considered for an improper purpose.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 406-07, 429 S.E.2d at 892 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">In <em>Craddock, </em>in contrast to <em>Cole, </em>the challenged argument referred to evidence that had not been admitted and, in fact, was not admissible for any purpose. <em>Craddock, </em>16 Va.App. at 406-07, 429 S.E.2d at 892. Similarly, in Pierce\u2019s case, because Pierce did not testify, the fact of her prior conviction was not admissible for any purpose,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as the majority recognizes in Part II.A. Although the trial court here acknowledged some potential for prejudicial effect from the challenged evidence when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>said \u201c[w]e don\u2019t have a jury so I\u2019ll deny the motion for a mistrial,\u201d it then said, <em>\u201cbut I\u2019m going to allow it [into evidence] </em>because ... it\u2019s part of the interrogation process.\u201d (Emphasis added). The trial court\u2019s statement that this evidence was \u201cpart of the interrogation process\u201d does not rebut the presumption of <em>Craddock </em>that the admission into evidence of testimony concerning the perjury conviction shows the trial judge \u201cconsidered [the evidence] for an improper purpose.\u201d <em>Craddock, </em>16 Va.App. at 407, 429 S.E.2d at 892. <em>Compare id. with Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 169, 186-88, 596 S.E.2d 563, 572-73 (2004) (applying principle in rape case where victim\u2019s pre-trial statement was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule only for the limited purpose of establishing a recent complaint of rape and where the <em>trial judge, in a detailed and carefully articulated ruling, \u201cspecifically said he did \u2018not admit [the challenged statement], and [would] not consider it relevant to ... issues\u201d other than to establish a recent complaint of rape </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Further, and contrary to the position taken by the majority in footnote 4, I do not believe the trial court\u2019s partial articulation of the reason for its decision in this case sufficiently rebutted the <em>Cole/Craddock </em>presumption that the court improperly considered the admitted evidence of Pierce\u2019s perjury conviction in determining her guilt. The trial court commented that, before defense witness Kisha LeBray testified, this was a \u201cclose\u201d case on the issue of possession with intent to distribute. Its statement that \u201cthe testimony of Miss LeBray makes it pretty clear that this defendant was at least a co-possessor of the items\u201d does not permit the conclusion that the court gave little or no consideration to the erroneously admitted evidence of the perjury conviction in determining what weight to give the testimony of LeBray. The court could have attributed greater credibility to LeBray\u2019s testimony and drawn more extensive inferences from it precisely because it rejected Pierce\u2019s denial of possession to police based on the court\u2019s admission of evidence of Pierce\u2019s prior perjury conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Applying harmless error terminology, neither the \u201ccumulative\u201d evidence nor the \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence formulation of harmless error analysis supports the conclusion that the admission of the challenged evidence was harmless. <em>See, e.g., Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 639, 113 S.Ct. at 1722, 123 L.Ed.2d at 373-74 (holding improperly admitted evidence may be harmless if \u201ccumulative\u201d); <em>Lane, </em>474 U.S. at 450, 106 S.Ct. at 732, <em>88 </em>L.Ed.2d at 826 (holding improperly admitted evidence may be harmless if other evidence of guilt is \u201coverwhelming\u201d and the error is insignificant by comparison). Here and in <em>Craddock, </em>unlike in <em>Cole, </em>the admission of or reference to the challenged evidence was not merely cumulative of other, undisputed evidence. In addition, we cannot conclude on this record that the evidence of Pierce\u2019s guilt was so \u201coverwhelming\u201d and the error so insignificant by comparison that the error \u201c \u2018did not influence the [fact finder], or had but slight effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clay, </em>262 Va. at 260, 546 S.E.2d at 731 (quoting <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 764, 66 S.Ct. at 1248, 90 L.Ed. at 1566). The evidence supported a finding that Pierce smoked two marijuana cigars on her front porch in full view of a police officer conducting surveillance, which supported a conviction for possession. However, to prove Pierce possessed marijuana with an intent to distribute, the Commonwealth relied on circumstantial evidence that she constructively possessed a much larger quantity of marijuana, approximately eight ounces, found inside her house. LeBray\u2019s testimony, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, established only that LeBray saw a bag of marijuana atop a dresser in one of two bedrooms in Pierce\u2019s two-story house,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at a time when appellant Pierce was at some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>unspecified location inside the house.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> LeBray also testified that their cousin, James Pierce, was standing next to the bag of marijuana when LeBray first saw it and that, when LeBray reported the police were at the front door, James Pierce \u201cgrabbed [the bag]\u201d and ran.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Given the weakness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>evidence proving Pierce\u2019s constructive possession of the large bag of marijuana, we cannot conclude, without usurping the trial court\u2019s fact-finding function, that when the trial court determined what weight to give to Pierce\u2019s statement to Detective Grover that she did not know what was going on in her house, the trial court\u2019s erroneous admission of evidence of Pierce\u2019s prior perjury conviction and her acknowledgment of guilt for that offense \u201c \u2018did not influence the [fact finder], or had but slight effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clay, </em>262 Va. at 260, 546 S.E.2d at 731 (quoting <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 764, 66 S.Ct. at 1248, 90 L.Ed. at 1566).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Because I believe our prior holdings in <em>Cole </em>and <em>Craddock </em>compel the conclusion that the trial court\u2019s error was not harmless, I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\">. Even if Pierce had later opted to testify, our case law would support the conclusion that this decision would not render harmless the court\u2019s <em>knowingly </em>erroneous admission of impeachment evidence in the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief. <em>Cf. Purvis v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 298, 309-10, 522 S.E.2d 898, 903 (2000) (holding erroneous refusal to sever offenses in bench trial is not harmless error where only fact that would render refusal harmless is defendant\u2019s decision to testify and clear evidence establishes \u201cthat the trial court ... used the 'harmless error doctrine ... prospectively ... as a basis to disregard an established rule of law\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Hackney v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 288, 296, 504 S.E.2d 385, 389 (1998) (en banc))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b668-5\">. The majority asserts \"LeBray testified that the marijuana was on top of [appellant] Pierce's dresser in [appellant Pierce\u2019s] bedroom.\u201d The Commonwealth does not contend, however, that the bedroom was appellant\u2019s, and the evidence fails to support the majority's assertion that the bedroom was appellant\u2019s. Although appellant Sandra Pierce was the lessor of the residence, the evidence established the residence had at least two bedrooms. As many as eight people may have been present when the police \"froze\u201d the scene that day while they obtained a warrant, and no evidence established how many people resided with appellant on a full-time or part-time basis. LeBray\u2019s testimony indicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ed that James Pierce was present that day while taking a shower and changing clothes, which suggests he may have been at least a part-time resident. Appellant\u2019s statement to Detective Grover, offered by the Commonwealth, suggested that appellant had children, who may also have resided with her. On the subject of where the marijuana was located, LeBray testified that, \"when I ran upstairs, she has like the two-piece bedroom set, I think it\u2019s called a hutch, the taller dresser, it was on top of the dresser,\u201d and James Pierce was \"standing right beside it.\u201d LeBray did not testify that the bedroom in which the dresser was located was a bedroom in which appellant Pierce resided or slept. The mere fact that LeBray referred to the furniture as appellant Pierce\u2019s does not preclude the reasonable inference that appellant, the lessor, had furnished the entire house and routinely occupied some other bedroom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\">. Although LeBray testified on direct that appellant Pierce \"was present\u201d while James Pierce was standing next to the marijuana atop the dresser in the upstairs bedroom, LeBray said \"[appellant Pierce] was present <em>but she had just walked in </em>\u201d (emphasis added), and LeBray did not indicate in what part of the house appellant was present while James Pierce stood next to the marijuana. LeBray, still testifying on direct, clarified that while she and appellant were in the house, LeBray saw the marijuana only while she, LeBray, was upstairs and that appellant was not upstairs during that period of time. The trial court was free to disregard some or all of LeBray\u2019s testimony, but if it disregarded the testimony that appellant was present only downstairs, it was left with the vague testimony that appellant \"was present\u201d at some unspecified location in the house \"when [LeBray] went in the house [and] Mr. Pierce had the marijuana on top of the dresser\u201d in the upstairs bedroom. Thus, this evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, establishes only that appellant was present inside the house when the marijuana was in plain view on the dresser and that she may or may not have seen it. At its best, this testimony constituted very weak evidence that appellant exercised joint constructive possession of the bag of marijuana that James Pierce had in his actual possession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\">. Thus, the record also does not support the majority's statement that \"LeBray testified she never saw anyone else,\u201d which would include her first cousin James Pierce, \"in actual possession of the marijuana.\u201d LeBray testified only that, \"when [she] first saw [the bag of marijuana],\u201d Mr. Pierce \"was standing right beside it\u201d and that he did not \"have it in his possession later downstairs.\u201d LeBray also testified that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>when she announced the police were at the front door, Mr. Pierce \"grabbed it\u201d and ran through \"the second bedroom\u201d and that she could not see whether he had the marijuana in his possession after that point in time because she had turned to go back downstairs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
