On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in granting Jury Instruction Number 7, arguing that instruction \u201cunconstitutionally commented upon [his] failure to testify by informing the jury that it could infer [he] was the thief from his failure to testify....\u201d Finding no error, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">\u201cUnder familiar principles of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party that prevailed below.\u201d <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 543, 586 S.E.2d 876, 877 (2003). Consistent with this principle, the evidence proved that during the early morning hours of October 18, 2004, someone broke into the Sycamore Grocery Store in Gretna and stole cigarettes and Virginia Lottery scratch-off tickets.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later that same morning, storeowner Douglas Dalton called the Virginia Lottery\u2019s hotline and reported the serial numbers of the tickets missing following the break-in. Lottery officials flagged those tickets in its statewide, computerized database system. Once flagged, if any of the missing tickets was presented for payment, the computer would generate an exception message, directing the cashier to not redeem the ticket and to contact Lottery officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Around 11:30 a.m. that same day, appellant entered the Fast Stop Food Mart in Altavista, located approximately fifteen miles from the Sycamore Grocery. The cashier knew appellant because she had lived \u201cacross the street\u201d from him for approximately thirteen years. Appellant handed the cash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>ier three scratch-off tickets to determine if they were winners. When she scanned the tickets into the store\u2019s Lottery computer terminal, the Lottery database recognized those tickets as three of the eight reported missing following the Sycamore Grocery break-in, and generated an exception message directing her to contact Lottery officials. Unable to redeem the tickets, the cashier handed them back to appellant, who then left the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">A lottery \u201cexception activity\u201d report, admitted into evidence, detailed the exact time, 11:31 a.m., and location where three tickets<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were presented for payment, and identified each ticket as previously reported lost or stolen. Using this report, a Virginia Lottery investigator tracked the three tickets to the Altavista Fast Stop Food Mart, where the cashier identified appellant as the person who had presented tickets for payment which had been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">At trial, appellant called as his only witness Pittsylvania Sheriffs Investigator Boyd Arnold, whose testimony showed inconsistencies between the cashier\u2019s statements to him during his investigation of the incident and her testimony at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Among the instructions the trial court gave the jury were Instruction 2, instructing it that \u201c[t]here is no burden on the [appellant] to produce any evidence\u201d; Instruction 3, instructing it that \u201c[t]he [appellant] does not have to testify, and exercise of that right cannot be considered by [it]\u201d; and Instruction 7, providing in pertinent part: \u201cProof of the exclusive personal possession by the [appellant] of recently stolen goods is a circumstance from which you may reasonably infer that the [appellant] was the thief unless the [appellant] offers a reasonable account of possession consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>innocence which the Commonwealth has failed to prove untrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Appellant timely objected to Instruction 7, arguing that the words \u201cunless the [appellant] offers a reasonable account of possession consistent with innocence\u201d impermissibly told the jury that it could infer appellant\u2019s guilt if he did not testify, and thereby violated his Fifth Amendment right under the United States Constitution not to testify. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred, as a matter of law, when it granted Instruction 7. \u201cA reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u2018to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gaines v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 562, 568-69, 574 S.E.2d 775, 778 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (quoting <em>Swisher v. Swisher, </em>223 Va. 499, 503, 290 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1982))). \u201c[It] is the duty of the jury to consider the instructions as a whole and in the light of the evidence applicable to the issues presented.\u201d <em>Rollston v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 535, 541, 399 S.E.2d 823, 826 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">In considering appellant\u2019s challenge to Instruction 7, we note that the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in pertinent part, that an accused in a criminal case \u201ccannot be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself____\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. Consistent with that protection, the government is prohibited from telling a jury that \u201ca defendant\u2019s silence is \u2018evidence of <em>guilt.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Portuondo v. Agard, </em>529 U.S. 61, 69, 120 S.Ct. 1119, 1125, 146 L.Ed.2d 47 (2000) (quoting <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1233, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965)) (internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In determining whether an instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>given by a trial court impermissibly commented upon an accused\u2019s right not to testify, we consider whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201cthe language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the [failure] of the accused to testify.\u201d <em>Hazel v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 403, 411, 524 S.E.2d 134, 138 (2000) [ (citations omitted) ]. Thus, a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to contradict the incriminating evidence presented by the prosecution does not offend the Fifth Amendment if, in context, the comment could be understood to refer to contradictory evidence from sources other than the defendant. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 48, 51, 372 S.E.2d 134, 136 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\"><em>Pollino v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 243, 250, 590 S.E.2d 621, 625 (2004) (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Here, Instruction 7 informed the jury that if it found the evidence proved that appellant presented recently stolen lottery tickets to the cashier, it could reasonably infer that he stole those tickets, unless he offered a reasonable account of his possession of those tickets, consistent with his innocence, that the Commonwealth did not disprove. By its verdict, the jury determined that appellant failed to offer a reasonable account of his possession of those stolen tickets, and inferred that he was the thief.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">In addition to Instruction 7, which appellant argues told the jury it could infer his guilt from his not testifying, the trial court also instructed the jury that appellant did not have to present any evidence (Instruction 2). It further instructed the jury that appellant did not have to testify and that it could not consider his failure to testify in its deliberations (Instruction 3). Virginia appellate courts have consistently held that a jury is deemed to have considered the instructions given to it as a whole, and in light of evidence applicable to the issues presented to it. See <em>Jordan v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 322, 329, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>649 S.E.2d 709, 713 (2007); <em>Walshaw v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 103, 119, 603 S.E.2d 633, 641 (2004); <em>Rollston, </em>11 Va.App. at 541, 399 S.E.2d at 826. We find nothing in the record to suggest that the jury did not do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">From the record before us, we cannot conclude that Instruction 7, particularly considered together with Instructions 2 and 3, \u201cwas manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the [failure] of the accused to testify.\u201d <em>Pollino, </em>42 Va.App. at 250, 590 S.E.2d at 625 (quoting <em>Hazel, </em>31 Va.App. at 411, 524 S.E.2d at 138) (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction of larceny, third or subsequent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\">. The tickets reported missing were: three \"Triple Sevens,\u201d ticket numbers 11, 12, and 13 (each a $5 ticket); two \"Double Down Doubler\u201d tickets, numbers 31 and 32 (each a $2 ticket); and two \"Rag Top Riches,\u201d ticket numbers 15 and 16 (each a $2 ticket).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\">. The report listed \"Double Down Doubler\u201d ticket number 31, \"Rag Top Riches\u201d ticket number 15, and \u201cTriple Sevens\u201d ticket number 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\">. The inconsistencies related to the wording of the message that appeared on the Lottery terminal when the cashier scanned in the tickets, the make and model of the car in which appellant arrived as a passenger at the Altavista store, and the name of the person who drove the car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\">. \"Our courts have consistently held that the protections afforded under the Virginia Constitution are co-extensive with those in the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>States Constitution.\u201d <em>Henry v.
