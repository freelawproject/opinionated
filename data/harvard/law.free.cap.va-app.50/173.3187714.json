ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">Convicted of driving after being declared an habitual offender, Elsie Lorraine Lilly contends that a partial repeal of the habitual offender statute in 1999 rendered continuing enforcement of the unrepealed portion unconstitutional. She also contends the trial court improperly precluded her counsel from informing the jury, prior to sentencing, about the mandatory minimum punishment she would face as a declared habitual offender and the legislative abolition of further civil declarations of habitual offender status. Finding her conviction suffered from neither error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">After her third drunk driving conviction in 1996, Lilly was civilly declared an habitual offender. Her driver\u2019s license was revoked indefinitely as a result. Undeterred, Lilly continued to drive illegally and was convicted in September 2008 for driving as an habitual offender. Lilly was caught driving again in July 2004. The Commonwealth indicted Lilly for driving after having been declared an habitual offender (second or subsequent offense) triggering the mandatory mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>mum sentence of one-year incarceration pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-857(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">At trial, Lilly attacked the habitual offender statute as unconstitutional on various grounds. The 1999 partial repeal of the habitual offender statute, Lilly argued, violates (i) the equal protection and due process provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and (ii) the special laws prohibitions of \u00a7\u00a7 14-15 of Article IV of the Virginia Constitution. Lilly also claimed the right to comment upon, present testimony concerning, and receive jury instructions about, the mandatory minimum sentence required by the habitual offender statute, Code \u00a7 46.2-357, and the legislative discontinuance of further civil habitual offender declarations. Finding none of these arguments persuasive, the trial court entered final judgment confirming the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. Similarly unpersuaded, we affirm Lilly\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">A. <em>The Constitutionality of the 1999 Partial Repeal Of The Habitual Offender Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\"><em>Statutory History. </em>The General Assembly enacted Virginia\u2019s first vehicular habitual offender statute in 1968. <em>See </em>former Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.1-387.1 to 46.1-387.12 (Supp. 1968) (1968 Va. Acts, ch. 476). Its purpose was to \u201cpromote highway safety by denying the privilege of operating motor vehicles to those persons \u2018who by their conduct and record\u2019 have demonstrated their lack of concern for the safety of others and then-disrespect for law and authority.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 808, 812, 252 S.E.2d 299, 301 (1979) (quoting former Code \u00a7 46.1-387.1); <em>see also Varga v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 547, 552, 536 S.E.2d 711, 714 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The habitual offender statute served as a civil recidivist provision mandating revocation of a driver\u2019s license upon conviction of a certain number of predicate driving offenses. The statute also created a criminal offense of driving after being declared an habitual offender. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-357 (formerly Code \u00a7 46.1-387.8 (1968 Va. Acts, ch. 476)). Over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the years, the General Assembly amended the habitual offender statute several times\u2014sometimes including new predicate offenses, sometimes excluding prior ones.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Effective July 1, 1999, the General Assembly repealed the then-current method of declaring a driver to be an habitual offender. Under that process, the Division of Motor Vehicles would make such a declaration in a civil administrative proceeding subject to judicial review. The General Assembly, however, did not repeal the criminal provision prohibiting previously declared habitual offenders from driving. <em>See </em>1999 Va. Acts, chs. 945, 987; see <em>generally Varga, </em>260 Va. at 549 n. 1, 536 S.E.2d at 712 n. 1 (noting \u201cthe status of persons declared habitual offenders prior to [1999] was not affected by the repeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Following the partial repeal, an habitual offender\u2019s first violation generally receives a misdemeanor conviction carrying a mandatory minimum sentence of ten days in jail. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(l). An habitual offender caught driving in an unsafe manner, or while intoxicated (if previously convicted as a drunk driver), generally receives a felony conviction carrying a mandatory minimum sentence of one year. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2). The same one-year mandatory minimum sentence is imposed on any recidivist who, like Lilly, has been previously convicted of driving as an habitual offender. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">To punish future recidivist drivers who had not been declared habitual offenders under the pre-1999 system, the General Assembly chose to rely on mandatory minimum punishments tailored to specific predicate offenses at the offender\u2019s criminal trial rather than continue the cumbersome civil declaration process. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-36.1, 18.2-51.4, 18.2-270, 46.2-391. The 1999 partial repeal reformed the treatment of recidivist drivers to continue recognizing the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>safety threat deemed to exist with drivers previously declared habitual offenders, while simultaneously ensuring that offenders later found to be recidivists received enhanced penalties roughly proportionate to that of declared habitual offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><em>Equal Protection &amp; Due Process. </em>Lilly argues the 1999 partial repeal created an unconstitutional anomaly by dividing recidivist drivers into two categories: those declared habitual offenders prior to July 1, 1999 (thus subject to conviction and penalties for driving while in that status) and those who commit certain recidivist driving offenses on or after July 1, 1999 (thus subject only to specific recidivism penalties of the underlying offenses). Offenders in the first group, Lilly points out, receive mandatory minimum sentences under Code \u00a7 46.2-357, while offenders in the second group are subject to a range of sentencing options. Lilly argues this disparity violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the special laws prohibitions of the Virginia Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">As always, we \u201cbegin our analysis with basic principles of judicial review. All legislative acts are \u2018presumed to be constitutional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyd v. County of Henrico, </em>42 Va.App. 495, 506, 592 S.E.2d 768, 774 (2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>In re Phillips, </em>265 Va. 81, 85, 574 S.E.2d 270, 272 (2003)). \u201cThis presumption is \u2018one of the strongest known to the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 507, 592 S.E.2d at 774 (quoting <em>Harrison v. Day, </em>200 Va. 764, 770, 107 S.E.2d 594, 598 (1959)). \u201cUnder it, courts must \u2018resolve any reasonable doubt\u2019 regarding the constitutionality of a law in favor of its validity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cTo doubt is to affirm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Peery v. Bd. of Funeral Dirs., </em>203 Va. 161, 165, 123 S.E.2d 94, 97 (1961) (quoting <em>City of Roanoke v. Elliott, </em>123 Va. 393, 406, 96 S.E. 819, 824 (1918))).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">These principles of judicial restraint apply with particular force in cases where, as here, the litigant cannot claim membership in any insular and discreet suspect class or assert a violation of any fundamental right. In such cases, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s equal protection and due process clauses invalidate only those laws that offend principles of minimum rationality. Minimum rationality requires only that \u201ca rational relationship exists between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose,\u201d and classifications reviewed under it are \u201caccorded a strong presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 290, 308, 645 S.E.2d 448, 459 (2007) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Under the minimum rationality standard, the General Assembly need not \u201cactually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). To be sure, the legislative classification \u201cmust be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Courts cannot subject a reasonably hypothesized state of facts to the crucible of \u201ccourtroom factfinding\u201d and must even accept \u201crational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 645 S.E.2d at 460 (citations omitted). And the Commonwealth \u201chas no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality\u201d of the challenged classification because the \u201cburden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308-09, 645 S.E.2d at 460 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Applying this standard, we find the current habitual offender statute free of any constitutional infirmity under the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only conceptual disparity identified by Lilly involves treating recidivist drivers declared habitual offenders prior to July 1,1999, differently than drivers convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>of recidivist offenses on or after July 1, 1999. The 1999 partial repeal, she asserts, created \u201ca situation where two people identically situated\u2014but for time\u2014are treated entirely differently with no discernible state purpose.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The underlying premise of Lilly\u2019s argument is little more than a broadside, albeit unintended, against <em>any </em>sequential changes in recidivism laws that distinguish between predicate offenses committed before and recidivist offenses committed after each statutory change. Under Lilly\u2019s approach, no substantive amendments could ever be enacted to recidivism statutes because such amendments would, of necessity, divide offenders into before and after categories. <em>See generally McIntosh v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 330, 330-33, 191 S.E.2d 791, 792-94 (1972); <em>Salama v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 320, 321-24, 380 S.E.2d 433, 434-35 (1989). To be sure, consistent with Lilly\u2019s argument, it could just as well be said that all statutory changes are irrational because they treat people differently on no other basis than the fortuity of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Lilly disclaims these logical extensions of her argument, focusing instead on the more discrete disparity existing between drivers declared to be habitual offenders prior to 1999 and those not declared habitual offenders but who committed the same offenses on or after 1999. Even if we allow Lilly this conceptual limitation on her argument, no constitutional infirmity arises. The distinction drawn by the General Assembly rationally balances the need to reform the cumbersome civil administrative process of declaring a driver to be an habitual offender with the corresponding need to retain the benefits of the old system. The going-forward strategy of the 1999 amendments more tightly calibrated future recidivism punishments to underlying offenses. The compromise also avoided the possibility of <em>ex post facto </em>concerns that might arise if drivers declared habitual offenders before 1999 were later reclassified under specific recidivism statutes authorizing a different range of punishments than the mandatory m\u00ednimums always required by Code \u00a7 46.2-357.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>True, the ultimate balance of these competing concerns produced an asymmetry of sorts. But as long as a legislative classification \u201chas some \u2018reasonable basis,\u2019 it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification \u2018is not with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970) (citation omitted). \u201cThe problems of government,\u201d after all, \u201care practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations\u201d that necessarily defy perfect or, for that matter, considerably less-than-perfect, legal symmetries. <em>Id. </em>Our judicial role \u201cis only to ascertain that a rational basis exists for the challenged distinction, not whether it is the best or only choice.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>274 Va. at 311, 645 S.E.2d at 461. That conclusion is all the more true in cases, like this one, involving legislative \u201cspecification of punishments\u201d\u2014matters ordinarily understood as \u201cpeculiarly questions of legislative policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 175-76, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2926, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\"><em>Virginia Constitution. </em>The corresponding provisions of the Virginia Constitution go no further than their federal counterparts. \u201cWe have \u2018consistently held that the protections afforded under the Virginia Constitution are co-extensive with those in the United States Constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rowley v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 181, 187 n. 2, 629 S.E.2d 188, 191 n. 2 (2006) (citations omitted). The federal equal protection and due process principles, therefore, subsume any analysis of parallel provisions in the Virginia Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Equally so, the prohibitions against \u201cspecial, private, or local law\u201d found in Article IV, \u00a7\u00a7 14-15, of the Virginia Constitution add nothing to the minimum rationality test employed by longstanding due process and equal protection doctrines. Virginia courts \u201capply the so-called \u2018rational basis\u2019 test\u201d when testing the constitutionality of legislation \u201cunder due process, equal protection, <em>and </em>special legislation provisions.\u201d <em>Willis v. Mullett, </em>263 Va. 653, 659, 561 S.E.2d 705, 709 (2002) (emphasis added). \u201cThe constitutional provisions prohibiting special legislation do not proscribe classifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>tions.\u201d <em>Jefferson Green Unit Owners Ass\u2019n v. Gwinn, </em>262 Va. 449, 459, 551 S.E.2d 339, 344 (2001) (citation omitted). Instead, the special laws prohibitions recognize \u201cthe necessity for and the reasonableness of classification are primarily questions for the legislature. If any state of facts can be reasonably conceived, that would sustain it, that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 551 S.E.2d at 345 (citations omitted). To prevail, the challenger must prove the classification to be without a \u201creasonable basis\u201d and \u201cessentially arbitrary,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citation omitted)\u2014a burden of proof Lilly cannot shoulder in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">B. <em>Discussing the Mandatory Minimum Sentence and 1999 Partial Repeal During the Guilt Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Lilly also claims the trial court denied her an impartial \u201cjury of her peers\u201d in violation of both the United States and Virginia Constitutions. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. amend. VI; Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. At the time they found her guilty, Lilly reasons, the jurors did not know of the mandatory minimum sentences required by the habitual offender statute. Nor did they know that the 1999 partial repeal limited future prosecutions under the statute only to those drivers who were declared habitual offenders prior to July 1,1999. We reject both arguments because, by raising matters having nothing to do with Lilly\u2019s criminal culpability, they amount to little more than an effort at inviting jury nullification on the issue of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">A juror\u2019s sworn obligation is to follow the law, not question it. While we are not naive enough to think jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>nullification never occurs (it \u201cundoubtedly\u201d does in some cases, <em>Walls v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 273, 282, 563 S.E.2d 384, 388 (2002)), no principle of constitutional import entitles \u201ca party to encourage such behavior,\u201d <em>id., </em>or to even imply its legitimacy. Consequently, defendants cannot use <em>voir dire</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>witness testimony,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> counsel\u2019s argument,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or jury instructions to comment on legal propositions wholly unrelated to the specific factual issues before the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When decoupled from specific factfinding issues, \u201cabstract propositions of law do little to help and much to mystify a jury.\u201d <em>Newton v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 433, 458, 512 S.E.2d 846, 858 (1999) (citation omitted). Courts similarly reject efforts by both prosecutors and defense counsel to inject issues of punishment into the guilt phase of a jury trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Lilly\u2019s repeated attempts to do so in this case were correctly resisted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Lilly further contends that the General Assembly has gone too far in its \u201cquest for sentencing control\u201d by enacting mandatory minimum sentences that impermissibly remove \u201cany judicial consideration or evaluation of the matters historically considered by the courts.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. She sees mandatory minimum sentences in general, like the habitual offender statute in particular, as violations of \u201cdue process\u201d that should be judicially declared invalid. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Lilly\u2019s appeal to tradition and history, however, unknowingly produces the opposite conclusion. Truth be told, American juries historically exercised little, if any, discretionary control over criminal sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">In the early days of the Republic, when imprisonment had only recently emerged as an alternative to the death penalty, confinement in public stocks, or whipping in the town square, the period of incarceration was generally prescribed with specificity by the legislature. Each crime had its defined punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\"><em>United States v. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41, 45, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 2613, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978); <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 467, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 1928, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991) (noting \u201c[determinate sentences were found in this country\u2019s penal codes from its inception\u201d). The historic norm for the jury was to determine only guilt or innocence, leaving the court alone to fix the punishment consistent with legislatively mandated sentences. Later statutory reforms produced wide sentencing ranges within which trial judges could exercise individualized discretion. <em>See Grayson, </em>438 U.S. at 45-46, 98 S.Ct. at 2613-14. Some states, like Virginia, authorized juries to ascertain a specific felony sentence within the statutory range, subject to the trial court\u2019s power of suspension. <em>See generally </em>Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Virginia Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7\u00a7 19:1, 19:5 (2006); John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 63.3-2 (3d ed. 2002 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The legislative development of the mandatory minimum sentence, however, produced a floor below which no judge or jury could go. A trial court\u2019s authority to depart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>downward below a mandatory minimum is \u201cnonexistent,\u201d <em>Mouberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 576, 585, 575 S.E.2d 567, 571 (2003), because the legislative purpose was to divest trial judges and juries of \u201call discretion\u201d to sentence below the threshold minimum, <em>In re Commonwealth of Virginia, </em>229 Va. 159, 163, 326 S.E.2d 695, 697 (1985). Given this history, we find no basis for Lilly\u2019s characterization of mandatory minimum sentences as a legislative usurpation of a historically unique judicial function. Just the opposite is true: The development of mandatory minimum sentences reflects the traditional legislative role in creating statewide uniformity, at least at the lower end of the punishment scale, for all sentences for the specified crimes. This can hardly be a due process violation, given that the General Assembly \u201chas the power to define criminal punishments without giving the courts any sentencing discretion.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>500 U.S. at 467, 111 S.Ct. at 1928 (citing <em>Ex parte United States, </em>242 U.S. 27, 41-42, 37 S.Ct. 72, 74, 61 L.Ed. 129 (1916)).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In sum, we reject Lilly\u2019s constitutional challenges to the 1999 partial repeal of the habitual offender statute and her claimed right to advise the jury during the guilt phase of her trial about the partial repeal and the mandatory minimum sentence required by the statute. We thus affirm her conviction for driving a vehicle after having been declared an habitual offender, a second or subsequent offense, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\">. <em>See </em>former Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-351(1)(b) (1997 Va.
