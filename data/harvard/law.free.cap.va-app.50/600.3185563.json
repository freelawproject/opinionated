His convictions should be overturned, Johnson argues, because the trial court erroneously disqualified his attorney prior to trial and appointed substitute counsel to defend him at trial. We disagree and affirm Johnson\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">Early one morning, Chonece Coleman witnessed a fight between Johnson and Edward Green. It appeared to Coleman and to other observers that Green had gotten the better of Johnson during the brawl. Later that morning, Johnson approached Green with a handgun and shot him three times. Green survived and identified Johnson as the shooter. Johnson was arrested for the crime and hired Joe Garrett, Esq., to represent him in court. Meanwhile, Coleman was arrested on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>unrelated drug charges. He too hired Garrett to defend him in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Prior to trial in Johnson\u2019s case, the Commonwealth moved to disqualify Garrett from representing Johnson. Based on a written statement Coleman had given to police investigators, the prosecutor said he intended to call Coleman to the witness stand to testify against Johnson. Coleman was a \u201ckey witness for the Commonwealth,\u201d the prosecutor asserted, and Coleman\u2019s testimony (if consistent with his written statement) would be adverse to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In response, Garrett admitted he represented Coleman on pending, unrelated drug charges. Garrett also acknowledged that Coleman was a friend of Green, the alleged victim in Johnson\u2019s case, and that Coleman\u2019s testimony would likely be \u201cadverse to Mr. Johnson and consistent with the Commonwealth\u2019s case.\u201d Garrett nevertheless argued, \u201cI cannot disqualify myself in every case in which a past client or, you know, a current client is a witness and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any ethical or legal requirement that I do so.\u201d Consistent with this view, Garrett advised Coleman and Johnson of his joint representation and secured unqualified waivers of any potential conflict from both.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The trial court disqualified Garrett from representing Johnson. To rule otherwise, the trial court reasoned, might place Garrett in a position where he would be \u201cdiscrediting one client\u2019s testimony in order to protect another client.\u201d Substitute counsel appeared at trial to defend Johnson. Coleman took the stand and testified about the fight he observed between Johnson and Green. Johnson\u2019s trial counsel cross-examined Coleman seeking to impeach his credibility. In closing argument, the prosecutor asserted Johnson shot Green in retaliation for \u201c[gjetting beat up in front of his friends\u201d\u2014a motive supported in part by the testimony of Coleman as well as other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">On appeal, Johnson claims the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by disqualifying Garrett from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>representing him at trial. Citing <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006), Johnson argues that his right to retained counsel should be deemed a \u201cstructural right\u201d subject to few limitations. While acknowledging that an actual, unwaived conflict of interest would authorize a trial court to reject a criminal defendant\u2019s counsel of choice, Johnson contends a mere <em>potential </em>conflict of interest, even a serious one, can never be an adequate basis for disqualification if the clients knowingly waive the potential conflict. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">To begin with, we accept that a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to retained counsel qualifies as a \u201cstructural defect,\u201d a proposition recently recognized by <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 126 S.Ct. at 2564. The structural quality of the error, however, tells us nothing about the scope of the right or any constitutionally permissible limitation that may circumscribe it. The \u201cstructural\u201d adjective merely denotes that the <em>violation </em>of the right cannot be subjected to the harmless error doctrine on appeal. <em>Id. </em>Whether the right has been violated in the first place is not affected by the structural classification of the alleged violation. A constitutional defect, in other words, must first be shown to exist before its structural or nonstructural qualities become relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Writing for the majority, Justice Scalia in <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>emphasized this distinction: \u201cNothing we have said today casts any doubt or places any qualification upon our previous holdings that limit the right to counsel of choice and recognize the authority of trial courts to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to argue before them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 S.Ct. at 2565. One of those \u201cprevious holdings\u201d was <em>Wheat v. United States, </em>486 U.S. 153, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988), which \u201crecognized a trial court\u2019s wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness\u201d and protected the judiciary\u2019s \u201cindependent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>\u2014 U.S. at---, 126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>S.Ct. at 2565-66 (citing <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 160, 163-64, 108 S.Ct. at 1697-98, 1699-1700). \u201cNone of these limitations on the right to choose one\u2019s counsel is relevant here,\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>made clear. <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 S.Ct. at 2566.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Our analysis thus begins not with <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>but with <em>Wheat, </em>which explained that the \u201cSixth Amendment right to choose one\u2019s own counsel is circumscribed in several important respects.\u201d <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 159, 108 S.Ct. at 1697. This limitation stems from the \u201cessential aim\u201d of the Sixth Amendment right to retained counsel, which is \u201cto guarantee an effective advocate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is particularly true where, as here, conflict-of-interest concerns intersect the Sixth Amendment debate. Trial courts \u201cface the prospect of being \u2018whipsawed\u2019 by assertions of error no matter which way they rule,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 161, 108 S.Ct. at 1698\u2014accused on direct appeal of depriving a defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to retained counsel (if the court disqualifies counsel) or challenged on collateral habeas review of violating the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel (if the court refuses to disqualify counsel). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>81 F.3d 1321, 1324 (4th Cir.1996) (holding that a trial court \u201cmust have sufficiently broad discretion to rule without fear\u201d of being reversed by either pull of the whipsaw).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Given these competing constitutional concerns, trial courts \u201cmust be allowed substantial latitude in refusing waivers of conflicts of interest not only in those rare cases where an actual conflict may be demonstrated before trial, but in the more common cases where a <em>potential for conflict exists </em>which may or may not burgeon into an actual conflict as the trial progresses.\u201d <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 163, 108 S.Ct. at 1699 (emphasis added). This standard gives trial courts \u201cbroad latitude\u201d because the \u201clikelihood and dimensions of nascent conflicts of interest are notoriously hard to predict, even for those thoroughly familiar with criminal trials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162-63, 108 S.Ct. at 1699. It necessarily follows that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>has a unique \u201cobligation to foresee problems over representation that might arise at trial and head them off beforehand.\u201d <em>United States v. Howard, </em>115 F.3d 1151, 1155 (4th Cir.1997) (affirming disqualification of counsel based upon a potential conflict of interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Appellate courts must rely heavily on a trial court\u2019s \u201cinstinct and judgment based on experience in making its decision.\u201d <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 163, 108 S.Ct. at 1699. It should be no surprise, then, that different trial courts faced with the similar circumstances could reach \u201copposite conclusions with equal justification, but that does not mean that one conclusion was \u2018right\u2019 and the other \u2018wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 108 S.Ct. at 1700. \u201cThe evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each case under this standard,\u201d therefore, \u201cmust be left primarily to the informed judgment of the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When reasonable jurists could disagree, the trial court\u2019s ruling should stand on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Employing this standard, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision to disqualify Garrett from representing Johnson at trial. Garrett acknowledged his existing attorney-client relationship with Coleman, Coleman\u2019s friendship with Johnson\u2019s alleged victim, and Coleman\u2019s likely adverse testimony. At trial, Garrett would have found himself in an intractable dilemma: either he could vigorously cross-examine Coleman in an effort to discredit Coleman\u2019s sworn testimony, or he could weaken the intensity of cross-examination (perhaps even abandon the effort altogether) out of a desire to protect Coleman.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Exercising the kind of experienced instinct and judgment <em>Wheat </em>commends, the trial court understandably concluded a serious potential (if not an outright actual) conflict of interest infected Garrett\u2019s continued representation of Johnson. <em>See generally </em>3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 11.9(a), at 652 (2d ed.1999) (recognizing a potential conflict when defense counsel \u201cis currently representing, in another matter, either the victim of the crime or a prosecution witness\u201d); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Stewart, </em>185 F.3d 112, 121 (3d Cir.1999) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>(noting the possibility of a conflict when counsel also represents a \u201cgovernment witness\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Moscony, </em>927 F.2d 742, 749 (3d Cir.1991)); <em>United States v. Bradford, </em>121 F.Supp.2d 454, 456 (W.D.Pa.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Johnson finds fault with this analysis, claiming it fails to give full effect to his waiver of any conflict of interest. We disagree that Johnson\u2019s conflict waiver precluded the trial court from exercising its disqualification discretion. The Sixth Amendment does not \u201cdemand that a court honor his waiver of conflict-free representation.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>\u2014 U.S. at ---, 126 S.Ct. at 2565-66 (citing <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 159-60, 108 S.Ct. at 1697-98). Whether waived or not, actual as well as serious potential conflicts of interest still implicate the judiciary\u2019s \u201cindependent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\u201d <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 160, 108 S.Ct. at 1698. This institutional interest in the appearance, as well as the reality, of propriety cannot be vitiated merely by a client\u2019s waiver. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Finally, Johnson claims our analysis does not take into account his belief that Coleman\u2019s testimony at trial was not \u201cessentially damaging\u201d to his defense and, at any rate, was \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d at best. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14. We need not agree or disagree with this characterization, however, to reject it. When the issue is raised pretrial, the trial court \u201cmust pass on the issue whether or not to allow a waiver of a conflict of interest by a criminal defendant not with the wisdom of hindsight after the trial has taken place, but in the murkier pretrial context when relationships between parties are seen through a glass, darkly.\u201d <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 162, 108 S.Ct. at 1699.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">To be sure, \u201c[i]t is a rare attorney who will be fortunate enough to learn the entire truth from his own client, much less be fully apprised before trial of what each of the Government\u2019s witnesses will say on the stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, 108 S.Ct. at 1699. For the same reason, trial courts must be given broad pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>latitude to address nascent conflicts of interest before they reach the point where they damage the institutional integrity of the trial and inflict actual prejudice on the defendant\u2019s right of effective, undivided advocacy. Consequently, we judge the trial court\u2019s ruling in light of the circumstances facing it at the time of the pretrial decision to disqualify, not through the lens of hindsight after the trial has come to a close.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in disqualifying Garrett from representing Johnson at trial, we affirm Johnson\u2019s convictions for aggravated malicious wounding and use of a firearm during the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-8\">. On brief, Johnson contends the trial court should have conducted a further evidentiary inquiry on the nature of the alleged conflict and also erred in appointing substitute counsel without first permitting him the opportunity to hire his own counsel. Because Johnson made neither argument in the trial court, we will not address them for the first time on appeal. \"As a precondition to appellate review, Rule 5A:18 requires a contemporaneous objection in the trial court to preserve the issue on appeal. Not just any objection will do. It must be both specific and timely\u2014so that the trial judge would know the particular point being made in time to do something about it.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 750, 607 S.E.2d 738, 742 (emphasis in original), <em>adopted upon reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
