Waddler (appellant) of first-degree murder, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-32, second-degree murder, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-32, and two counts of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court denied his right to strike a member of the jury pool, as provided in Code \u00a7 19.2-262. For the reasons stated below, we find the trial court did not err in the selection of the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">At the conclusion of voir dire, appellant and the Commonwealth exercised their peremptory strikes. The trial court excused the people who were not selected to serve on the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Almost immediately, and before the jury was sworn, one of the selected jurors informed a bailiff that he needed to be excused to keep a doctor\u2019s appointment. Upon learning of the problem, the trial court told the bailiff, \u201c[C]all and stop everybody at the door. Don\u2019t have anybody go out.\u201d The trial court then conferred with the parties. Neither party objected to releasing the juror to go to his appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The trial court explained that it would replace the excused juror in the venire, reconstitute the panel from which the jurors were selected, and begin the peremptory strikes anew. Appellant objected to this procedure. He argued that \u201cwe\u2019re both doing it with full knowledge of what the other party has done and I don\u2019t think that is fair to the defendant.\u201d The trial court noted that appellant\u2019s argument \u201ccuts both ways\u201d and added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">but really neither side knows the reasons that they struck the people that they exercised their peremptory strikes in the way that they did nor did they know what you\u2019re going to do this time because we don\u2019t know who this next person is going to be that\u2019s put on the panel and the Commonwealth doesn\u2019t either....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">After more voir dire questioning and no motion to strike the potential venireman for cause, the court added the new venireman taken from the jury pool to the reconstituted panel of twenty. Both parties then exercised their peremptory strikes anew. The Commonwealth struck the same veniremen. For his last strike, appellant\u2019s counsel faced a choice of striking the new venireman on the panel, striking a venireman he had struck previously, or striking a venireman that he previously left on the jury. He chose to strike the new venireman.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Appellant then objected to the procedure again, stating that the new venireman was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">such that I didn\u2019t want her on the jury so I had to take a strike I originally used to strike somebody else during the first strikes and use on her. As a result, the first jury which I was satisfied with, one of those people is now on this jury. I was not able to strike him. I did not want him on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the jury. So because of the procedure we\u2019ve used, the defendant has been prejudiced in that which person he originally struck is now on the jury and, therefore, the specific prejudice is he was denied one of his peremptory strikes through this process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The Commonwealth pointed out that the jurors did not know who struck them, so they could not become prejudiced against the party who had struck them the first time. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objection to the procedure and denied appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. After hearing all the evidence, the jury convicted appellant of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and two counts of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">A panel from which to select a jury must contain twenty people, at minimum, and then the panel is reduced to twelve through a system of peremptory strikes. Code \u00a7 19.2-262 establishes the procedure a court should use:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">B. Twelve persons from a panel of not less than 20 shall constitute a jury in a felony case. Seven persons from a panel of not less than 13 shall constitute a jury in a misdemeanor case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">C. The parties or their counsel, beginning with the attorney for the Commonwealth, shall alternately strike off one name from the panel until the number remaining shall be reduced to the number required for a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">This statute does not describe a procedure for replacing a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Appellant suggests that a trial court must comply with the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-360 and 8.01-361 in order to protect his rights under Code \u00a7 19.2-262. Code \u00a7 8.01-361 discusses how to replace a juror after the jury has been sworn, which is not the circumstance that confronted the trial court here.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">Code \u00a7 8.01-360 discusses how to seat additional, alternate jurors, particularly important when the court expects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>that a trial will be protracted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Code section reads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">Whenever in the opinion of the court the trial of any criminal or civil case is likely to be a protracted one, the court may direct the selection of additional jurors who shall be drawn from the same source, in the same manner and at the same time as the regular jurors. These additional jurors shall have the same qualifications, and be considered and treated in every respect as regular jurors and be subject to examination and challenge as such jurors. When one additional juror is desired, there shall be drawn three veniremen, and the plaintiff and defendant in a civil case or the Commonwealth and accused in a criminal case shall each be allowed one peremptory challenge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Again, the problem here is not addressed by Code \u00a7 8.01-360. The parties were not selecting an \u201cadditional\u201d juror, but instead were replacing a \u201cregular\u201d juror. In addition, appellant did not ask the trial court to use the procedure discussed in Code \u00a7 8.01-360.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Appellant also argues <em>Irving v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 581, 453 S.E.2d 577 (1995), controls the outcome of this ease. The Commonwealth contends <em>Satcher v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 220, 421 S.E.2d 821 (1992), controls the outcome. Both <em>Irving </em>and <em>Satcher </em>note that trial courts have discretion to determine the appropriate solution when jury problems arise. <em>Satcher, </em>244 Va. at 238, 421 S.E.2d at 832 (\u201c[T]he manner of proceeding under the circumstances was a matter for the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d); <em>Irving, </em>19 Va.App. at 583, 453 S.E.2d at 578 (\u201cCode \u00a7 8.01-361 allows the court in its discretion to \u2018cause another qualified juror to be sworn in\u2019 to replace the juror who is unable to serve.... \u201d). <em>See also Justus v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 971, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>975, 266 S.E.2d 87, 90 (1980). We find that <em>Irving </em>is distinguishable from the facts presented here and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The steps taken by the trial court in <em>Irving </em>created a very different problem. In <em>Irving, </em>the trial court needed to replace a sworn juror. The judge called upon four people in the courtroom who had been called for jury duty, two of whom were struck from the original jury pool by Irving and one of whom was struck by the Commonwealth. 19 Va.App. at 583, 453 S.E.2d at 578. After a random drawing among these four individuals, the person earlier struck by the Commonwealth was taken off the replacement pool. <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth then struck the person who had not been in the original venire of twenty people, leaving Irving to choose between two people that he had previously struck off the jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">This Court found in <em>Irving, </em>based on an examination of Code \u00a7 8.01-360, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">the trial court should have at least called three jurors not previously stricken from the panel of twenty and provided both the defendant and Commonwealth with one peremptory strike. By following this <em>or some similar procedure, </em>the trial court would have ensured that both sides would have had the full right of their peremptory strikes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 585, 453 S.E.2d at 579 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Here, the trial court added one person who was not in the original venire to replace the excused juror and then gave each side the full number of peremptory strikes under Code \u00a7 19.2-262. Because the Commonwealth again struck the same veniremen, appellant was left with three options: striking a venireman he had previously struck from the jury, striking a venireman who had not been struck during the original jury selection, or striking the new venireman. Unlike in <em>Irving, </em>appellant was not forced to choose between two veniremen that he had previously struck. Furthermore, also unlike in <em>Irving, </em>the procedure used by the trial court here complied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>with the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-262. Therefore, <em>Irving </em>is not applicable here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Furthermore, appellant did not use a peremptory-strike to exclude a juror who should have been struck for cause. <em>Contrast Cressell v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 744, 755, 531 S.E.2d 1, 6 (2000) (explaining that under Virginia law defendants are entitled to a panel \u201cfree of exception\u201d before exercising their peremptory strikes). Instead, appellant\u2019s prejudice argument is based on his belief that the previous jury, the one he could no longer have because a juror was excused without objection, was a better jury for him than the jury that heard the case. This argument has no merit. No case law says that a defendant is entitled to the most sympathetic jurors available to him. As the United States Supreme Court has stated, in discussing juror selection, \u201cA hard choice is not the same as no choice.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Salazar, </em>528 U.S. 304, 315, 120 S.Ct. 774, 781, 145 L.Ed.2d 792 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">If the juror with the doctor\u2019s appointment had been excused <em>prior </em>to the use of the peremptory strikes, then the new venireman would have been added to the twenty-person panel and the peremptory strikes would have progressed just as they did here. The only difference here was that both the Commonwealth and appellant knew which jurors the opposing party had struck the first time. This \u201cforesight\u201d does not prejudice either party, especially as the reasons for those strikes were not disclosed by either party and, of course, none of the jurors knew which party had originally struck that juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">For the reasons stated, this Court\u2019s prior opinion in <em>Irving </em>does not control this case, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it fashioned this procedure for replacing the excused jury pool member. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-16\">. As appellant\u2019s argument involves jury selection only, we do not recount the evidence of his guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\">. Before beginning voir dire, the parties agreed to include one additional person on the jury as an alternate juror, who would be excused prior to deliberation by the jury. When a juror needed to be excused prior to the start of the trial, no one suggested that the trial go forward without an alternate juror. The juror who was excused was not the one designated as the alternate juror.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\">. In addition, in <em>Irving, </em>the jury had been sworn and the parties had given their opening statements before the problem with a juror was discovered. 19 Va.App. at 583, 453 S.E.2d at 578. Here, the problem was discovered prior to the swearing of the jury and the attachment of double jeopardy. Therefore, the procedural posture here is more similar to <em>Satcher, </em>where a juror was excused prior to the swearing of the jury. 244 Va. at 237-38, 421 S.E.2d at 832.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
