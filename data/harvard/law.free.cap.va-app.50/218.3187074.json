DSS argues that because the child was placed in the custody of DSS pursuant to an emergency removal order alleging abuse and neglect, and then made subject to a foster care plan, the trial court erred in subsequently transferring custody to the Cooks pursuant to certain custody related statutes (Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1\u2014 241(A)(3), 16.1-278.15, 20-124.2 and 20-124.3) separate and apart from the foster care statutory scheme (Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281 through -282.1). A panel majority of this Court agreed with DSS and reversed the decision of the trial court. We granted a petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of the panel decision. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Cooks, the prevailing parties below, and grant to them all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Logan v. Fairfax County Dep't of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 463 (1991). On April 7, 2004, DSS removed the child from her parents\u2019 custody, based on allegations against the father, and placed her in foster care. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of the City of Lynch-burg (\u201cJDR court\u201d) entered an emergency removal order on April 8, 2004. On July 1, 2004, the JDR court entered an order transferring custody to DSS, and approving a foster care plan with the goal of \u201creturn to home.\u201d On January 4, 2005, the JDR court approved a foster care plan with a new goal of \u201ccontinued foster care,\u201d and scheduled a permanency planning hearing to be held on May 27, 2005.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>In the meantime, three different parties filed petitions for custody of the child. On April 6, 2004, the child\u2019s mother, Amy Cook (\u201cmother\u201d), filed for custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 8, 2004, the Cooks and the child\u2019s father, Jimmy Cook (\u201cfather\u201d), filed separate petitions for custody. Each of the petitions specifically referenced the JDR court\u2019s jurisdiction over custody matters under Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u2014separate and apart from the statutory scheme governing the pending foster care plan. On March 4 and March 11, 2005, the JDR court conducted hearings on the petitions. After finding it to be in the child\u2019s best interest, pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-278.15, 20-124.2, and 20-124.3, the JDR court transferred custody from DSS to the Cooks, by order dated March 11, 2005. The custody order also allowed supervised visitation with the mother, and prohibited visitation with the father. The mother, father, and DSS appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">DSS filed a pre-trial motion in circuit court to suspend execution of the JDR court\u2019s March 11, 2005 order pending a trial <em>de novo. </em>By order dated April 12, 2005, the circuit court denied the motion and incorporated the JDR court\u2019s order into its own interlocutory order, with modifications expediting the Cooks\u2019 visitation schedule with the child before she commenced residing with them, then set for no later than May 30, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">On May 25, 2005, the circuit court heard argument on DSS\u2019s motion to remand based on a procedural challenge to the JDR court\u2019s March 11, 2005 custody order. DSS contended the JDR court \u201clacked jurisdiction\u201d to hear the Cooks\u2019 custody petition because of the pending foster care plan, and requested that the circuit court thus remand the case to the JDR court for a permanency planning hearing, pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>foster care statutes. Noting that disposition of the child\u2019s custody had proceeded in JDR court on \u201ctwo track[s] ... at the same time,\u201d the circuit court ruled there was no \u201cprocedural defect\u201d in the JDR court, which had the statutory authority to award custody of the child to the Cooks apart from the foster care plan. Accordingly, the circuit court further ruled there was no requirement or need for a permanency planning hearing in JDR court. The circuit court also granted the mother certain periods of unsupervised visitation with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">After a two-day trial in October 2005, the circuit court, like the JDR court, transferred custody to the Cooks upon finding it to be in the child\u2019s best interest, under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-124.2 and 20-124.3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, the court allowed unsupervised visitation with the mother, and supervised visitation with the father, as long as both remained in counseling. The court denied the father\u2019s petition for custody, and reserved the right to revisit the mother\u2019s petition for custody at a later date. The court also held that DSS no longer \u201cneed[ed] to be involved\u201d with the case. DSS then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">DSS argues both the JDR court and the circuit court \u201clacked jurisdiction\u201d to consider the custody petitions filed by the Cooks and the child\u2019s parents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the child was the subject of a foster care plan filed with the JDR court pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-281, DSS contends the disposition of the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>could only be decided under the procedures set forth in the foster care statutes. Under those procedures, according to DSS, the JDR court was limited to either reviewing the child\u2019s status, reviewing the foster care plan, or conducting a permanency planning hearing. DSS thus contends that neither the JDR court, nor the circuit court on appeal, had the authority to \u201cdeviate\u201d from the foster care statutory scheme by entertaining the parties\u2019 custody petitions filed pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3), and awarding custody to the Cooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">As a corollary to this argument, DSS further argues that the courts below applied the wrong standard in determining what was in the child\u2019s best interest, and thereby transferring custody to relatives and awarding visitation to both mother and father, pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-278.15(F), 20-124.2(B), and 20-124.3. Instead, according to DSS, the courts were limited to applying standards set forth in the foster care statutes regarding an abused or neglected child\u2019s contact or reunification with a parent, or placement of the child with a relative, as a foster care parent, pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281(C1), 16.1-282(D1), and 16.1-282.1(A1). We disagree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">A. Custody Award</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">An issue of statutory construction, as here presented, is \u201ca pure question of law which we review <em>de novo </em>\u201d on appeal. <em>Conyers v. Martial Arts World of Richmond, Inc., </em>273 Va. 96, 104, 639 S.E.2d 174, 178 (2007) (citations omitted). Under well established principles, \u201c[w]hen the language of a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In those instances, we do not \u201cresort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the rules of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Last v. Virginia State Bd. of Med., </em>14 Va.App. 906, 910, 421 S.E.2d 201, 205 (1992). In other words, \u201cwhen the General Assembly has used words of a definite import, we cannot give those words a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly meant something other than that which it actually expressed.\u201d <em>Britt Constr., Inc. v. Magazzine Clean, LLC, </em>271 Va. 58, 62-63, 623 S.E.2d 886, 888 (2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Title 16.1 of the Code provides several procedural means of obtaining child custody. Here, DSS initially obtained in the JDR court custody of the Cooks\u2019 granddaughter for placement in foster care, pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281 through -282.1. The day after the child was taken from her parents by DSS, the Cooks filed their own petition for custody of the child in JDR court and were ultimately awarded custody, pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3), 16.1-278.15, 20-124.2, and 20-124.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-241 sets forth the JDR court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, including, among other things, \u201c[t]he custody, visitation, support, control or disposition of a child ... [which] is a subject of controversy or requires determination.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3). This statute further plainly states, in dis-positive terms: \u201cThe authority of the juvenile court to consider a petition involving the custody of a child <em>shall not be proscribed or limited </em>where the child has previously been awarded to the custody of a local board of social services,\u201d as in the instant case. Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15 then provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[i]n cases involving the custody, visitation or support of a child pursuant to subdivision A 3 of \u00a7 16.1-241, the court may make <em>any </em>order of disposition to protect the welfare of the child and family as may be made by the circuit court.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15(A) (emphasis added). Specifically, the JDR court \u201cmay award custody upon petition to any party with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>legitimate interest therein, including, but not limited to, grandparents.... \u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15(B). This statute then reiterates verbatim that the JDR court\u2019s authority to consider such a petition for child custody <em>\u201cshall not be proscribed or limited </em>where the custody of the child has previously been awarded to a local board of social services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In filing the petition for custody of their granddaughter under this statutory scheme, the Cooks were not seeking to merely \u201cstep into the shoes\u201d of a foster care parent under a foster care plan, and were not limited to such status upon their petition. Rather, pursuant to the express terms of these statutes, the Cooks were entitled to bring a direct, independent action seeking a change in the child\u2019s custody from DSS to the Cooks, separate and apart from any foster care plan. And both the JDR court and the circuit court, upon appeal, were expressly authorized to adjudicate the Cooks\u2019 petition and award them custody. In Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241(A) and 16.1-278.15(B), the General Assembly has stated unequivocally that the JDR court\u2019s authority to consider such a petition is not \u201cproscribed or limited\u201d by the fact that \u201ccustody of the child has previously been awarded to [DSS].\u201d Consequently, through these provisions, the General Assembly has made the foster care plan statutes subordinate to the statutes under which the Cooks were awarded custody of their granddaughter, and did not conflate the two statutory schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Given that the courts below had the authority to adjudicate the Cooks\u2019 petition and award them custody apart from the foster care plan, the courts also correctly applied the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard in making that award, pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-278.15(F), 20-124.2(B), and 20-124.3, rather than the standard for approving foster care parents, which did not apply.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15(F), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the court is directed \u201c[i]n any case or proceeding involving the custody or visitation of a child\u201d to \u201cconsider the best interest of the child, including the considerations for determining custody and visitation set forth in Chapter 6.1 (\u00a7 20-124.1 et seq.) of Title 20.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Code \u00a7 '20-124.2, in turn, provides, in relevant part: that \u201c[i]n any case in which custody or visitation of minor children is at issue, whether in a circuit court or district court, the court shall provide prompt adjudication, upon due consideration of all the facts, ... [including] custody and visitation arrangements ... that \u201c[i]n determining custody, the court shall give primary consideration to the best interests of the child\u201d; and that \u201c[t]he court shall give due regard to the primacy of the parent-child relationship but may upon a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the best interest of the child would be served thereby award custody or visitation to any other person with a legitimate interest,\u201d including grandparents, as set forth in Code \u00a7 20-124.1. Code \u00a7 20-124.2(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Code \u00a7 20-124.3 then sets forth ten factors the court shall consider \u201c[i]n determining best interests of a child for purposes of determining custody.\u201d Those factors include, among others, \u201c[t]he needs of the child, giving due consideration to other important relationships of the child, including but not limited to ... extended family members;\u201d \u201c[a]ny history of family abuse ...;\u201d and \u201c[s]uch other factors as the court deems necessary and proper to the determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the circuit court, after noting its review of the factors under this statute and in determining that awarding custody to the Cooks was in the child\u2019s best interest, specifically found, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe child\u2019s doing well in [the Cooks\u2019] home\u201d and that the court had \u201cevery confidence that they\u2019ll be able to provide [the child] good support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>In sum, both the JDR court and the circuit court acted pursuant to express statutory authority in adjudicating the Cooks\u2019 petition for custody of their granddaughter, and in awarding them custody, upon finding that to be in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">B. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The Cooks request costs and attorney\u2019s fees associated with this appeal. We have recognized an award of attorney\u2019s fees associated with an appeal in matters properly brought before the JDR court may be appropriate under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19. <em>See Cartwright v. Cartwright, </em>49 Va.App. 25, 31, 635 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2006). However, we cannot say DSS\u2019s position in this case was unreasonable, <em>see O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996), because \u201cthe litigation addressed appropriate and substantial issues[,]\u201d <em>Estate of Hackler v. Hackler, </em>44 Va.App. 51, 75, 602 S.E.2d 426, 438 (2004). Therefore, we do not award attorney\u2019s fees associated with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">For these reasons, we affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-7\">. The requirements for the foster care plan are provided in Code \u00a7 16.1-281, the foster care review hearing in Code \u00a7 16.1-282, and the permanency planning hearing in Code \u00a7 16.1-282.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\">. The mother filed her petition the day she purportedly separated from her husband, the child\u2019s father. DSS removed the child from the home the following day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\">. Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014241 (A)(3) grants the JDR court jurisdiction over custody matters involving a child \u2019\u2019[wjhose custody ... is a subject of controversy or requires determination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\">. The circuit court specifically noted its review of the factors required to be considered under Code \u00a7 20-124.3 when determining the best interest of the child and, in doing so, found <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe child\u2019s doing well in [the Cooks\u2019] home\u201d and that the court had \"every confidence that they\u2019ll be able to provide [the child] good support.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\">. DSS does not actually argue that the lower courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction in granting the Cooks\u2019 custody petition, but rather argues that the courts erred in their exercise of authority over the child\u2019s custody by applying the wrong custody related statutes when awarding custody to the Cooks. <em>See Nelson v. Warden, </em>262 Va. 276, 552 S.E.2d 73 (2001) (explaining the distinction between subject matter jurisdiction and the authority to exercise that jurisdiction).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\">. Because we decide it was appropriate for the lower courts to proceed under Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3) and 16.1-278.15, the fact that the child was the subject of a foster care plan was not controlling and the related statutes were not applicable to the courts\u2019 adjudication of the three custody petitions before them. Consequently, DSS\u2019s other arguments, which are erroneously premised on mandatory application of that plan and related statutes in this case, are rendered moot and will not be considered. <em>See Commonwealth v. Harley, </em>256 Va. 216, 219-20, 504 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1998) (noting that appellate courts do not consider moot issues).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\">. This jurisdictional authority is distinct from that granted to the JDR court under this same statute regarding \"[t]he custody, visitation, support, control or disposition of a child ... [w]ho is alleged to be abused [or] neglected....\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\">. In other words, the courts below were not compelled, as DSS contends, to apply the standards and make the findings required for placing a child with a relative as a foster care parent, pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-28KC1), 16.1-282(D1), and 16.1-282.1(A1). We note, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>er, that Code \u00a7 16.1-282(D) incorporates the \"best interest of the child\" standard as part of the court\u2019s review of a foster care plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b272-9\">ELDER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ae8\">with whom BENTON and HALEY, JJ., join, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">I concur in the result reached by the majority. However, I write separately to articulate my understanding of the interplay between the findings required for placement of a child with a non-parent \u201cparty\u201d or \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d pursuant to the more general child custody statutes, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3), 16.1-278.15, 20-124.2, 20-124.3, and the findings required for placement of a child with a foster care parent pursuant to the abuse and neglect statutes, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281 to -282.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>In my view, the criteria in Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-124.2 and 20-124.3 for determining what is in the best interests of the child set out the overarching standard to be applied in any case involving a custody determination, but all best interests determinations are made in the context in which they arise. Neither Code \u00a7 16.1-282(D1) nor Code \u00a7 20-124.2 is intended to provide an all-inclusive list of factors to be considered in making the \u201cbest interests\u201d determination. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.3(10) (providing \u201cthe court shall consider,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>certain factors enumerated (1) to (9) and \u201csuch other factors as the court deems necessary and proper to the determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The standard for approving a foster care placement set out in Code \u00a7 16.1-282(D) expressly requires compliance with the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d test and specifically incorporates the criteria of Code \u00a7 16.1-282(D1), which, although not specifically listed in Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-124.2 or 20-124.3, are nevertheless subsumed in the best interests analysis. Any finding, pursuant to the general custody statutes, that an award of custody to \u201ca relative other than the child\u2019s prior family,\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-282(D1), is in the child\u2019s best interests includes an implicit finding that the relative</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajs\">(i) is ... willing and qualified to receive and care for the child; (ii) is willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with the child; (iii) is committed to providing a permanent, suitable home for the child; and (iv) is willing and has the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af5\"><em>Id. </em>Further, Code \u00a7 20-124.2 expressly provides that, in the case of an award of custody to a non-parent, the best interest finding must be made by clear and convincing evidence rather than by a mere preponderance, as is required by Code \u00a7 16.1-282(D1) for the above four specific criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Thus, here, the court\u2019s award of custody included an implicit finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Cooks were \u201cwilling and qualified to receive and care for the child; ... willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with the child; ... committed to providing a permanent, suitable home for the child; and ... willing and ... [able] to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>child from abuse and neglect,\u201d as set out in Code \u00a7 16.1-282(D1). The court was not bound by the requirement of Code \u00a7 16.1-282(D1) to set out any subsidiary findings in its order because it proceeded under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-124.2 and 20-124.8 instead.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b274-4\">HUMPHREYS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEl\">with whom PETTY, J. joins, concurring in part, dissenting in part, and dissenting from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">I agree with the majority that the JDR court and the circuit court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the issue of custody with regard to the child. However, because I believe that the foster care statutes\u2014specifically, Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281 and 16.1-282\u2014must govern the manner in which the trial court must address the issue of custody of a child who has been deemed abused and neglected, I respectfully dissent from the majority view on the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In this case, DSS argues that the trial court erred in transferring custody to the Cooks pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1\u2014 278.15 and 20-124.3. Specifically, DSS contends that once a child is taken into custody, and is subject to a foster care plan, the trial court is required to make findings pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-282 in order to transfer custody to an interested party, even a relative. I agree. Moreover, I would further hold that although an abused or neglected child has been placed with a relative or other interested party, DSS is not relieved of its duty to comply with the statutory mandates of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1\u2014 281, 16.1-282, and 16.1-282.1, and thus the trial court erred in holding that DSS no longer \u201cneed[ed] to be involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">A. Custody Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">A child who is taken into custody pursuant to an emergency removal order, and then placed in the custody of social services, is statutorily subject to a foster care plan. Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 281; <em>see also Strong v. Hampton Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>45 Va.App. 317, 321-22, 610 S.E.2d 873, 875 (2005) (\u201cThe statute [Code \u00a7 16.1-281] places on the Department the obligation to prepare a foster care plan.\u201d). In order for the court to transfer custody of a child who is deemed abused or neglected, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>either pursuant to a foster care plan, or a petition for custody, the court must make specific factual findings. Specifically, Code \u00a7 16.1-281 requires that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><em>[a]ny </em>order transferring custody of the child to a relative other than the child\u2019s prior family shall be entered only upon a finding, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the relative is one who, after an investigation as directed by the court, (i) is found by the court to be willing and qualified to receive and care for the child; (ii) is willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with the child; (in) is committed to providing a permanent, suitable home for the child; and (iv) is willing and has the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect; <em>and the order shall so state. </em>The court\u2019s order transferring custody to a relative should further provide for, as appropriate, any terms or conditions which would promote the child\u2019s interest and welfare; ongoing provision of social services to the child and the child\u2019s custodian; and court review of the child\u2019s placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Noticeably absent from this statute is any reference to the general custody statute relied upon by the majority, Code \u00a7 20-124.3, regarding the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard. In fact, none of the statutes addressing the foster care plan, the foster care review hearing, or the permanency planning hearing, incorporate, by reference, the general standard for determining custody. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281, 16.1-282, and 16.1-282.1.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Instead, the statutes set forth a more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>stringent standard that the court must follow in order to transfer the custody of an abused or neglected child to a relative. Moreover, rather than specifying that these findings of fact are limited to orders resulting from a foster care review hearing or a permanency planning hearing, the statute requires that <em>any </em>order transferring custody of a child in foster care to a relative contain specific findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The majority holds that because Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241(A) and 16.1-278.15(B) state that the JDR court\u2019s authority to consider a petition for custody \u201cshall not be proscribed or limited where the custody of the child has previously been awarded to [DSS],\u201d the trial court correctly entertained and disposed of the custody petition pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-124.2 and 20-124.3, and therefore any discussion of the foster care statutes is moot. Moreover, the majority holds that the language contained in Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241(A) and 16.1-278.15(B) manifests the General Assembly\u2019s intent not to conflate, in any way, the two statutory schemes, and to make the foster care statutes subordinate to the general custody statutes. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Although the majority correctly notes that the trial court has jurisdiction over \u201c[t]he custody, visitation, support, control or disposition of a child ... [which] is a subject of controversy or requires determination,\u201d <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3), it seemingly dismisses, in a footnote, the fact that Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1) grants the trial court jurisdiction over \u201c[t]he custody, visitation, support, control or disposition of a child ... <em>[w]ho is alleged to be abused [or] neglected </em>...,\u201d <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1) (emphasis added). The majority then erroneously relies, as did the circuit court, upon Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3) to determine that the circuit court had authority to dispense with the issue of custody without taking into consideration the standards set forth in the foster care statutes, specifically Code \u00a7 16.1-281. In my view, the error is two-fold.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">First, construing these statutes in the manner suggested by the majority fails to take into consideration an important canon of statutory construction. That is, \u201ca statute [must] be construed from its four corners and not by singling out a particular word or phrase.\u201d <em>First Virginia Bank v. O'Leary, </em>251 Va. 308, 312, 467 S.E.2d 775, 777 (1996). Moreover, \u201ca legislative enactment \u2018should be interpreted, if possible, in a manner which gives meaning to every word.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Monument </em>Assoc. <em>v. Arlington County Bd., </em>242 Va. 145, 149, 408 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Here, as the majority notes, the General Assembly has granted jurisdiction to the juvenile and domestic relations district courts over the custody disposition of a child who is alleged to be abused or neglected <em>separate and apart </em>from the jurisdiction over the disposition of a child whose custody is the subject of controversy. Under the rules of statutory construction, had the legislature intended for subsection (A)(3) to govern the cases where a child is alleged to be abused or neglected, it would not have included subsection (A)(1), which <em>specifically </em>addresses such cases. To hold that the trial court did not err in entertaining the issue of custody of an abused and neglected child pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3) renders Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1) meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Second, the majority implicitly contends that construing the statutes as I suggest would proscribe, or limit, the trial court\u2019s authority to consider a custody petition by an interested party for a child who is alleged to be abused and neglected. However, in my view, the statute\u2019s plain meaning indicates that once a child is placed in the custody of social services, the child\u2019s placement with DSS does not proscribe or limit the circuit court\u2019s ability to <em>consider </em>a petition for custody. In other words, the child\u2019s placement does not remove the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over issues such as custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In <em>Walla v. Prince William County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., 25 </em>Va.App. 356, 363-64, 488 S.E.2d 653, 657 (1997), this Court addressed whether a juvenile court judge had the authority to consider a FAPT report and order social services to obtain treatment for a minor in a residential treatment facility. Social services argued that the juvenile court judge divested himself of that authority when he granted social services legal custody of the minor under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4(6)(c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>However, this Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">the juvenile court judge retained the authority to \u201creview the status\u201d of the minor even after she was placed in the custody of Social Services. Code \u00a7 16.1-281(E) expressly states that children in the custody of Social Services are those the juvenile court judge can review pursuant to that section. <em>See id. </em>(giving the juvenile court judge the power \u201cto review the status of children in the custody of local boards of ... social services\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">Contrary to the argument of Social Services, Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 278.4(6)(c) does not mandate a different result. The statement that \u201cthe [local] board [of social services] to which the child is committed shall have the final authority to determine the appropriate placement for the child,\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4(6)(c), was intended to give Social Services the power to override the wishes or recommendations of the child\u2019s parents, the FAPT, or any other interested party. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>section was not intended to divest the juvenile court judge of power to review the status of the minor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 368, 488 S.E.2d at 657. Moreover, in <em>Walla </em>we continued, stating, \u201cthe scope of the judge\u2019s power to oversee the provision of treatment and care to a particular child is not limited to a review of the plan submitted by Social Services,\u201d and \u201c[t]he General Assembly clearly intended to provide the juvenile courts, under Code \u00a7 16.[1]\u2014281, broad authority to oversee the status of children in the custody of Social Services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 488 S.E.2d at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Likewise, in my view, Code \u00a7 16.1-281 was not intended to \u201cdivest\u201d the trial court of jurisdiction over the custody matter, nor was it intended to limit or proscribe the trial court\u2019s authority to <em>entertain </em>the custody matter. Nor does Code \u00a7 16.1-281 limit the trial court to considering just the foster care plan or the objectives set forth by DSS. In fact, Code \u00a7 16.1-241 makes it perfectly clear that the trial court has jurisdiction over custody matters. And, in my view, when read in conjunction with the other pertinent statutes, Code \u00a7 16.1-281 simply requires that when the custody of an abused and neglected child is at issue, the trial court must make specific written findings of fact, designed to protect the child from the dangers for which he or she was removed from the home. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281, 16.1-282, 16.1-282.1.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>other words, the trial court is free to decide the issue of custody as it sees fit, so long as it incorporates into the record a finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">the relative or other interested individual is one who, after an investigation as directed by the court, (i) is found by the court to be willing and qualified to receive and care for the child; (ii) is willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with the child; (iii) is committed to providing a permanent, suitable home for the child; and (iv) is willing and has the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnZ\">Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2(A1). Therefore, I would hold that the trial court erred in addressing the issue of custody pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1~241(A)(3) and 16.1-278.15, and in failing to recognize that Code \u00a7 16.1-281 applied to the disposition of the petition for custody filed by the Cooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Nevertheless, I recognize that under the harmless error doctrine, this Court must affirm the judgment of the trial court if \u201cthe error complained of could not have affected the result.\u201d <em>See Rhoades v. Painter, </em>234 Va. 20, 24, 360 S.E.2d 174, 176 (1987). However, in this case, DSS asserts, and the record reflects, that the trial court failed to make a finding that the Cooks were \u201cwilling and ha[d] the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect,\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 16.1-281. In my view, because the statute requires the court to make this specific finding, this error is not harmless. Therefore, I would hold that the trial court erred in failing to make the required findings, as mandated by Code \u00a7 16.1-281.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">B. Continuation of the Foster Care Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">According to Code \u00a7 16.1-282, the court \u201cshall\u201d conduct a foster care review hearing for \u201ca child who was the subject of a foster care plan filed with the court pursuant to \u00a7 16.1-281.\u201d The court must conduct this hearing \u201cif the child ... is under the legal custody of ... social services or a child welfare agency and has not had a petition to terminate parental rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>granted, filed or ordered to be filed on the child\u2019s behalf.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-282.Code \u00a7 16.1-282 also mandates that, \u201c[a]fter the hearing required pursuant to subsection C, the court <em>shall </em>schedule a permanency planning hearing on the case to be held five months thereafter in accordance with \u00a7 16.1-282.1 or within thirty days upon the petition of any party entitled to notice in proceedings under this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">In my view, by using the word \u201cshall,\u201d the legislature intended for any department of social services to follow specific statutory provisions once a child has been taken into custody because of abuse or neglect. In fact, we have held that \u201cthe statute places on the Department the obligation to prepare a foster care plan\u201d and that \u201c[njothing in the statutory scheme ... removes the burden on [the Department] to establish compliance with the statutes.\u201d <em>Strong, </em>45 Va.App. at 321-22, 610 S.E.2d at 875. In other words, although the trial court may grant temporary custody to a relative or other interested party, the statute contemplates that a foster care review hearing, pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-282, and ultimately a permanency planning hearing, pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-282.1, will take place. Accordingly, because the statutory scheme requires DSS to comply with certain provisions, I would hold that the trial court erred in terminating DSS\u2019s involvement in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this analysis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">. In footnote 8, the majority notes that \"Code \u00a7 16.1-282(D) incorporates the 'best interests of the child\u2019 standard as part of the court\u2019s review of a foster care plan.\u201d However, the entire sentence is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall, upon the proof adduced in accordance with the best interests of the child <em>and subject to the provisions of subsection Dl, </em>enter any appropriate order of disposition consistent with the dispositional alternatives available to the court at the time of the original hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Code \u00a7 16.1-282(D) (emphasis added). Subsection D1 reiterates the language set forth in Code \u00a7 16.1-281. Specifically, subsection D1 states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuK\">Any order transferring custody of the child to a relative other than the child's prior family shall be entered only upon a finding, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the relative is one who, after an investigation as directed by the court, (i) is found by the court to be willing and qualified to receive and care for the child; (ii) is willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with the child; (iii) is committed to providing a permanent, suitable home for the child; and (iv) is willing and has the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect; and the order shall so state. The court\u2019s order transferring custody to a relative should further provide for, as appropriate, any terms and conditions which would promote the child\u2019s interest and welfare; ongoing provision of social services to the child and the child\u2019s custodian; and court review of the child\u2019s placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2l\">Clearly, the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d will always be of importance when determining custody of a child. However, in the case of an abused or neglected child who has been placed in the custody of social services for his or her protection, the statute requires that the court make specific findings of fact to maintain the safety and welfare of the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">. This statute states that social services \u201cshall have the final authority to determine the appropriate placement.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4(6)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b279-6\">. Even Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2 contains similar language to the foster care statutes. According to Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2, once a court enters an order permitting DSS to place an abused or neglected child, DSS may transfer custody of the child to a relative only upon a finding that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATx\">the relative or other interested individual is one who, after an investigation as directed by the court, (i) is found by the court to be willing and qualified to receive and care for the child; (ii) is willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with the child; (iii) is committed to providing a permanent, suitable home for the child; and (iv) is willing and has the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect; and the order shall so state. The court\u2019s order transferring custody to a relative or other interested individual should further provide for, as appropriate, any terms or conditions which would promote the child\u2019s interest and welfare; ongoing provision of social services to the child and the child's custodian; and court review of the child\u2019s placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2(A1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
