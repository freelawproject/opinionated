ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Corporate Resource Management, Inc. (CRM) appeals an award of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission to Lourenda Southers for an injury to the C5-6 facet joint of her cervical spine. Relying on Code \u00a7 65.2-601\u2019s two-year statute of limitations, CRM claims the commission had no jurisdiction to award compensation for a neck injury because the only timely claim asserted by Southers identified her injury as a \u201ccontusion to the left shoulder.\u201d We agree and reverse the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">In 2003, Southers fell down some steps and landed on her left shoulder. Represented by counsel, Southers claimed her accident caused bruising to her left shoulder. CRM accepted the claim without contest after Southers executed a memorandum of agreement specifying the \u201cnature of injury\u201d and \u201cparts of body affected\u201d as a \u201ccontusion to the left shoulder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">More than two years after the accident, Southers sought compensation for an injury to the C5-6 facet joint of her cervical spine. CRM denied the claim on several grounds, including the two-year statutory time bar codified in Code \u00a7 65.2-601. Though acknowledging Southers never filed a timely claim \u201calleging any neck injury,\u201d the commission reject<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ed CRM\u2019s assertion of the time bar. By a majority vote, the commission stated that the statutory time bar applied only to \u201can untimely filing of a claim for a body part <em>unrelated </em>to that reflected in the initial claim for benefits.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The commission then reasoned that the time bar did not apply to Southers\u2019s case because her accident did not involve \u201cinjuries to two <em>separate </em>body parts.\u201d A dissenting commissioner disagreed, finding the majority\u2019s reasoning inconsistent with <em>Shawley v. Shea-Ball Constr. Co., </em>216 Va. 442, 219 S.E.2d 849 (1975), the leading case interpreting the statutory time bar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Both the majority and the dissenting commissioners, however, agreed on the facts. The evidence before the commission included Southers\u2019s testimony conceding that she had never filed \u201cany claims for a neck injury\u201d and that neither CRM nor its insurance carrier attempted to dissuade her from doing so. Seeking to explain her reason for not filing a timely neck-injury claim, Southers testified (despite medical records suggesting otherwise) that she did not \u201csuffer from neck pain\u201d prior to the expiration of the two-year limitations period and never complained of neck pain to any treating physician during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">An injured employee must file a claim with the commission within two years of the accident. If the claimant fails to meet this filing deadline, the right to compensation \u201cshall be forever barred.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-601. Unlike an ordinary statute of limitations, this statutory bar acts as a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d limitation on the commission\u2019s remedial powers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>Shawley, </em>216 Va. at 445, 219 S.E.2d at 852; <em>see also Stuart Circle Hasp. v. Alderson, </em>223 Va. 205, 208-09, 288 S.E.2d 445, 447 (1982); <em>Barksdale v. H.O. Engen, Inc., </em>218 Va. 496, 497, 237 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1977). In the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact, the question whether \u201ca claim is barred by the statute of limitations is a question of law.\u201d <em>Tuck v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>47 Va.App. 276, 284, 623 S.E.2d 433, 437 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Our analysis begins with <em>Shawley, </em>the governing precedent on the jurisdictional nature of the statutory bar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that case, an employee fell from a ladder and filed a timely claim for injuries to his \u201cright hip and left ankle.\u201d <em>Shawley, </em>216 Va. at 443, 219 S.E.2d at 850 (describing claim in a memorandum of agreement). After the expiration of the filing deadline, the employee filed an \u201cadditional claim for alleged back and right leg injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 219 S.E.2d at 851. The employer refused to pay, arguing the new claim had not been timely filed. The commission agreed, holding the employee failed to file a \u201cclaim for injury to the back or right leg\u201d within the (then one-year) statutory limitations period. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">On appeal, the employee in <em>Shawley </em>argued it was \u201cnot necessary to specify all injuries in his original claim\u201d filed with the commission. <em>Id. </em>at 446, 219 S.E.2d at 853. The Virginia Supreme Court flatly disagreed, holding \u201can employee must assert against his employer any claim that he might have for <em>any injury </em>growing out of the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Stressing the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d nature of the filing deadline, <em>Shawley </em>held that the employee\u2019s claim for injuries to his back and right leg was \u201cforever barred,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 445-46, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>219 S.E.2d at 852, because these injuries were not identified in the original, timely-filed, claim\u2014which listed only injuries to his \u201cright hip and left ankle,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 443, 219 S.E.2d at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Our most recent application of the statutory time bar, <em>Tuck, </em>47 Va.App. at 283-84, 623 S.E.2d at 436-37, involved an untimely claim for a \u201cneck\u201d injury when the timely claim, memorialized in a memorandum of agreement, identified injuries only to the \u201clower back and right shoulder.\u201d The commission had disallowed the untimely neck-injury claim, holding that the \u201crequirement that a claim be timely filed under Code \u00a7 65.2-601 is jurisdictional\u201d and no statutory or equitable exception suspended its operation in this particular case. <em>Tuck v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>VWC File No. 204-66-57, 2005 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 274, at *10 (Apr. 8, 2005). A dissenting commissioner disagreed, arguing that the employer knew of the neck injury and should not be relieved of the obligation to compensate for that injury simply because the memorandum of agreement \u201cdid not list \u2018neck\u2019\u201d among the injured body parts. <em>Id. </em>at *21. We affirmed the majority\u2019s view, holding that the neck claim was \u201cbarred by the two-year statute of limitations pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-601\u201d and that none of the proffered exceptions to the statutory bar applied. <em>Tuck, </em>47 Va.App. at 286, 623 S.E.2d at 438.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Here, Southers made a timely claim for a \u201ccontusion to the left shoulder\u201d and an untimely claim for an injury to the C5-6 facet joint of her cervical spine. Departing from its reasoning in <em>Tuck,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the commission interpreted the <em>Shawley </em>time bar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>apply only to \u201ca body part <em>unrelated </em>to that reflected in the initial claim for benefits\u201d and concluded <em>Shawley </em>did not apply to this case because it did not involve \u201cinjuries to two separate body parts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">To begin with, we question whether the commission meant its reasoning to be taken literally. That is, we think it unlikely the commission was truly unwilling to recognize the left shoulder and the C5-6 facet joint as \u201ctwo separate body parts.\u201d Obviously they are, from the perspective of both physicians and laymen. Nor can we accept that a left shoulder bruise is anatomically the same as a cervical spine injury. What we understand the commission to be saying is that, while not the same, they are close enough to pass the <em>Shawley </em>specificity standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We cannot concur with the commission\u2019s reasoning. The timely claim in <em>Shawley </em>included an allegation of injury to the \u201cright hip,\u201d whereas the untimely claim included the \u201cback\u201d and \u201cright leg\u201d among the injured body parts. <em>Shawley, </em>216 Va. at 443-44, 219 S.E.2d at 851. We discern no principled basis, in law or in fact, for the commission to assert that the right hip is unrelated to either the back or the right leg (thus not close enough to excuse the time bar in <em>Shawley), </em>but the left shoulder is related to the neck (thus close enough to excuse the time bar in Southers\u2019s case). This <em>ad hoc </em>distinction is no distinction at all, much less one to which our judicial imprimatur can be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In reply, Southers says this discursive legal debate over claim-filing principles should be subordinated to a more important factual point: Unlike the employer in <em>Shawley, </em>Southers\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>employer had \u201cnotice of a possible neck injury\u201d because medical records mention she complained of neck pain prior to the expiration of the statutory deadline. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Brief at 16. That is dispositive, she continues, because <em>Shawley </em>declared notice to be the \u201ccompelling\u201d public policy rationale underlying the statutory filing requirement. <em>Shawley, </em>216 Va. at 446, 219 S.E.2d at 853. From these two observations, Southers concludes that the statutory filing requirement does not apply to any case (including hers) where the employer had notice of the unfiled, untimely claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">We believe this misreading of <em>Shawley </em>leads to a <em>non </em>sequitur\u2014one which, if accepted, would distort long-accepted principles governing statutes of limitation. The observation in <em>Shawley </em>about the employer\u2019s lack of notice was meant to illustrate the animating public policy behind the statute, not to atomize it into a case-by-case adjudication of notice. No published opinion of a Virginia court has ever interpreted <em>Shawley </em>to empower the commission to decide, by looking at the facts of each disputed claim, whether the statutory bar really advances its underlying notice policies and, if not, selectively suspend its application. \u201cIn the long run, experience teaches that strict adherence to the procedural requirements specified by the legislature is the best guarantee of evenhanded administration of the law.\u201d <em>Hallstrom v. Tillamook County, </em>493 U.S. 20, 31, 110 S.Ct. 304, 311, 107 L.Ed.2d 237 (1989) (citation omitted). No matter its view of the wisdom of applying filing deadlines to a given case, neither a court nor a commission can \u201cdisregard these requirements at its discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">To accept Southers\u2019s argument would be to employ the long-discredited \u201cinherent equity\u201d doctrine to judicially fashion an exception where the governing statute of limitations \u201ccreates none.\u201d <em>Bickle v. Chrisman\u2019s Adm\u2019x, </em>76 Va. (1 Hansbrough) 678, 685 (1882) (citation omitted). As a general rule, \u201ccourts have no authority to make any exception in favor of a party to protect him from the consequences\u201d of a statute of limitations, <em>Ackiss\u2019 Ex\u2019rs v. Satchel, </em>104 Va. 700, 704, 52 S.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>378, 379 (1905), and, in any event, \u201cno reasons based on apparent inconvenience or hardship can justify a departure from it,\u201d <em>Amy v. Watertown, </em>130 U.S. 320, 324, 9 S.Ct. 537, 538, 32 L.Ed. 953 (1889). To the extent specific exceptions exist, they are applied \u201cwith great caution; otherwise the courts would make the law instead of administer it.\u201d <em>Ackiss\u2019 Ex\u2019rs, </em>104 Va. at 705, 52 S.E. at 379 (quoting <em>Amy, </em>130 U.S. at 324, 9 S.Ct. at 538).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">With respect to Code \u00a7 65.2-601, we have recognized narrow exceptions to the two-year claim-filing requirement. <em>See Tuck, </em>47 Va.App. at 284, 623 S.E.2d at 437. But we have never dispensed altogether with Code \u00a7 65.2-601\u2019s limitation period on any actual notice theory of <em>de facto </em>compliance. Indeed, in <em>Cibula v. Allied Fibers &amp; Plastics, </em>14 Va.App. 319, 324, 416 S.E.2d 708, 711 (1992), <em>aff'd, </em>245 Va. 337, 428 S.E.2d 905 (1993) <em>(per curiam), </em>we recognized that an employer\u2019s \u201cvoluntary payment\u201d of an injured employee\u2019s medical bills does not, by itself, estop the employer from invoking the two-year limitation bar of Code \u00a7 65.2-601. <em>See also Stuart Circle Hosp., </em>223 Va. at 209, 288 S.E.2d at 447. All the more, an employer\u2019s actual notice of an injury would never suffice, by itself, as an exception to Code \u00a7 65.2-601\u2019s jurisdictional requirement that a timely claim be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Despite the inconsistency inherent in her argument, Southers also claims neither she nor her attorney could have reasonably known to file a claim for a neck injury because no doctor diagnosed the C5-6 facet joint injury until after the expiration of the limitation period. The commission thought this point persuasive, dwelling at some length on the facts supporting it and concluding it helped to understand how the underlying injury (consistently referred to in the singular) remained the same from the date of the accident forward. We have two responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">First, for purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-601\u2019s two-year limitation, a claim accrues on the date of the accident not the date the injuries are medically diagnosed. Unless a statute of limitations expressly says so, the limitation period does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>depend on the claimant\u2019s \u201cdiscovery of injury or damage\u201d even in situations where \u201cthe injury or damage is unknown or difficult or even incapable of discovery.\u201d <em>Shipman v. Kruck, </em>267 Va. 495, 503, 593 S.E.2d 319, 323 (2004) (citations and ellipses omitted). This principle accepts, albeit reluctantly, that \u201cstatutes of limitations may impose hardships upon individual litigants who discover salient facts after the statutory deadline. Such hardships are inherent in their nature.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. 1st Source Bank, </em>928 F.2d 86, 90 (4th Cir.1990) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Second, even if Southers\u2019s medical diagnosis changed over time, what matters is not how the injuries <em>could have been described </em>in a timely claim but how they were, if at all, in fact described. In her memorandum of agreement, Southers specified the \u201cnature of injury\u201d and \u201cparts of body affected\u201d as a \u201ccontusion to the left shoulder.\u201d That description of a bruised left shoulder defined the boundaries of CRM\u2019s liability, as well as the limits of the commission\u2019s remedial jurisdiction. In short, by moving the liability markers out to include an injury to Southers\u2019s cervical spine\u2014after the expiration of the two-year time bar\u2014the commission exercised a jurisdictional power denied it by Code \u00a7 65.2-601.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The employee in <em>Shawley </em>argued it is \u201cnot necessary to specify all injuries\u201d in a timely filed claim. <em>Shawley, </em>216 Va. at 446, 219 S.E.2d at 853. \u201cWe disagree,\u201d the Virginia Supreme Court replied, holding that \u201can employee must assert against his employer <em>any claim </em>that he might have for <em>any injury </em>growing out of the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). <em>Shawley </em>governs this case. As Southers concedes, she never filed a timely claim specifying an injury to her neck. The commission, therefore, had no jurisdiction to make an award for this injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\">.

Shea-Ball Construction Co., </em>216 Va. 442, 219 S.E.2d 849 (1975), much too narrowly on the facts of this case. Employer did not dispute claimant suffered a neck injury that manifested itself primarily as chronic shoulder pain, and employer accepted a \u201cshoulder\u201d injury as compensable. I would hold employer\u2019s acceptance of the chronic symptoms as a compensable shoulder injury satisfied the statute of limitations because claimant\u2019s medical records document that, prior to expiration of the statute of limitations, claimant\u2019s symptoms consistently involved both her shoulder and her neck; an award for a shoulder injury was entered when the symptoms had been diagnosed as only a shoulder injury; and claimant received a diagnosis of neck injury only after the applicable statute of limitations had run.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, I would affirm the commission\u2019s award of benefits, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Because I believe the holding in <em>Shawley </em>indicates the contents of claimant\u2019s medical records are relevant to the analysis of the statute of limitations issue, particularly because of their repeated references to neck pain within the statutory period, I find it necessary to summarize claimant\u2019s records, course of treatment, and the procedural history of the claim in greater detail than does the majority. Because claimant prevailed before the commission, I recite that evidence in the light most favorable to claimant. <em>See, e.g., Crisp v.

She was carrying a \u201cportavac\u201d around her neck, and when she fell, she landed with all her weight on her left shoulder. She sought medical treatment, complaining of pain throughout her entire left shoulder and across the back of the shoulder blade that \u201cmoves to [the] left side of [her] neck.\u201d She came under the care of an orthopaedist, Dr. Praveer Srivastava, who ordered various tests, including a left shoulder MRI, and a course of physical therapy but was unable to determine the source of claimant\u2019s shoulder and neck pain. When a course of work hardening resulted in some improvement, Dr. Srivastava released claimant to return to work without restrictions, but within a few weeks, she reported a recurrence of \u201csevere[ ] symptom[s]\u201d in her shoulder and neck and was again excused from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Dr. Wilhelm A.

Dr. Zuelzer opined claimant\u2019s shoulder was \u201cf\u00edne\u201d and was not the source of her symptoms. He recommended an MRI of the neck but indicated he thought that, regardless of what the MRI showed, claimant\u2019s ongoing pain \u201cmore than likely is coming from [the neck] area.\u201d After receiving Dr. Zuelzer\u2019s recommendations, Dr. Srivastava ordered additional tests including an MRI of claimant\u2019s cervical spine. The MRI revealed only a \u201c[m]inimal C5-6 posterior disc bulge\u201d and was \u201cotherwise normal.\u201d When claimant returned to Dr. Srivastava on November 20, 2003, with \u201cunchanged symptoms\u201d including persistent neck and left shoulder pain, Dr. Srivastava informed her that her various tests revealed no significant abnormalities, and he released her to regular duty. Thereafter, claimant experienced \u201c[ongoing] neck and shoulder pain,\u201d but Dr. Srivastava refused to treat her because \u201cthe bills were not paid at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">During that time frame, employer and its purported insurance carrier were engaged in a dispute over whether employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>had coverage at the time of claimant\u2019s accident. Claimant had no private health insurance and also had insufficient funds to obtain her own medical treatment because she was unable to work due to her injury during that time. Thus, although she experienced ongoing pain, she received no medical treatment for it from late 2003 until mid-2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">In late 2003, claimant sought additional temporary total disability benefits, but the dispute between employer and the carrier delayed resolution of this claim. In March 2005, employer accepted liability for the additional period of temporary total disability. An award for disability and lifetime medical benefits for the shoulder injury was entered on May 2, 2005, and at claimant\u2019s request, employer offered her a new panel of physicians on May 11, 2005. Claimant chose a new treating physician from the list but was not able to obtain an appointment with him until June 8, 2005, two years and approximately two weeks after her accident of May 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">When claimant saw her new treating physician, Dr. John Frederick Meyers, on June 8, 2005, she reported chronic pain in her left upper back and shoulder, and Dr. Meyers noted tenderness and limited rotation in claimant\u2019s neck. He diagnosed her as having cervical radiculitis. After a spine surgeon determined claimant was not a candidate for surgery, she was referred to a pain management physician, Dr. Michael DePalma.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Dr. DePalma performed a series of diagnostic injections and opined that claimant had facet joint arthrosis of the cervical spine at C5-6. Dr. DePalma indicated that \u201c[t]he primary source of [claimant\u2019s] pain was the [facet] joint\u201d and explained that this was a different diagnosis categorically from C6 radiculopathy, which is a dysfunction of the nerve root at the vertebral joint rather than at the facet joint. He also noted that \u201c[f]acet joint arthrosis is ... difficult to completely discern just on MRI findings.\u201d Finally, he opined to a reasonable degree of medical probability that claimant\u2019s work-related fall caused the injury to her cervical spine, which was the source of her symptoms and work restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>When claimant filed a new change-in-condition application, employer contended the claim for a neck injury was barred by the statute of limitations because her original claim was for an injury to her left shoulder only.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the hearing before the deputy, claimant testified that the primary pain she experienced was consistently in the same part of her body, which she described as her entire back left shoulder with radiation into her left arm and hand. She testified that Dr. Meyers, whom she first saw over two years after the accident, was the first physician to tell her that her \u201cinjury was coming from [her] neck.\u201d She denied having \u201cany other accidents of any kind whatsoever since [her] original accident back in 2003.\u201d She agreed that she signed the Agreement to Pay Benefits form on September 18, 2003, listing her injury as a \u201ccontusion to [her] left shoulder\u201d and that she had an attorney when she did so, but she indicated she did not complete the form herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">The deputy concluded that claimant\u2019s claim was not barred by the statute of limitations, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">[T]he Agreement to Pay Benefits form reflects a contusion to the left shoulder. Medical records reflect some neck pain____ Despite conflicting opinions about the etiology of the claimant\u2019s symptoms, it is clear that they have their origin in the occupational accident and have manifested themselves primarily as shoulder symptoms. The claimant could not reasonably be expected to file a claim for a neck injury when none had been diagnosed, and we do not believe her claim is time-barred because a new physician now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>disagrees with the earlier diagnosis as to the etiology of her symptoms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The deputy further noted that the claim did not involve a situation in which claimant sustained multiple injuries to different parts of the body and filed a timely claim for injury to only one of those body parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Employer filed a request for review, and the commission affirmed, with one commissioner dissenting. The majority reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">The Agreement to Pay Benefits form indicated the nature of injury to be a contusion to the left shoulder. The claimant has consistently complained of pain in the lateral section of her shoulder, which at times included neck pain and radiation both down the arm and up the neck. It is uncontradicted that her symptoms never changed from the date of the accident. While the claimant complained of neck and shoulder complaints, she received various diagnoses relating only to the shoulder and it was not until she underwent substantial diagnostic evaluations that Drs. Meyers and DePalma diagnosed her with a neck injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">Therefore, we find that this is not a case involving injuries to two separate body parts but the same injury throughout the course of treatment, now presenting with an altered diagnosis. We find that the constant symptoms caused by the injury encompassed both the shoulder and neck and neither the nature of the injury nor the manifestation of the symptoms have changed since the date of injury or when the Agreement to Pay Benefits form was executed. The claimant\u2019s symptoms have consistently manifested in shoulder pain which [only] recently [has been] attributed to claimant\u2019s neck injury. We agree with the Deputy Commissioner that it was reasonable for the claimant to have relied on the treating physician\u2019s diagnoses in seeking benefits relating to the shoulder contusion and it would be unreasonable to expect a claimant to file a claim for an injury to a body part, for the same symptoms for which the claimed diagnosis was made, for which her physician had not identified any specific injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The commission noted that employer had notice of the accident and injury and that the Act does not \u201cimpose a duty on employees to amend agreement forms with each new development in treatment.\u201d It distinguished the holding in <em>Shawley </em>as involving the untimely filing of a claim for a body part wholly unrelated to the body part named in the initial claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Employer noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">On appeal, we are to find guidance in the principle that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cis highly remedial.\u201d <em>Henderson v.

The Supreme Court noted the commission\u2019s factual findings that \u201cthe back and right ankle claims asserted by [Shawley] were for injuries not covered by the memorandum of agreement or [the commission\u2019s] original award\u201d and that Shawley made \u201c \u2018no assertion or <em>complaint </em>of back or right leg injury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201d until after the applicable statute of limitations had expired. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 445, 219 S.E.2d at 851, 852 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Here, the majority, relying on <em>Shawley, </em>concludes that a timely claim was filed only for claimant\u2019s shoulder injury and that, because it is undisputed claimant\u2019s current disability stems from an injury to her cervical spine rather than her shoulder, the statute of limitations bars her from receiving benefits for the cervical spine injury. I believe <em>Shawley </em>is factually distinguishable and does not support the result the majority reaches.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>In <em>Skawley, </em>the Court cited as \u201ccompelling\u201d reasons for requiring a claimant to file a timely claim for all injuries sustained in a particular accident the need of the employer to \u201cdetermin[e] whether or not there was in fact an injury, the nature and extent thereof, and if related to the accident.\u201d Id. at 446, 219 S.E.2d at 858. It also noted that the filing of a timely claim allows an employer to obtain \u201cthe treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>necessary to effect a cure of the claimant and to minimize the employer\u2019s liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447, 219 S.E.2d at 853. Because Shawley reported only an injury to his left ankle and right hip, the employer had no notice that Shawley contended his back and right ankle were involved; no opportunity to make a contemporaneous determination about whether the back and right ankle injuries could, in fact, have been sustained in the accident reported; and no ability to obtain timely medical treatment for those body parts not originally listed in order to minimize its liability for disability and medical treatment resulting from injury to those parts. In addition to noting Shawley did not file a timely claim for injury to those body parts, the Supreme Court emphasized that \u201c[a]n examination of the medical reports and other documents submitted within the [statute of limitations] period from the date of the accident fail[ed] to disclose any reference to an injury to Shawley\u2019s back or to his right leg or right ankle\u201d and that \u201c[n]owhere in any of the reports [was] it recorded that Shawley complained of such an injury within that period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444-47, 219 S.E.2d at 851-53. Thus, the Court found relevant <em>both </em>the failure to file a formal claim listing injuries to the back and right ankle prior to expiration of the statute of limitations <em>and </em>the absence of any mention of injury to those body parts in the medical records prior to expiration of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Claimant\u2019s situation is readily distinguishable. In claimant\u2019s case, claimant reported falling on her left shoulder, and employer accepted as compensable the injury to claimant\u2019s left shoulder. In marked contrast to <em>Shawley, </em>the commission found that, contemporaneously with the accident and prior to expiration of the statute of limitations, claimant \u201cconsistently complained of pain in the lateral section of her [left] shoulder, which at times included neck pain and radiation ... up the neck.\u201d The medical records support this finding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Thus, here, unlike in Shawley, claimant\u2019s timely claim for a left shoulder injury and her consistent complaints to her medical providers of pain in her left shoulder radiating into her neck gave employer all the notice it needed to meet the objectives that <em>Shawley </em>termed \u201ccompelling\u201d reasons requiring the timely filing of a claim for all injured body parts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Employer had timely notice of claimant\u2019s assertion that she suffered a significant blow to her left shoulder area, and claimant received timely medical attention for the affected, interrelated body parts. Claimant, a layperson with a ninth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>grade education, could not be expected to know precisely where her scapular region ended and her cervical region began. Further, neither claimant\u2019s original treating physician nor the physician who performed an independent medical examination at employer\u2019s request was successful in determining the precise source of claimant\u2019s radiating shoulder pain before the statute of limitations had expired. In fact, both these physicians purported to <em>exclude </em>claimant\u2019s cervical region as the source of her chronic pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s cervical spine injury was encompassed by the award for her shoulder injury was supported by credible evidence in the record. As the commission stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">it was reasonable for the claimant to have relied on the treating physician\u2019s diagnoses in seeking benefits relating to the shoulder contusion and it would be unreasonable to expect a claimant to file a claim for an injury to a body part, for the same symptoms for which the claimed diagnosis was made, for which her treating physician had not identified any specific injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Application of such reasoning under the facts of this case does not contravene <em>Shawley\u2019s </em>holding regarding the \u201ccompelling\u201d reasons entitling an employer to timely notice of a particular injury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here, claimant received timely medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>treatment for <em>the symptoms </em>caused by her industrial accident,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> although her physicians were not initially successful in identifying their source. When the \u201cprimary source\u201d of claimant\u2019s chronic pain was finally diagnosed as \u201cfacet joint arthrosis\u201d of the cervical spine at C5-6, employer had the opportunity to contest causation and was not held to its prior acceptance of claimant\u2019s injury to her \u201cshoulder\u201d as binding it to cover the newly diagnosed source of claimant\u2019s pain. Employer does not contest the commission\u2019s determination of causation in this appeal and does not contend that it might somehow have proved the injury to claimant\u2019s cervical spine was unrelated to the industrial accident if it had received notice of the precise mechanism of claimant\u2019s injury within the statutory period. The fact that employer did not learn at an earlier time the precise mechanism causing claimant\u2019s chronic pain was not the fault of the claimant, and applying the statute of limitations on these facts would provide a windfall to employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">On these facts, I would hold that the commission\u2019s entry of an award for medical and disability benefits for claimant\u2019s \u201cshoulder injury\u201d of May 23, 2003, covered the cervical spine facet joint arthrosis injury that manifested itself in claimant\u2019s chronic shoulder and neck pain. Thus, I would affirm the commission\u2019s award of benefits, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">. Employer remained free to challenge causation based on the new diagnosis, and employer in fact did before the commission in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\">. Claimant \"relie[d] on estoppel or imposition, given the complicated procedural history\u201d of the claim.

By the time the claimant saw the new doctor [who she testified was the first to diagnose her injury as being to her neck], it was more than two years beyond the date of accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">Although claimant raised the doctrine of imposition before both the deputy and the commission, the commission chose to make no ruling on the application of the doctrine because it found the statute of limitations did not bar the claim. Although imposition may have provided the commission with an alternative basis for awarding benefits, it did not hold that imposition applied, and we may not consider application of this doctrine on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b80-5\">. <em>Shawley </em>was decided under Code \u00a7 65.1-87, the predecessor to present Code \u00a7 65.2-601, which provided a one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b80-6\">.

The commission then wrote to Tuck stating that if all issues raised in her amended claim for benefits had been resolved, she should notify the commission in writing that the scheduled hearing was not needed. <em>Id. </em>at 280, 623 S.E.2d at 435. In response, Tuck \"filed a hand-written letter requesting that the dispute be removed from the hearing docket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When Tuck later again sought benefits for her upper back and right hand, as well as her neck, the commission found, based on Tuck\u2019s earlier written representations, that the memoranda of agreement resolved all issues regarding what body parts her 2001 claim stated had been injured. <em>Id. </em>at 282, 623 S.E.2d at 436. We held on appeal that \"[cjredible evidence supported the commission\u2019s decision ... that the parties\u2019 [Memoranda of Agreement] resolved all issues raised in [Tuck\u2019s] April 2001 claims for benefits and that [Tuck] did not prove mutual mistake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286, 623 S.E.2d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"AV\">We did not separately address in <em>Tuck, </em>as the Supreme Court did in <em>Shawley, </em>whether the carrier or employer had notice that Tuck claimed injury to the upper back and hand in the industrial accident; Tuck\u2019s employer clearly had notice of the upper back and hand injuries but also had notice, as found by the commission, that claimant had affirmatively abandoned any claim she might have had for coverage of those parts. Although Tuck had not previously specified a \"neck\u201d injury in the claims she filed with the commission, she had expressly claimed injury to her upper back, which the medical records indicated were in the cervical spine, i.e., the upper back.

Claimant testified that she did not report neck pain to her medical providers, although frequent notations about reports of neck pain appear in her medical records. The deputy considered this testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>in his opinion but implicitly concluded it did not compel the finding that claimant made no such reports.

The commission was entitled to conclude that this seeming discrepancy between claimant\u2019s testimony and her medical records resulted from the fact that claimant could merely have shown the various treating medical personnel where she hurt, after which they determined the appropriate name for the part of the body part or parts to which she referred. Clearly, the primary location of claimant's pain was her left shoulder, and as set out <em>infra </em>in the text, claimant, a layperson with a ninth grade education, could not be expected to know with anatomic precision where her scapular region ended and her cervical region began.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\">.
