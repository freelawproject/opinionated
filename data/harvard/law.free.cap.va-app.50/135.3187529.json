ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Convicted of disorderly conduct in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-415, Rasheik K. Battle argues on appeal that, even after giving the Commonwealth the benefit of all reasonable inferences, the factual record does not support the conviction because the statute specifically excludes \u201cconduct otherwise made punishable\u201d by other Title 18.2 criminal statutes. We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">A Richmond police officer, Carlos Martin, worked an off-duty assignment at a nightclub one night in January 2006. While outside the club, Martin saw two club security guards escort Battle and several of his friends out of the club. Battle and his companions argued loudly with each other. Martin and two other officers, all in their police uniforms, approached Battle and his friends and told them to \u201cmove outside the doorway of the club\u201d because there were \u201c100 to 200 people coming in and going out of the club\u201d that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Battle and his friends walked thirty to forty feet down the sidewalk. On that same sidewalk were \u201ca number of people coming up and down\u201d to enter and exit the club. Martin heard Battle and his friends continue to argue among themselves. He then saw Battle make a \u201cstriking motion toward another individual.\u201d Martin could not see whether a blow landed. Martin ran to them and ordered both to leave the sidewalk area. When Battle refused to obey, Martin repeated his order several times. At that location on the sidewalk, Martin explained, were groups of \u201cpeople at my back\u201d and \u201cin front of me\u201d still trying to get into the club. Battle cursed Martin so loudly that spit came out of his mouth. Martin pushed Battle against a wall and told him he would be arrested for disorderly conduct if he did not leave as ordered. Battle did not leave, and Martin arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">At Battle\u2019s trial for disorderly conduct, the Commonwealth presented Martin\u2019s testimony and then rested its case. Battle moved to strike, arguing the disorderly conduct statute, Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u00a7 18.2-415, did not apply to words or conduct \u201cotherwise made punishable\u201d under Title 18.2 of the Code. Battle\u2019s conduct, counsel contended, could have been punished under other criminal code provisions, thus exempting it from the scope of the disorderly conduct statute. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In his case-in-chief, Battle offered only one witness, Hakeem Johnson. He testified that Battled \u201cpushed\u201d but did not strike him outside the club. Battle was justified in doing so, Johnson said, because he had earlier \u201csmacked\u201d Battle. After Battle renewed his motion to strike, the trial court denied the motion and found him guilty of disorderly conduct. On appeal, Battle repeats his argument that his conduct falls outside the scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-415 as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Referring to Code \u00a7 18.2-415 as the \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d statute, as we often do, tends to oversimplify its reach and betray its conceptual subtleties. Code \u00a7 18.2-415 does indeed criminalize conduct that is disorderly, but only subject to various statutory caveats and limitations. The relevant portion of the text reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">A person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, with the intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">A. In any street, highway, public building, or while in or on a public conveyance, or public place engages in conduct having a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person or persons at whom, individually, such conduct is directed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">B. Willfully or being intoxicated, whether willfully or not, and whether such intoxication results from self-administered alcohol or other drug of whatever nature, disrupts any funeral, memorial service, or meeting of the governing body of any political subdivision of this Commonwealth or a division or agency thereof, or of any school, literary society or place of religious wor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>ship, if the disruption (i) prevents or interferes with the orderly conduct of the funeral, memorial service, or meeting or (ii) has a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person or persons at whom, individually, the disruption is directed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">C. Willfully or while intoxicated, whether willfully or not, and whether such intoxication results from self-administered alcohol or other drug of whatever nature, disrupts the operation of any school or any activity conducted or sponsored by any school, if the disruption (i) prevents or interferes with the orderly conduct of the operation or activity or (ii) has a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person or persons at whom, individually, the disruption is directed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">However, the conduct prohibited under subdivision A, B or C of this section shall not be deemed to include the utterance or display of any words or to include conduct otherwise made punishable under this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The essential elements of a disorderly conduct charge include the specified <em>mens rea </em>(\u201cintent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof\u2019) and a concomitant <em>actus reus </em>(public conduct tending to cause acts of violence under subsection A, behavior disrupting certain formal public gatherings under subsection B, and behavior disrupting school functions under subsection C).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Following these state-of-mind and conduct elements, Code \u00a7 18.2-415 includes a proviso stating \u201cconduct prohibited under subdivision A, B or C of this section shall not be deemed to include the utterance or display of any words or to include conduct otherwise made punishable under this title.\u201d This provision, added in 1976, followed <em>Squire v. Pace, </em>516 F.2d 240 (4th Cir.1975), which held the statute unconstitutionally vague and overbroad particularly given its potential impact on free speech protections. <em>See generally Twenty-First Annual Survey of Developments in Virginia Law, </em>62 Va. L.Rev. 1352, 1403-05 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The 1976 proviso, however, went beyond sheltering the statute from First Amendment scrutiny. The amendment also exempted defendants from disorderly conduct culpability if their \u201cconduct\u201d (prohibited in subsections A, B, or C) was \u201cotherwise made punishable\u201d under Title 18.2. <em>See </em>1976 Va. Acts, ch. 244. Ordinarily, a \u201cprosecutor has the discretion to decide under which of several applicable statutes the charges shall be instituted.\u201d <em>Bishop v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 251, 260, 639 S.E.2d 683, 687 (2007) (footnote and citation omitted). The proviso added to Code \u00a7 18.2-415, however, limits prosecutorial discretion by reserving disorderly conduct convictions only for conduct not punishable elsewhere in the criminal code. <em>See </em>Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Virginia Practice Series: Criminal Offenses &amp; Defenses </em>166 (2007) (recognizing that conduct \u201cof sufficient gravity to violate some other provision of Title 18.2 ... must be prosecuted as that crime rather than as disorderly conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The scope of the other-crimes proviso, however, is finely calibrated. It does not say a disorderly conduct charge must be dismissed anytime a defendant could be prosecuted under both the disorderly conduct statute and another provision of Title 18.2. The proviso, instead, focuses specifically on \u201cconduct prohibited under subdivision A, B or C\u201d and instructs that such conduct cannot include words or conduct \u201cotherwise made punishable under this title.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-415. Conduct cannot be punishable under Title 18.2 without first being criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Thus, the conduct exempted from the reach of Code \u00a7 18.2-415 includes only Title 18.2 crimes for which the defendant could be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. It is not enough that the defendant could merely be prosecuted for a Title 18.2 crime because that requires only a showing of probable cause. The proviso only applies when a rational factfinder could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt for a Title 18.2 crime. Any other view would lead to the anomaly of negating the disorderly conduct statute in its entirety even in cases where no rational factfinder could find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the defendant guilty of any criminal offense \u201cpunishable\u201d under Title 18.2. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-415.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Applying these principles here, we assume <em>arguendo </em>the trial court correctly found Battle\u2019s conduct fell within the scope of subsection A of Code \u00a7 18.2-415 because Battle intended \u201cto cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm\u201d and engaged in conduct \u201chaving a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person or persons at whom, individually, such conduct is directed.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-415. The issue before us is whether Battle\u2019s convictable disorderly conduct was comprised <em>solely </em>of conduct \u201cotherwise made punishable under this title.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">We agree with Battle that the subsection A conduct could not be, as the statute puts it, \u201cdeemed to include\u201d his assault on Johnson because that action could be punishable under Code \u00a7 18.2-57. Battle\u2019s subsection A conduct likewise could not include cursing at Martin because that could only be punished, if at all, as fighting words under Code \u00a7 18.2-416. <em>See generally Mercer v. Winston, </em>214 Va. 281, 288-84, 199 S.E.2d 724, 725-26 (1973) (limiting the curse-and-abuse statute to the \u201cfighting\u201d words holding of <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 573-74, 62 S.Ct. 766, 770, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942)).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Finally, Battle\u2019s refusal to obey Martin\u2019s lawful order to move away from the sidewalk so others could come and go from the club in an unobstructed manner could have been punished under Code \u00a7 18.2-404, which specifically criminalizes the refusal by someone obstructing the \u201cfree passage\u201d of others coming and going from a public place to \u201cmove on when requested to do so\u201d by a law enforcement officer. <em>See Tinsley v. Richmond, </em>202 Va. 707, 715, 119 S.E.2d 488, 493 (1961) (construing analogous municipal ordinance); <em>see generally Gregory v. Chicago, </em>394 U.S. 111, 112, 89 S.Ct. 946, 947, 22 L.Ed.2d 134 (1969) (distinguishing between charge alleging a \u201crefusal to obey a police officer\u201d and a charge asserting \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In short, the other-crimes proviso of Code \u00a7 18.2-415 applies as a matter of law to the disorderly conduct for which Battle was found guilty in this case. His conviction is therefore reversed and the corresponding arrest warrant dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>Reversed and warrant dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
