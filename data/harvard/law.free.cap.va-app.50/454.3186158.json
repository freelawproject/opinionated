On appeal, she contends the trial court erred in ruling her conviction for DUI, after her privilege to drive in Virginia had been suspended pursuant to the sixty-day suspension provision in Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 for the same offense, did not violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">The relevant facts and procedural posture of this case are not in dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 13, 2005, appellant was arrest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ed in Clarke County and charged with DUI, first offense. Prior to trial on that charge, appellant was arrested in Chesterfield County on February 1, 2006, and charged with DUI, second offense. Testing in connection with the second arrest revealed that appellant had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.16%. Upon issuance of a warrant by the magistrate for DUI, second offense, appellant was served with notice that her privilege to drive in Virginia was administratively suspended for sixty days pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2, effective immediately.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">At a February 10, 2006 scheduling hearing in the General District Court of Chesterfield County, appellant requested that the administrative suspension of her privilege to drive be reduced to seven days because she had not been convicted of a previous DUI offense. The court, however, took no action on her request and set trial for March 24, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">On March 2, 2006, appellant was tried in the General District Court of Clarke County on the 2005 DUI charge. She was convicted only of reckless driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">On March 10, 2006, appellant filed a motion with the General District Court of Chesterfield County to have her privilege to drive in Virginia restored. With the agreement of the Commonwealth, the court restored appellant\u2019s driving privilege on March 16, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">On March 24, 2006, appellant was tried in the General District Court of Chesterfield County on the 2006 DUI charge. Rejecting appellant\u2019s claim that the prior administrative suspension of her privilege to drive in Virginia constituted a criminal sanction for purposes of double jeopardy, the court convicted her of DUI, first offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">After appealing her conviction to the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County (trial court), appellant moved to have the 2006 DUI charge dismissed on double jeopardy grounds. She argued the administrative suspension of her privilege to drive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>in Virginia pursuant to the sixty-day suspension provision of Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 constituted a criminal sanction. Thus, she further argued, her subsequent criminal prosecution for the same offense was barred by the double jeopardy prohibitions of the United States and Virginia Constitutions. The trial court denied the motion and subsequently convicted appellant of DUI, first offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erroneously ruled that the administrative suspension of her privilege to drive in Virginia pursuant to the sixty-day suspension provision of Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 did not constitute a criminal sanction for double jeopardy purposes. Appellant acknowledges that this Court held in <em>Ingram v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 759, 514 S.E.2d 792 (1999), that the administrative suspension of a person\u2019s driving privilege pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 is a civil, rather than criminal, sanction and, thus, does not offend the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. She asserts, however, that, unlike the statute\u2019s seven-day-suspension provision applied in <em>Ingram, </em>the more recently enacted sixty-day suspension provision of Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 applied in this case constitutes a criminal sanction because of its excessive length. As such, she argues, it offends federal and state double jeopardy protections since it permits a defendant to be twice placed in jeopardy as a result of the administrative suspension and the subsequent prosecution for the same DUI offense. Accordingly, she concludes, the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the 2006 DUI charge on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">In response, the Commonwealth contends that, even though the length of the administrative suspension at issue in this case is longer than the length of the suspension at issue in <em>Ingram, </em>this Court\u2019s underlying rationale and holding in <em>Ingram </em>are equally applicable to this case. Consistent with that rationale and holding, the Commonwealth argues, the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>trative suspension of appellant\u2019s privilege to drive in Virginia pursuant to the sixty-day suspension provision of Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 was a civil sanction and, thus, did not offend federal or state double jeopardy protections. Accordingly, the Commonwealth concludes, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the 2006 DUI charge on double jeopardy grounds. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">As relevant here, \u201c[t]he double jeopardy clauses of the United States and the Virginia constitutions ... protect against ... multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hudgins, </em>269 Va. 602, 604-05, 611 S.E.2d 362, 364 (2005). \u201cThus, subjecting a defendant to cumulative punishments for the \u2018same offense\u2019 violates both state and federal protections against double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 407, 440, 611 S.E.2d 631, 647 (2005). However, the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy \u201c \u2018protects only against multiple <em>criminal </em>punishments for the same offense ... in successive proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dorsey v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 154, 161, 526 S.E.2d 787, 790 (2000) (quoting <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 99, 118 S.Ct. 488, 493, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997)); <em>see also Stephens v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 58, 62, 557 S.E.2d 227, 230 (2002) (\u201cVirginia\u2019s constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy affords a defendant the same guarantees as the federal Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d). Accordingly, the imposition of a sanction that is civil, rather than criminal, in nature does not implicate double jeopardy principles. <em>See Dorsey, </em>32 Va.App. at 165, 526 S.E.2d at 792. In other words, the imposition of civil sanctions in connection with a criminal charge does not bar the subsequent criminal prosecution for the same charge. <em>Id. </em>The dispositive question before us, then, is whether the administrative suspension of a person\u2019s privilege to drive in Virginia pursuant to the sixty-day suspension provision of Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 constitutes a criminal sanction, as appellant asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In <em>Hudson, </em>the United States Supreme Court set forth the current two-part test to be used to determine whether a particular sanction is civil or criminal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>A court must first ask whether the legislature, \u201cin establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or another.\u201d <em>[United States v. Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 248, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 2641, 65 L.Ed.2d 742 (1980) ]. Even in those cases where the legislature \u201chas indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive in purpose or effect,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 248-49[, 100 S.Ct. at 2641], as to \u201ctransform what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty,\u201d <em>Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 148, 154 [76 S.Ct. 219, 222, 100 L.Ed. 149] (1956).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 99, 118 S.Ct. at 493. Regarding the latter inquiry, the Supreme Court provided in <em>Hudson </em>the following \u201cuseful guideposts\u201d for determining whether a civil sanction has been transformed into a criminal sanction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">(1) \u201cwhether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether it has historically been regarded as a punishment\u201d; (3) \u201cwhether it comes into play only on a finding of <em>scienter </em>\u201d; (4) \u201cwhether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment\u2014retribution or deterrence\u201d; (5) \u201cwhether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime\u201d; (6) \u201cwhether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it\u201d; and (7) \u201cwhether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 99-100, 118 S.Ct. at 493 (quoting <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 554, 567-68, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963)). \u201cAs the Court emphasized, however, \u2018these factors must be considered in relation to the statute on its face, and only the clearest proof will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>32 Va.App. at 162, 526 S.E.2d at 791 (quoting <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 100, 118 S.Ct. at 493).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Here, appellant\u2019s privilege to drive in Virginia was administratively suspended pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(A), which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>If a breath test is taken pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 18.2-268.2 or any similar ordinance and ... the results show a blood alcohol content of 0.08 percent or more by weight by volume or 0.08 grams or more per 210 liters of breath ... and ... upon issuance of a warrant by the magistrate, for a violation of ...

The period of suspension of the person\u2019s license or privilege to drive shall be seven days, unless the ... warrant issued charges the person with a second or subsequent offense. If the person is charged with a second offense the suspension shall be for 60 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Because the 2006 warrant issued by the magistrate charged appellant with a second DUI offense, her privilege to drive in Virginia was administratively suspended pursuant to the sixty-day suspension provision of Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In <em>Ingram, </em>\u201cthe Commonwealth administratively suspended [Ingram\u2019s] operator\u2019s license for seven days pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2.\u201d 29 Va.App. at 761, 514 S.E.2d at 793. On appeal to this Court, Ingram argued \u201cthat the suspension was punitive and that his subsequent DUI conviction violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying the first part of the test set forth in <em>Hudson, </em>we held that \u201cthe legislature clearly intended for the administrative license suspension to be a civil sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765, 514 S.E.2d at 795. In reaching that decision, we observed that the purpose of the administrative suspension was \u201c\u2018not to punish the offender but to remove from the highways an operator who is a potential danger to other users.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763, 514 S.E.2d at 794 (quoting <em>Tench v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 200, 205, 462 S.E.2d 922, 924 (1995)). We further observed that \u201cthe legislative history behind the enactment of the suspension statute ... provided that the legislature was \u2018motivated by its desire to reduce alcohol-related crashes, fatalities, and injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tench, </em>21 Va.App. at 205, 462 S.E.2d at 924). We concluded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>therefore, that the legislature\u2019s manifest intent in enacting the administrative suspension provision of Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 was to establish \u201c \u2018a remedial sanction [whose] purpose is to protect the public from intoxicated drivers and to reduce alcohol-related accidents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tench, </em>21 Va.App. at 205, 462 S.E.2d at 924).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We then turned in <em>Ingram </em>to the second prong of the test set forth in <em>Hudson, </em>namely, the issue whether the remedial seven-day administrative suspension pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 was so punitive in effect that it was transformed into a criminal sanction. Expressly applying each of the seven factors outlined in <em>Hudson, </em>we held that the administrative suspension was \u201cnot so punitive as to transform \u2018a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765, 514 S.E.2d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Although our analysis in <em>Ingram </em>dealt solely with the administrative suspension of a person\u2019s privilege to drive in Virginia pursuant to the seven-day-suspension provision of Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2, we conclude that the same reasoning equally applies to the administrative suspension of a person\u2019s privilege to drive pursuant to the sixty-day suspension provision of Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2. The fifty-three day increase in the length of the period of the suspension does not alter the result of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">For one thing, the longer period of the suspension has no direct bearing on the statute\u2019s underlying purpose. Whether the suspension period is seven or sixty days, the administrative suspension of a person\u2019s privilege to drive in Virginia pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 is intended to remove dangerous drivers from the highways and thus protect the safety and welfare of other users. <em>See Brame v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 122, 133, 476 S.E.2d 177, 183 (1996) (holding that the administrative suspension prescribed by Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 has a \u201cclear, overriding remedial purpose\u201d); <em>Tench, </em>21 Va.App. at 205, 462 S.E.2d at 924 (\u201cWe hold that automatic license suspension under Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 is a remedial sanction because its purpose is to protect the public from intoxicated drivers and to reduce alcohol-related accidents.\u201d). Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>that remedial purpose of protecting the public from harm is actually better served by the longer sixty-day suspension period. Moreover, because a person charged with a second DUI offense presumably poses a greater potential risk to the safety and welfare of the public than a person who has only been charged once, the enhanced civil sanction is consistent with the statute\u2019s remedial purpose. We conclude, therefore, that the legislature intended the administrative suspension of a person\u2019s privilege to drive pursuant to the sixty-day suspension provision of Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 to be a civil, rather than criminal, sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Likewise, notwithstanding appellant\u2019s claim to the contrary, we conclude the increased suspension period is not so punitive in effect as to transform a remedial, civil sanction into a criminal sanction. Focusing primarily on the seventh <em>Hudson </em>factor, appellant argues the sixty-day suspension period is \u201ctoo long to pass constitutional muster under the Double Jeopardy provisions of the United States and Virginia Constitutions\u201d because \u201cthe length of the suspension clearly exceeds any remedial purpose envisioned by the General Assembly.\u201d However, as we specifically noted in <em>Ingram,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">\u201cthe length of the period necessary to [accomplish the remedial purpose] is a matter within the sound discretion of the General Assembly,\u201d and \u201cit can hardly be said the discretion has been abused in light of the fact that Virginia\u2019s [suspension] period is shorter than ... the periods considered [and upheld for double jeopardy purposes] in ... out-of-state cases ... the majority [of which] have suspension periods of ninety days or more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">29 Va.App. at 767, 514 S.E.2d at 796 (first and fourth alterations in original) (quoting <em>Brame, </em>252 Va. at 133, 476 S.E.2d at 183) (citing <em>State v. Lomas, </em>114 Nev. 313, 955 P.2d 678, 681 (1998) (holding that a ninety-day-minimum administrative suspension is not excessive) and <em>Powers v. Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass. 534, 694 N.E.2d 324, 326, 328-29 (1998) (upholding an indefinite administrative suspension)). Accordingly, we cannot say that Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2\u2019s sixty-day suspension period is excessive relative to the statute\u2019s remedial purpose.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Our consideration in <em>Ingram </em>of the six other <em>Hudson </em>factors is similarly applicable to the statute\u2019s sixty-day suspension period:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">First, the [sixty-day] administrative suspension does not involve an affirmative restraint, for it is \u201ccertainly nothing approaching the \u2018infamous punishment\u2019 of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Hudson, 522 </em>U.S. at 104[, 118 S.Ct. at 496] (quoting <em>Flemming v. Nestor, </em>363 U.S. 603, 617 [80 S.Ct. 1367, 1376, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435] (1960)). \u201cIf occupational debarment from the banking industry [in <em>Hudson] </em>cannot be considered an affirmative disability or restraint, then quite obviously the temporary suspension of [one\u2019s] driving privilege also cannot be so considered.\u201d <em>Lomas, </em>955 P.2d at 681.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">Second, drivers\u2019 license suspensions historically have not been considered punishment in Virginia. <em>See, e.g., Brame, 252 </em>Va. at 130-31, 476 S.E.2d at 181-82. The \u201c \u2018revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted\u2019 \u201d is an act which \u201c \u2018is characteristically free of the punitive criminal element.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 104[, 118 S.Ct. at 496] (quoting <em>Helvering v.

We hold, therefore, that, notwithstanding any incidental punitive effect it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>may have, the sixty-day administrative suspension of a person\u2019s privilege to drive in Virginia pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 constitutes a civil sanction and, thus, does not offend the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Appellant further contends Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2\u2019s sixty-day suspension provision was punitive as applied to her in violation of her right not to be placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense because she had not been convicted of a previous DUI offense. However, \u201cas the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Hudson, </em>a court determining whether a supposed civil sanction constitutes punishment for purposes of double jeopardy must \u2018evaluate the statute on its face,\u2019 rather than \u2018the character of the actual sanctions imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 768, 514 S.E.2d at 796 (quoting <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 101, 118 S.Ct. at 494). Indeed, \u201c[a]ny deviation from proper procedure does not change the fundamental character of [a] sanction [that] is civil and remedial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 768, 514 S.E.2d at 797. Moreover, a statutory scheme, \u201cfound to be civil, cannot be deemed punitive \u2018as applied\u2019 to a single individual in violation of the Double Jeopardy ... Clause[ ].\u201d <em>Seling v. Young, </em>531 U.S. 250, 267, 121 S.Ct. 727, 737, 148 L.Ed.2d 734 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Consequently, to the extent appellant claims the sixty-day suspension provision was improperly applied to her, her \u201cremedy was to challenge the suspension as provided in the statute\u201d during the suspension period. <em>Ingram, </em>29 Va.App. at 768, 514 S.E.2d at 797; <em>see Easter v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 714, 718-19, 525 S.E.2d 592, 594 (2000) (noting that Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(C) \u201callows the accused to immediately challenge the administrative suspension in a civil proceeding\u201d during the \u201cperiod of the suspension, [and] does not limit the permissible grounds of review\u201d). Although appellant apparently chose to dispense with that remedy when she failed to obtain a ruling from the general district court on her request to reduce the administrative suspension, the court later terminated the suspension and restored appellant\u2019s privilege to drive in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>For these reasons, we conclude that appellant\u2019s subsequent conviction for DUI did not violate her double jeopardy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the 2006 DUI charge on double jeopardy grounds, and we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-15\">.
