HALEY, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">The issue here for resolution is whether the inclusion in a Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cVPDES\u201d) discharge permit of a provision authorizing photography by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (\u201cVDEQ\u201d) staff is arbitrary and capricious, when such photography is \u201creasonably related to the purpose of the site visit and the particular inspection being carried out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\n<em>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Bowman Apple Products Company, Inc. (\u201cBowman\u201d) bottles apple products in Mount Jackson, Virginia. The company uses well water for cooling and filtration in its operations, resulting in wastewater. From a holding pond, this wastewater, at times combined with parking lot and plant storm water, is ultimately discharged into the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. Accordingly, Bowman is required to hold a VPDES permit (\u201cthe permit\u201d) issued by the State Water Control Board (\u201cSWCB\u201d), subject to re-issue at five-year intervals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such permits contain \u201cInspection and Entry\u201d provisions to assist VDEQ in monitoring compliance with the permit. The statutory basis for inspection and entry is Code \u00a7 62.1\u201444.20, a provision of the State Water Control Law. That section reads, \u201cAny duly authorized agent of the Board may, at reasonable times and under reasonable circumstances, enter any establishment or upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of obtaining information or conducting surveys or investigations necessary in the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Prior permits issued to Bowman, likewise unchallenged, contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">W. <em>Inspection and Entry</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">The permittee shall allow the Director, or an authorized representative, upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">1. Enter upon the permittee\u2019s premises where a regulated facility or activity is located or conducted, or where records must be kept under the conditions of this permit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>2. Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of this permit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">3. Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or required under this permit; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">4. Sample or monitor at reasonable times, for the purposes of assuring permit compliance or as otherwise authorized by the Clean Water Act and the State Water Control Law, any substances or parameters at any location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">For purposes of this section, the time for inspection shall be deemed reasonable during regular business hours, and whenever the facility is discharging. Nothing contained herein shall make an inspection unreasonable during an emergency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Nevertheless, Bowman refused to let VDEQ take photographs during admittedly proper prior inspections. VDEQ internal correspondence, part of the administrative record, demonstrates that refusal: (1) \u201cWhen their lagoon was beyond full and had an inflow and outflow ... I was still not able to take photos. It was a no photo policy, as they have always stated (no conditions)\u201d; (2) \u201cThe permit writer asked to take photos and was denied the opportunity. The permit writers routinely photograph things such as the outfall point during re-issuance inspections\u201d; (3) \u201cI don\u2019t think the statement is true in their letter where they say they have in the past allowed photos of violations. My recollection has been that no photos were allowed\u2014period\u201d; and (4) \u201c[Bowman] continues to prohibit DEQ staff from taking photographs inside and around their facilities during routine inspections and site visits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The administrative record also contains language from the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s 2004 manual on compliance and inspection. That manual includes the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Photography is an essential tool used to assist the inspector in preparing a thorough and accurate inspection report, to present evidence in enforcement proceedings, and to document conditions found at a site....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">If the facility representative expresses reservations about allowing the inspector to take photographs [the parties can agree] to avoid photographing sensitive items which are irrelevant to the inspection, and/or allowing the representative to look through the camera\u2019s viewfinder prior to taking the photograph. With digital ... photography it is possible to immediately show the representative your image with the option to delete it if deemed unacceptable. As <em>a general rule, it is considered a denial of entry when a facility imposes any photographic restrictions which limit the inspector from properly performing the inspection.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">United States Environmental Protection Agency, NPDES Compliance Inspection Manual 2-17 (July 2004) (emphasis added) (hereinafter \u201cEPA Inspection Manual\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Because of Bowman\u2019s refusals, VDEQ requested, and the SWCB added, the following provision to Bowman\u2019s April 18, 2005 proposed re-issue permit: \u201cFacility Entry Special Requirement\u2014It shall be considered a denial of entry and a violation of Part II.W. of this permit to impose any photographic restrictions which limit Department staff from properly performing inspections and site visits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">During the public comment period prior to re-issue, counsel for Bowman wrote to VDEQ maintaining that Bowman has \u201calways\u201d agreed that photography by inspectors was permissible if there is a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 that a violation has been or is being committed. Counsel objected, however, to \u201cthe taking of pictures for no reason whatsoever.\u201d He suggested permit language incorporating a \u201cprobable cause\u201d of violation standard. That is, Bowman would only allow inspectors to take photographs at the site after written notice that evidence showing a violation, and probable cause of a violation, existed. Thus, Bowman would not permit photography during an inspection, unless and until Bowman is satisfied that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>probable cause that a violation has occurred. Counsel\u2019s letter does not address the question whether photography is a permissible evidentiary adjunct when VDEQ executes its statutory mandate in \u201cobtaining information or conducting surveys or investigations necessary\u201d during inspections, as set forth in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">After the permit was issued as proposed, over Bowman\u2019s objection, Bowman filed suit pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4000 to -4031, the Virginia Administrative Process Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), in the Circuit Court of Shenandoah County. In its pleadings, Bowman maintained: (1) \u201cThe Special Requirement creates an impermissible <em>per se </em>violation ... if [Bowman] imposes <em>any </em>photographic restrictions on authorized inspectors, even in order to protect secret information and/or its proprietary interests\u201d; (2) \u201cThe Special Provision is overbroad and denies [Bowman] the ability to comply ... without sacrificing its privacy ... [and] without triggering a <em>per se </em>Permit violation characterized as a denial of entry\u201d; and (3) The Special Requirement is \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d because it was imposed in \u201cdisregard\u201d of statutory authority and is \u201cunique to [Bowman\u2019s] permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Significantly, nowhere in these pleadings does Bowman deny that VDEQ inspectors have some right to photograph. Rather, Bowman claims that a permittee\u2019s refusal to grant that right, even if its exercise threatens proprietary or privacy interests, unlawfully constitutes a <em>per se </em>denial of access and, thus, an immediate violation. Indeed, Bowman concedes in its pleadings that: \u201cTh[e] right of entry provision hinges upon reasonableness and the methods necessary to complete an inspection that will allow inspectors to ensure that [Bowman] is in compliance____\u201d The \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard, advanced in counsel\u2019s letter during public comment, is not raised in these pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">After reviewing the administrative record and considering the argument of counsel, the trial court issued a letter opinion dated January 25, 2006. The court concluded that the issue before it did not involve agency fact-finding and, accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the deference afforded to the agency in such instances was not applicable. Rather, the court addressed the statutory authority granted VDEQ by Code \u00a7 62.1-44.20, and whether its inclusion of the Special Requirement in the permit was arbitrary and capricious. Relying on the provisions of Code \u00a7 2.2-4029,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court directed VDEQ to amend the Special Requirement as follows: \u201cIt shall be considered a denial of entry ... for the permittee to prevent or restrict photography ... reasonably related to the purpose of the site visit and the particular inspection being carried out under this permit.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai9\">The court explained the amendment in its letter opinion, Bowman\u2019s interference with photography ... would not be a <em>per se </em>violation of the permit. There would be an evidentiary issue as to whether the photography exceeded the scope permitted and hence whether Bowman would be justified in objecting. If Bowman would be found to have prevented or restricted photography reasonably related to the inspection at hand, then such conduct would be deemed to be a denial of entry and a violation of the permit. If the photography would go beyond that necessary to accomplish the inspection, then Bowman would not violate the permit by placing restrictions on such photography.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The court noted that administrative procedures existed to resolve issues arising under the amended Special Requirement language. Accordingly, as amended, the trial court found that the Special Requirement was authorized by statute and was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Bowman\u2019s present challenge, as raised on brief in the Question Presented and in the third paragraph of his pleadings, is whether Code \u00a7 62.1-44.20 authorizes photography <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>under the terms <em>of </em>the amended Special Requirement and whether its inclusion, based upon the administrative record, is arbitrary and capricious.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">(a) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">It is undisputed that the issue here raised is not one where \u201cagency findings of fact are to be accorded great deference,\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 243, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988), because of \u201cthe experience and specialized competence of the agency,\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. Rather, an \u201cagency does not possess specialized competence over the interpretation of a statute merely because it addresses topics within the agency\u2019s delegable authority.\u201d <em>Finnerty v. Thornton Hall, Inc., </em>42 Va.App. 628, 634, 593 S.E.2d 568, 571 (2004). Thus, \u201cwhen an issue involves a pure question of statutory interpretation, that issue does not invoke the agency\u2019s specialized competence but is a question of law to be decided by the courts.\u201d <em>Alliance to Save the Mattaponi v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 423, 442, 621 S.E.2d 78, 88 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2862, 165 L.Ed.2d 895 (2006). <em>See also Citland, Ltd. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Kilgore, </em>45 Va.App. 268, 275, 610 S.E.2d 321, 324 (2005); <em>Evelyn v. Commonwealth of Virginia Marine Res. Comm\u2019n, </em>46 Va. App. 618, 624, 621 S.E.2d 130, 133 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">(b) Authorized by Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">In <em>Commonwealth ex rel. State Water Control Board v. County Utilities Corp., </em>223 Va. 534, 290 S.E.2d 867 (1982), the Supreme Court of Virginia held that the Board exceeded its statutory mandate when it ordered a private utility company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>to comply with water quality standards which were admittedly technologically unattainable. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\">We conclude that the legislative intent governing the Board\u2019s authority to establish and enforce standards was at all times to require that rules be promulgated which are reasonable, practicable of attainment, based upon a fair weighing of the economic and social costs and benefit involved, and of uniform application to all affected parties similarly situated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 546, 290 S.E.2d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">As quoted above, Code \u00a7 62.1-44.20 directs the Board to inspect permit sites \u201cfor the purpose of obtaining information or conducting surveys or investigations necessary in the enforcement of the provisions\u201d of the State Water Control Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Precisely put, then, the question before us is whether photography is, within the parameters of the amended Special Requirement, a reasonable means to be employed by VDEQ in meeting the foregoing statutory mandate. We conclude it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Bowman\u2019s prior permits included a provision granting VDEQ the right to \u201c[h]ave access to and copy ... any records that must be kept under the conditions of this permit.\u201d These permits were never challenged. We see no substantive distinction between copying records and photographing that which an inspector sees is \u201creasonably related to the purpose of the site visit and the particular inspection being carried out,\u201d as set forth in the amended Special Requirement. We agree with the conclusion set forth in the EPA Inspection Manual: \u201cPhotography is an essential tool used to assist the inspector in preparing a thorough and accurate inspection report, to present evidence in enforcement proceedings, and to document conditions found at the site.\u201d Photographs are \u201can aid ... in ascertaining the truth.\u201d <em>Adams v. Ristine, </em>138 Va. 273, 298, 122 S.E. 126, 133 (1924). They are likewise a reasonable means of \u201cobtaining information or conducting ... investigations\u201d in accordance with VDEQ\u2019s enforcement responsibilities. Code \u00a7 62.1-44.20</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Support for our conclusion may be found in <em>Brock v. Nabisco Brands, Inc., </em>1986 U.S. Dist. Lexis 28733 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 1986). In <em>Brock, </em>Nabisco asserted OSHA had no right to take photographs during inspections and sought to quash an administrative warrant permitting the same. The court noted that the enabling legislation granted OSHA the right \u201cto inspect and investigate ... within reasonable limits and a reasonable manner\u201d and that administrative regulations had been promulgated thereunder concerning photography. <em>Id. </em>at *5. In denying the motion, the court stated, \u201c[T]he photographs ... would assist the agency in formulating its position .... [T]his is certainly related to the purpose of the inspection, which is to determine whether or not this employer is complying with the [OSHA] Standards and regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *10.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Moreover, we note that the Supreme Court of Virginia has stated that \u201c[t]he control of discharges into the waters of the State, where properly administered, is a valid exercise of the State\u2019s police power, entrusted to the Board by the State Water Control Law. All citizens hold property subject to the proper exercise of the police power for the common good.\u201d <em>County Utilities, </em>223 Va. at 542, 290 S.E.2d at 872 (citing <em>Weber City Sanitation Comm\u2019n v. Craft, </em>196 Va. 1140, 1148, 87 S.E.2d 153, 158 (1955)). Therefore, the use of photography as an evidentiary adjunct, within the parameters of the amended Special Requirement, is authorized by Code \u00a7 62.1-44.20 for that \u201ccommon good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">(c) Arbitrary and Capricious</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Bowman argues that the amended Special Requirement is arbitrary and capricious for two reasons: first, because there is \u201can absolute paucity of facts\u201d in the administrative record supporting the requirement and, secondly, because the Special Requirement is \u201cunique,\u201d that is, not contained in other permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\"> In determining whether substantial evidence in the record supports the decisions of the agency and the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u201cwe review the evidence and reasonable inferences it raises in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below.\u201d <em>Groome Transp., Inc. v. Va. DMV, </em>27 Va.App. 682, 693, 500 S.E.2d 852, 857 (1998). \u201cThe burden of proof rests upon the party challenging an agency decision to show that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the decision.\u201d <em>Consolidation Coal Co. v. Va. Dept. of Mines, Minerals and Energy, </em>33 Va.App. 784, 788, 537 S.E.2d 15, 17 (2000). <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-4027 (\u201cThe burden shall be upon the party complaining of agency action to designate and demonstrate an error of law subject to review by the court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">In <em>Palmer v. Commonwealth Marine Res. Comm\u2019n, </em>48 Va.App. 78, 628 S.E.2d 84 (2006), we held that a \u201cdecision is arbitrary and capricious only if there is no credible evidence in the record to support the finding and the agency \u2018arbitrarily disregarded uncontradicted evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87, 628 S.E.2d at 89 (quoting <em>City of Bristol Police Dep\u2019t v. Broome, </em>7 Va.App. 161, 167, 372 S.E.2d 204, 207 (1988)). <em>See also State Bd. of Health v. Godfrey, </em>223 Va. 423, 435, 290 S.E.2d 875, 881 (1982). We apply that standard here.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Despite counsel\u2019s claim in his public comment letter that Bowman has \u201calways\u201d permitted photography whenever Bowman had a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 that a violation has been or is being committed, the administrative record contains the evidence supplied by those who actually were carrying out inspections. That record, quoted above, shows that Bowman never permitted photography. We conclude, therefore, that evidence is credible and adequately supports the decision of the agency and the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">With respect to Bowman\u2019s second argument, the terms of the amended Special Requirement regarding photography may be unique among all other permittees in the Commonwealth. That fact, however, does not render that requirement <em>ipso facto </em>arbitrary and capricious. The Special Requirement became necessary for VDEQ to meet its statutory mandate because of Bowman\u2019s continued refusal to permit photography, a denial that was, apparently, unique among other permittees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the photography provision in the amended Special Requirement is not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\">. Bowman does not dispute that it must hold a VPDES permit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\">. Code \u00a7 2.2-4029 states, in pertinent part: \"Where a regulation or case decision is found by the court not to be in accordance with law ... the court shall suspend or set it aside and remand the matter to the agency for further proceedings, if any, as the court may permit <em>or direct in accordance with law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b435-10\">. Initially, we note that the amendment of the Special Requirement at the direction of the trial court has rendered moot, and Bowman has abandoned on appeal, the first two allegations of the pleadings below, that is, that as originally adopted the Special Requirement was over-broad in that it deemed any restrictions on photography, even to protect proprietary or privacy interests, a <em>per se </em>denial of entry and thus a violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b439-16\">. For example, we note the following excerpt from VDEQ\u2019s internal correspondence, quoted above and included in the administrative record: \"The permit writer asked to take photos and was denied the opportunity. The permit writers routinely photograph things such as the outfall point during re-issuance inspections.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
