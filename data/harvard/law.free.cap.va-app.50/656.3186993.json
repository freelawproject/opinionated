FELTON, JR., Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Following a jury trial, Joshua Paul Coyle (appellant) was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, appellant contends the evidence failed to prove he acted in a criminally negligent manner when he provided DXM capsules he packaged to Glenn Sherman Thomas. He also contends the medical evidence was insufficient to prove Thomas died of an overdose of DXM. Finally, he asserts Thomas\u2019 voluntary ingestion of the DXM capsules was the sole proximate cause of his death. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\u201cWhere the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged after conviction, it is our duty to consider it in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). \u201c \u2018When a case, civil or criminal, is tried by a jury ... the judgment of the trial court shall not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that such judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Charity v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 581, 585, 643 S.E.2d 503, 505 (2007) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-680). \u201c[T]he relevant question is whether ... any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Consistent with these principles, the evidence established that on January 23, 2005, at approximately 7:00 p.m., J.M. and Thomas, ages fourteen and seventeen, respectively, visited appellant at appellant\u2019s home. Appellant and Thomas entered appellant\u2019s bedroom and locked the door. When they emerged from the bedroom approximately thirty minutes later, J.M. saw appellant holding a bag containing white capsules wrapped together in groups of five. Appellant, J.M., and Thomas smoked marijuana together that evening. J.M. and Thomas left appellant\u2019s home sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m. On the walk to Thomas\u2019 home, Thomas showed J.M. five capsules of DXM,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as several capsules of Xanax, and told J.M. that appellant had given those drugs to him earlier that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The next morning around 12:30 a.m., J.M. and Thomas each took one capsule of DXM. They talked until approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>4:00 a.m. when J.M. fell asleep. During the late morning hours of the same day J.M. awoke to the sound of Thomas snoring \u201cvery, very, very loud[ly].\u201d J.M. fell asleep again, and when he awoke approximately one hour later, Thomas \u201cwouldn\u2019t wake up.\u201d J.M. called the police. Emergency personnel were unable to revive Thomas, who was transported to the hospital and pronounced dead around 3:30 p.m. that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Detectives from the Danville Police Department searched Thomas\u2019 home pursuant to a search warrant in an effort to locate capsules containing DXM or Xanax, but found none. Later the same day, detectives searched appellant\u2019s bedroom and located a \u201cfanny pack\u201d containing \u201ccapsules with an off-white powder inside,\u201d as well as empty capsules and \u201ca manual device [for] making capsules, where you could take empty capsules and put [] [powder] in them and then close [the capsules].\u201d In his statement to police later that evening, appellant admitted, \u201cI gave [ ] Thomas 3 or 4 DXM capsules and 3 Xanax pills____ Thomas took all the pills I gave him with him [when he left my home on January 23].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Medical examiner Dr. Susan Yenuti performed an autopsy on Thomas. She concluded that Thomas\u2019 cause of death was an overdose of DXM, which depressed his respiratory system and caused him to stop breathing in his sleep. The jury found appellant guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The sole question on appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of involuntary manslaughter of Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">A. Appellant\u2019s Criminal Negligence in Providing Thomas with DXM</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Appellant asserts the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of involuntary manslaughter, arguing his conduct in providing Thomas with DXM, a legal substance, did not amount to criminal negligence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Involuntary manslaughter may occur \u201cduring the prosecution of an unlawful, but not felonious, act, or during the improper performance of some lawful act.\u201d <em>Gooden v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 565, 571, 311 S.E.2d 780, 784 (1984). \u201cThe \u2018improper\u2019 performance of the lawful act, to constitute involuntary manslaughter, must amount to an unlawful commission of such lawful act, not merely a negligent performance. The negligence must be criminal negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo constitute criminal negligence essential to a conviction of involuntary manslaughter, an accused\u2019s conduct \u2018must be of such reckless, wanton or flagrant nature as to indicate a callous disregard for human life and of the probable consequences of the act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 201, 206, 335 S.E.2d 375, 378 (1985) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 684, 687, 179 S.E.2d 506, 509 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">It is well settled in Virginia that a conviction of involuntary manslaughter will be sustained where lawful acts performed in a criminally negligent manner cause the death of another. <em>See e.g., Gallimore v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 441, 436 S.E.2d 421 (1993) (death resulted from defendant\u2019s criminally negligent act of fabricating story likely to incite violence); <em>Cable v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 236, 415 S.E.2d 218 (1992) (defendant\u2019s criminally negligent shooting caused death of hunting partner); <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 347, 592 S.E.2d 353 (2004) (father\u2019s criminally negligent failure to remove child from closed car for seven hours in hot weather resulted in child\u2019s death).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Virginia courts have not previously addressed whether providing dangerous quantities of a lawful substance to another who voluntarily ingests it and dies constitutes criminal negligence. However, other states have found criminal negligence to exist in similar circumstances. In <em>Commonwealth v. Feinberg, </em>433 Pa. 558, 253 A.2d 636 (1969), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found a storeowner acted in a criminally negligent manner when he sold sterno, used for heating and cooking purposes, to skid row customers when he knew, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>should have known, they would extract and drink the toxic and potentially lethal methanol it contained. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Here, evidence in the record established, and appellant does not contest, that he purchased pure DXM powder from an internet supplier for the purpose of experimenting with the various stages of the DXM \u201ctrip.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his written statement to the police, appellant explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">back in 2004, I wanted to experiment with DXM---- I found a place on the internet ... that sells DXM in powder form. My friends ... and I went in on some DXM and purchased DXM over the internet. I bought capsules from the internet and used digital scales to measure out exact measurements for each capsule. I put [ ] 300 to 400 milligrams of DXM in each capsule. Some [of the] capsules only weigh 100 milligrams. You have to add different amounts to get to different stages -with the trip caused by DXM. They are called stages or plateaus. It is 7 stages, and it takes more [DXM] to reach each stage. The stages are 1. drunk/stone high 2. more excitable, like ecstasy 3. excitement plus colors, acid 4. energy goes away, zone out like anesthesia, you come down to level three 5. almost a coma state 6. deeper coma, passed out &amp; forget [the] trip 7. <em>death.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxT\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Shortly after appellant purchased his first supply of DXM over the internet, he became aware of the dangerous nature of his packaging pure powdered DXM in large dosages. He provided DXM in quantities sufficient to create the various stages of the DXM trip for L.M., a minor, who after taking one of the DXM capsules, became violently ill, and was rushed to the hospital to have her stomach pumped. When a relative of L.M. asked appellant about the nature of the substance L.M. ingested, appellant admitted \u201cyou can hallucinate on it and <em>... it could kill you.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The record also establishes that despite his awareness that taking DXM in sufficient quantities to experience the DXM stages or plateaus could be lethal, appellant nevertheless continued to package DXM in large dosages. He purposely distributed those capsules to his friends so that they could experience the DXM \u201ctrip.\u201d On the night of January 28, 2005, appellant bundled five such capsules together and gave them to Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The record contains credible evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that appellant was criminally negligent when he acted in a \u201c \u2018reckless, wanton or flagrant nature as to indicate a callous disregard for human life,\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis, </em>230 Va. at 206, 335 S.E.2d at 378 (quoting <em>Lewis, </em>211 Va. at 687, 179 S.E.2d at 509) \u201cunder circumstances reasonably calculated to produce injury, or which [made] it not improbable that injury would be occasioned, [where appellant knew,] or is charged with the knowledge of, the probable result of his acts,\u201d <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>170 Va. 597, 612, 195 S.E. 675, 681 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">B. DXM as Cause of Thomas\u2019 of Death</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Appellant also contends the medical evidence at trial failed to prove Thomas died of an overdose of DXM. He argues that, because the medical experts failed to quantify the precise amount of DXM necessary to cause death, the medical evidence failed to establish Thomas died of an overdose of DXM.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, the testimony of two experts provided credible evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude that Thomas died from a DXM overdose. In a written statement to the police, appellant admitted that he gave Thomas several capsules, each containing 300-400 milligrams of DXM, hours before Thomas\u2019 death. Dr. Kuhlman, an expert in forensic toxicology, told the jury that Thomas\u2019 post-mortem toxicology reports revealed elevated levels of DXM in his bodily fluids and tissues. Dr. Venuti, an expert in anatomical and forensic pathology, testified that, in her professional opinion, \u201cThomas died from drug toxicity, due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>to Dextromethorphan.\u201d Further, police officers searched Thomas\u2019 home shortly after his death and no drugs were found. From this fact, a jury could reasonably infer Thomas consumed all remaining capsules containing a minimum of 1200-1600 milligrams of DXM.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">From this record, we cannot say that the jury\u2019s finding that appellant died from an overdose of DXM was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Code \u00a7 8.01-680. Accordingly, we will not disturb that finding on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">C. Thomas\u2019 Proximate Cause of Death</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Finally, appellant contends that even if he were criminally negligent, and Thomas died of a DXM overdose, Thomas\u2019 own conduct in voluntarily ingesting the DXM capsules was the proximate cause of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">To sustain a conviction of involuntary manslaughter, the Commonwealth must prove that appellant\u2019s \u201ccriminally negligent acts were a proximate cause of [Thomas\u2019] death.\u201d <em>Gallimore, </em>246 Va. at 446, 436 S.E.2d at 424. In <em>O\u2019Connell v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 719, 728, 634 S.E.2d 379, 383 (2006), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">\u201c[t]here can be more than one proximate cause [of a harm] and liability attaches to each person whose negligent act results in the victim\u2019s injury or death. To be an intervening cause ... [a harm] must have been an event which [the defendant] could not have foreseen. \u2018An intervening act which is reasonably foreseeable cannot be relied upon as breaking the chain of causal connection between an original act of negligence and a subsequent injury.\u2019 <em>Delawder v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 55, 58, 196 S.E.2d 913, 915 (1973). Furthermore, an intervening event, even if a cause of the harm, does not operate to exempt liability if the intervening event was put into operation by the defendant\u2019s negligent acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-10\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gallimore, </em>246 Va. at 447, 436 S.E.2d at 425) (other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>In <em>State v. Wassil, </em>233 Conn. 174, 658 A.2d 548, 556 (1995), the Connecticut Supreme Court concluded, as we do here, that a victim\u2019s voluntary ingestion of a potentially lethal substance does not break the causal link between the provider\u2019s criminally negligent act in supplying the known dangerous substance and the victim\u2019s death. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">\u201cThe concept of proximate cause incorporates the notion that an accused may be charged with a criminal offense even though his acts were not the immediate cause of death. An act or omission to act is the proximate cause of death when it substantially and materially contributes, in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by an efficient, intervening cause, to the resulting death____ It is unnecessary for \u2018proximate cause\u2019 purposes that the particular kind of harm that results from the defendant\u2019s act be intended by him. In many situations giving rise to criminal liability, the harm that results is unintended, yet is directly or indirectly caused by an act of the defendant. In such cases, where the death or injury caused by the defendant\u2019s conduct is a foreseeable and natural result of that conduct, the law considers the chain of legal causation unbroken and holds the defendant criminally responsible.\u201d <em>State v. Spates, </em>[176 Conn. 227, 405 A.2d 656, 660 (1978)]. The defendant\u2019s conduct need not be the predominating cause or the substantial factor in bringing about the victim\u2019s injuries, so long as his conduct was \u201ca cause that necessarily set in operation the factors that accomplish the injury.\u201d <em>State v. Leroy, </em>[232 Conn. 1, 653 A.2d 161, 166 (1995)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 551-52. <em>See also People v. Galle, </em>77 N.Y.2d 953, 570 N.Y.S.2d 481, 573 N.E.2d 569 (1991) (one who knowingly supplies potentially lethal substances to victim is a proximate cause of victim\u2019s death as victim\u2019s self-administering substance was reasonably foreseeable).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Here, appellant intentionally and knowingly distributed five potentially lethal DXM capsules to Thomas, capsules appellant purposefully packaged for ingestion in large dosages. He knew that Thomas intended to ingest the DXM capsules to \u201ctrip.\u201d Thomas\u2019 ingestion of the DXM capsules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>was not only reasonably foreseeable, it was actually anticipated by appellant. Although Thomas\u2019 voluntary act of ingesting the adulterated DXM capsules was a contributing cause of his death, his voluntary act did not interrupt the natural and probable consequence of appellant\u2019s criminally negligent act of purposefully distributing DXM for ingestion in large dosages to Thomas so that he could experience the \u201cDXM trip.\u201d The record before us clearly supports the jury\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s criminally negligent conduct was a proximate cause of Thomas\u2019 death. Accordingly, we will not disturb the jury\u2019s verdict because it is not plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The record on appeal contains credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of involuntary manslaughter. Accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-10\">.
