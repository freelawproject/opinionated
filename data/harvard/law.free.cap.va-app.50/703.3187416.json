ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">A jury convicted Brian Alden Kennemore of various violent crimes, including murder during the commission of arson. On appeal, Kennemore claims his felony murder conviction should be overturned because the trial court improperly instructed the jury about the necessary causal relationship between the arson and the victim\u2019s death. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling and affirm Kennemore\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">At 1:00 a.m. one night in 2005, Kennemore and a friend arrived at the home of Mark Alger and Jennifer Popa. After the four drank alcohol and used cocaine for about two hours, Kennemore and his friend left. At 7:00 a.m., Alger went to work. He returned that evening to find Popa dead in their bedroom. Her hands had been tied behind her back, and a cloth was tied around her head covering her mouth and nose. The lower half of her body was unclothed. A steak knife lay next to her head on the floor. Wrapped in a sheet and blanket, Popa had been set on fire. After burning Popa and melting the television and the mini-blinds, the fire extinguished itself by consuming all of the oxygen in the home. Responding firefighters detected lingering gasoline fumes which had previously fueled the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">DNA testing identified Kennemore as the likely perpetrator. Samples of his DNA were found on an abrasion on the victim, on the handle of the steak knife, on the cloth tied around the victim\u2019s mouth and nose, and on the victim\u2019s shirt. The odds of it being someone else\u2019s DNA on the victim\u2019s abrasion were 1 in 6 billion. Police arrested Kennemore and charged him with multiple felonies,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> including arson and felony murder related to the arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>At trial, the coroner who performed the autopsy testified that Popa died by asphyxiation. She had been smothered to death by the cloth tied around her mouth and nose. The coroner believed Popa was dead by the time the \u201csooty fire was taking place.\u201d The forensic evidence, however, left open the possibility that Popa was alive when the initial \u201cflash fire\u201d occurred. The \u201cflash fire,\u201d the coroner explained, could have quickly consumed much of the oxygen in the room and accelerated Popa\u2019s death by asphyxia.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Kennemore did not testify. At the close of the evidence, Kennemore\u2019s counsel made a motion to strike on various grounds, including the sufficiency of the evidence offered in support of the felony-murder charge predicated on arson. Noting the coroner\u2019s testimony about the effect of a \u201cflash fire,\u201d the trial court denied the motion to strike this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">During the jury\u2019s deliberations, the foreman submitted a written question to the trial court: \u201cReferring to the charge of murder in the commission of arson, must the victim be alive at the time the fire is set or can they [sic] be already dead for the defendant to be guilty of this charge?\u201d The trial court presented the question to the prosecutor and Kennemore\u2019s counsel. The court suggested answering the question this way: \u201cIn the commission of arson as used in these instructions means a killing before, during or after arson or attempted arson where the killing is so closely related to the arson in time, place, and causal connection as to make it part of the same criminal enterprise.\u201d Kennemore\u2019s counsel objected, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\"><em>The evidence in this case indicates that the deceased was either already dead at the time that the arson was committed </em>and that the arson was committed for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>hiding her death or concealing the manner of her death, <em>or as the medical examiner testified, there is a possibility that it in fact was a contributor or the sole cause of her death from what was termed oxygen deprivation in a flash fire. Because the jury must decide between those two alternative fact situations in determining whether or not the arson was the cause of her death, </em>it is our position that the jury instruction unfairly could confuse the jury to believe that if the death were, occurred prior to the time of the arson separate, that it would permit them to find a verdict of guilty in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">J.A. at 206-07 (emphasis added). Kennemore\u2019s counsel went on to argue that the confusing nature of the proposed instruction could be remedied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">It\u2019s our position, and we suggest to the Court that the statute and the case law which the Court has referred to means that the death has to be in some way connected with the arson and that would be for example if someone were killed in order to facilitate an arson, if someone intended to permit, to commit arson and then killed someone in order to be able to commit the crime of arson, that would be murder before but would still be within the arson. We don\u2019t believe that the evidence in this case does fit that and we suggest to the Court that that is the only scenario in which that could apply....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">In short, Kennemore\u2019s objection conceded the evidence would permit a rational jury to conclude that the flash fire contributed to Popa\u2019s death. The specific objection was simply that such a contributing cause of death was not sufficiently \u201cconnected with the arson\u201d in the same way that a killing \u201cin order to facilitate an arson\u201d would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">The trial court rejected Kennemore\u2019s objection and answered the jury\u2019s question with the proposed instruction. The jury later returned guilty verdicts on various indictments, including the charge of felony murder during the commission or attempted commission of arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">On appeal, Kennemore claims the trial court\u2019s instruction was \u201cpartially correct\u201d but nonetheless \u201cincomplete\u201d because \u201cit left out cause.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The prosecution, Kennemore argues, had to prove that Popa\u2019s murder \u201coccurred <em>while the appellant was engaged in </em>the arson.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14 (emphasis in original). Kennemore interprets the question submitted by the jury to be an implied finding of fact that Popa\u2019s death wholly preceded the arson or attempted arson, thus making it all the more important that the trial court\u2019s instruction set out the causation test with analytical care. After surveying the <em>res gestae </em>precedents governing felony murder, Kennemore concludes the trial court\u2019s instruction provided too little guidance on the required causal nexus and thereby confused the jury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">(a) Jury Questions &amp; Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Kennemore\u2019s argument starts with the assumption that the jury\u2019s question represents an implicit finding that Popa had died prior to the commission or attempted commission of arson. We do not read it that way.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But, even if we did, we still would not characterize it as some sort of finding of fact by the jury. A jury speaks only through its unanimous verdict. \u201cThe verdict, as finally agreed upon and pronounced in court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>by the jurors, must be taken as the sole embodiment of the jury\u2019s act.\u201d <em>United States v. Espinoza, </em>338 F.3d 1140, 1148 (10th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). We infer from a jury verdict only those factual findings which, by logical necessity, must have been made for the jury to reach the conclusion it did. <em>See Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 231, 233, 228 S.E.2d 127, 128-29 (1976) (attributing to the jury only those findings of fact \u201cnecessarily\u201d subsumed in the verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In Virginia, as elsewhere, the deliberations of jurors \u201cduring retirement, their expressions, arguments, motives, and beliefs, represent that state of mind which must precede every legal act and <em>is in itself of no jural consequence.\u201d </em>8 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 2348, at 680 (McNaughton rev. 1961) (emphasis added). A question posed to the court during deliberations, after all, could suggest as little as the tentative views of a single juror. It cannot be extrapolated into a binding factual finding by the jury as a whole. <em>Espinoza, </em>338 F.3d at 1148 (applying the Wigmore principle and refusing \u201cto consider the jury\u2019s note to the trial judge as evidence of how the jury arrived at its verdict\u201d because the \u201cjury speaks through its verdict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">(b) The Trial Court\u2019s <em>Res Gestae </em>Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">No matter how one interprets the jury\u2019s question, Kennemore argues, the trial court\u2019s instruction\u2014taken directly from <em>Haskell v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 1033, 243 S.E.2d 477 (1978)\u2014was nonetheless an incomplete and confusing summary of the <em>res gestae </em>doctrine. We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">The felony-murder doctrine \u201coriginated at common law,\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Montague, </em>260 Va. 697, 700, 536 S.E.2d 910, 912 (2000), with antecedents recognized as long ago as Blackstone, 4 <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>200-01 (1769), and Lord Coke, 3 Institutes <em>of the Law of England </em>56 (1797). Under common law, a defendant\u2019s \u201ccommission of a felony of violence manifests a person-endangering frame of mind such that malice may be imputed to the act of killing.\u201d <em>Cotton v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 511, 515, 546 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>S.E.2d 241, 243 (2001) (quoting John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3.4-3, at 33 (2d ed. 1995) (footnote omitted)). When the killing takes place during the commission of arson, Code \u00a7 18.2-32 punishes the killing as first-degree murder. Code \u00a7 18.2-32 applies both to \u201cunintentional\u201d and intentional killings. <em>Ball v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 754, 757, 273 S.E.2d 790, 792 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Inherent in the felony-murder doctrine is the <em>res gestae </em>limitation. It focuses on whether the killing and the felony were \u201cclosely related in time, place, and causal connection\u201d to permit the conclusion that there \u201cwas a continuity of evil action.\u201d <em>Haskell, </em>218 Va. at 1043, 243 S.E.2d at 483 (finding <em>res gestae </em>satisfied where the defendant killed a victim of an attempted robbery in an effort to protect the defendant\u2019s way of escape); <em>see also Pope v. Netherland, </em>113 F.3d 1364, 1369 (4th Cir.1997) (applying <em>Haskell\u2019s </em>restatement of <em>res gestae </em>doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">\u201cThe rule which we adopt,\u201d the Virginia Supreme Court has declared, \u201cis that the felony-murder statute applies where the killing is so closely related to the felony in time, place, and causal connection as to make it a part of the same criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>Haskell, </em>218 Va. at 1043-44, 243 S.E.2d at 483 (refusing to limit <em>res gestae </em>to the elements of the felony); see <em>also Montague, </em>260 Va. at 701, 536 S.E.2d at 913; <em>see generally </em>Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Criminal Offenses and Defenses </em>338 (2007). If the felony and the killing are \u201cinextricably interwoven\u201d in this way, they conjoin for purposes of the res <em>gestae </em>doctrine. <em>Haskell, </em>218 Va. at 1043, 243 S.E.2d at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Within the <em>res gestae </em>\u201ccontinuity of evil action,\u201d <em>id., </em>it does not matter whether the killing precedes the felony or follows it. <em>See id. </em>at 1041, 243 S.E.2d at 482 (discussing, with approval, the general rule that \u201ca killing within the <em>res gestae </em>of the felony is felony-murder, whether the killing occurs before or after the felony\u201d). If the events are sufficiently related, the killing can take place \u201cbefore, during, or after\u201d the felony. <em>Hoke v. Netherland, </em>92 F.3d 1350, 1363 (4th Cir.1996) (citation omitted); <em>see Harward v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>363, 366, 330 S.E.2d 89, 91 (1985) (noting that the statutory phrase \u201cin the commission of\u2019 includes a killing <em>\u201cbefore, during, and after </em>the underlying felony\u201d (emphasis in original)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, under the prevailing view, the <em>res gestae </em>doctrine</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">embraces not only the actual facts of the transaction and the circumstances surrounding it, but the matters immediately antecedent to and having a direct causal connection with it, as well as acts immediately following it and so closely connected with it as to form in reality a part of the occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Rollin M. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>42-43 (2d ed. 1969) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Here, the trial court\u2019s instruction fairly restated the governing principles of the <em>res gestae </em>limitation on the felony-murder doctrine. The instruction explained that the killing could take place \u201cbefore, during or after\u201d the arson if the killing was \u201cso closely related to the arson in time, place, and causal connection as to make it a part of the same criminal enterprise.\u201d It was unnecessary for the trial court to give a more elaborate restatement of the <em>res gestae </em>conceptual boundaries. We find nothing in the brevity or clarity of the instruction to suggest, as Kennemore does, that the jury could find him guilty without <em>any </em>showing of causal connection between the killing and the arson or attempted arson. Nor do we think the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>instruction somehow misled the jury by giving them an incomplete explanation of their factfinding task.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Our task on appeal is to \u201censure that the law has been \u2018clearly stated\u2019 and that the \u2018instructions cover all issues\u2019 fairly raised by the evidence.\u201d <em>Mouberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 576, 581-82, 575 S.E.2d 567, 569 (2003) (citation omitted). No instruction \u201cshould be given that \u2018incorrectly states the applicable law or which would be confusing or misleading to the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bruce v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 298, 300, 387 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1990)). \u201cThe purpose of any jury instruction is to inform the jury of the law guiding their deliberations and verdict.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 120, 132, 646 S.E.2d 899, 905 (2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">It is true brevity can sometimes mask incomplete thinking. But it is more often true that verbosity parades confused thinking. Instructions to juries, therefore, should be succinct and clear\u2014leaving nothing unsaid which needs to be said, while saying no more than necessary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We rely heavily on the instincts of trial judges on where to draw that line. As the United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">Once the judge has made an accurate and correct charge, the extent of its amplification must rest largely in his discretion. The trial judge, in the light of the whole trial and with the jury before him, may feel that to repeat the same words would make them no more clear, and to indulge in variations of statement might well confuse. How far any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>charge on technical questions of law is really understood by those of lay background would be difficult to ascertain, but it is certainly more evident in the living scene than in a cold record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-5\"><em>United States v. Bayer, </em>331 U.S. 532, 536-37, 67 S.Ct. 1394, 1396, 91 L.Ed. 1654 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The trial court\u2019s <em>res gestae </em>instruction in this case compromised none of these principles. The instruction fairly addressed the causation nexus and did not understate the importance of this limitation of the <em>res gestae </em>doctrine. The trial court \u201cwas within its area of discretion in his brevity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 537, 67 S.Ct. at 1396. We thus reject Kennemore\u2019s challenge to the accuracy or completeness of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Finding no error in the <em>res gestae </em>instruction given by the trial court in response to the jury\u2019s question, we affirm Kirby\u2019s conviction for felony murder during the commission or attempted commission of arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\">.
