The will was executed on the 24th of May, 1886, and the testatrix died on the 13th of December, 1888. By the will, which was admitted to probate on the 18th of December, 1888, the testatrix makes several devises of real estate, and gives a legacy of $10,000 to her cousin, Mrs. Harwood, about which there is no dispute. The clauses of the will which give rise to controversy are the <em>ninth </em>and <em>eleventh, </em>and these will be considered in their order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-10\"><em>\u201c </em>1st. By the <em>ninth </em>clause, the testatrix, after expressing her desire to \u2018establish a home for <em>destitute, aged and infirm women, </em>where they may find a retreat from the vicissitudes of life, and to endow the same, as far as my means will allow, to be called and known as the <em>\u201c Chase </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>Home,\u201d </em>devises to eight named persons, \u2018and to their heirs, successors and assigns,\u2019 \u2018all that lot of ground on Maryland avenue, in the City of Annapolis, together with all the buildings and improvements thereon, where I now reside, (not including any of the lots, parts of said property, which have been heretofore leased or sold,) together with the furniture which may be in said house at the time of my decease, not including, however, family portraits and silverware, <em>in trust, </em>to be held by them and their successors for the objects and purposes of such home. \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">\u201cShe then devised to the same trustees certain real estate in the City of Baltimore, to be held by them \u2018as an endowment or fund to be <em>used </em>and applied, as to the rents, issues and profits thereof, for the support and maintenance of the before mentioned <em>\u201c(7liase Home,\u201d </em>in such manner as may seem best to them, or to a majority of them.\u2019 This is all of the clause \u2014 a very long one \u2014 which, according to my view of the case, it is necessary to quote at present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">\u201c But for the recent action of the Legislature, I should be compelled to declare this devise for the establishment of a most admirable charity <em>invalid, </em>by reason of the uncertainty as to the beneficiaries entitled to enjoy it. According to a loqg line of decisions by the Court, of Appeals, a devise for the benefit of \u2018 destitute, aged and infirm women \u2019 is void for uncertainty. Happily, however, the Legislature has at last intervened, and by the passage of the Act of 1888, ch. 249, has declared that \u2018 <em>no devise or bequest </em>of real or personal property, for <em>any </em>charitable uses, shall be deemed or held to be void by reason of <em>any uncertainty </em>with respect to the donees thereof, provided, the will or codicil making the same, shall also contain directions for the formation of a corporation to take the same ; and within the period of twelve calendar months after the grant of probate of such will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>or codicil, a corporation shall be formed in correspondence with such directions, capable and willing to receive and administer such devise or bequest. \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\"><em>\u201c </em>This law went into effect on the 4th of April, 1888, and of course operates upon this will, the testatrix having died on the 13th of December following. To my mind it is perfectly clear that it was the purpose of the Legislature in passing this Act to abolish under certain conditions, the rule as to uncertainly, in obedience to which so many devises to charitable uses have been stricken down by the Courts</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The question then is, have the conditions prescribed by the statute been complied with in this case P As to this I have no doubt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-7\"><em>\u201c </em>In the same clause the testatrix says : <em>\u2018 </em>And I hereby <em>will and direct, </em>and fully authorize and empower the said trustees, if in their judgment they may think best to become a body corporate either under a special charter from the Legislature of this State, or under the general incorporation laws of this State, and whether as trustees under this will or by incorporation, to make, ordain and declare whatever rules, regulations, ordinances, or bylaws as they may deem best for the better government and advancement of the Home ; provided, always, that nothing in such charter or incorporation, rules or bylaws, shall conflict with the provisions of such trust as declared by this will.\u2019 This, as it seems to me, is a substantial, if not a literal compliance with the conditions of the statute. The law cannot mean that the corporation provided for shall be created only by special Act of the Legislature, for this would nullify its operation, as to all wills which might be admitted to probate after an adjournment of the Legislature, and more than twelve months before its next session. Nor do I think there is any force in the objection that this corporation under the general law is limited in duration to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>period of forty years. \u2022 It is capable and willing to take now, and what may become of this property in case its charter is not extended and made perpetual by the Legislature, it will he time enough to decide when such an improbable event occurs. I am, therefore, clearly of opinion that the devise of this real estate under this clause of the will, for the benefit of this charity, is valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">\u2018 \u2018 Another question arising under this clause is, does the china and platedware found in the house in which the testatrix resided, pass under the terms, \u2018together with the <em>furniture </em>which may be in said house at the time of my decease, not including, however, <em>family portraits and silverware ? \u2019 </em>As to this also, I have no doubt. The china and platedware clearly passed. The terms, <em>\u2018furniture,\u2019 </em>or <em>\u2018householdfurniture,\u2019 </em>when not associated with less comprehensive words, embrace everything in the house that has usually been enjoyed therewith, and in this case would have passed the portraits and silverware had they not been expressly excepted. 2 <em>Jarman on Wills, </em>352, <em>note 0.; Kelly vs. Powlet, Ambler, </em>605 ; <em>Nieholls vs. Osborn, </em>2 <em>P.

Rep.,) </em>21.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">\u201c The remaining question under this clause is, does what is called the \u2018Ringgold Lot/ pass under the devise of \u2018 all that lot of ground on Maryland avenue, in the City of Annapolis, together with all the buildings and improvements thereon, where I now reside, (not including any of the lots, <em>parts of said property, </em>which have <em>been heretofore leased or soldi\u2019) </em>In my opinion it does not, because it is clearly embraced in the exception. The <em>property </em>here mentioned, whereon the house in which the testatrix resided stands, fronts on Maryland avenue, and extends from King George street to Prince George street, with a uniform depth of about one .hundred and eighty feet. The house spoken of is near the King George street end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>of the property, and from the Prince George street end the testatrix, prior to the execution of her will, had, in conjunction with other then joint owners of the same, leased under perpetual leases, and sold off several lots to different parti-es, on some of which houses have been built. Among the lots so leased is the one in question to Mr. Ringgold. It has a front of forty feet on Maryland avenue, and extends back about one hundred and eighty feet. The lease is for ninety-nine years, renewable forever, reserving a ground-rent; was executed on the 15th of March, 1883, and was a valid subsisting lease at the time the will was executed. This lot, therefore, comes within the express terms of the exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">\u201c But parol proof has been introduced to show, that before she executed her will, the testatrix had been negotiating with Mr. Ringgold for the purchase of his leasehold interest, had expressed her determination to repurchase the lot at any price, and had declared her intention that it should go to the Chase Home. This testimony has been excepted to, and I cannot think it admissible. Parol proof is always admissible to apply the language of a will to its subject-matter, but when this is done, such proof is never admissible to show that the testator intended to do something different from what the language of his will plainly expresses. In <em>Walston\u2019s Lessee vs. </em>White, 5 <em>Md., </em>291, a testator, devised all his land called c Parson's Outlet/ lying on the south side of a certain road, <em>'c </em>except so much of said land as lies south of Beaver Dam Branch/ and the Court held, that extrinsic evidence was admissible to show the location of the land, but not to show what was the <em>intention </em>of the testator in the use of the words <em>1 </em>Beaver Dam Branch. \u2019 \u2018 The rule, \u2019 says the Court, is this : \u2018 Where the language of the testator is <em>plain and unambiguous, </em>such language must govern, and, therefore, extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to show that he <em>meant </em>something different from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>what his language imports ; but any evidence is admissible, which in its nature and effect simply explains what the testator has written ; in other words, the question in expounding a will is, not what the testator meant as distinguished from what his words express, but simply what is the meaning of his words. And extrinsic evidence in aid of the exposition of his will, must he admissible or inadmissible with reference to its bearing upon the issue which this question raises.\u2019 Now to \u25a0 apply this rule to this case. I think it quite impossible for any one to contend that there is any ambiguity in the language of this exception. It seems to me that if any language can be plain and unambiguous, it is the language here used. It excepts and excludes from the operation of this devise to the trustees, i any of the lots \u2014parts of said property \u2014 which have been heretofore leased or sold.\u2019 Now when it is shown by extrinsic proof what lots have been so leased or sold the office of such proof is at an end, and the plain language excluding them from the devise must prevail. Courts cannot allow such language in a will to be controlled or modified by parol <em>proof </em>of intention. The case is quite different from those of <em>Warner vs. Miltenberger\u2019s Lessee, </em>21 <em>Md., </em>264, and <em>Adams, et al. vs. Morrow, </em>42 <em>Md., </em>434. The testatrix did not consummate the repurchase of this lot by receiving a release and reconveyance of the leasehold interest until the 1st of July, 1886, more than a month after the execution of her will. I hold it to be clear that the mere fact of this subsequent'acquisition of the leasehold interest in this lot cannot have the effect of taking it out of the operation of the language of the exception. Much less can parol proof, as to declarations of her intentions, have that effect. The plain words of a solemn will cannot be thus tampered with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">\u201c 2nd. The case shows that the testatrix had personal property amounting to more than $80,000 which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>had not disposed of by the previous clauses, and hence the <em>eleventh </em>clause, which reads as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\">\u201c Eleventh. Not being as yet fully prepared to dispose of the residue of. my real and personal estate to the various persons to whom I desire to leave .legacies, I now will and bequeath all the residue of my estate and effects of every kind to my executors, or to the survivor of them, to be held <em>in trust </em>and <em>confidence </em>that they will apply and pay over the same to such persons and such objects and purposes as <em>I may in writing direct &lt;md </em>designate, my purpose being, as soon as may be, to add a codicil to this will, which will fully set out my wishes in reference to the residue of my estate and effects ; and in the meantime shall, as far as in my power, give written directions to my executors in reference to the application and payment of the same, having full and entire confidence in their faithful discharge of the trust so confided to them.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">\u201cShe appointed as her executors Frank. H. Stockett, Esq., and Dr. Zachariah D. Ridout, who have qualified as such and are proceeding to settle up her estate. Shortly after - the will was admitted to probate, the executors found among the papers of the testatrix a written memorandum or note, endorsed, \u00a3 For the instruction of my executors, Dr. Z. D. Ridout and Frank. H. Stockett, May 26, 1886'. \u2019 This paper is in the handwriting of the testatrix and signed by her, but is not attested by any witness. In the body of the paper she commences by saying, <em>\u2018At my death I desire to give to,\u2019 </em>and then proceeds to' give to various relatives of her deceased husband and of herself, pecuniary legacies amounting in the aggregate to about $39,000. As soon as this discovery was made the executors brought the paper into the Orphans\u2019 Court, accompanied by affidavits proving it to be in the handwriting of the testatrix and signed by her, and in their petition prayed that the same may be filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>and recorded with the affidavits thereto attached attesting its genuineness, \u2018 to have such effect as it may.' The Orphans\u2019 Court accordingly, on the 27th of December, 1888, passed an order <em>\u2018 </em>that the foregoing papers be filed by the Register of Wills, and by him recorded in accordance with the prayer of the petitioners. \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">\u201c Can any effect be given to this paper ? The paper, as appears by its date, was written two days after the will was executed, and could not therefore be incorporated into\u2019 the will by <em>reference, </em>because it was not in existence at the date of the execution of the will. The will gives the residue of the estate to the executors <em>in trust. </em>They take no beneficial interest, but merely hold the legal title. In such cases where there is no declaration of the trust lawfully and effectually made by the testator, the trustees hold the property in trust for his heirs-at-law or next of kin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">\u201c This proposition is too clear to admit of question or doubt; it is the teaching of all the authorities. The executors, except for this paper, would unquestionably hold the money thereby attempted to be disposed of in trust for the next of kin of the testatrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-7\">\u201cIs the paper good 'as a declaration of trust in favor of the parties named in it, and what is the law on this subject ? A case very similar to this is that of <em>Saylor vs. Plaine, et al., </em>31 <em>Md., </em>158. In that case, after deciding that the parties to whom the will gave the property, held it in trust, and not beneficially, the Court goes on to say that \u2018 the law has wisely thrown around the execution of wills and testamentary papers certain solemnities, the observance of which is necessary to their validity. In the disposition of real estate, it provides that they shall be signed by the testator and attested by three or four credible witnesses. Now if this <em>unattested </em>paper, found thirty years after the death of the testator, is to be received as a declaration of trust, if it is to be en-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>grafted on the will and to give effect to the same, if in fact it is to control the disposition of the real estate of the testator, would it not be a palpable violation of the statute ? \u2019 What is thus said is also applicable now to bequests of personal property, because since that decision was made the Legislature has placed bequests of personalty and devises of realty on the same footing, and has declared that <em>both </em>shall be <em>1 utterly void and of none effect,\u2019 </em>unless they be attested by two or inore credible witnesses. <em>Act of </em>1884, <em>ch. </em>293 ; <em>Code, Art. </em>93, <em>sec. </em>310.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\">\u201c The Court then adoj)ts the law as stated in <em>Leioin on, Trusts, </em>thus : <em>\u2018 </em>Should the testator devise the estate in such language that the will passes the legal estate only to the devisee, and manifests an intention of not conferring the equitable \u2014 in short, stamps the devisee with the character of trustee \u2014 and yet does not define the particular-trust upon which he is to hold; in this case no paper not duly attested (except, of course, papers <em>existing at the date of' the will </em>and <em>incorporated by </em>reference) will be admissible to prove what were the trusts intended. Nor will the devisee be allowed to retain the beneficial interest himself; but while the legal estate passes to him, the equitable will, according to the date and terms of the will, result to the testator\u2019s heirs-at-law or general residuary devisee. \u2019 To this I may add, that the learned author in the following paragraph states the law to be the same in regard to bequests of personal estate, and it seengs to me this must also be the law here since the passage of the Act of 1884. He says: cSo if by will personal estate be given upon trusts to be afterwards declared, the testator cannot by any instrument <em>not duly executed as a will, </em>and <em>a fortiori </em>he cannot by parol, declare a valid trust, but the equitable interest will result to the next of kin, or pass to the residuary legatee. \u2019 <em>Lewin on Trusts, </em>60.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Among the cases cited with approval by the Court in <em>Saylor vs. Blaine, et al., </em>is <em>Briggs vs. Benny, </em>3 <em>DeGex &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Smale, </em>525; (see also, same case on appeal, in 3 <em>Macn. &amp; G., </em>546;) a case which has also been ajiproved by the Court of Appeals in another point in <em>Maught, Ex\u2019r vs. Getsen-? danner, et al., </em>65 <em>Md., </em>527. That case is strikingly similar to this. The testatrix, Frances Harley, by her will gave the residue of her personal estate to Miss Sarah Penny, her executors, administrators and assigns, \u2018well knowing that she will make a good use and dispose of it in a manner <em>in accordance </em>with my views and wishes. \u2019 At her death four letters were found among her papers, all in the handwriting of the testatrix, and all evidently for Miss Penny, one of them being entitled \u2018my wishes,\u2019 and another \u2018Directions for Miss Penny.\u2019 By these letters she gave sundry legacies and made various other dispositions of her property, but they were <em>undated </em>and <em>unaltested. </em>The Court after deciding that Miss Penny took the estate in trust, and not beneficially, and that the letters were all probably written after the passage of the <em>Wills Act of </em>1837, prescribing <em>formalities </em>for the effectual gift of a legacy, as well as after the date of the will, declared that none of them could be treated as \u2018 of any avail or efficacy for 'any purpose,\u2019 and in the course of his opinion, the Yice-Chancellor, Sir Knight Bruce, said: \u2018Before that statute,\u2019 (the Wills Act of 1837,) \u2018 A man could not by his will <em>enable himself </em>to devise freehold estates by an unattested codicil. But the rule may, I conceive, be more largely stated. I apprehend that a testator by a will, whether made before or after that Act, could not <em>enable himself </em>to make a disposition of any part of his property <em>by any means ivhich, if the will had not been made, he could not effectually have used. </em>Nor do I recollect any exception or qualification beyond the well-known one as to affecting real estate, by means of a will, with debts incurred and legacies given after it, which is now restricted \u25a0 so far as the statute requires <em>particular </em>formalities for the effectual gift of a legacy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The power of a testator to <em>incorporate </em>in his will another existing paper, which the will by specific reference and description identifies, and the prevention of fraud by compelling a legatee to perform, after the testator\u2019s death, a promise made by him to the testator upon the faith of which the testator, to the knowledge of the legatee, gave the legacy, are scarcely exceptions or qualifications. \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">\u201cAnother similar case is that of <em>Johnson vs. Ball, </em>5 <em>DeGex &amp; Smale, </em>85, where a testator by his will gave a policy of insurance to two persons \u2018 To hold the same upon the uses appointed by letter signed by them and myself. \u2019 Several years after the date of the will the testator wrote two unattested letters, making a declaration of the trust upon which the policy was to be held, which were relied upon by the beneficiaries, but the Court rejected them, saying: \u2018The testator\u2019s language appears to point at some letter already signed by him and the trustees; but even supposing it to refer to a letter to be afterwards signed, it is impossible to give effect to any such letter as a declaration by the testator of the trusts on which he had bequeathed the policy to his trustees. To give them any such effect would be to receive as a part of or as codicils to the will, papers <em>subsequent </em>in date to the will, which are <em>unattested </em>and which have not been <em>and could not be admitted </em>to probate. A testator cannot, by his will, <em>prospectively create for himself apoioer </em>to dispose of his property by an instrument not duly executed as a will or codicil.\u2019 Among the other English cases to the same effect, reference may be made to <em>Sidgreaves vs. Brewer, Lato Bep., </em>15 <em>Oh. Div., </em>604; <em>Singleton vs. Tomlinson, Lato Bep., </em>3 <em>Appeal Gases, </em>404; and <em>Boyes vs. Garritt, Law Bep., </em>26 <em>Gh. Div., </em>531. Such is the law established by the English Courts, and it has, to a large extent, been approved and adopted here by the Court of Appeals. The bearing and effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>these authorities on the case before me, seem complete and irresistible, in view of the fact that our Act of 1884 is substantially the same as the English <em>Wills Act </em>of 1837, 7 <em>Wm. IV, </em>and I <em>Viet. Oh. </em>26, after the passage of which most of these cases were decided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-5\">\u201c These authorities, in connection with the Act of 1884, furnish, as it seems to me, a complete answer to the argument, that this unattested paper is valid, because the testatrix had declared in her will that she has confidence .in her executors, that they will apply the property given them in trust to such persons, objects and purposes as she may thereafter in <em>writing </em>direct and designate, and that until she make a <em>codicil </em>to h\u00e9r will, she will give such <em>written directions </em>to them. If there is any force at all in these authorities, it is clear she could not, by her will, reserve to herself the power afterwards to dispose of her property after her death by any paper not executed and attested in the manner prescribed by the statute. If the argument be sound, then any and every testator may execute a duly attested will, giving all his estate to his executors on the same terms, and then afterwards dispose of it, or at least all of the personalty, by loose unattested letters and memoranda.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-6\"><em>\u201c </em>This would open the way again to innumerable controversies, and an ever increasing flood of litigation, as to what papers constitute valid testamentary dispositions of personal property, and encourage forgery of such papers, by striking down the salutary change in the law of wills made by the Act of 1884, and restoring the old law on the subject. In my judgment it would be a serious evil if the Courts should allow this to be done. The capital invested in personal property has in recent times become so enormous and important, that it is proper, if not absolutely necessary, that the disposition of it by wills and testaments should be hedged around with the same formalities and solemnities as are required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>in like dispositions of real estate. I can see no good reason why this testatrix should be allowed to give away after her death $40,000 of her money by an informal, unattested note, when she could not dispose of one of her farms, worth not one-tenth of that sum, except by a formal, duly executed and attested will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">\u201cFor these reasons, and upon these authorities, I am constrained to declare this paper to be, in the language of the statute, c utterly void and of none effect. \u2019 While I am fully persuaded that the law permits me to reach no other conclusion, I must confess I have come to it with much regret, on account of the disappointment which it will necessarily bring if sustained by the Court of Appeals, to the highly esteemed and estimable persons named in the paper, with many of whom I am personally acquainted. It is greatly to be regretted that the testatrix did not carry out her expressed purpose of making a codicil to her will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">\u201cBut an argument has been made that the action of the Orphans\u2019 Court in regard to this paper, is in effect the <em>probate </em>of it as a testamentary document, and that the next of kin cannot attack its <em>validity </em>so long as this order remains in force. This question does not appear to be raised by the bill and answer. The main object of these proceedings, as I understand them, is to obtain from the Court a construction of the will, and the effect of this paper in connection with it. But if it is raised, I do not think the position tenable. The Maryland cases (and none others need be referred to) in support of it, such as <em>Michael vs. </em>Baker, 12 <em>Md., </em>158, and <em>Warford vs. Colvin, </em>14 <em>Md., </em>582, and others, to the effect that probate is conclusive as to the <em>factum </em>of a will, if they have any bearings on this case, were all decided under the old law, when wills of personalty were not required to be attested. But even under that law it has never been understood by the profession, or decided, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>probate of an nnattested will, attempting to dispose of real estate, and validly disposing of personalty, and therefore entitled to probate, had any effect upon the rights of the heirs-at-law, or that they were hound to notice it. <em>Sale vs. Monroe, </em>26 Md., 112. The rights of the next of kin are now jjlaced on 'the same footing in this respect as those of the heirs-at-law. Why, then, should they he bound hy the unauthorized probate of an unattested paper attempting to dispose of personalty, or required to get rid of it before they can assert their rights to such property ? But I do not consider the legal effect of the order passed hy the Orphans\u2019 Court as amounting to the probate of this paper. It was evidently not the intention of that Court that it should have this effect. It is not to he supposed that the Orphans\u2019 Court would admit such a paper to probate in the face of the statute, which declares it to be void for want of attestation. The executors, in their petition, did not ask for this, but simply that it be filed and recorded with the affidavits attesting its <em>genuineness \u2018 </em>to have such effect as it may,\u2019 and the Orphans\u2019 Court simply gratified this <em>request </em>of the executors, hy ordering the Register to file and record the papers in accordance with their request. The only purpose of this order, and the only one which seems to have been intended either by the executors or the Court, was to place the paper, with the proofs of its <em>genuineness, </em>in <em>safe custody, </em>so that it could he proved in case the original should thereafter be lost, and this, I think, is its only legal effect. That the Orphans\u2019 Court did not suppose it had admitted the paper to probate, is also manifest from the fact that it has allowed the originals to be withdrawn entirely from the custody of the Register, and filed as an exhibit in this case \u2014 a proceeding in direct violation of the law, if it was regarded as a probated document. <em>Code, Art. </em>93, <em>sec. </em>339. For these reasons I do not think there is any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>force in this argument. The proof shows that the undisposed of real estate is not susceptible of partition, and it must therefore be sold by the executors, and the proceeds paid over to the heirs-at-law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\">\u201c The result then is, 1st.

The object for which it was so offered was for its safe-keeping and identification, and <em>\u201cto </em>have such effect as it may, \u2019 \u2019 and it was in the discharge of what the executors considered their duty, that said paper was delivered to the said Court, and asked that it be ordered to be recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-10\">These appellants do not contend that the said paper-writing ivould be valid as a testamentary paper. As such it would be excluded by the provisions of the Act of 1881, ch. 293, Art. 93, sec. 310, of the Code. This paper is not a <em>bequest </em>of any goods, chattels, or personal property of any kind, as designated by said law. The <em>bequest </em>had already been made and perfected by the eleventh clause of her will, validly executed in every respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>to dispose of every species of property, and this operating, as at her death, <em>divested </em>all of her estate from any claims on the part of her heirs-at-law, or next of kin, and <em>vested </em>all of it in her executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\">Though not a <em>testamentary </em>paper, and therefore not requiring probate, having been executed under the power reserved in the will, it became a part of her will as much as if it had been therein incorporated, so as to remove it from the restrictions imposed by the Act of 1884, ch. 293. As such, these \u201cinstructions\u201d come within and are-covered by the decisions in <em>Metham vs. Duke of Devonshire, </em>1 <em>Peere Williams, </em>530, and <em>Lord Inchiquin vs. French, </em>1 <em>Cox Chan. Cases, </em>1-42.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-6\">In neither of these cases was the declaration of the trusts admitted to probate, nor was either executed in the forms required to pass or bind real estate, yet each was recognized as a part of the will, and the legacies sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-7\">It will not be contended that this was not a <em>valid </em>devise and bequest, and as such, could be divested only for the reason that no clearly designated persons, or defined objects, were pointed out for the recipients of the bounty covered under the trust, to the executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-8\">It is conceded that the executors took no beneficial interests under this clause, but the devise was in no wise diminished in its validity for that cause. The Courts all agree, that if the declaration of such trusts is made sufficiently specific, that a Court of chancery can administer it, then the trust will be sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-9\">Can it be contended that this trust, so far at least as the persons and objects named in the \u201cinstructions,\u201d is too vague and indefinite to be enforced by a Court of chancery ? There is not an element of doubt or uncertainty in respect to it, so far at least as would impair full relief in its administration, by a Court of chancery. It is a perfect declaration of trust in favor of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>named in it, and made under a reservation which, is so precise, and clearly designated, that none of the controversies, or litigations intended to be provided against by section 301 of the Act of 1884, ch. 293, could by possibility arise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-5\">It can only be by a forced and strained construction, that this Act of 1884 can be made to cover this paper-writing; and whj'' should this be done, when the effect would be to work such injustice to the objects of the testatrix\u2019s bounty, and to divert her estate to persons whom she never contemjffated as entitled to her consideration ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-6\">Is her <em>intention, </em>which the Courts say controls the disposal of property by wills, to have no weight ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-7\">Conceding, for the sake of this argument, that the English Courts and text-books are in accord, in excluding under their laws, declarations of the objects of trusts, created by wills, as stated by the Circuit Court in the very able opinion of its Chief Justice, it is submitted that not one of the cases referred to would cover the case now before this Court, except in most general terms. Assuming, however, they were conclusive, in excluding such a declaration of this trust as iioav presented to this Court, Avhy should this Court be bound by such decisions and rules ? It has often manifested its freedom from being so controlled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-8\">What greater unairimity could be found than in the decisions of the English and many American Courts, and the text-books, in respect to Avhat is derisively called \u201cSpendthrift Trusts?\u201d by Avhicli the objects of the bounty, and affection of donors, Avere left Avithout protection. Yet this Court did not hesitate to disregard the whole current of these decisions, and the authority and force of the boobs, by sanctioning and protecting such trusts as has been done by the Avell considered opinion in <em>Smith &amp; Son vs. Towers, Garnishee, </em>69 <em>Md., </em>77.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Can any case be presented appealing more strongly to the careful and independent consideration of tbis Court, than the one now before it, which seeks to destroy the right of a person to dispose of her property according to her own wishes, and to deprive the persons of her choice of her bounty ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-5\">These decisions and the principles on which they stand, harsh and technical in their application, have never been adopted or even sanctioned by this Court, to anything like the extent now sought to make them applicable in this case. The case of <em>Saylor vs. Plaine, et al., </em>31 <em>Md., </em>158, depended entirely on the facts of that case, and a very slight examination of those facts will convince the Court how greatly they fall short of the effect now sought to be given to them. In that case the testator had given his entire estate to his wife to be wholly hers during her widowhood, with full power to use and dispose of it, and what should remain, if any, at the termination of her estate, he devised to four persons, to be disposed of-according to the <em>verbal directions of those four or either of them.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-6\">He thus divested himself not only of the entire estate, but left the disposal of whatever should come to the four, to be disposed of by their verbal directions, or by either one of them. No power, therefore, remained to the testator to declare or designate any trust, under which this residue was to be disposed of or enjoyed, and yet by a paper-writing found among his papers, the testator undertook to give directions how the four were to dispose of the property they might receive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-7\">This in no sense could he considered as any declaration of a trust, for it was attempted to be made by a person having no other or greater power over the estate than an entire stranger. It was an attempt to direct the disposal <em>extra vires, </em>and was entitled to receive no respect from the Court.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ao0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>(Decided 19th March, 1890.)</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-4\">A very mild approval of the principles enunciated by English decisions would have been sufficient to have excluded this declaration or direction on the part of the testator. In fact, to have disposed of it as the Court did, required no such reference, for there was no declaration or direction from one having the right or power, and thus there was an <em>absolute want or failure of any \u2022declaration </em>of the trust. Confining that case to the special facts, as it is proper to do, it will be seen that it gives no precedent to bind this Court, to the extent claimed for it, by the learned Judge who decided this case below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">The case in 31 <em>Md., </em>158, is the only instance where this question has been brought before this Court, and the reference made to it in the case of <em>Maught, &amp;c. vs. Getzendanner, </em>65 <em>Md., </em>527, was upon a different point entirely, and furnished no approval of <em>Saylor vs. Plaine, et al., </em>on the question now submitted to this Court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Adm\">Did not participate in the argument, though present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Took no part in the argument, although present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b281-12\"> Was not present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b285-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AuX\">We all agree that the decree in this case must be affirmed. The questions are fully considered and the authorities fully reviewed by the learned Judge in the opinion filed in the Court below. And we shall affirm the decree for the reasons stated, and upon the authorities relied on by the Judge below. What we have said will dispose of all the appeals taken from the same decree.
