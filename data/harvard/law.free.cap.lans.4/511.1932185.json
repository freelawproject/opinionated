The relator appeared before the justice on the return of the summons to show cause why he should not be fined for his default; and the only cause shown by him was, that he was one of the partners, and employed by the year in an establishment where castings, farming implements, and machinery were made from iron. The castings were made by melting pig iron and old iron. This was no sufficient excuse. By statute (2 R. S., 415, \u00a7 33), the court is required to discharge any person from serving on a jury when it shall satisfactorily appear, amongst other things, that such person is \u201cin the actual employment of any glass, cotton, linen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>woolen, or iron manufacturing company by the year, month, or season.\u201d Manufacturing, according to Webster and other lexicographers is, making goods and wares from raw materials. It does not include tailors and blacksmiths, or other persons engaged in making clothing or other articles for use or sale from cloth after it has been manufactured from cotton, flax, or wool, or implements and wares from iron after it has been manufactured from ore. The relator did not, therefore, come within the statute. If the defendant had been a member of such a company as the statute designates, I am of the opinion that his excuse would have been sufficient, inasmuch as it appears that although he was one of the partners and had a share of the profits, he was actually in the employment of the company, doing its work and business by the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">But, as his company was not engaged in manufacturing iron, but articles for sale and use from iron manufactured, the fine was rightfully imposed. (2 R. S., 245, \u00a7 112.)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The conviction is therefore affirmed with costs, to be paid by relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Taloott, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b530-8\">Mullin, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJn\">concurred on the ground that the relator was properly fined for not appearing and making his excuse upon being served with the venire, but did not concur in the construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Conviction affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
