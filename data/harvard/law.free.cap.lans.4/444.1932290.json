That the plaintiff recovered judgment against the company September IT, 1866, in an action against it (for negligence in failing to deliver a trunk and its contents, which was received by the company from the plaintiff in July, 1863, for transportation), after trial had upon issue joined by the company as defendant in the action.

That there were no assets of the corporation upon which an execution upon the judgment could be levied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\">The referee found that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment ; that the other stockholders were not necessary parties defendant to the action jointly with the defendant Drew, and that there was no defect of parties.
