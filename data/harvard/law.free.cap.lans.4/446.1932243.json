Ricketts et al., Appellants, <em>v. </em>The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, Respondents.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b464-10\">(General Term, First Department,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A-A\">November, 1871.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b464-11\">Plaintiffs stated to the freight agent of defendants at R., that he desired to send goods from R. to M., neither of these points being upon defendants\u2019 route, and inquired at what rate defendants would carry the same. The agent stated the rate of charges, and instructed the plaintiffs as to the malting of the goods, and directed him to deliver them to the 0. &amp; A. Co., a company having a connecting line with defendants. The goods were afterward delivered, by plaintiffs\u2019 direction, to the C. &amp; A. Co., marked as directed by the agent, and properly addressed to plaintiffs at M., and a bill of lading taken, headed with the name of defendants\u2019 road, and stipulating for the delivery of the goods to defendants\u2019 agent at P., the terminus of the company\u2019s road, to whom they were delivered; also providing that the company in whose actual possession the goods might be at the happening of any loss, should alone be responsible therefor. The goods were safely delivered at the terminus of defendants\u2019 road, for delivery at M. to a common carrier, by whom they were lost.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b464-12\"><em>Held, </em>That what occurred between the plaintiffs and defendants\u2019 agent at R. did not amount to an agreement for the transportation of the goods; nor could the sending of the goods by the plaintiffs afterward, as directed by the agent, be considered as amounting to an acceptance by them of an offer made by the agent to carry the goods upon the prescribed terms. The bill of lading contained the only contract between the parties, and as it expressly stipulated for exemption from liability of the defendants for damage, except that happening while the goods were in possession of defendants, plaintiffs could not recover.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>This was an appeal by plaintiffs from a judgment dismissing their complaint, and for costs, entered upon the report of a referee. The following facts appeared upon the trial, and were found by the referee:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\">That during the month of September, 1866, the plaintiffs were copartners, doing business in Maysville, in the State of Kentucky, under the firm name of Ricketts Brothers, and that Lewis M. Ricketts, one of the plaintiffs, was, at the time of the commencement of this action, a resident of this State; that the defendants were at the same time, a corporation duly incorporated by and under the laws of the State of Maryland, having an office in the city of Hew York; and were common carriers of goods for hire; that on or about the first day of September, in the year 1866, Lewis M. Ricketts, one of the plaintiffs herein, at the office of the defendants, Ho. 229 Broadway, in the city of Hew York, stated to the defendants\u2019 freight agent, that he was desirous of sending certain merchandise to the plaintiffs, at Maysville, Kentucky, and inquired at what rate the defendants would carry the same; the said freight agent replied, <em>\u201c </em>at the rate of $1.51 (one dollar and fifty-one cents) per hundred pounds,\u201d and instructed the said plaintiffs to have the same marked <em>\u201c </em>B. &amp; O. Express, River,\u201d and to deliver the same at the office and freight depot of the Camden and Amboy Railroad Company, pier Ho. 1, Horth river, in the city of Hew York; that the said Lewis M. Ricketts thereupon instructed the firm of George Bliss &amp; Co., of whom he had purchased for account of the plaintiffs the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, to mark such merchandise \u201c B. &amp; 0. Express, River,\u201d and to send the same to the freight depot of the Camden and Amboy railroad, pier Ho. 1, Horth river, in the city of Hew York; that on the nineteenth day of September, in the year 1866, the said firm of George Bliss &amp; Co., caused the said merchandise (the same being contained in one bale and one case) to be delivered by then carman, at the freight depot of the Camden and Amboy Railroad Company, pier Ho. 1, Horth river, in the city of Hew York, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>same being duly packed and marked in accordance with the defendants\u2019 instructions, as aforesaid, and addressed to the said plaintiffs, at Maysville, Kentucky; upon delivery thereof the said carman took from the person who received such merchandise, and carried back to said firm of George Bliss &amp; Co., a document, partly printed and partly in writing, the material parts of which were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\">\u201cBaltimore and Ohio Express route Bill of Lading.

The plaintiffs did not agree to ship any goods, and their sending property to the place designated some eighteen days afterward cannot be said to be an acceptance by them of what, putting what the freight agent said in the strongest light, was but an offer or proposition on the part of the defendant. <em>(The Chicago Railway, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>Lane, &amp;c., </em>43 N. Y., 240.) When, therefore, on the 19th of September, the plaintiffs, through Bliss <em>&amp; </em>Co., shipped the goods in question and took the receipt, which they put in evidence, the contract, whatever it was, was made. That contract was contained in the receipt, and by the express terms of it, it was agreed that that company should alone be held answerable in whose actual custody the property should be at the time of the happening of loss, detriment or damage; and as the fact was shown that the loss happened after the property had been delivered by the defendant to the steamboat running between Parkersburg and Maysville, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
