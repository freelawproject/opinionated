Said plea is not properly entitled in the cause.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b495-15\" pgmap=\"495\">\u201c2. The term of court is not stated in the caption of said plea.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b495-16\" pgmap=\"495\">\u201c3. There is no allegation in said plea that said suit is not a local action.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b495-17\" pgmap=\"495\">\u201c4. Said plea does not deny that defendants, and each, were residents of said county at the time of commencement of said suit.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b495-18\" pgmap=\"495\">And upon hearing said demurrers, the court below overruled said demurrers, whereupon appellant stands by her demurrers. And then the court adjudged that the writs of summons herein be quashed, and this cause dismissed, and awarded costs against appellant.</p> <p id=\"b495-19\" pgmap=\"495(37) 496(14)\">Appellant excepts, and appeals to this court, assigning as errors the overruling of her demurrer to said plea in abatement of appellee, George H. Sidwell; the quashing of the writ of summons served on said George H. Sidwell; the dismissing said suit, and rendering judgment against her for costs.</p> <p id=\"b496-4\" pgmap=\"496\">Thus by the pleadings in the court below it appears that appellant\u2019s claims, if any, were held by her against appellees jointly; and her counsel in this court concedes that the court below correctly overruled the demurrer to the plea in abatement of appellee George T. Sidwell, and dismissed him out of said suit.</p> <p id=\"b496-5\" pgmap=\"496\">Then if that action of the court below was correct, and we find it was, there was left to the court below this state of facts; that the claims sued upon by appellant were owing her, if at all, by appellees jointly, while the cause, when appellee George T. Sidwell was dismissed, was left pending against appellee, George H. Sidwell, alone. Hence the court below correctly dismissed said suit as to appellee, George H. Sidwell, also.</p> <p id=\"b496-6\" pgmap=\"496\">No nonjoinder by appellee George H. Sidwell, after appellee George T. Sidwell was properly dismissed, was necessary; because it appeared by appellant\u2019s own declaration that he was a necessary party. See Damson v. Sweetser, 16 Ill. App. 339, and cases therein cited.</p> <p id=\"b496-7\" pgmap=\"496\">Finding no error in the proceedings herein, by the court below, its judgment in this cause is affirmed. Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
