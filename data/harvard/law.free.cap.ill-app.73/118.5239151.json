This was shown by the answer of appellant, and admitted by the demurrer. The hearing of the demurrer took place July 10, 1897. Of what practical benefit could be the granting of the writ at that time? There was no board of review before which the defendant could produce the books. There was no duty of any sort or kind as a member of such board that petitioner Sheahan had to perform.

It was a tribunal established by law to which the owner of property might appeal from the valuation made by the assessor with authority \u2019to reduce the assessment. A right to a hearing before these revisors was granted by the law to all taxpayers, and if deprived of this right, they not be bound by the assessment.

Some reason must be assigned for it, which is done by the disclosure of a sufficient case upon affidavit.\u2019 This rule seems to be fully sustained by long and well recognized practice.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b128-4\" pgmap=\"128\">But inasmuch as there may be some question as to whether appellant has not waived this objection by answering the petition we proceed to consider whether there was error in awarding the peremptory writ of mandamus for other reasons. If it would prove vain and fruitless or useless, or if it can not have a beneficial effect, or the relator has not a clear right thereto, the writ of mandamus will not be awarded. Cristman v.

No complaint that another is assessed too low shall be acted upon until the person so assessed or his agent shall be notified in writing of such complaint, if a resident of the county.'</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b130-6\" pgmap=\"130\">\u201cAny two of such officers meeting are authorized to act, and they may adjourn from day to day upon notifying those present of the date to which they adjourn until they shall have finished the hearing of all cases presented to them.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b130-7\" pgmap=\"130\">\u201cProperty assessed after the fourth Monday of June, and all other property whereof the owner or his agent has made application to the town board to have the assessment on the same revised as provided by this section, and has given notice in writing to said board that he will appeal from its decision to the county board, shall be subject to complaint to the county board, and the county board shall revise and correct the assessment upon the same upon application of the owner or his agent, as provided by Section 97 of this act, and if it shall appear that the same has been assessed higher in proportion than other lands in the same neighborhood, the county board shall revise and correct the same and make such reduction in said assessment as shall be just and right.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b130-8\" pgmap=\"130\">Section 87 of the same chapter provides that the assessor shall cause ten days notice of the time and place of the meeting provided for in the previous section, to be given by posting notices in at least three public places in said town; and Section 88 provides that the failure to give such notice of holding said meeting shall not vitiate the assessment, except as to the excess of valuation or tax thereon, shown to be unjustly made or levied.</p> <p id=\"b130-9\" pgmap=\"130(22) 131(22)\">\" Section 90 of the same chapter provides: \u201cThe assessor shall, on or before the first day of July of the year for which the assessment is made, return his assessment books to the county clerk, verified by his affidavit, etc.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b131-4\" pgmap=\"131\">Section 97 of the same chapter, provides that: \u201cThe county board at a meeting to be held for the purpose contemplated in this section, on the second Monday in July, annually after the return of the assessment books, shall first assess all such lands or lots as have been listed by the county clerk, and not assessed by the assessor. Said board may make such alterations in the descriptions of real property as it shall deem necessary. Second, on the application of any person considering himself aggrieved, or who shall complain that the property of another is assessed too low, they shall review the assessment and correct the same as shall appear to be just. * * * Third, to hear and determine the application of any person who is assessed on property claimed to be exempt from taxation. * * * Fourth, it shall ascertain whether the valuations in one town or district bear just relation to all the towns or districts in the county, and may increase or diminish the aggregate valuation of' property in any town or district,\u00bb\u201d setting forth how the latter duty shall be performed.</p> <p id=\"b131-5\" pgmap=\"131(116) 132(167)\">Whatever may be said as to.the action of said Dunning and Barnett (being the majority of the board of review), in dismissing as they did, on July 2, 1897, all the complaints and petitions not therefore disposed of by said board of review and adjourning the said board sine die, and also as to the right of petitioner to have said assessment books produced before said board, the fact remains that this petition is for the purpose of requiring the production of said assessment books before said board to enable it as \u00e1 board to intelligently perform its duties as a reviewing board of assessments of property, but' the petition fails to show that said board would, at any time after the filing of said petition, meet again, and the order of the court requiring the production of said books was made (as is shown by the answer, which is admitted to be true by the demurrer thereto, and as shown by the order of court awarding the- writ of mandamus itself), eight days after said board had, in the manner stated by the answer, completed its business (whether improperly, unlawfully or otherwise, is immaterial), and had adjourned sine die. It may be that it was the duty of Grunning, when the board of review was in session at any time prior to or on July 1, on request of a majority of the board, to produce his books, but in the Case at bar that was waived by a majority of the board by their taking the statement of the assessor, and stating that they did not require that the books be produced\u2014 that they did not want the books.</p> <p id=\"b132-5\" pgmap=\"132\">The said board of review, however, is a creature of the statute. There is no provision of the statute which has been called to our attention, or which we have been able to discover, making it incumbent on the assessor to produce his books before said board; on the contrary, as above set forth, the statute provides* that he shall, on or before July 1 of the year for which the assessment is made, being the very day on which said Grunning was served with process, return his assessment books to the county clerk. Whatever might have been his duty when said board was in session prior to July 1, or on that day, he could not comply with his statutory duty to return the books to the county clerk on that day, and also twelve days thereafter, as directed by the order awarding the writ of mandamus, produce the books before said board of review.</p> <p id=\"b132-6\" pgmap=\"132(31) 133(86)\">The right of petitioner is certainly not a clear right, and even if it were a clear right the mandamus could have no really beneficial effect. It would be a vain and useless thing to require these books to be produced on July 13, because it does not appear that there would be another meeting of the board, but on the contrary that the board had adjourned sine die, and because before that time, to wit, July 12, the second Monday in July, the county board would meet for the purpose of hearing appeals from the decisions of the town board of review to revise and correct the assessments complained of, as set forth in the petition.</p> <p id=\"b133-4\" pgmap=\"133\">What the power of the court might be if this were a proceeding to compel said Gunning and Barnett as members of the board of review, to meet with said petitioner and perform their duties as members of said board, in the consideration of the complaints filed by the different property owners, if the provisions of the statute were such that it could be done in time to be of avail to the property owners, would present a very different question to the one at bar. The province of this court is to pass upon the questions presented by this case, and none other.</p> <p id=\"b133-5\" pgmap=\"133\">The order awarding the writ of mandamus is reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
