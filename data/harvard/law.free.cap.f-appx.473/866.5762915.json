GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">A Colorado jury convicted Paul Palecek of two counts of murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit murder. Mr. Palecek\u2019s convictions were affirmed on appeal, and the Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari in November 2000. Eleven years later, in November 2011, Mr. Palecek filed a federal habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, which the district court dismissed as untimely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Mr. Palecek now seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal that dismissal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-18\">We may issue a COA only if the petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). And where, as here, the district court dismisses a \u00a7 2254 petition on procedural grounds, that means we may issue a COA only if \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-19\">We cannot say so much here. The district court issued a thorough opinion explaining why Mr. Palecek\u2019s petition is untimely and we find ourselves in agreement with its analysis and unable to discern anything we might add to it. Accordingly, we grant Mr. Palecek\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>but deny his request for a COA and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b898-15\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-16\">. Upon review of Mr. Palecek's notice of appeal, which includes a stamp from his prison\u2019s legal mail system, it is clear that he placed his notice of appeal in the prison mail system within thirty days of the entry of the district court\u2019s judgment. Accordingly, Mr. Palecek\u2019s notice of appeal is timely filed pursuant to the prison mailbox rule. Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1); <em>Price v. Philpot, </em>420 F.3d 1158, 1163-64 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
