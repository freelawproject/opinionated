(\u201cB &amp; N\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s order granting Erick Lina\u2019s motion to remand his class action to state court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the Declaration of Marvin Adams lacked foundation. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(4). The record is unclear whether Adams supervised all B &amp; N stores in California as opposed to merely a subset, and what responsibilities his position entailed. Absent this information, the district court was justified in refusing to infer that Adams knew the circumstances of all the Store Managers across California.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">Even assuming Adams supervised all California stores, his Declaration does not explain how he learned the details concerning the Store Managers\u2019 average annual salaries, typical schedules, and break periods. It was not unreasonable for the district court to expect that Adams took steps to ascertain these facts, and thus, to require Adams to lay that foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">Further, the district court\u2019s refusal to give B &amp; N an opportunity to cure these defects was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Abrego Abrego v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>443 F.3d 676, 691 (9th Cir.2006) (per curiam); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"b639-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b639-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
