Salazar appeals the district court\u2019s grant of inmate Alexander Mezhbein\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-26\">1. Although Mezhbein was released from prison pursuant to an order of the district court, this appeal is not moot. Mezhbein\u2019s release was effected by the very order that the Warden now argues was in error. <em>See Eagles v. United States ex rel. Samuels, </em>329 U.S. 304, 307-08, 67 S.Ct. 313, 91 L.Ed. 308 (1946) (\u201cThough the writ has been granted and the prisoner released, the appellate court by what it does is not rendering an opinion and issuing an order which cannot affect the litigants in the case before it.... Reversal undoes what the habeas corpus court did and makes lawful a resumption of the custody.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-27\">2. Mezhbein argues that the Warden failed to appeal the district court\u2019s order subsequent to its initial grant of Mezhbein\u2019s habeas petition, which directed the state governor to consent to Mezhbein\u2019s release from prison. The Warden was not obligated to appeal the district court\u2019s subsequent order, because the relevant judgment in a federal habeas appeal is the district court\u2019s grant or denial of the writ itself. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a); <em>see also Eagles, </em>329 U.S. at 307, 67 S.Ct. 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>3. Federal due process requires only that a prisoner seeking parole receive an opportunity to be heard, notification of the reasons for any denial, and advance access to the record. <em>See Swarthout v. Cooke, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 859, 862, 178 L.Ed.2d 732 (2011). Mezhbein concedes that he was afforded this constitutionally adequate process.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">4. Finally, we note that since his release, Mezhbein has lived peaceably in Southern California for five years. That the state is constitutionally entitled to return him to custody does not mean that it would be judicious to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b804-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
