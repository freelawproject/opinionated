The district court calculated Wazny\u2019s Guidelines range under the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2010) at 324 to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment and sentenced Wazny to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on the distribution count and a consecutive sentence of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment on the possession count, for a total imprisonment term of 340 months. On appeal, Wazny\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred in the manner in which it determined that consecutive prison terms were warranted in Wazny\u2019s case. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal of Wazny\u2019s sentence based on his waiver of appellate rights. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-19\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Poindexter, </em>492 F.3d 263, 270 (4th Cir.2007). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the plea colloquy performed in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005). Whether a defendant validly waived his right to appeal is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162,168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-20\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Wazny knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his 340-month prison sentence. We therefore grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss the appeal of Wazny\u2019s sentence. Although Wazny\u2019s appeal waiver insulates his sentence from appellate re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>view, the waiver does not prohibit our review of his convictions pursuant to <em>Anders. </em>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the remainder of the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for review. We therefore affirm Wazny\u2019s convictions and dismiss the appeal of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">This Court requires that counsel inform Wazny, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Wazny requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this Court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Wazny.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
