The asserted patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,466,898, relates to a design simulation tool, Verilog Compiler Simulation (\u201cVCS\u201d), used to test and debug complex integrated circuits. Dynetix sought discovery of defendant Synopsys, Inc.\u2019s VCS source code for the accused instrumentalities. Synopsys agreed to produce the source code, but only if the parties would stipulate to the Model Protective Order used in the Northern District of California, which, <em>inter alia, </em>makes produced source code available for inspection only at the office of the producing party\u2019s counsel during business hours, unless the parties otherwise agree, and prohibits the receiving party from transferring the source code onto a recordable device. Paper copies of limited portions of the source code may be requested as needed for preparation of court filings, expert reports, etc., but not for the purpose of reviewing the source code. Dynetix objected that the Model Protective Order\u2019s source code restrictions were too burdensome, and proposed alternate provisions to safeguard against inadvertent disclosure. The district court granted Synopsys\u2019 motion for entry of the Model Protective Order and denied Dynetix\u2019s cross-motion for entry of its modified protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-22\">Mandamus requires the petitioner to establish: (1) there are no alternative means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>of obtaining the relief desired, <em>Mallard v. U.S. District Court, </em>490 U.S. 296, 309, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989), and (2) the right to the relief sought is \u201cclear and undisputable,\u201d <em>Allied Chemical Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). Mandamus is an \u201cextraordinary remedy,\u201d justifiable only in \u201cexceptional circumstances, amounting to a judicial usurpation of power....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Dynetix\u2019s petition fails to meet this high standard. The district court found Dynetix\u2019s concerns about lack of sufficient access to Synopsys\u2019 source code under the Model Protective Order to be \u201cmerely speculative,\u201d and noted that Dynetix could seek relief from the court if its fears came to pass. Likewise, Dynetix\u2019s work-product concern regarding possible inappropriate monitoring of searches by opposing counsel was \u201cunfounded\u201d according to the district court, because such behavior is prohibited by the Model Protective Order, and violations would subject opposing counsel to sanctions. The district court thus made it clear that Dynetix could seek the court\u2019s assistance if the source code provisions of the Model Protective Order were unworkable. Accordingly, Dynetix has alternative means to obtain relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Dynetix has not established that it has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to relief from the district court\u2019s decision to use the Model Protective Order. The district court\u2019s Patent Local Rules provide that \u201c[t]he Protective Order authorized by the Northern District of California shall govern discovery unless the Court enters a different protective order,\u201d N.D. Cal. Pat. L.R. 2-2. We note that neither party disputed that some protective order was appropriate to protect the source code in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">The petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
