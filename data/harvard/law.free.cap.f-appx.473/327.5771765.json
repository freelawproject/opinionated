R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2006) petition (No. 11-7548), and the district court\u2019s order denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion for reconsideration of that order (No. 12-6398). The orders are not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certif\u00edcate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (2006); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 369 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the petition states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-17\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Barnes has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Barnes\u2019 motion to hold Appeal No. 11-7548 in abeyance, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-18\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
