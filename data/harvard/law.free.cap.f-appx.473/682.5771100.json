We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182,1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-23\">Singh does not allege past persecution. With respect to his fear of future harm in India, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Singh failed to establish a clear probability that he would be persecuted on account of his Christian religion or his conversion to Christianity. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179,1185 (9th Cir.2003) (no compelling evidence that persecution of nonpolitical Albanians in Kosovo is so widespread that applicant faced a clear probability of persecution). Accordingly, Singh\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Singh has not established that it is more likely than not he would be tortured by the government or with the government\u2019s consent or acquiescence if returned to India. <em>See Soriano v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 1162, 1167 (9th Cir.2009). Accordingly, Singh\u2019s CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b714-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
