Oct. 29, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of Balliu\u2019s motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006). An alien may file only one motion to reopen and must do so within 90 days of the final administrative decision. <em>Luna v. Holder. </em>637 F.3d 85, 95-96 (2d Cir.2011); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although Balliu\u2019s motion was indisputably untimely, there is no time or numerical limitation if the alien establishes materially \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); see <em>also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-15\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Balliu\u2019s motion to reopen. Balliu argues that the BIA erred by failing to properly consider and give weight to his father\u2019s statement, the police report his father filed, and a newspaper article in the record. To the contrary, the BIA specifically referenced those documents in its decision, and went on to find that, although the evidence supported the claim that Balliu\u2019s father had been harmed, it indicated that the motivation for the attacks was criminal. <em>See Ucelo-Gomez v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 70, 74 (2d Cir.2007) (harm motivated by wealth is not persecution under the INA). Balliu therefore essentially quarrels with the weight that the BIA chose to afford to the documents, a decision that lies within the BIA\u2019s discretion. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-16\">Moreover, the BIA\u2019s determination that the attacks on Balliu\u2019s father were motivated by money rather than by the family\u2019s political opinion was not \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001). As the BIA found, the police report and the local news article indicated only that the motive behind those events was \u201ca criminal demand for money.\u201d In addition, the BIA pointed to a doctor\u2019s report relating to injuries that Balliu\u2019s father allegedly sustained in October 2008, which stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>that the father \u201crefused to inform the doctor of the cause\u201d of his injuries. Indeed, the only record evidence suggesting a political motive for the attacks was the father\u2019s statement, which the BIA reasonably determined was \u201cless persuasive than these other reports, which appear to be more objective.\u201d <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 171 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201cWe do not ourselves attempt to resolve conflicts in record evidence, a task largely within the discretion of the agency\u201d); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
