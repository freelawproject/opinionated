Windfeldt appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-28\">Windfeldt contends that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to the effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>assistance of counsel during plea negotiations because counsel failed to adequately advise him of all the mental states included in the second-degree murder charge. The state court\u2019s conclusion that Windfeldt did not show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, he would have accepted the plea offer, was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, nor was it based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Hill v.
