We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Ghahremani v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 993, 997 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Cir.2007), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Menendez\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Even if Menendez were entitled to equitable tolling of the filing deadline during the representation by her former counsels, her motion is untimely because it was filed more than ninety days after she met with present counsel and \u201cdefinitively learned\u201d of her former counsels\u2019 incompetence. <em>See Ghahremani, </em>498 F.3d at 999-1000; <em>see also Dela Cruz v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 946, 949 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (\u201c[T]he pendency of a petition for review of an order of removal does not toll the statutory time limit for the filing of a motion to reopen with the BIA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In light of our disposition, we need not reach Menendez\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">We note that Menendez has been granted Temporary Protected Status and cannot be removed from the United States while she maintains this status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">The Clerk shall amend the docket to reflect that the sole petitioner is Irma Juventina Menendez, A073-936-671. The substance of the underlying motion to reopen relates solely to Irma Juventina Menendez. Because Melvin Ernesto Menendez did not file a separate petition for review and cannot derive any status from his mother\u2019s applications for relief, his case is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b706-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
