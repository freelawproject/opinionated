Although oral argument was scheduled, the Appellant did not appear and the Appellees chose to rest on their brief. The court has afforded full consideration to the issues presented and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. R. 36(d). For the reasons stated below, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b35-23\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the order of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-24\">Emmanuel Lazaridis filed an application for discovery in the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782. He sought documents from the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC) and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), allegedly for use in a pending criminal prosecution and separate investigation in Greece. Section 1782(a) authorizes district courts in the district in which a person resides or is found to compel discovery for use in foreign or international proceedings. The district court determined that it had authority under this statute to order discovery, but declined to exercise its discretion to grant Lazaridis\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-25\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its considerable discretion when determining whether to grant discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>ery under \u00a7 1782(a). The district court was not required to grant Lazaridis\u2019s application \u201csimply because it ha[d] the authority to do so,\u201d <em>Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., </em>542 U.S. 241, 264, 124 S.Ct. 2466,159 L.Ed.2d 355 (2004); rather, Congress made the decision whether to grant a \u00a7 1782 application one of judicial discretion, <em>see id. </em>at 260-61, 124 S.Ct. 2466. The district court considered the specific facts of Lazaridis\u2019s application consistent with the factors the Supreme Court has instructed are relevant under \u00a7 1782(a), <em>id. </em>at 264-65, 124 S.Ct. 2466. Lazaridis cannot show that the factors the court chose to weigh most heavily\u2014primarily the criminal nature of the foreign proceedings and burdensomeness of his request\u2014were inappropriate or that its ultimate decision was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Moreover, the district court had no obligation to trim Lazaridis\u2019s discovery request after it determined it was overbroad and vague, and it correctly concluded that \u00a7 1782(a), not the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, governed its decision in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The Clerk, is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing <em>en banc. </em>See Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. R. 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
