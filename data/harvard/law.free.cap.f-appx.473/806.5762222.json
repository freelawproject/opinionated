The district court denied Lopez leave to file without prepayment of the full filing fee, on the ground that Lopez\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. We vacate, reverse, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-21\">1. Although the magistrate\u2019s recommendation states that Lopez \u201crequested leave to proceed <em>in forma pawperis,\u201d </em>the record does not indicate that Lopez ever made such a request. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Lopez leave to file the action without prepayment of the full filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-22\">2. The district court may have intended to dismiss Lopez\u2019s complaint, pursuant to mandatory screening under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. So construing the district court\u2019s denial of leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis, see O\u2019Neal v. Price, </em>531 F.3d 1146, 1153 (9th Cir.2008), we conclude that the court erred in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-23\">Lopez\u2019s complaint, as it now stands, may satisfy the relaxed pleading standards applied to <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs. <em>See Hebbe v. Pliler, </em>627 F.3d 338, 342 &amp; n. 7 (9th Cir. 2010). But even if it does not, the district court should have granted Lopez leave to amend. <em>See Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122,1130-31 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-24\">Lopez may well be able to cure the complaint\u2019s deficiencies by alleging additional facts. Lopez could, for example, amend his complaint to clarify: (1) which MCDC staff members he informed of his toxoplasmosis diagnosis and need for sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>gery; and (2) whether any defendants either acquiesced or were directly involved in the alleged provision of rotten food. With such amendments, the complaint would most likely render Lopez\u2019s allegations adequate to support his constitutional claims. <em>See Jett v. Penner, </em>439 F.3d 1091, 1094, 1097-98 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that a prison physician\u2019s months-long delay in scheduling a medical consultation ordered by the prisoner\u2019s prior physician could constitute deliberate indifference, where the record showed that the delay was harmful); <em>Keenan v. Hall, </em>83 F.3d 1083, 1091 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that the provision of spoiled food violates the Eighth Amendment); <em>see also Snow v. McDaniel, </em>681 F.3d 978, No. 10-16951, 2012 WL 1889774, at *8 (9th Cir.2012) (holding that a prison warden and associate warden could be held liable for deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s medical needs, \u201c[b]ecause they were aware [the prisoner] needed surgery and failed to act to prevent further harm\u201d). We therefore reverse the dismissal of Lopez\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">3. MCDC argues that Lopez\u2019s complaint is time-barred. Because the district court did not address MCDC\u2019s fact-bound statute of limitations defense, we decline to reach it here. <em>See Hells Canyon Pres. Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>403 F.3d 683, 691 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">4. Lopez concedes that the Central District of California is an improper venue. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b). On remand, the district court should consider whether to transfer the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">VACATED, REVERSED, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b838-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
