Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider and reopen, and review de novo due process claims. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Santana-Quintero\u2019s motion to reopen and reconsider because SantanaQuintero failed to establish that the alleged ineffective assistance of his former attorneys may have affected the outcome of his proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 793-94 (to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must demonstrate prejudice); <em>Mielewczyk v. Holder, </em>575 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>F.3d 992, 995-98 (9th Cir.2009) (a conviction for violating California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11352 constitutes a removable controlled substance offense where the record of conviction establishes that the offense involved cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review SantanaQuintero\u2019s contention that he qualifies for relief under former section 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996), because he failed to exhaust this claim in his motion to reopen and reconsider. <em>See Barron v.
