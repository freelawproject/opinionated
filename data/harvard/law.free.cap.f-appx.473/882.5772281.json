Adams contends that he is entitled to a reduced sentence under Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which was promulgated after Congress enacted the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). The district court ruled that Adams was ineligible for a reduced sentence because he had been sentenced as a career offender. Adams contends that the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2695, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), abrogated our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), regarding whether a defendant sentenced as a career offender is eligible for a reduced sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a decision that a movant is ineligible for a reduced sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">The district court did not err when it denied Adams\u2019s motion. Adams was ineligible for a reduced sentence because Amendment 750 did not lower his guideline range. <em>See id. </em>at 1330. Adams was sentenced as a career offender, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov.2008), and was ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 750. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28, 1330. Moreover, the district court was not permitted to consider whether Adams\u2019s designation as a career offender was erroneous. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). Adams was not sentenced based on an offense level that was higher than the otherwise applicable offense level for career offenders, and he did not receive a departure, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, that might have provided him with a sentencing range that could have been affected by Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">Adams\u2019s argument about <em>Freeman </em>is meritless. In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court decided a case arising from a plea agreement that allowed the government and defendant to agree to a term or range of imprisonment, and present the plea agreement to the district court for acceptance or rejection, but not alteration. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C). The Supreme Court held that, under section 3582 and Rule 11(c)(1)(C), the sentence can be said to be \u201cbased on\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines, and eligible for a later reduction, if the express terms of the plea agreement provide that the sentence is set by a sentencing range, applicable to the charged offense, to establish the term of imprisonment. In contrast, Adams was sentenced as a career offender, which renders him ineligible for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
