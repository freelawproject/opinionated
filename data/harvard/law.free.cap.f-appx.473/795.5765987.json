Subsequently, he was denied relief pursuant to the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Barrios was neither persecuted nor tortured in Guatemala. Therefore, he is not entitled to a rebuttable presumption that he will be persecuted in the future should he be returned. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). In addition, the record does not compel the conclusion (1) that he adequately demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground, i.e., his membership in a particular social group, (2) that he is a member of a group disfavored in his country, or (3) that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted should he return. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1062-64 (9th Cir.2009). Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s final decision and order, including its determination that he is not entitled to CAT protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b828-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
