He contends that he was denied medication, and \u201cparticular counseling\u201d that a \u201cDirector/Doctor\u201d had prescribed to treat his depression and suicidal thoughts. He also asserts that after being improperly placed in administrative segregation due to a disciplinary proceeding, all mental health treatment came to a halt. Huff consented to proceed before a magistrate judge who granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment based on the ground that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">This court reviews the dismissal of a complaint on summary judgment de novo. <em>Nickell v. Beau View of Biloxi, L.L.C., </em>636 F.3d 752, 754 (5th Cir.2011). Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, government officials acting within their discretionary authority are immune from civil liability for damages if their conduct does not violate clearly established constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. <em>See Flores v. City of Palacios, </em>381 F.3d 391, 393-94 (5th Cir. 2004). The test for qualified immunity has two prongs: \u201c(1) whether the plaintiff has alleged the violation of a clearly established constitutional right, and (2) if so, whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was objectively unreasonable in the light of the clearly established law at the time of the incident.\u201d <em>Domino v. Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 755 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA court may rely on either prong of the defense in its analysis.\u201d <em>Brown v. Callahan, </em>623 F.3d 249, 253 (5th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2932,180 L.Ed.2d 225 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">Huff has made no showing of deliberate indifference. The medical records and Huff\u2019s recitation of the facts indicate that he was frequently provided mental health treatment for his depression. Notably, \u201c[mjedical records of sick calls, examinations, diagnoses, and medications may rebut an inmate\u2019s allegations of deliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1995). He has not shown that the defendants ignored his complaints, refused treatment, intentionally treated him incorrectly, \u201cor engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u201d <em>See Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985). As such, he has failed to show that the defendants\u2019 conduct violated his constitutional rights, and he has failed to show that the magistrate judge erred in determining that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Domino, </em>239 F.3d at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">Huff does not challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that his request for monetary damages is barred by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). He also does not challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s July 29, 2010 order dismissing 11 defendants and his claims concerning harassment, retaliation, and prison disciplinary proceedings. Accordingly, he has abandoned the claims. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The judgment is AFFIRMED. Huffs motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
