R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b696-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-21\">Sari Anggriani and her husband, natives and citizens of Indonesia, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing their appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying then-application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law and review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Anggriani did not experience harms in Indonesia amounting to past persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1059-60; <em>Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 975-76 (9th Cir.2009). In addition, even as a member of a disfavored group, the record does not compel the conclusion that Anggriani established a well-founded fear of persecution in Indonesia because she did not demonstrate sufficient individualized risk of persecution. <em>See Halim, </em>590 F.3d at 979; <em>cf Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-23\">Because petitioners failed to establish eligibility for asylum, they necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-24\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because petitioners failed to establish it is more likely than not that they will be tortured upon return to Indonesia. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Finally, petitioners\u2019 due process claim fails because the proceedings were not so fundamentally unfair that Anggriani was prevented from reasonably presenting her case, and because she failed to demonstrate prejudice. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge); <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error and prejudice for a petitioner to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b696-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
