Bolick appeals pro se from the District Court\u2019s order dismissing his amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and from a subsequent order denying reconsideration. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we need only summarize the facts and procedural history of this case. Bolick was represented by counsel in the District Court. In an amended complaint, he alleged that he was \u201cfraudulently convicted and sentenced\u201d in 1981 in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, after pleading guilty to a charge of robbery. In 2007, long after his ten-year maximum sentence had expired, Bolick filed various pleadings in the trial court, including a proposed order seeking to vacate/strike the 1981 conviction. Despite having rejected Bolick\u2019s related submissions, Judge Robert B. Sacavage signed and filed the proposed order in June 2007. The order stated that the 1981 judgment \u201cis void on its face for lack of jurisdiction due to <em>fraud upon the court.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Bolick alleges that Judge Sacavage thereafter had an ex parte conference</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">with Chuck Cobaugh, an employee of the Pennsylvania State Police. (Bolick had informed the State Police of the court\u2019s order in an effort to clear his criminal record.) Judge Sacavage then filed an order in November 2007 vacating his June 2007 order. Judge Sacavage explained that the June order was \u201cinadvertently signed,\u201d that he had \u201cintended to deny [Bolick\u2019s] Proposed Order,\u201d and that he had \u201cpreviously disposed of this issue\u201d by entering an order in May 2007 denying Bolick\u2019s petition to strike/open the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">Bolick appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, which held that Judge Sacavage\u2019s June and November orders were both \u201clegal nullities\u201d because the time in which to modify the earlier order denying Bolick\u2019s petition to strike/open had expired. The Superior Court thus quashed Bolick\u2019s appeal and remanded for the trial court to vacate the June and November orders and to reinstate a May 25, 2007, order denying Bolick\u2019s petition to strike/ open the 1981 judgment. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied Bolick\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">In the present suit, Bolick complains that the \u201cfraudulent\u201d 1981 conviction remains on his criminal record, that the conviction \u201cno longer exists\u201d in light of Judge Sacavage\u2019s June 2007 order, and that certain defendants conspired to violate his rights in connection with the alleged ex parte conference with Judge Sacavage. Bolick sought damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for alleged violations of his First, Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as damages based on state-law claims of false reports, defamation, and civil conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">The District Court granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the amended complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and denied Bolick\u2019s motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>default judgment against Northumberland County. The District Court noted that Bolick agreed to the dismissal of his claims against the following defendants: the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; the Pennsylvania State Police; the Northumberland County Public Defender\u2019s Officer; George Nagle; and the Northumberland County District Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">As to the remaining defendants\u2014Cobaugh, Anthony J. Rosini, John P. Muncer (Rosini and Muncer are prosecutors), and Northumberland County\u2014the District Court held that Bolick failed to state a viable claim for relief under federal or state law. Among other things, the District Court observed that <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), bars any \u00a7 1983 claim that would necessarily imply the invalidity of the 1981 conviction, that the public record contradicts Bolick\u2019s assertion that his 1981 conviction is invalid, thereby undermining many of his claims, and that Bolick failed to point to a policy or custom to support a municipal liability claim against Northumberland County. After the District Court denied Bolick\u2019s timely filed motion for reconsideration, Bolick timely filed a pro se notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201cOur review of a district court\u2019s order of dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, is plenary and we apply the same test as the district court.\u201d <em>Doug Grant, Inc. v. Greate Bay Casino Corp., </em>232 F.3d 173,183 (3d Cir.2000). \u201cWe review a denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion, but we review the District Court\u2019s underlying legal determinations de novo and factual determinations for clear error.\u201d <em>Howard Hess Dental Labs. Inc. v. Dentsply Intern., Inc., </em>602 F.3d 237, 246 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">As a preliminary matter, it is clear that Bolick, through his counsel, expressly waived all claims against several defendants in response to the motions to dismiss. Consequently, the only issues properly raised on appeal concern the four remaining defendants: Cobaugh, Rosini, Muncer, and Northumberland County. Furthermore, as to Rosini and Muncer, Bolick waived his \u00a7 1983 claims, and as to Northumberland County, he waived his state-law claims. We review only those claims that Bolick did not waive in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">Turning to the merits, we discern no error in the District Court\u2019s analysis and fully agree with its reasons for holding that Bolick failed to state a federal or state-law claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Bolick contends that the District Court erred by not accepting as true his contentions that the 1981 conviction is \u201cfraudulent\u201d and that it was \u201cinvalidated\u201d by Judge Sacavage\u2019s June 2007 order. However, when ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court is permitted to look to matters of public record, including \u201ccriminal case dispositions,\u201d <em>Pension Ben. Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., </em>998 F.2d 1192, 1197 (3d Cir.1993), and \u201ca prior judicial opinion.\u201d <em>McTernan v. City of York, Pa., </em>577 F.3d 521, 526 (3d Cir.2009). The District Court here properly took note of the public record regarding Bolick\u2019s 1981 conviction, including the Superior Court\u2019s ruling that Judge Sacavage\u2019s June 2007 order is a \u201clegal nullity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">To survive a motion to dismiss, Bolick had to plead \u201cfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955,167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>extent that Bolick\u2019s claims hinge upon the untenable assertion that his 1981 conviction is somehow invalid or fraudulent, those claims do not pass the plausibility test. And while Bolick insists that the Superior Court improperly vacated Judge Sacavage\u2019s June 2007 order, <em>see, e.g., </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9-11, the fact remains that the Superior Court <em>did </em>vacate the June 2007 order, and therefore the 1981 conviction undoubtedly still stands. On this record, we are satisfied that the District Court did not err in its application of the Rule 12(b)(6) standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We also agree with the District Court that Bolick\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims are barred at least in part under <em>Heck </em>to the extent that a judgment in Bolick\u2019s favor would necessarily imply the invalidity of the 1981 conviction. As the Court held in <em>Heck, </em>\u201cto recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional ... harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal <em>authorized to make such determination, </em>or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus[.]\u201d 512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (footnote omitted, emphasis added). As mentioned, the Superior Court held that Judge Sacavage\u2019s June 2007 order was unauthorized, and therefore Bolick\u2019s conviction remains valid for purposes of the <em>Heck </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We have considered Bolick\u2019s remaining arguments, including any challenge that he may be raising to the denial of his motion for reconsideration, but we find those arguments without merit and in need of no separate discussion. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\">. Bolick\u2019s motion to strike the brief of appellees Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, et al., is denied. Contrary to Bolick\u2019s contention, the Clerk granted appellees\u2019 motion for an extension of time, and appellees filed their brief within the time permitted. While appellees did not initially submit a certificate of service with the brief, they promptly filed a certificate after the Clerk notified them of the deficiency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
