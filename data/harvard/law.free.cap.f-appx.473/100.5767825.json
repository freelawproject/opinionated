Dec. 6, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2006). It is well established that the BIA may deny an alien\u2019s motion to reopen for failure to demonstrate her <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for the underlying relief sought. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). To establish eligibility for asylum, an applicant, like Chen, who does not rely on past persecution must demonstrate an objectively reasonable well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Kyaw Zwar Tun v. INS, </em>445 F.3d 554, 564 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). An asylum applicant can demonstrate that a fear of future persecution is objectively reasonable by either: (1) offering evidence that \u201cshe would be singled out individually for persecution\u201d; or (2) \u201cproving the existence of a pattern or practice in [] her country of nationality of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.13(b)(2), 1208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Chen argues that she established a well-founded fear of future persecution based on her assertion that she would practice in an unregistered church in China and letters from individuals in her native village and background evidence indicating that members of unregistered churches are persecuted in China. However, the BIA reasonably declined to consider her evidence to the extent that it pertained to individuals who were not similarly situated to her\u2014including members of underground churches that were not located in her native Fujian Province, pastors, human rights and pro-democracy activists, lawyers, and artists. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (requiring that a motion to reopen be based on new evidence <em>material </em>to the movant\u2019s eligibility for asylum); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.13(b)(2), 1208.16(b)(2) (providing that, to establish an objective basis for a fear of future persecution, evidence of a pattern or practice of persecution must involve a group of persons \u201csimilarly situated to the applicant\u201d). To the extent that Chen\u2019s evidence indicated that members of underground churches in Fujian Province were sometimes subject to beatings, arrest, and detention, the BIA reasonably found that, absent more detailed evidence, such treatment does not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Mei Fun Wong v. Holder, </em>633 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2011); <em>Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied Chen\u2019s motion based on her failure to demonstrate her <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for relief. <em>See Jian Hui Shao, </em>546 F.3d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
