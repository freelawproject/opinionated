Gritzner, Chief District Judge for the U.S. District Court for Southern Iowa, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">The plaintiffs in this class action appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Kinro. We affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs lack standing to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">An order granting or denying summary judgment is reviewed de novo, <em>see Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. of Am. v. Brenneke, </em>551 F.3d 1132, 1137 (9th Cir.2009), as is a district court\u2019s decision on standing, <em>see Fair Hous. of Marin v. Combs, </em>285 F.3d 899, 902 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">Standing under Article III of the Constitution requires an injury in fact. <em>See D\u2019Lil v. Best W. Encina Lodge &amp; Suites, </em>538 F.3d 1031, 1036 (9th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)). Section 17204 of California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law incorporates the federal injury in fact standard. <em>See </em>Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17204; <em>Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court, </em>51 Cal.4th 310, 120 Cal. Rptr.3d 741, 246 P.3d 877, 884-85 (Cal. 2011). To demonstrate an injury in fact, a plaintiff must show the \u201cinvasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>D\u2019Lil, </em>538 F.3d at 1036 (quoting <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">Here, the plaintiffs fail to show an injury in fact resulting from the alleged noncompliance of their bathtubs with federal safety regulations. Of the 1.5 million bathtubs manufactured and sold by Kinro during the class period, none was involved in a fire. Only named plaintiff Gonzalez incurred a cost to replace her bathtub. The remaining plaintiffs have introduced no evidence to support the conclusory allegation that their homes lost value due to this possible defect. Without such evidence, they fail to show an injury in fact. The district court did not err in dismissing their claim for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">The grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b801-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
