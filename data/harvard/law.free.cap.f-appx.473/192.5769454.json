Mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Disk Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>United States v. Moussaoui, </em>333 F.3d 509, 516-17 (4th Cir.2003). Mandamus relief is available only when there are no other means by which the relief sought could be granted, and should not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>Moussaoui, </em>333 F.3d at 517. The party seeking mandamus relief bears the heavy burden of showing he has no other adequate means to obtain the relief sought and that his entitlement to relief is clear and indisputable. <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-19\">Our review of the district court\u2019s docket reveals that Chase filed a motion identical to his current petition in the district court on January 25, 2012. The district court denied it on February 14. Because mandamus relief is not a substitute form of appellate relief, we deny Chase\u2019s petition. We likewise deny his pending motions to appoint counsel and to set a trial date. We dispense with oral argument because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
