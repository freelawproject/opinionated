We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we exercise plenary review over the district court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). For the reasons discussed below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In March 1998, the Abeds were convicted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia of, among other things, using a destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). That charge concerned the Abeds\u2019 use of a Molotov cocktail to commit arson. Amar and Obayda were sentenced to 570 and 497 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. The Abeds appealed, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed their criminal judgments. <em>See United States v. Abed, </em>203 F.3d 822 (4th Cir.2000) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Thereafter, in 2001, the Abeds filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Among their arguments was a claim that the District Court \u201cinvaded the province of the jury by instructing the jury that a Molotov Cocktail, \u2018a device consisting of a bottle, gasoline, and a rag,\u2019 <em>is </em>an incendiary destructive device,\u201d rather than submitting that issue to the jury. <em>Abed v. United States, </em>Civ. A. No. 01-0383, 2001 WL 1343394, at *1 (WD.Va. Oct. 19, 2001). The District Court held that the Abeds had defaulted the claim because they had raised it neither at trial nor on appeal, and had failed to show actual prejudice or actual innocence. <em>See id. </em>The Fourth Circuit refused to issue a certificate of appealability-</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">After filing several other motions not relevant here (all of which were denied), the Abeds filed a petition under \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In their \u00a7 2241 petition, the Abeds reiterated their claim that the question of whether a Molotov cocktail qualifies as a \u201cdestructive device\u201d under \u00a7 924(c) should have been submitted to the jury rather than resolved by the District Court. In support of this argument, the Abeds cited <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 2180, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010), where the Court held that, for purposes of \u00a7 924(c), whether the firearm at issue was a machine gun is an issue that must be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">The District Court, approving and adopting a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, concluded that the Abeds\u2019 petition was in essence a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and thus dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(h). The Abeds then filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s analysis. As we have recognized, \u201cunder the explicit terms of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, unless a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u2018inadequate or ineffective,\u2019 a habeas corpus petition under \u00a7 2241 cannot be entertained by the court.\u201d <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538 (quoting \u00a7 2255(e)); <em>see also Application of Galante, </em>437 F.2d 1164, 1165 (3d Cir.1971) (\u201cThis Court has time and again ruled that in a situation such as here presented habeas corpus relief is unavailable for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d). Thus, in cases like this one, prisoners may proceed under \u00a7 2241 only where \u201cthe remedy by [\u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>legality of [the] detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e). In <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir. 1997), we explained that \u00a7 2255 may be inadequate or ineffective where an intervening change in law has potentially made the conduct for which the petitioner was convicted non-criminal. <em>See id. </em>at 248 (permitting use of \u00a7 2241 in case of \u201cparty who claims that s/he is factually or legally innocent as a result of a previously unavailable statutory interpretation\u201d). However, the exception is narrow: a motion under \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective simply because a district court has denied relief or the petitioner is prevented by \u00a7 2255(h)\u2019s gatekeeping requirements from litigating his current claims. <em>See Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538 (\u201cIt is the inefficacy of the remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The Abeds argue that this exception applies to them because a change in law wrought by <em>O\u2019Brien </em>has rendered them actually innocent of the charge under \u00a7 924(c). We disagree, for two reasons. First, <em>O\u2019Brien </em>did not announce a new rule of law; rather, it recognized that the holding of <em>Castillo v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 120,123-24,120 S.Ct. 2090,147 L.Ed.2d 94 (2000)\u2014that the particular firearm type in \u00a7 924(c) is an element of the offense that must be found by the jury\u2014remained valid notwithstanding an intervening statutory amendment to \u00a7 924(c). The Abeds cited <em>Castillo </em>in support of this argument in their \u00a7 2255 motion. Thus, in this case, unlike <em>Dorsainvil, </em>the Abeds did previously have \u201can opportunity to challenge [the] conviction as inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 924(c)(1).\u201d 119 F.3d at 251. Further, \u00a7 2255 is not rendered inadequate or ineffective \u201cmerely because the sentencing court [did] not grant relief.\u201d <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Second, <em>O\u2019Brien </em>did not render the conduct for which the Abeds were convicted non-criminal. Rather, it merely emphasized that the identity of the weapon is a question for the jury, not the court. See <em>generally Logan v. United States, </em>434 F.3d 503, 509-10 (6th Cir.2006) (explaining that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), \u201cconcerning who must find a fact (not what fact must be found), in no way renders [defendant\u2019s] conduct legal. The substance of the law did not change; only the procedure changed.\u201d). The Abeds have not argued that a Molotov cocktail does not qualify as a \u201cdestructive device\u201d under \u00a7 924(c), <em>see generally United States v. York, </em>600 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir.2010) (\u201c[w]e hold that a Molotov cocktail falls within the definition of a destructive device\u201d); instead, they contend only that the jury should have been the one to find this fact. They thus cannot show that a change in law has \u201cnegate[d]\u201d the crime for which they were convicted. <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251; <em>see also Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117,120 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that the Abeds have failed to show that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, and that the District Court therefore properly dismissed their \u00a7 2241 petition. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
