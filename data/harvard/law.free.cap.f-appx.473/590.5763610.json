We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Hernandez-Gonzalez contends that the district court\u2019s failure to sentence him to a term comparable to the term that he would have received had he accepted the government\u2019s fast-track plea offer resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity that rendered his sentence unreasonable. Although he concedes that he waived his right to appeal, he contends that the appeal waiver is unenforceable, as the government impermissibly conditioned the award of a third point under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b) on his accession to the waiver. Hernandez-Gonzalez acknowledges that we held in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>581 F.3d 994 (9th Cir.2009), that the government may condition the award of a third point under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b) on the defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal, but he argues that <em>Johnson </em>was wrongly decided. We are bound by our precedent, <em>see United States v. Gonzalez-Zotelo, </em>556 F.3d 736, 740 (9th Cir.2009), and dismiss the appeal in light of the valid appeal waiver, <em>see United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179,1182 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b623-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
