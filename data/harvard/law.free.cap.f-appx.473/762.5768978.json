As amended, Gualberto Bahena-Carreno\u2019s petition for panel rehearing is denied. No further petitions for rehearing shall be entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-23\">Gualberto Bahena-Carreno appeals from the 36-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for attempted entry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-24\">Bahena-Carreno contends that the district court erred in denying a downward departure for cultural assimilation because the court misapplied the parameters for granting a departure and relied on clearly erroneous facts. The record reflects that Bahena-Carreno did not request a downward departure for cultural assimilation.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-25\">The record is clear that the court entertained Bahena-Carreno\u2019s arguments as part of its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, granted a downward variance based on the staleness of Bahena-Carreno\u2019s prior conviction, and explained why a further variance was not warranted. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>520 F.3d 984, 991-93 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Bahena-Carreno also contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. In light of the totality of the circumstances and the section 3553(a) sentencing factors, the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b794-26\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
