We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Robinson contends that the district court plainly erred by varying upward from the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range without providing him adequate notice under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) and <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 708, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008). This contention fails because the notice requirement of Rule 32(h) does not apply to variances, <em>see United States v. Cruz-Perez, </em>567 F.3d 1142, 1146 (9th Cir. 2009), and the record belies Robinson\u2019s contention that he did not have adequate notice of the facts on which the court based his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Robinson also contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to consider adequately his cognitive and emotional problems as mitigating factors. The record belies this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The record also belies Robinson\u2019s contention that the district court gave too much weight to his criminal history in imposing his sentence. The sentence imposed, though above the Guidelines range, is reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Robinson\u2019s unopposed request to file a late reply brief is granted. The reply brief is deemed filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b650-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
