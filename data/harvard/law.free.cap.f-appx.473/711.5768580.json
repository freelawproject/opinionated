We have jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Noli v. Comm\u2019r, </em>860 F.2d 1521, 1527 (9th Cir.1988), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The Tax Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Robertson\u2019s petition in light of his failure to respond to its order to show cause or to comply with prior court orders, especially where it had reinstated the action after a previous dismissal and had warned Robertson about the possibility of another dismissal if he failed to respond or comply with the applicable rules. <em>See Al-Torki v. Kaempen, </em>78 F.3d 1381,1384-85 (9th Cir.1996) (dismissal was not an abuse of discretion because willful failure to appear, prejudice to defendant, and interference with court\u2019s docket outweighed policy favoring resolution of litigation on the merits and imposition of less drastic sanctions); <em>see also </em>Tax Ct. R. 123(a) (dismissal permitted where party fails to proceed as required by court).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">We decline to address Robertson\u2019s arguments regarding the Tax Court\u2019s prejudgment determination that Robertson\u2019s petition was frivolous and dilatory. <em>See Al-Torki, </em>78 F.3d at 1386 (after dismissal for failure to prosecute, litigant forfeits right to appeal the merits of interlocutory orders prior to judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">Robertson\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b744-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
