We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-22\">Karapetian contends that the district court erred when it applied a four-level enhancement because the offense involved 50 or more victims. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(B). The district court did not err because both the financial institutions and the account holders were victims as defined by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 1 &amp; 4(E); <em>see also United States v. Pham, </em>545 F.3d 712, 717 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201c[I]t is not impermissible double counting to consider both [the banks and the individual account holders] as victims even if their losses are ultimately traceable to the same fraudulently obtained funds.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-23\">Karapetian also contends that the district court procedurally erred when it applied a four-level enhancement based on the amount of loss. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 3(F)(i). Karapetian specifically contends that the district court failed to address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the loss amount and treated the Guidelines as mandatory. The record reflects that the district court adequately addressed the parties\u2019 arguments, treated the Guidelines as advisory, and did not otherwise procedurally err. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-24\">Karapetian\u2019s \u201cmotion to request a calendar date\u201d is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b635-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
