Chen, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b779-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-24\">Petitioner Oliver Zosa Clavano appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his federal habeas petition, raising a claim that the state trial judge unconstitutionally coerced the jury\u2019s verdict. Reviewing de novo, <em>Lambert v. Blodgett, </em>393 F.3d 943, 964 (9th Cir.2004), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-25\">Under the deferential standard of review, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 785, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011), the district court properly denied habeas relief. The state appellate court correctly identified and applied the constitutional rule announced in <em>Lowenfield v. Phelps, </em>484 U.S. 231, 241, 108 S.Ct. 546, 98 L.Ed.2d 568 (1988). Because the rule is a general one, <em>Weaver v. Thompson, </em>197 F.3d 359, 366 (9th Cir.1999), the state court had \u201cmore leeway\u201d in its application, <em>Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004). Whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>we might have decided had the case arisen on direct review, we cannot conclude that the state court\u2019s application of <em>Lowenfield </em>here was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">When the trial judge inquired as to whether more time would assist the jury, at least two jurors gave equivocal answers. Additionally, as the trial court noted during its charge, the trial and deliberations had been \u201cchopped up,\u201d so it was unclear whether the jury had been given a full opportunity to resolve the case. The trial court never instructed the jurors to give up their firmly held views; the court simply asked the jury to \u201ctry\u201d for a \u201clittle while\u201d longer to reach a verdict. Moreover, defense counsel did not object to the trial court\u2019s comments and instructions to the jury. <em>See Lowenfield, </em>484 U.S. at 240, 108 S.Ct. 546 (noting that the failure of defense counsel to object \u201cindicates that the potential for coercion argued now was not apparent to one on the spot\u201d). Finally, as the state appellate court noted, the tentative vote was 8 to 4. Although other factors supported the opposite conclusion, the factors described above supported the state court\u2019s determination that the trial judge\u2019s charge did not violate the Constitution. <em>See Weaver, </em>197 F.3d at 366 (listing the relevant factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b779-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
