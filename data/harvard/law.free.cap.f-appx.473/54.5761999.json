A097 966 034/A070 902 978 (B.I.A. Apr. 26, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-16\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). <em>\u201cA </em>motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (2005); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7). Failure to offer such evidence is, therefore, a proper ground on which the BIA may deny a motion to reopen, as is the movant\u2019s failure to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for the underlying substantive relief sought. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-17\">In support of her claim that she established a <em>prima facie </em>case, Zhang argues that the BIA erred in declining to afford probative- weight to a village committee notice and affidavit from her mother allegedly showing that Chinese officials are aware of Zhang\u2019s Falun Gong practice. She avers that because she was found credible in her underlying proceedings, and because the village committee notice she submitted was not obtained in preparation for her proceedings but when Chinese officials came to her mother\u2019s house, her evidence should have been credited. These arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The BIA\u2019s rejection of the village committee notice was not in error because the notice was not authenticated \u201cin any manner.\u201d <em>See Shunfu, Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141,149-50 (2d Cir.2008). The BIA\u2019s decision had nothing to do with its finding that Zhang was credible, and finding Zhang credible but giving the notice limited probative value are not mutually exclusive, which makes Zhang\u2019s attempts to distinguish her case from <em>Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143 (2d Cir.2007) beside the point. Furthermore, Zhang\u2019s argument that the notice she submitted was unlike that found to be properly afforded minimal weight in <em>Matter of H-L-H &amp; Z-Y-Z-, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 209 (BIA 2010) is not persuasive because the evidentiary concerns associated with an unsigned and unauthenticated notice are not obviated by the notice\u2019s contemporaneity. <em>See Shunfu Li, </em>529 F.3d at 149-50; <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006). We afford considerable flexibility to the BIA to determine how unauthenticated documents can impact and alien\u2019s claim and find no abuse of the flexibility and discretion here. We also find Zhang\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision to afford her mother\u2019s affidavit minimal weight similarly unpersuasive. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99,104 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Moreover, none of the additional evidence Zhang submitted, including photographs of herself and her husband practicing Falun Gong and engaging in a Falun Gong demonstration, the 2007 Department of State profile on China, and various news reports of China\u2019s treatment of Falun Gong practitioners established the Chinese government\u2019s awareness of her practice of Falun Gong. <em>See Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 135, 143 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 162 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
