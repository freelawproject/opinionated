We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">Miranda-Oregel contends that the district court erred by not awarding him a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). The district court did not clearly err in finding that Miranda-Oregel had not accepted responsibility for his offense, because the record reflects that he did not demonstrate contrition and that his conduct manifesting acceptance of responsibility was untimely. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 1(H); <em>United States v. Nielsen, </em>371 F.3d 574, 582 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cTo receive the two-point downward adjustment, a defendant must at least show contrition or remorse.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-15\">We decline to consider on direct appeal Miranda-Oregel\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, because the record is insufficiently developed and his legal representation was not so inadequate that we can now conclude he obviously was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>See United States v. McKenna, </em>327 F.3d 830, 845 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally inappropriate on direct appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
