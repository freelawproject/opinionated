We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">He contends that he will be forcibly sterilized in China because he has two children. Even if He testified credibly and even if He filed a timely application for asylum, the record does not compel the conclusion that He demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1018 (concluding petitioner\u2019s fear was \u201ctoo speculative\u201d); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (\u201c[t]o reverse the BIA finding we must find that the evidence not only <em>supports </em>that conclusion, but <em>compels </em>it\u201d) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, He\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Because He failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182,1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b703-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
