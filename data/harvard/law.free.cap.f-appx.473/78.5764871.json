May 9, 2011), <em>rev\u2019g </em>No. A072 403 979 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 4, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-18\">Because the BIA rejected the decision of the IJ in its entirety, we have reviewed only the decision of the BIA. <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008). We review questions of law <em>de novo. Aliyev v. Mukasey, </em>549 F.3d 111, 115 (2d Cir.2008). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act, such as the application in this case, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on, <em>inter alia, </em>inaccuracies or falsehoods in an applicant\u2019s statements without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-19\">The BIA did not err in concluding that the IJ\u2019s factual findings that formed the basis for his positive credibility determination were clearly erroneous and the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See 8 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i); <em>see also Anderson v. City of Bessemer, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (\u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In this case, the BIA reasonably concluded that the IJ committed clear error in finding that the \u201crecord lack[ed] any evidence that [Singh\u2019s] ... asylum application was fraudulent,\u201d because there were striking similarities in the description of incidents of persecution between Singh\u2019s March 2002 asylum application, which was prepared by individuals who were subsequently convicted of conspiracy to submit false asylum applications, and an application filed in July 2001 by the same individuals. <em>See Anderson, </em>470 U.S. at 573,105 S.Ct. 1504. Moreover, the similarities supported the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Mei Chai Ye v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>489 F.3d 517, 524 (2d Cir.2007)(discussing similarities in the \u201cinter-proceeding\u201d context, i.e., where similar documents are produced by aliens in different removal proceedings and concluding that \u201cstriking similarities between affidavits are an indication that the statements are \u2018canned\u2019 \u201d and provide a basis for deeming an applicant\u2019s general credibility undermined) (citation omitted); <em>see also Borovikova v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>435 F.3d 151, 157-58 (2d Cir.2006) (concluding that the submission of a fraudulent document in support of an asylum application alone may constitute substantial evidence to support an adverse credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Furthermore, we find no merit to Singh\u2019s arguments that the agency violated the Federal Rules of Evidence and his due process rights by admitting into the record, and relying on, a Termination Notice prepared by an asylum officer who did not appear at his hearing and by allowing a government witness to testify without timely serving a proposed witness list. There is no merit to Singh\u2019s argument that the agency violated the Federal Rules of Evidence in his proceedings because \u201cthe Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in removal proceedings; rather, \u2018[e]vidence is admissible provided that it does not violate the alien\u2019s right to due process of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aslam v. Mukasey, </em>537 F.3d 110, 114 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Zhen Nan Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>459 F.3d 255, 268 (2d Cir.2006)). In the immigration context, \u201c[t]he standard for due process is [ ] satisfied ... if the evidence \u2018is probative and its use is fundamentally fair,\u2019 fairness in this context being \u2018closely related to the reliability and trustworthiness of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Zhen Nan Lin, </em>459 F.3d at 268); <em>see also Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir.2006) (providing that due process requires that an applicant receive a full and fair hearing that provides a meaningful opportunity to be heard). If an applicant shows that his hearing was not fair based on the submission of evidence, he also must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the error. <em>See Aslam, </em>537 F.3d at 115; <em>see also Garcia-Villeda v. Mukasey, </em>531 F.3d 141,149 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Here, the agency did not violate Singh\u2019s due process rights by admitting and relying on the Termination Notice because the document did not raise any relia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>bility concerns and Singh did not challenge the reliability of the notice before the IJ despite ample opportunity to do so. <em>See Felzcerek v. INS, </em>75 F.3d 112, 116 (2d Cir.1996) (recognizing that \u201crecords made by public officials in the ordinary course of their duties ... evidence strong indicia of reliability\u201d). Additionally, contrary to Singh\u2019s argument regarding a government witness\u2019s testimony, the government provided almost eight months\u2019 prior notice of its intent to produce a fact witness as to the criminal enterprise of the preparers of Singh\u2019s asylum application, and Singh was provided an opportunity to question the government witness regarding the reliability of his testimony. <em>See Li Hua Lin, </em>453 F.3d at 104-05; <em>Aslam, </em>537 F.3d at 115. Finally, Singh cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the admission of either the Termination Notice or the government witness\u2019s testimony because, even without that evidence, the striking similarities between his application and another prepared by the same persons alone demonstrated clear error in the IJ\u2019s decision and supported the conclusion that his asylum application was fraudulent. <em>See Mei Chai Ye, </em>489 F.3d at 526; <em>see also Aslam, </em>537 F.3d at 115; <em>Garcia-Villeda, </em>531 F.3d at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, petitioner\u2019s pending motions for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b111-15\"> Contrary to Singh's contention, the BIA did not find that he knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application, but concluded only that he was not credible due to his filing of a fraudulent asylum application. <em>See Yuanliang Liu v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>455 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>106, 112-15 (2d Cir.2006) (recognizing that a finding that an applicant knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application, which permanently forecloses the applicant from certain immigration benefits, \"does not flow automatically from an adverse credibility determination\") (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
