On appeal, McNeil\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether the district court erred in denying the motion to suppress the firearm found during a search of a vehicle in which McNeil was a passenger. McNeil was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he did not file one. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-21\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u201c[w]e review the district court\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo </em>and its factual determinations for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>592 F.3d 586, 589 (4th Cir.2010). When the district court has denied a suppression motion, \u201cwe construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-22\">Consistent with the Fourth Amendment, a police officer \u201cmay ... conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). While an officer generally must have probable cause to search a vehicle during an investigatory stop, the owner\u2019s consent to a search negates the probable cause requirement. <em>Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 250-51, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991). General consent to the search reasonably extends to \u201ccontainers within that car which might bear [contraband].\u201d Id. at 251, 111 S.Ct. 1801. Officers also \u201cmay inspect passengers\u2019 belongings found in the car that are capable of concealing the object of the search.\u201d <em>Wyoming v. Houghton, </em>526 U.S. 295, 307, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999). \u201c[A] passenger normally has no legitimate expectation of privacy in a car in which he asserts neither a property interest nor a possessory interest and where he disclaims any interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>seized object.\u201d <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 874 (4th Cir.1992); <em>see Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 148, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978) (holding that standing to challenge search to which vehicle owner has consented requires passenger to have \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy in the particular areas of the automobile searched\u201d). Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying McNeil\u2019s motion to suppress the firearm found during the owner-consented search of the vehicle in which he was a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform McNeil, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If McNeil requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on McNeil. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conclusions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
