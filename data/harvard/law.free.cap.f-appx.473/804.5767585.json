Defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona claiming federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381. They argued before the district court that federal question jurisdiction existed because as part of the state case, the credit union had disclosed a copy of the checking account contract which referred to the account being governed by United States laws and regulations and thus that the credit union had somehow \u201cenlarged upon the allegations\u201d in its complaint to include federal claims. Recognizing that the case was a \u201csimple claim for breach of a written contract\u201d which manifestly did not raise a federal question, the district court remanded the case. Two months later, the district court granted Desert Schools\u2019 motion for sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 based on the unreasonable removal and awarded sanctions against only defendants\u2019 counsel Sylvia Thomas in the amount of the attorney\u2019s fees incurred before the district court. Ms. Thomas appeals the district court\u2019s award of Rule 11 sanctions against her on the sole ground that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter such an award after the case had been remanded to state court. For the reasons below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">The Supreme Court has long held that a district court retains jurisdiction to impose Rule 11 sanctions even after a case has been dismissed. <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartman Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 394-98, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990). Further, this court has held that a district court retains jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) after a case has been remanded to state court, as \u201cit is clear that an award of attorney\u2019s fees is a collateral matter over which a court normally retains jurisdiction even after being divested of jurisdiction on the merits.\u201d <em>Moore v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc., </em>981 F.2d 443, 445 (9th Cir.1992). In both <em>Cooter &amp; Gell </em>and <em>Moore, </em>earlier actions had divested the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the cases. Thus, the district court had jurisdiction to impose Rule 11 sanctions in the amount of attorney\u2019s fees even after remanding the case to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b837-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and except as provided by 9th Cir.
