Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 992 (9th Cir. 2008), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Colop-Gomez\u2019s motion to reopen because it considered the record and acted within its broad discretion in determining the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (the BIA may deny a motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case for the underlying relief sought); <em>see also Toufighi, </em>538 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>F.3d at 996-97 (underlying adverse credibility determination rendered evidence of changed circumstances immaterial).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">We reject Colop-Gomez\u2019s contention that the BIA did not adequately examine her evidence because she has not overcome the presumption that the BIA reviewed the record. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review Colop-Gomez\u2019s challenge to the immigration judge\u2019s underlying adverse credibility determination because this petition for review is not timely as to the agency\u2019s order finding her not credible. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b660-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
