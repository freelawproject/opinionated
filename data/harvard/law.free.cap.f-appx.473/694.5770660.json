We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo legal determinations and for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-22\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because petitioners did not establish that the three incidents of harm they experienced constituted torture, <em>see Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1230 (9th Cir.2002) (harassment, interrogation, threats, and two hit-and-run incidents did not amount to torture), and they did not establish that it is more likely than not they would be tortured at the instigation of or with the acquiescence of the Philippine government, <em>see Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008). We reject petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA did not consider evidence of country conditions as they have not overcome the presumption that the BIA considered this evidence. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b726-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
