He appeals the district court\u2019s grant of judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment against his First Amendment retaliation and defamation claims. We review those rulings <em>de novo. Lyon v. Chase Bank USA, N.A., </em>656 F.3d 877, 883 (9th Cir. 2011) (judgment on the pleadings); <em>Anthoine v. N. Cent. Cntys. Consortium, </em>605 F.3d 740, 747 (9th Cir.2010) (summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-20\">In a First Amendment retaliation claim against a government employer, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing that his speech addressed a matter of public concern. <em>Eng v. Cooley, </em>552 F.3d 1062, 1070 (9th Cir.2009). Holbrook stated in his complaint that he informed the NDOC director about procedural violations by other officers \u201cin the context of seeking an accommodation for his [employment] predicament.\u201d \u201cLooking to the \u2018content, form, and context\u2019 \u201d of Holbrook\u2019s conversation with the director, we agree with the district court that the speech addressed a personal grievance and employment dispute, rather than a matter of public concern. <em>Brownfield v. City of Yakima, </em>612 F.3d 1140, 1149 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 147-48, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983)). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of judgment on the pleadings against Holbrook\u2019s First Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-21\">All of the allegedly defamatory statements that Holbrook challenges on appeal were made to other officers or investigators. The district court held that these statements fall within the common interest privilege. Holbrook does not challenge that holding on appeal. Instead, he argues that he has raised a triable issue that Defendants abused the privilege by making defamatory statements with actual malice. However, Holbrook\u2019s own deposition testimony about his actions during the riot does not suffice because the test for actual malice is subjective, relying on \u201cwhat the defendant believed and intended to convey.\u201d <em>Pegasus v. Reno Newspapers, Inc., </em>118 Nev. 706, 57 P.3d 82, 92 (2002) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>(internal quotation marks omitted). Nor has Holbrook demonstrated that Defendant Alois Hanke made inconsistent statements. As a result, Holbrook has not presented any evidence indicating that the Defendants knew their statements were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. <em>See id. </em>at 93. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against Holbrook\u2019s defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b618-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
