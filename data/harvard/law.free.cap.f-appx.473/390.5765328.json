The district court dismissed the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. Martinez contends the court erred because: his claim was properly brought under \u00a7 2241; he was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies; exclusion from the program violated his due-process rights; and, exclusion violated his equal-protection rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-21\">Martinez, a native of Mexico, was convicted of illegal reentry subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). He was sentenced to, <em>inter alia, </em>60 months of imprisonment. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a detainer against him under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5) based on its determination that he is subject to immediate removal from the United States upon his release from Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP) custody. While in prison, Martinez filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, asserting that the BOP improperly denied him certain benefits and opportunities made available under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3621 and 3624 on the basis that he is not a U.S. citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">This petition is foreclosed by our court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Ricardo Gallegos-Hernandez v. United States, </em>\u2014 F.3d -, 2012 WL 2914038 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
