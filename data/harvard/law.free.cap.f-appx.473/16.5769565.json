Roefaro appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of their Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss. <em>See Pearce v. Estate of Longo, </em>766 F.Supp.2d 367 (N.D.N.Y. 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The plaintiffs are representatives of the estate of Kristin Longo, who was murdered by her husband, Joseph Longo, a Utica, New York, police officer, who killed himself after the murder. LaBella was the chief of police in Utica at the time; Roefaro was the mayor. On appeal, La-Bella and Roefaro argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity from the plaintiffs\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 substantive due process claims, brought under the \u201cstate created danger\u201d theory. <em>See, e.g., Pena v. DePrisco, </em>432 F.3d 98, 107-12 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">\u201cWhen, as here, the district court resolves a qualified immunity issue on a motion to dismiss, we review the court\u2019s determination de novo, accept as true all the material allegations of the complaint, and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Recore, </em>317 F.3d 194,197 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">The district court concluded that the plaintiffs had sufficiently stated a \u201cstate created danger\u201d claim, <em>see Pearce, </em>766 F.Supp.2d at 375, and that neither LaBella nor Roefaro was entitled to qualified immunity. The court held that the \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint sufficiently alleges that [LaBella and Roefaro] implicitly communicated to Longo that his abusive and threatening behavior would go unpunished and unimpeded. This conduct created, or at the very least increased, the danger to Kristin and violated a constitutional right that was clearly established at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">The district court was correct with respect to LaBella but incorrect with respect to Roefaro.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">As to LaBella, the amended complaint alleged, inter alia, that (1) he was unqualified for the job of police chief and had obtained the position \u201cwrongfully and surreptitiously,\u201d <em>see </em>Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-13; (2) he and Joseph Longo \u201chad been close friends for several years\u201d prior to LaBel-la\u2019s appointment as chief \u201cand had been partners for many years\u201d in the Utica Police Department, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 14; (3) after word of Joseph Longo\u2019s domestic violence began to spread throughout the police department, another officer \u201curged\u201d LaBella \u201cto take action, including but not limited to confiscating\u201d Joseph Longo\u2019s weapons, but LaBella \u201cdenied these requests, and directly ordered\u201d that Officer Longo \u201cbe allowed to keep his weapons, and remain on duty without psychiatric and/or mental health intervention, notwithstanding the representations [by a Utica police official] to [Kristin Longo] that his weapons would be confiscated and that all measures would be taken to protect\u201d Kristin Longo \u201cand her children,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 26; (4) the Utica Police Department \u201chad a policy, custom and practice,\u201d either established or approved by LaBella, \u201cof turning a blind eye to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>incidents of police officers involved in domestic violence,\u201d \u201cdiscouraging] victims from reporting abusive behavior on the part of police officers,\u201d and telling \u201clie[s] to victims so as to protect officers,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47, 70; and (5) LaBella and the police department \u201cfailed to properly supervise\u201d or train officers, including \u201cin the legal limits regarding use of force,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">At least at the pleading stage, these allegations suffice to defeat LaBella\u2019s claim of qualified immunity. They sufficiently state a claim under the \u201cstate created danger\u201d doctrine because these facts, if true, would permit a jury to conclude that La-Bella \u201ceommunicate[d] to a private person\u201d\u2014Joseph Longo\u2014\u201cthat he or she will not be arrested, punished, or otherwise interfered with while engaging in misconduct that is likely to endanger the life, liberty or property of others.\u201d <em>See Pena, </em>482 F.3d at 111. As this conclusion is based on caselaw that was well established at the time of LaBella\u2019s actions in 2009, qualified immunity would not apply if the allegations are successfully proven. <em>See id. </em>at 110-12; <em>Okin v. Vill. of Cornwall-on-Hudson Police Dep\u2019t, </em>577 F.3d 415, 429-34 (2d Cir.2009). The district court was therefore correct to reject LaBella\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">However, the allegations against Roefaro as mayor are plainly insufficient to establish liability or defeat qualified immunity. As to Roefaro, the amended complaint alleged merely that (1) he appointed his friend LaBella as police chief, even though LaBella was not qualified for the job and other applicants had achieved equal or higher scores on the qualifying civil-service exam, Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-12; (2) Roefaro hired LaBella as police chief despite knowing that LaBella \u201clacked the requisite education, qualifications, and experience to serve competently\u201d as chief,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 13; (3) LaBella\u2019s appointment constituted a \u201cwrongful and illegal conspiracy\u201d between Roefaro, LaBella, and other unspecified members of the Utica city government, carried out \u201cwith reckless disregard,\u201d that \u201ccreated a danger to\u201d Kristin Longo because it made her \u201cvulnerable to the dangers posed by\u201d her husband, <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42, 44, 45; and (4) Kristin Longo\u2019s \u201cgreat pain and suffering,\u201d \u201capprehension of death,\u201d and death were all \u201cforeseeable consequences of the appointment of an unqualified individual to act as chief of police,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">These allegations do not allege a violation of any \u201cclearly established\u201d constitutional or statutory right. Plaintiffs do not allege that Roefaro knew or should have known about Joseph Longo\u2019s violent behavior, or knew or should have known that LaBella, as police chief, would ignore such behavior, or refused to take appropriate steps once he learned (if he ever did) of Joseph Longo\u2019s domestic violence or of LaBella\u2019s inaction. Rather, the only reasonably specific allegations against the mayor are that he knowingly hired an unqualified police chief, and that at some later point the unqualified chief failed to prevent a subordinate from murdering his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">These allegations do not come close to clearing the two hurdles required to overcome qualified immunity: establishing that (1) the mayor\u2019s \u201cconduct violated a constitutional right,\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001); and (2) that the right was \u201cclearly established\u201d\u2014that is, that it \u201cwould be clear to a reasonable [mayor] that his conduct\u201d in hiring an unqualified friend as police chief \u201cwas unlawful,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">As to the first prong of the test, the plaintiffs have not alleged that Roefaro \u201ccreated a serious danger by acting with deliberate indifference to it.\u201d <em>See Pena, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>432 F.3d at 114. Indeed, the complaint does not contain any non-conclusory allegations that the mayor knew or should have known of the danger that Joseph Longo posed to Kristin Longo, or knew or should have known that LaBella would be ill-equipped to supervise an officer like Joseph Longo. Instead, the complaint alleges merely that the mayor knew that LaBella \u201clacked the requisite education, qualifications, and experience to serve competently as Chief of Police for a paramilitary organization the size of the Utica Police Department.\u201d Am. Compl. \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Furthermore, even if the complaint <em>had </em>properly made out an allegation of a substantive due process violation, the mayor would nonetheless be entitled to qualified immunity under the second prong of the qualified immunity test, because the purported mayoral \u201cduty\u201d asserted by the plaintiffs\u2014a duty to prevent officers like Joseph Longo from committing domestic violence by assuring that the candidate most qualified to prevent such is hired as police chief\u2014cannot be said to have been a \u201cclearly established\u201d one. <em>See Anderson, </em>317 F.3d at 197. Elected executives on occasion appoint cronies of questionable qualification to important government positions, and such appointments have not been held to implicate the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Indeed, we know of no case, in our circuit or any other, that contemplates the existence of a duty like the one that the plaintiffs assert here. Such a duty certainly was not \u201cclearly established\u201d when Roefaro hired LaBella as police chief or when Joseph Longo killed his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In addition to the allegations listed above, the amended complaint contains several conclusory allegations against \u201cthe defendants\u201d collectively that do not distinguish between the individual defendants. For example, the plaintiffs allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">The defendants had a policy, custom and practice of turning a blind eye to incidents of police officers involved in domestic violence. Upon information and belief, supervisors often discouraged victims from reporting abusive behavior on the part of police officers and/or lied to victims so as to protect police officers.... This policy, custom and practice amounted to either express or implicit consent to police officers to continue to engage in domestic violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq\">Am. Compl. \u00b6 47. The qualified immunity doctrine certainly does not permit government officials to turn a blind eye to or encourage such conduct. <em>See, e.g., Okin, </em>577 F.3d at 434 (concluding that \u201cthe state-created danger theory, at the time of defendants\u2019 actions here, clearly established that police officers are prohibited from affirmatively contributing to the vulnerability of a known victim by engaging in conduct, whether explicit or implicit, that encourages <em>intentional </em>violence against the victim, and as that is the substantive due process violation alleged here, qualified immunity does not apply\u201d). But in the present case, the plaintiffs\u2019 broad and conclusory allegations against \u201cthe defendants\u201d as a group do not suffice to overcome Roefaro\u2019s individual qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Accordingly, Roefaro was entitled to qualified immunity, and the district court should have granted his Rule 12(b)(6) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED with respect to LaBella but REVERSED with respect to Roefaro. The case is remanded with directions to enter judgment for Roefaro.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
