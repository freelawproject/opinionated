Jones also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a Franks<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-19\">1. The district court did not err when it denied Jones\u2019s motions to suppress evidence seized from the first search of his car based on the determination that the search was justified by probable cause. <em>See United States v. Rodgers, </em>656 F.3d 1023, 1028 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cProbable cause exists when, under the totality of the circumstances, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-20\">2. Likewise, the district court did not err in concluding that the second search was justified for the same reason. <em>See United States v. Noster, </em>590 F.3d 624, 634 (9th Cir.2009), <em>as amended </em>(\u201c[T]he justification to conduct a warrantless search does not vanish once the car has been immobilized, and there is no requirement that the warrantless search of a vehicle occur contemporaneously with its lawful seizure ....\u201d) (citations, alteration, and internal quotation marks omitted). In any event, the second search was executed pursuant to a search warrant supported by an adequate and not misleading affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"AA9\">3. The district court also did not err in denying Jones\u2019s request for a <em>Franks </em>hearing based on its conclusion that no information was deliberately or recklessly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>omitted from the affidavit. <em>See United States v. Flyer, </em>683 F.3d 911, 916 (9th Cir.2011); <em>see also Ewing v. City of Stockton, </em>588 F.3d 1218, 1226 (9th Cir.2009). Because probable cause would still exist had the omitted information been included, \u201cno constitutional error has occurred.\u201d <em>Bravo v. City of Santa Maria, </em>665 F.3d 1076, 1084 (9th Cir.2011) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b793-22\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
