Haizlip\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>886 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that he has reviewed the record and has determined \u201cafter a thorough examination of the case and applicable case law that [Haizlip] has no meritorious grounds for appeal.\u201d Counsel nonetheless explains that Haizlip wishes to raise as an issue for this court\u2019s review, whether the district court considered the Fair Sentencing Act, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (\u201cFSA\u201d), when it imposed Haizlip\u2019s sentence. Haizlip has not filed a pro se supplemental brief, despite receiving notice of his right to do so, and the Government has declined to file a responsive brief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-25\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence for reasonableness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>using an abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The first step in this review requires the court to ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155,160-61 (4th Cir.2008). If, and only if, this court finds the sentence procedurally reasonable can the court consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Although Haizlip suggests that the district court erred in imposing his sentence because he asserts that the district court failed to sentence him under the FSA, this allegation is belied by the record. In fact, prior to imposing Haizlip\u2019s sentence, the district court heard argument from counsel regarding the FSA\u2019s applicability to Haizlip\u2019s sentence, and ultimately determined that the statute did apply, requiring the alteration of Haizlip\u2019s Guidelines range from sixty to sixty-three months to fifty-one to sixty-three months. We presume on appeal that Haizlip\u2019s sentence, which was near the bottom of his properly calculated Guidelines range, is reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Go, </em>517 F.3d 216, 218 (4th Cir.2008); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 346-56, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (permitting presumption of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">We have examined the entire record in accordance with our obligations under <em>Anders </em>and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Haizlip, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Haizlip requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Haizlip. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-18\">. Although Haizlip's plea agreement contained an appellate waiver, the Government elected not to file a responsive brief or a motion to dismiss the appeal based on the appellate waiver contained in Haizlip's plea agreement. Accordingly, we have conducted an <em>Anders </em>review in accordance with circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Poindexter, </em>492 F.3d 263, 271 (4th Cir.2007) (recognizing that the Government may file a responsive brief raising the appellate waiver issue or do nothing and allow this Court to perform the <em>Anders </em>review).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-18\">. By this disposition, we intimate no view as to whether Haizlip would be entitled to resentencing based on the recent Guidelines Amendments. However, this decision is rendered without prejudice to Haizlip\u2019s right to pursue relief, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2006), in the sentencing court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
