Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and of a motion to reconsider. <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002). We deny in part and dismiss in part the consolidated petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chirinkina\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely where the motion was filed nearly one-and-a-half years after the BIA\u2019s final order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Chirinkina failed to demonstrate materially changed circumstances in Uzbekistan to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limit, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 989-90 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 996 (9th Cir.2008) (requiring movant to produce material evidence that conditions in country of nationality had changed).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">In addition, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chirinkina\u2019s motion to reconsider, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1), or in construing the motion to reconsider as a motion to reopen and denying it as untimely and number barred, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>Toufighi, </em>538 F.3d at 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction over any challenge Chirinkina makes to the BIA\u2019s 2007 order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s decision finding her not credible, because Chirinkina failed to file a timely petition for review as to that order. <em>See Toufighi, </em>538 F.3d at 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">No. 08-75207: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-14\">No. 09-72551: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b689-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
