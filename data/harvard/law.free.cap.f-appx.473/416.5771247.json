The district court granted summary judgement in favor of Kimberly-Clark. On appeal, Segel contends that the district court misconstrued the facts and improperly applied the law. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Appellant Garry Segel began working for Kimberly-Clark in 1985 as a sales representative. Appellant Br. at 6. Se-gel\u2019s sales record was outstanding, and his annual performance reviews consistently indicated that he \u201cmeets performance expectations\u201d or \u201cexceeds performance expectations\u201d for his position. <em>See, e.g., </em>R.76-4, Excerpts from the Personnel File of Garry Segel.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">As early as 2000, however\u2014a year where Segel\u2019s overall performance rating \u201cexceed[ed] expectations\u201d\u2014Segel was encouraged to work on being more flexible. <em>Id. </em>at 223 (noting that Segel should \u201ccontinue to work on his flexibility with regards to changes which occur [ ]at Kimberly-Clark\u201d). As an example of \u201cobserved behavior\u201d relating to this job skill, Segel\u2019s reviewer noted: \u201cVery flexible in adapting to changes implemented by [customers]; [a]t times, less flexible/understanding of changes occurring in Kimberly-Clark.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222. Segel\u2019s 2002 evaluation again counseled him to be more flexible. <em>Id. </em>at 205. Segel\u2019s 2002 performance reviewer explained that Segel was \u201c[a] little negative with [Kimberly-Clark] changes, but always effectively moves forward and accomplishes what needs to be done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Segel was promoted to Customer Business Manager III (\u201cCBM III\u201d) in 2004. <em>Id. </em>328. Segel\u2019s 2004 reviewer gave him an overall rating of \u201cmeets expectations\u201d for his new position, but flexibility and interpersonal skills were rated as \u201cdoes not meet\u201d expectations. R. 74-6 at 3. The 2004 reviewer described \u201cadaptability/flexibility\u201d as Segel\u2019s \u201cbiggest skill opportunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The reviewer continued: \u201cHe becomes so focused on his objectives [that he] does not always address the other person[\u2019]s needs. His style needs to change when he receives push back.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">In 2005, Kimberly-Clark initiated a new performance appraisal system in which employees received feedback on their \u201cResults\u201d and their \u201cLeadership Qualities.\u201d Appellant Br. at 5. Although Segel\u2019s overall performance rating for his \u201cLeadership Qualities\u201d was \u201cEffective,\u201d many of the reviewer\u2019s comments suggested that Se-gel\u2019s interpersonal skills were lacking. R. 76-7, Segel 2005 Review. For example, the reviewer praised Segel as \u201cone of the best CBM\u2019s I work with,\u201d but also cautioned that \u201c[Segel] needs to keep an eye on his reactions during disagreements or conflict and try not to let others get under his skin. During customer presentations [Segel] has gotten confrontational with the customer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the reviewer noted that Segel \u201ctends to become involved in too many disagreements where he has little to gain. If [Segel] were more selective in choosing his battles he would have more success----In the future he needs to focus more on compromise and creating mutually beneficial agreements.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">In 2006, Segel\u2019s \u201cLeadership Qualities\u201d were rated as \u201cimprovement required.\u201d R. 76-9, Segel\u2019s 2006 Review, 141. Among other criticisms, the reviewer noted that Segel \u201ccan be inflexible when presented with new ideas and suggestions. He needs to listen to others, be more objective in sizing up situations, and be ready to adjust his approach when better ways of doing things come up.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the reviewer noted that Segel\u2019s \u201cinability to find positions that benefit both [the customer] and Kimberly Clark has hurt his relationship with [a] key customer.\u201d Segel was again urged \u201cto become less confrontational with the customer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">The \u201ckey customer\u201d referenced in Se-gel\u2019s personnel review was Meijer. As of November 2006, Segel\u2019s contact at Meijer was Fiona Hein, a Senior Buyer in the baby department at Meijer. Meijer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Segel\u2019s primary customer. Additionally, because Hein was the buyer for millions of dollars of products, R. 89 at 109, keeping Hein happy was of significant importance to Kimberly-Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">By Segel\u2019s own account, he did not enjoy a good relationship with Hein. For her part, Hein complained to Kimberly-Clark about Segel on multiple occasions. Hein found Segel \u201cdifficult to work with\u201d in a variety of contexts, and she registered her concerns with multiple layers of management at Kimberly-Clark. Ultimately, Hein informed Kimberly-Clark management that she would prefer to work with someone other than Segel.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">On April 10, 2007, Kimberly-Clark placed Segel on a 90-day \u201cPerformance Improvement Plan\u201d (\u201cPIP\u201d) to improve his leadership skills. The PIP cited a decline in Segel\u2019s leadership skills and a \u201cnegative and confrontational style which has an adverse effect on the [Kimberly-Clark] Team.\u201d R. 76-10, Performance Improvement Plan for Segel. The PIP also referenced comments from Segel\u2019s customers \u201cwho have expressed an unwillingness to have [Segel] contact them\u201d because \u201che is hard to work with.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notably, the PIP referenced Segel\u2019s problematic relationship with Hein, and attributed the following comments to her: \u201c[Segel] doesn\u2019t get it, I can\u2019t work with him, He can\u2019t figure it out, your competition figures it out, he asks too many questions and delays.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The PIP identified eight areas for Segel to improve, including the need for Segel \u201cto become more flexible in his dealings with the Customer and his Team.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the PIP warned that \u201c[fjailure to complete this Plan successfully and maintain acceptable performance may result in employment action up to and including termination of employment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Segel did not successfully complete his PIP because he continued to demonstrate inflexibility. R. 76, Ex. 16, Segel\u2019s Last Chance Agreement. Instead of being terminated, however, Kimberly-Clark and Segel agreed to a 30-day Last Chance Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) on July 10, 2007. <em>Id. </em>The Agreement allowed Segel 30 days to \u201cbecome more flexible in his dealings with the Customer and his Team.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Agreement concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">[Segel] is fully aware and agrees that continuation of employment is dependent upon successful completion of the above described plan and his continuing to sustain improvement if this plan is completed. [Segel] understands that if he does not meet this Action Item or later fails to sustain his performance, he will be terminated from employment with the Company. This Agreement does not alter the otherwise at-will relationship between ... Segel and Kimberly-Clark.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-10\"><em>Id. </em>Segel failed to satisfactorily complete the Agreement, and on or about August 13, 2007, Segel was terminated. R. 15, Defendant\u2019s Answer, at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">Segel filed a timely charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). R. Ill at 2. Segel also sued Kimberly-Clark for violating the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1) (2006), and Michigan\u2019s Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 37.2202 (Lexis-Nexis 2011). R. 11, Am. Compl. Segel alleged that, because he was 53 years old, Kimberly-Clark (i) unfairly evaluated his performance, (ii) placed him on a PIP, and (iii) terminated his employment. <em>Id. </em>In support of his claim, Segel argued that the existence of other age discrimination cases pending against Kimberly-Clark constituted relevant pattern-or-practice evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>At the close of discovery, Kimberly-Clark moved for summary judgment. The district court heard oral argument and requested supplemental briefs regarding Se-gel\u2019s argument that the existence of several other age discrimination cases pending against Kimberly-Clark was relevant pattern-or-practice evidence. The district court granted Kimberly-Clark\u2019s motion for summary judgment on August 31, 2010, 2010 WL 3488813. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">On appeal, Segel contends: (1) the district court erred in finding the only facts establishing Segel\u2019s age discrimination claim were those surrounding his replacement; (2) the district court erred in finding Segel\u2019s rebuttal of Kimberly-Clark\u2019s legitimate business reasons for his treatment and termination insufficient to establish pretext; (3) the district court erred in determining Segel failed to show circumstances tending to prove age discrimination was more likely than not the reason for his treatment and termination; and (4) the district court misconstrued Sixth Circuit law by holding Segel to an improperly high proof requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Geiger v. Tower Auto., </em>579 F.3d 614, 620 (6th Cir.2009). Summary judgment is proper when the moving party shows \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). A court must view the facts and construe inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Provenzano v. LCI Holdings, Inc., </em>663 F.3d 806, 811 (6th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">\n<em>Relevant Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (the \u201cADEA\u201d) makes it \u201cunlawful for an employer ... to discharge any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). Subject to exceptions not applicable here, ADEA protection applies to \u201cindividuals at least 40 years of age.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 631(a). \u201cAn employee may establish a claim under the ADEA by offering either direct or circumstantial evidence of age discrimination.\u201d <em>Wexler v. White\u2019s Fine Furniture, Inc., </em>317 F.3d 564, 570 (6th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Kline v. Tenn. Valley Auth., </em>128 F.3d 337, 348 (6th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\"><em>\u201cMcDonnell Douglas </em>and subsequent decisions have \u2018established an allocation of the burden of production and an order for the presentation of proof in ... discriminatory-treatment cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000)(omission in original)(quoting <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993)). The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework proceeds in three stages: First, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). If the plaintiff succeeds in establishing a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action. <em>Id. </em>Third, if the defendant satisfies its burden, the plaintiff is then \u201cafforded a fair opportunity to show that [defendant\u2019s] stated reason ... was in fact pretext.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">The parties agree for the purposes of this appeal that Segel established a prima facie case of age discrimination. Plaintiff-Appellant Br. at 29; Defendant-Appellee Br. at 25 n. 9. Kimberly-Clark addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the second <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>prong by explaining that it terminated Segel because \u201can important part of his position as a CBM was to develop and maintain strong relationships with Kimberly-Clark\u2019s customers,\u201d and Segel\u2019s \u201cconfrontational style adversely impacted his relationship with his customer.\u201d Defendant-Appellee Br. at 26. In response, Segel argues that Kimberly-Clark\u2019s stated reasons for his termination are pretext for age discrimination. Plaintiff-Appellant Br. at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Segel has not alleged any direct evidence of age discrimination. Accordingly, Segel must establish pretext through circumstantial evidence. <em>Geiger, </em>579 F.3d at 620. Circumstantial evidence \u201cis proof that does not on its face establish discriminatory animus, but does allow a factfinder to draw a reasonable inference that discrimination occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Segel has the burden of demonstrating that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of Kimberly-Clark\u2019s adverse action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">To establish pretext, Segel must prove that: (1) Kimberly-Clark\u2019s reasons for his termination had no basis in fact; (2) Kimberly-Clark\u2019s proffered reasons did not actually motivate Segel\u2019s discharge; or (3) Kimberly-Clark\u2019s reasons were insufficient to motivate Segel\u2019s discharge. <em>Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock, </em>29 F.3d 1078, 1084 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Segel\u2019s brief addresses the <em>Manzer </em>factors by arguing that \u201c[tjhere is a plethora of evidence which indicates that the proffered basis for Segel\u2019s termination is not based in fact, is not worthy of credence or was insufficient to justify termination.\u201d Plaintiff-Appellant Br. at 33. Rather than analyze each factor in turn, Segel offers a five-page long list of allegations and leaves it to this Court to sift through his laundry list and ascertain which fact is meant to apply to each factor. <em>See id. </em>at 33-38. Below, we identify the most salient points from both Segel\u2019s brief and the record that best support Segel\u2019s ADEA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\n<em>Factor One</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">First, Kimberly-Clark\u2019s reasons for Se-gel\u2019s termination are richly supported by the record. Segel\u2019s annual performance reviews persistently expressed concern regarding Segel\u2019s inflexibility toward his colleagues and his clients as early as 2000. When Segel\u2019s 2006 performance review indicated a heightened level of dissatisfaction with Segel\u2019s inflexibility, Kimberly-Clark provided Segel with both a 90-day PIP and a 30-day Last Chance Agreement to improve his behavior. Both documents highlighted Segel\u2019s inflexibility as the reason for Segel\u2019s probationary status with Kimberly-Clark and made clear that Se-gel\u2019s failure to improve would result in termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Segel does not dispute this record. Rather, he emphasizes his track record as an exemplary salesman. <em>See </em>Plaintiff-Appellant Br. at 33-38. This effort, however, does not undermine the well-supported factual basis that Kimberly-Clark provided as a foundation for Segel\u2019s termination. As such, Segel\u2019s efforts to establish the first <em>Manzer </em>prong are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">\n<em>Factor Two</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Second, Segel argues that Kimberly-Clark\u2019s proffered reason for termination\u2014 Segel\u2019s inflexibility\u2014did not actually prompt Kimberly-Clark\u2019s adverse employment action. In support of this point, Segel argues that \u201cflexibility\u201d is an entirely subjective criterion, and that \u201c[sjubjective assessments are easily susceptible to manipulation in order to mask the interviewer\u2019s true motivations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37. Se-gel cites two cases in support of this proposition: <em>White v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>533 F.3d 381 (6th Cir.2008), and <em>Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab, </em>554 U.S. 84, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>128 S.Ct. 2395, 171 L.Ed.2d 283 (2008). Neither case is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In <em>White, </em>an African-American employee appealed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of his prior employer. 533 F.3d at 384. The employee in this case had received stellar performance reviews and was interviewed for an internal promotion; ultimately, however, another candidate was selected for the job. <em>Id. </em>at 386-87. The employer explained that the other candidate was selected because the interviewers considered the employee \u201cextremely aggressive\u201d and \u201cconfrontational.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387. This Court reversed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUX\">any evaluation of [plaintiffs] interview performance is an inherently subjective determination, and thus easily susceptible to manipulation in order to mask the interviewer\u2019s true reasons for making the promotion decision. Indeed, since the very issue in dispute is whether the reasons given by these interviewers for their decision should be believed, it would be highly inappropriate for us to assume ... that their own subjective perceptions of [plaintiff] were accurate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArF\"><em>Id. </em>at 394. Accordingly, this Court found that a jury could reasonably disbelieve the employer\u2019s proffered explanation and that the employee\u2019s case was entitled to go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The facts in this case are distinguishable from <em>White. </em>The record in this case presents a longstanding concern with Segel\u2019s flexibility; whereas the adverse employment decision in <em>White </em>occurred in a vacuum of otherwise glowing reviews, Kimberly-Clark\u2019s decision to terminate Segel took place after years of documented concerns regarding his flexibility. Further, the plaintiff in <em>White </em>was interviewed by only four people on one occasion, whereas Segel was evaluated by a greater number of individuals on multiple occasions over the course of many years. So, even though a subjective term like \u201caggressive\u201d was not a sufficiently clear motivating factor in <em>White, </em>we find that a similarly subjective term\u2014\u201cinflexible\u201d\u2014is adequate where it was repeatedly utilized by varying people on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">This case is much more similar to <em>Chen v. Dow Chemical Company, </em>580 F.3d 394 (6th Cir.2009). In <em>Chen, </em>the employee \u201cstruggled to fit in socially,\u201d and \u201c[b]oth coworkers and customers found her combative----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397. After the employer documented these interpersonal problems in the employee\u2019s performance reviews, the employee was put on a PIP, and ultimately terminated. <em>Id. </em>at 398. The employee appealed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment by arguing that the employer\u2019s reason for termination was pretextual. <em>Id. </em>at 401. This Court rejected the employee\u2019s argument: \u201cWhen an employer reasonably and honestly relies on particularized facts in making an employment decision, it is entitled to summary judgment on pretext even if its conclusion is later shown to be mistaken, foolish, trivial, or baseless.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">Like in <em>Chen, </em>Segel\u2019s performance problems were documented in his reviews and his PIP. When Kimberly-Clark subsequently terminated Segel, its decision was based on documented \u201cparticularized facts\u201d that Segel consistently failed to be appropriately flexible with his customers and his colleagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Segel\u2019s reliance on <em>Meacham </em>is also unavailing. In <em>Meacham, </em>an employer laid off 31 employees as a result of an involuntary reduction in force. 554 U.S. at 87, 128 S.Ct. 2395. Thirty of these employees were at least 40 years old, and twenty-eight of them alleged a disparate-impact violation of the ADEA. <em>Id. </em>at 88, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>128 S.Ct. 2895. The employer explained that it selected employees for layoff based on their supervisors\u2019 evaluation of employees\u2019 performance, flexibility, and critical skills, thereby articulating a \u201creasonable factors other than age\u201d (\u201cRFOA\u201d) affirmative defense under \u00a7 628(f). <em>Id. </em>at 88, 128 S.Ct. 2395. In response, the employees \u201crelied on a statistical expert\u2019s testimony to the effect that results so skewed according to age could rarely occur by chance; and that the scores for \u2018flexibility\u2019 and \u2018criticality,\u2019 over which managers had the most discretionary judgment had the firmest statistical ties to the outcomes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88-89, 128 S.Ct. 2395. A jury found in favor of the plaintiffs, but the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the employee had not carried the burden of persuasion with regard to the reasonableness of the employer\u2019s non-age factors. Ultimately, the Supreme Court vacated and remanded, holding that an employer defending a disparate impact claim under the ADEA bears both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion for the RFOA affirmative defense under \u00a7 623(f). <em>Id. </em>at 102,128 S.Ct. 2395.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Like the plaintiffs in <em>Meacham, </em>Segel makes a statistical argument in support of his pretext argument, arguing that his case represents one of many similar cases against Kimberly-Clark. <em>See </em>Plaintiff-Appellant Br. at 42. This, however, is where the similarities between the two cases end. Segel was not laid off as a result of a reduction in force; he was laid off because of poor work performance. Additionally, whereas the <em>Meacham </em>case utilized a statistical expert to buttress their claims, Segel fails to marshal any meaningful statistical evidence. Kimberly-Clark makes the point well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">Segel\u2019s identification of 105 unadjudicated EEOC charges filed against Kimberly-Clark and its various subsidiaries throughout the United States over the past five years is meaningless. Indeed, Segel fails to set forth any comparative data (such as the total number of Kimberly-Clark employees, the number of employees under 40 who have been terminated, the number of Kimberly-Clark employees who are over 40 who have not filed charges, the entity which employed the charging party, <em>etc.) </em>from which the court could determine whether the 105 charges suggest anything, much less a pattern of age discrimination across the approximately 56,000 employee organization of a Fortune 150 company. In the absence of any context for these charges, the mere fact the charges themselves exist is not a \u2018statistic\u2019 and has no probative value with respect to the pretext inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Defendant-Appellee Br. at 41-42. Kimberly-Clark also correctly noted that \u201cSe-gel fails to advise the Court that the EEOC has not found reasonable cause to conclude that Kimberly-Clark violated the ADEA <em>in any </em>of the 105 charges identified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 16. As such, Segel\u2019s reliance on <em>Meacham </em>is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Segel also complains that his 2006 performance review was \u201cmanipulated\u201d and inaccurate. Plaintiff-Appellant Br. at 33. Toward that end, Segel appears to be arguing that discrimination can be inferred from (1) the fact that his supervisor \u201cmanipulated\u201d his rankings; (2) that \u201cHein had no complaints about Segel in 2006,\u201d and therefore his 2006 evaluation was inaccurate; and (3) that \u201cHein did not corroborate\u201d his supervisors\u2019 concerns. <em>Id. </em>at 33-38. In addition, Segel claims that \u201che was treated differently compared to his counter-part, Maneinelli, who was substantially younger than him, had fewer responsibilities, and had an overall lower score on the 2006 Performance Appraisal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Kimberly-Clark admits that Segel\u2019s supervisor \u201cincorrectly transcribed a numerical ranking,\u201d Defendant-Appellee Br. at 31. Nonetheless, as Kimberly-Clark points out, \u201cthe record is devoid of any evidence that the mistake was motivated by a discriminatory animus,\u201d and the numerical ranking had no bearing on the numerous critical comments regarding Se-gel\u2019s inflexibility. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32. In this context, even an \u201cundeniably suspicious\u201d alteration is \u201cultimately irrelevant.\u201d <em>Geiger, </em>579 F.3d at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Second, Segel complains that \u201cHein testified that she had no complaints about Segel in 2006.\u201d Plaintiff-Appellant Br. at 34. The record confirms that Hein, who had only worked with Segel for two months at that point, had not complained about Segel in 2006. R. 89 at 105. Because the Kimberly-Clark supervisor who completed Segel\u2019s review admits that he does not remember when he started receiving complaints from Hein, this does not raise a genuine dispute over a material fact. Segel maintains that this \u201ctemporal disconnect\u201d is evidence that Kimberly-Clark retroactively justified its actions and suggests that this provides circumstantial evidence of age discrimination. Plaintiff-Appellant Br. at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The record simply does not support this argument. First, given that Segel\u2019s 2006 evaluation did not take place until March 31, 2007, R. 76-9 at 141\u2014three full months into 2007\u2014it is possible that Hein\u2019s complaints from early 2007 seeped into Segel\u2019s 2006 performance review. Second, Hein is never mentioned in Segel\u2019s 2006 review\u2014 the review only references Segel\u2019s need to improve his relationship with Meijer, and Hein reported that her predecessor likewise experienced difficulty with Segel. Ultimately, however, Segel fails to make a cognizable allegation of circumstantial discrimination given that Hein\u2019s deposition thoroughly supports the conclusion that she experienced significant difficulties while working with Segel. As Hein\u2019s testimony makes clear, she found Segel \u201cdifficult to work with\u201d and requested the opportunity to work with someone else at Kimberly Clark. Accordingly, even assuming the 2006 evaluation prematurely referenced events from 2007, as Segel alleges, Hein\u2019s deposition thoroughly corroborates Kimberly-Clark\u2019s position that Se-gel\u2019s interpersonal difficulties with Hein animated Kimberly-Clark\u2019s decision to terminate Segel. Accordingly, Segel\u2019s arguments that \u201cHein did not corroborate\u201d his supervisor\u2019s criticisms, Plaintiff-Appellant Br. at 37, are likewise belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Finally, we consider Segel\u2019s assertion that Kimberly-Clark treated him differently from his younger colleague, Mancinelli. For Segel to use Mancinelli to establish pretext through <em>Manzer\u2019s </em>second option, Segel has the burden of establishing that Mancinelli is similar in \u201call of the relevant aspects.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co., </em>40 F.3d 796, 802 (6th Cir.1994). Among other things, Segel must prove that he and Mancinelli engaged in the same conduct which served as the basis for his termination, but that he was the only one who suffered an adverse employment action. <em>See Colvin v. Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., </em>390 Fed. Appx. 454 (6th Cir.2010) (\u201cThis Court has held that in the disciplinary context, to be found similarly situated, the plaintiff and his proposed comparator must have engaged in acts of comparable seriousness.\u201d) (internal alterations and citations omitted). In this case, then, Segel must establish that Mancinelli had the same interpersonal shortcomings that served as the basis for Segel\u2019s termination. Mancinelli\u2019s 2006 annual review makes clear that this is not the case. Accordingly, Segel fails to identify a comparator at Kimberly-Clark to</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>establish circumstantial evidence of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\n<em>Prong Three</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Segel also complains that Kimberly-Clark\u2019s stated reasons for Segel\u2019s termination were insufficient to motivate the adverse employment action. Plaintiff-Appellant Br. at 33-38. In support of this claim, Segel repeatedly references his excellent sales record. <em>Id. </em>As this Court made clear in <em>Chen, </em>580 F.3d at 401, an employee\u2019s interpersonal difficulties are sufficient grounds for an adverse employment action. <em>See also Viergutz v. Lucent Techs., Inc., </em>375 Fed.Appx. 482, 485 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Because Segel failed to satisfy any of the <em>Manzer </em>prongs, Segel did not establish that Kimberly-Clark\u2019s adverse employment action was pretextual. As such, Se-gel did not demonstrate that age was a \u201cbut-for\u201d cause for his termination. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
