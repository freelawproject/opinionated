R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Meien Li, a native and citizen of China, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Li does not challenge the agency\u2019s dis-positive determination that her asylum application was time-barred. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256,1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not supported by argument are deemed waived). Accordingly, her asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Li is unmarried and has no children. She fears she will be harmed in China if, at some point, she violates China\u2019s family planning practices. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Li\u2019s fear of future harm is speculative. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (possibility of future persecution too speculative).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-17\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Li\u2019s CAT claim because she failed to establish it is more likely than not she will be tortured if returned to India. <em>See Zheng v. Holder, </em>644 F.3d 829, 835 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW IS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b667-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
