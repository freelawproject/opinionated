The sole argument that Jones raises on appeal is that his sentence is both proeedurally and substantively unreasonable. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>thoroughly examining the record and the contentions of the parties, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Jones attacks the procedural aspect of his sentence on the ground that the district court failed to properly implement an incremental approach when determining the degree of its upward departure, as required by <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4)(B). As we have explained, however, \u201cSection 4A1.3\u2019s mandate to depart incrementally does not, of course, require a sentencing judge to move only one level, or to explain its rejection of each and every intervening level.\u201d <em>United States v. Dalton, 477 </em>F.3d 195, 199 (4th Cir.2007) (citations omitted). Nor must the district court \u201cgo through a ritualistic exercise in which it mechanically discusses each criminal history category [or offense level] it rejects en route to the category [or offense level] that it selects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Further, even assuming that the district court did fail to properly implement the required incremental analysis, any such procedural error is harmless where, as here, an \u201cupward variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justified] the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera-Santana, </em>668 F.3d 95, 104 (4th Cir.2012). <em>See also United States v. Grubbs, </em>585 F.3d 793, 804 (4th Cir.2009) (relying on district court\u2019s discussion of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to affirm a sentence as a reasonable variance); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 165 (4th Cir.2008) (affirming on the basis of the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors where the district court found that both the departure provisions and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported its chosen sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Our review of the court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to Jones\u2019 circumstances persuades us that the variant sentence imposed upon Jones was not unreasonable. <em>Grubbs, </em>585 F.3d at 804-05. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 (in reviewing a variance for reasonableness, an appellate court \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 474 (4th Cir.2007); <em>Evans, </em>526 F.3d at 160. Thus, at the bare minimum, any procedural error with respect to the district court\u2019s departure analysis is harmless. <em>Riverar-Santana, </em>668 F.3d at 104-05; <em>Evans, </em>526 F.3d at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Jones\u2019 assertions to the contrary notwithstanding, the sentence imposed upon him is also substantively reasonable, in light of \u201cthe totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Although Jones contends that the district court gave short shrift to the extent of his cooperation with the Government and overemphasized the seriousness of his criminal record, we decline to hold that the district court\u2019s assessment of these considerations rendered its ultimate sentencing decision substantively unreasonable. <em>See Evans, </em>526 F.3d at 160; <em>id. </em>at 163-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Because Jones has advanced no other reason why his sentence is either procedurally or substantively defective, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument will not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
