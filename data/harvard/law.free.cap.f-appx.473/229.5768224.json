On appeal, Lane asserts that the district court miscalculated his Sentencing Guidelines range. Specifically, he states that the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) erroneously applied <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2010). The Government concedes error on appeal. Accordingly, we vacate Lane\u2019s sentence and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The PSR applied USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 and assigned Lane a base offense level of 37, the base offense level for a career offender subject to a statutory maximum life sentence. However, the base offense level for a career offender subject to a statutory maximum sentence of twenty to less than twenty-five years <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> is only 32. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(3). Accordingly, Lane\u2019s advisory Guidelines range (of 240 months) was miscalculated, and taking into account the statutory maximum, the parties agree that his range should have instead been 210-240 months. Because the parties are in agreement that the error should be corrected, we vacate Lane\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">On remand, Lane should be appointed a different attorney from the one who represented him at his prior two sentencing hearings. In addition, his case should be reassigned to a different district court judge. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\"> At resentencing, it was undisputed that Lane\u2019s statutory maximum sentence was twenty years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
