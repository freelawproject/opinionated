Our jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo due process challenges, <em>Munoz v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 950, 955 (9th Cir.2003), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Sandoval failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relatives. <em>See Mendez-Castro v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 975, 978 (9th Cir.2009). Sandoval\u2019s contentions that the IJ violated his due process rights by discounting some of his evidence of hardship and by failing to consider the evidence in the aggregate are not supported by the record and do not amount to colorable constitutional claims. <em>See id. </em>(court lacks jurisdiction over abuse of discretion challenges cloaked as constitutional questions).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Sandoval\u2019s right to due process was not violated when the IJ permitted his former counsel to withdraw his application for asylum in favor of an application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Munoz, </em>339 F.3d at 955 (explaining that counsel\u2019s withdrawal of an application did not constitute a due process violation where applicant failed to demonstrate eligibility for form of relief). Sandoval\u2019s contention that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance by filing an asylum application in order to trigger the initiation of removal proceedings also fails. <em>See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Sandoval\u2019s remaining contentions are not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b751-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
