We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we repeat only those facts necessary to resolve the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">As a preliminary matter, we clarify that the settlement agreement between AZ Holding and Frederick does not impact our jurisdiction because the agreement was fairly circumscribed and limited to the calculation of payments owed under the district court\u2019s judgment and the offset of payments owed under a consulting agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s confirmation of an arbitral award. <em>Bosack v. Soward, </em>586 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir. 2009). \u201cWith respect to the underlying arbitration decision, however, our review is both limited and highly deferential.\u201d <em>Coutee v. Barington Capital Grp., L.P., </em>336 F.3d 1128, 1132 (9th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We may vacate an arbitration award only if the conduct of the arbitrator violated the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) or if the award itself is \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d or \u201cconstitutes manifest disregard of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have no authority to reweigh the evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">Contrary to AZ Holding\u2019s assertion, there is ho indication that the Arbitrator construed \u00a7 9.12(d) of the Asset Purchase Agreement (\u201cAPA\u201d) as a permissive, rather than mandatory, provision. The Arbitrator acknowledged that \u00a7 9.12(d) governed, but ultimately concluded that neither AZ Holding nor Frederick was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the section and, as such, were not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. \u201cPrevailing party\u201d is not a defined term in the APA and that determination was within the Arbitrator\u2019s authority. The Arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that AZ Holding prevailed with respect to some claims, but not others, did not foreclose the possibility that AZ Holding was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 9.12(d). <em>See Lagstein v. Certain Underwriters of Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>607 F.3d 634, 643 (9th Cir.2010) (noting that a reviewing court need only determine whether the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation was plausible).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">AZ Holding\u2019s claim that it is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 9.11 of the APA is equally unpersuasive. To the extent this argument relies on the meaning of \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the APA, it fails for the reasons stated above. In addition, the decision not to award fees under \u00a7 9.11 falls within the scope of the Final Arbitration Award\u2019s statement that \u201c[a]ll claims for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>relief, costs, expenses or damages not specifically addressed in this Award are denied.\u201d The Arbitrator\u2019s \u2022 decision drew its essence from the parties\u2019 agreement and was not completely irrational. <em>See Bosack, </em>586 F.3d at 1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\">Finally, the district court was not required to award attorney\u2019s fees under Arizona Revised Statute \u00a7 12-341.01. The language of the APA permitted the Arbitrator to make all determinations relating to court costs, arbitration expenses and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, including those incurred in the two years of litigation that preceded the arbitration. No separate determination by the district court was required. An award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 12-341.01 is discretionary. It was within the district court\u2019s discretion to determine that the case amounted to \u201ca draw\u201d and that AZ Holding was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Assoc. Indem. Corp. v. Warner, </em>143 Ariz. 567, 694 P.2d 1181, 1184 (1984) (holding that the phrase \u201cmay award\u201d in \u00a7 12-341.01 \u201cvest[s] discretion in the trial court to determine the circumstances appropriate for the award of fees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b809-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
