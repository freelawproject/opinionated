We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We review motions to suppress evidence from admission at trial <em>de novo, </em>and factual findings made at the suppression hearing for clear error. <em>United States v. Basher, </em>629 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir.2011). The government contends that Silva was properly subject to a search condition at the time of search, because the 2003 reinstatement of probation included the search term from the original 1997 probation order. Alternatively, the government contends that the good faith exception applies to the officers\u2019 conduct, such that the evidence should not be excluded even if obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">We do not address the parties\u2019 arguments whether Silva was properly subject to a search condition as a matter of California law, because we conclude that even if Silva was not subject to a search condition, the good faith exception applies and prevents suppression of the evidence found at Silva\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Whether the exclusionary rule applies here is a question of federal, not state, law. <em>United States v. Chavez-Vernaza, </em>844 F.2d 1368, 1374 (9th Cir.1987). The exclusionary rule\u2019s \u201csole purpose\u201d is \u201cto deter future Fourth Amendment violations.\u201d <em>Davis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2419, 2426, 180 L.Ed.2d 285 (2011). Inadvertent record-keeping errors do not permit application of the exclusionary rule where there was no \u201csystemic error or reckless disregard of constitutional requirements.\u201d <em>Herring v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 135, 147-48, 129 S.Ct. 695, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009). Good-faith reliance on appellate court precedent that is later overruled also does not allow for exclusion. <em>Davis, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2429. The Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Herring </em>and <em>Davis </em>compel our conclusion here that the police conduct at issue does not warrant exclusion. The police officers searched Silva\u2019s residence only after being told by a probation officer that Silva was indeed subject to a warrantless search condition. There is no evidence that the officers acted recklessly or that any possible error was systematic in any way. California law as to whether Silva was in fact subject to the condition is far from clear, and exclusion under these circumstances would provide little deterrent effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
