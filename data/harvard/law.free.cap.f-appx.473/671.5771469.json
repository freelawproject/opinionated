We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 986 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Singh fears harm in India based on a family dispute related to an arranged marriage and subsequent divorce proceedings. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Singh failed to establish that it is more likely than not he will be tortured upon return to India. <em>See Soriano v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 1162, 1167 (9th Cir.2009). Accordingly, Singh\u2019s CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In addition, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s untimely motion to reopen because it considered the evidence and acted within its broad discretion in determining that Singh did not establish <em>prima fade </em>eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 595 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b704-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
