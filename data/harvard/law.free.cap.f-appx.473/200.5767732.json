We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-24\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-25\">The district court\u2019s order denying Tad-lock\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion was entered on the docket on October 12, 2011. Tadlock\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability, which was construed as his notice of appeal, was filed on December 23, 2011.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Because Tadlock failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b232-16\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the motion is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court.
