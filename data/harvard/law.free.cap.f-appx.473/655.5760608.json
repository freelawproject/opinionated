R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b688-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Feng Zhao, a native and citizen of China, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), a waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(1) (\u201csection 212(i) waiver\u201d), and adjustment of status. Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s findings of fact, including adverse credibility determinations. <em>Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2011). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination on the basis of the omission from Zhao\u2019s asylum application and testimony to an asylum officer that four police officers held him down and forcibly removed his Falun Gong tattoo while he was in custody. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cMaterial alterations in the applicant\u2019s account of persecution are sufficient to support an adverse credibility finding.\u201d). The agency reasonably rejected Zhao\u2019s explanation for the omission. <em>See Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir. 2007). In the absence of credible testimony, Zhao\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153,1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Because Zhao\u2019s CAT claim is made on the basis of the same testimony the agency found not credible, and Zhao does not point to any other evidence that would compel a finding that it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to China, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s denial of Zhao\u2019s section 212(i) waiver. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(i)(2); <em>Corona-Mendez v. Holder, </em>593 F.3d 1143, 1146 (9th Cir. 2010). Further, we lack jurisdiction to consider Zhao\u2019s unexhausted contention that it was not necessary for him to seek a section 212(i) waiver. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
