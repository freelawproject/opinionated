We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 992 (9th Cir.2008), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s second motion to reopen as time-barred and number-barred where the successive motion was filed over four years after the BIA\u2019s final decision, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Singh failed to present sufficient evidence of changed circumstances in India to qualify for an exception to the time and number limits, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">We reject Singh\u2019s contention that the BIA did not adequately examine his evidence because he has not overcome the presumption that the BIA reviewed the record. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006).
