We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-25\">Shepard asserts that the district court erred when it determined that his petition was barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). He agrees that absent equitable tolling the time to file his petition expired on March 23, 2007, and he did not file the operative petition (actually his first amended petition) until January 16, 2008. Nevertheless, he claims that equitable tolling applies here. The district court disagreed, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-26\">Certainly, a state prisoner is entitled to equitable tolling when he was diligently pursuing his rights, but some extraordinary circumstance prevented his timely filing. <em>See Holland v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2562, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010); <em>Spitsyn v. Moore, </em>345 F.3d 796, 799 (9th Cir.2003). Shepard asserts that he proceeded reasonably diligently, and that his attorney abandoned him. Were that so, he might have established his claims. <em>See Holland, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 130 S.Ct. at 2565; <em>Doe v. Busby, </em>661 F.3d 1001, 1015 (9th Cir.2011). We have reviewed the record and are unable to say that the district court clearly erred in determining that the asthenic evidence in the record did not suffice to show abandonment or diligence. <em>See Spitsyn, </em>345 F.3d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Then, argues Shepard, he should have been accorded an evidentiary hearing so that he could further develop his claims. But the district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to order an evidentiary hearing in this case. <em>See Roy v. Lampert, </em>465 F.3d 964, 968 (9th Cir. 2006). In fact, the district court gave him an opportunity to file further declarations to support his position; he did so, but did not effectively buttress it. The record was sufficiently developed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to show that Shepard\u2019s attorney had not actually abandoned him,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was also sufficient to show that Shepard had not used reasonable diligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the district court did not err. Because of that, there is no need to consider Shepard\u2019s claims regarding relation back of his second amended petition and exhaustion of state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b843-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
