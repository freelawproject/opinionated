On appeal, Rico\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he concludes that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questions the substantive reasonableness of Rico\u2019s sentence. Rico was informed of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, but has not done so. The Government elected not to file a brief and does not seek to enforce the plea agreement\u2019s appeal waiver.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">When reviewing a sentence for substantive reasonableness, we take into account \u201cthe totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We accord a sentence within a properly-calculated Sentencing Guidelines range an appellate presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Abu Ali, </em>528 F.3d 210, 261 (4th Cir.2008). Such a presumption is rebutted only by showing \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the [18 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2011) ] factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">In this case, the district court calculated a Guidelines range of 100 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment. Both parties advocated for a downward variance, primarily based on Rico\u2019s cooperation with the authorities; however, the parties disagreed as to the extent that was warranted. The district court ultimately granted a downward variance and imposed a seventy-five-month sentence, a sentence greater than that requested by Rico, but less than that requested by the Government. The district court noted Rico\u2019s extensive efforts to cooperate and the safety risks he undertook in doing so. However, the court was also concerned with the likelihood of recidivism. We conclude that the district court properly analyzed the arguments presented by Rico and appropriately imposed a downward variance after having considered the mitigating circumstances raised by Rico. Taking into account the totality of the circumstances and the district court\u2019s explicit consideration of Rico\u2019s arguments, we can find no abuse of discretion, and so, we conclude that Rico\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we reviewed the entire record in this case and found no meritorious claims. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Rico, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Rico requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Rico. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-11\"> Because the Government fails to assert the waiver as a bar to the appeal, we may consider the issues raised by counsel and conduct an independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Anders. United States v. Poindexter, </em>492 F.3d 263, 271 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
