Moreover, the state court was not obliged to explain the reasons for its rejection of Ryel\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, and therefore we do not review de novo the question whether any error on the part of trial counsel prejudiced Ryel. <em>See Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 784-85, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-25\">Under the AEDPA standard, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), the state court\u2019s determination that Ryel\u2019s counsel made \u201ccompelling arguments\u201d for the admission of the excluded evidence and therefore did not perform deficiently under the first prong of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), was not objectively unreasonable. Nor would it have been objectively unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>sonable for the state court to conclude that Ryel was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s performance, where the excluded evidence was circumstantial and the record included substantial direct and circumstantial evidence pointing to Ryel\u2019s guilt. <em>See Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b611-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b612-8\">TASHIMA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A1b\">concurring in the result:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
