He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Based on our review of the record, we deny Cadet\u2019s petition for writ of mandamus without prejudice. Although Cadet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>has not properly styled his pro se motion, a fair reading of his filing indicates that he is seeking the type of relief spelled out in Fed.R.Civ.P. 60. We therefore direct the district court to treat Cadet\u2019s \u201cResponse to the Memorandum Order\u201d as a motion to reconsider or a motion under Rule 60 for relief from the court\u2019s dismissal and to dispose of the matter accordingly. Should the district court fail to dispose of the motion in a timely fashion, Cadet may renew his petition for writ of mandamus in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Accordingly, although we grant Cadet leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny his petition for writ of mandamus without prejudice. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
