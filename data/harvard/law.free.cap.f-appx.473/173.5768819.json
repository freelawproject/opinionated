We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-29\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we will but briefly recite the facts of this case. Montgomery was indicted on a drug-conspiracy charge stemming from his role in the notorious Carter Organization; specifically, he was charged with conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of powder cocaine and more than fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>846. </em>Following a <em>jury </em>trial, Montgomery was convicted of the offense. The pre-sentence report (PSR) prepared by the probation office determined that Montgomery was \u201caccountable for greater than 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d); and greater than 150 kilograms of powder cocaine (which combine to equate to a minimum of 60,000 kilograms of marijuana) in furtherance of the criminal activity.\u201d PSR \u00b6 63. Applying the November 2003 Sentencing Guidelines, the PSR set Montgomery\u2019s base offense level at 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2003). Following a Booker<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> remand, Montgomery was resentenced in 2006 to a term of 280 months of incarceration. We affirmed his sentence on direct appeal. <em>See generally United States v. Montgomery, </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. -, 2007 WL 3122255 (3d Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Since that time, both the statutory terms and Guidelines ranges attached to crack offenses have been lowered, and Montgomery has endeavored to avail himself of the changes. In the appeal from one of Montgomery\u2019s previous, unsuccessful attempts to seek relief via \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we explained to him why he might encounter difficulty premising his motion on the changed crack sentencing ranges: \u201c[t]he more than 150 kilograms of powder cocaine for which he was responsible supports his base offense level, wholly apart from any changes to the Crack Cocaine Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>398 Fed.Appx. 843, 845 (3d Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">Montgomery filed this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion pursuant to Guidelines Amendment 750,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arguing that he was eligible for a reduction in his sentence due to the further lowering of the crack Guidelines. The District Court denied relief, reemphasizing that Montgomery\u2019s powder cocaine range had not changed. Montgomery appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. While the ultimate decision to reduce a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is committed to the discretion of the District Court, we exercise plenary review over the Court\u2019s legal analysis. <em>United States v. Styer, </em>573 F.3d 151, 153 (3d Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Doe, </em>564 F.3d 305, 307 n. 2 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">The District Court rightly concluded that Montgomery was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which allows for a sentence reduction based on \u201ca sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d The sentencing range for powder cocaine was left unaltered by the modifications to the crack Guidelines. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2011), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2003). Thus, our observation from Montgomery\u2019s prior appeal retains its full force: the cocaine exposure alone would suffice to place Montgomery at a base offense level of 38. Recognizing this impediment, Montgomery argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the amount of crack and powder cocaine with which he was associated in the PSR represented \u201cextrapolated drug amounts\u201d; and, thus, he maintains that the lowering of the Guidelines range attached to 1.5 kilograms of crack <em>(compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3) (2011), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2003)) could conceivably lead to an independent reevaluation of his sentence. But \u00a7 3582 authorizes \u201conly a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence and <em>not </em>a plenary resentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (emphasis added). The District Court is not authorized, via \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to conduct the inquiry Montgomery seeks in the absence of a lowered Guidelines range, and here there is no question that the applicable range was not lowered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, relief was properly denied. Because we find the language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sufficient to so conclude, we need not address Montgomery\u2019s claim that portions of the Guidelines are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\">. <em>United.

The Act reduced the statutory penalties for cocaine base (\u2018crack cocaine\u2019) offenses, eliminated the statutory mandatory minimum sentence for simple possession of crack cocaine, and contained directives to the Commission to review and amend the guidelines to account for specified aggravating and mitigating circumstances in certain drug cases.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C Vol. 3, at 392 (2011), <em>available at </em>http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines/2011Guidelines/Manual-PDF/Appendix-C-Vol-III. pdf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b207-8\">. Moreover, Montgomery\u2019s bifurcation of his sentence into \"crack\u201d and \"powder\u201d components is undermined by the fact that he was convicted on a single count of conspiracy to distribute both drugs. <em>See Montgomery, </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. at -, 2007 WL 3122255, at *1. We find no record support for Montgomery\u2019s contention that he was sentenced \"only\u201d for the crack portion of the conspiracy. <em>See, e.g., </em>Apr. 30, 2004 Tr. 46:19-22 (adopting the PSR, as amended, as the findings of the District Court during sentencing).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
