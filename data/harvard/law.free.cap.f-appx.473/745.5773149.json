We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Doe 1 v. Abbott Labs., </em>571 F.3d 930, 933 (9th Cir.2009), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-21\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Endsley\u2019s inadequate mental health treatment claim arising from the revocation of some of his privileges because he failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether this decision by his treatment team was \u201ca substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards.\u201d <em>Youngberg v. Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 323, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982) (decisions by mental healthcare professionals are \u201cpresumptively valid\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-22\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Endsley\u2019s excessive force claim because he failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the force used was reasonable under the circumstances and did not amount to punishment. <em>See Hydrick v. Hunter, </em>500 F.3d 978, 997 (9th Cir.2007) (Fourteenth Amendment applies to excessive force claims by civilly committed individuals, which requires that they not be subjected to conditions that amount to punishment, within the bounds of professional discretion), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2431,174 L.Ed.2d 226 (2009); <em>see also Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 395 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (Fourteenth Amendment protects a pretrial detainee from excessive force amounting to punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-25\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Endsley\u2019s conditions of confinement claim because he failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether conditions in the common room, where those patients who chose not to participate in treatment sessions were temporarily held, amounted to punishment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number><em>See Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 537, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (some losses of freedom of movement and choice are inherent discomforts of confinement, and not every disability imposed during detention \u201camounts to \u2018punishment\u2019 in the constitutional sense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Endsley\u2019s remaining contentions, including those regarding his state law tort claims, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">We do not consider matters not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the opening brief. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b777-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
