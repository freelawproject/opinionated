We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Cholla Ready Mix, Inc. v. Civish, </em>382 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>The district court properly dismissed Counts I through III, and the part of Count IV that was premised on pre-judgment conduct, as time-barred because Dominguez filed this action more than six years after she knew or should have known of defendants\u2019 purported negligence. <em>See Blair v. Ing, </em>95 Hawai\u2019i 247, 21 P.3d 452, 469 &amp; n. 12, 472 (2001) (under Hawaii law, a six-year statute of limitations applies to legal malpractice claims, and the statute begins to run when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the defendant\u2019s negligence); <em>see also Carvalho v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>794 F.2d 454, 456 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201cA cause of action accrues under Hawaii law when the plaintiff knows, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should know, of his injury, the defendant\u2019s negligence (or violation of a duty), and the causal connection between the two.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The district court properly dismissed the remainder of Count IV because Dominguez failed to allege sufficient facts to show that defendants\u2019 post-judgment conduct amounted to legal malpractice. <em>See Thomas v. Kidani, </em>126 Hawai\u2019i 125, 267 P.3d 1230, 1234 (2011) (setting forth the elements of a legal malpractice claim under Hawaii law and discussing causation).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to apply the law of the case doctrine to the motion to dismiss because the issues in question were not decided explicitly or by necessary implication in the order granting Dominguez leave to file the first amended complaint. <em>See United States v. Lummi Indian Tribe, </em>235 F.3d 443, 452-53 (9th Cir.2000) (setting forth the standard of review and discussing the law of the case doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Dominguez\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">We do not consider matters not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the opening brief. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b709-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
