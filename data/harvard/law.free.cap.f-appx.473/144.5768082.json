For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to the extent that it dismissed Ufele\u2019s challenge to his removal proceedings. We will dismiss the remainder of the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">Ufele is a Nigerian citizen who in 2004 was convicted of conspiracy/theft by deception in the New Jersey Superior Court. In October 2009, Ufele was convicted of two counts of bank fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Meanwhile, in October 2008, immigration officials charged him with inadmissibility/removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C)(i), based on the 2004 state conviction. On October 22, 2008, an administrative arrest warrant was issued, and a detainer was placed on Ufele while he was in the Hudson County Jail. On that date, a \u201cnotice of custody determination\u201d was issued, stating that Ufele would be detained in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security until a final determination in his removal proceedings. Then, upon Ufele\u2019s federal conviction, immigration officials issued another detainer and began formal removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">In July 2010, Ufele filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. He asserted that his immigration detention violated his due process rights and that the removal proceedings violated an agreement that he made with the federal prosecutor during his federal criminal proceedings. While his \u00a7 2241 petition was pending, an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Ufele\u2019s request for a change in custody status, noting that he was in \u201cmandatory custody.\u201d On February 3, 2011, the District Court denied Ufele\u2019s petition. Ufele timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-16\">Meanwhile, on May 9, 2011, an IJ ordered Ufele removed and on September 16, 2011, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissed Ufele\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s order and issued a final order of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government notified us that upon the issuance of a final order of removal, the authority for Ufele\u2019s detention switched from 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226 to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. We asked the parties to address whether this development made moot Ufele\u2019s challenge to his 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226 detention. The Government responded by arguing that the appeal was moot. Ufele\u2019s response asserted that the length of his detention remains a viable issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review de novo the District Court\u2019s decision as to Ufele\u2019s habeas corpus petition. <em>See United States v. Cleary, </em>46 F.3d 307, 309-10 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We first consider whether Ufele\u2019s challenge to the propriety of his 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226 detention is moot. Federal courts have habeas jurisdiction to examine the statutory and constitutional bases for an immigration detention unrelated to a final order of removal. <em>Demore v. Kim, </em>538 U.S. 510, 517-18, 123 S.Ct. 1708, 155 L.Ed.2d 724 (2003). Ufele\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition alleged that his two-year mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c) violated his constitutional rights. The District Court denied his petition and Ufele timely appealed. However, while Ufele\u2019s appeal was pending, the BIA issued a final order of removal. When Ufele\u2019s time to file a petition for review expired, the BIA\u2019s order became administratively final and Ufele\u2019s detention switched from \u00a7 1226 to \u00a7 1231. <em>See Casas-Castrillon v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>535 F.3d 942, 947 (9th Cir.2008); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Accordingly, insofar as Ufele challenges the lawfulness of his detention pursuant to \u00a7 1226(c), and he is no longer in custody pursuant to this statute, his appeal is moot and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Article III of the Constitution states that \u201cfederal courts may adjudicate only actual, ongoing cases or controversies.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990). Here, the injury alleged is an unreasonably long pre-final order of removal detention under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226. Because this injury can no longer be redressed by a favorable judicial decision, this issue is moot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Isidor Paiewonsky Assocs., Inc. v. Sharp Properties, Inc., </em>998 F.2d 145, 151 (3d Cir.1993) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Additionally, we agree with the District Court to the extent that it dismissed Ufele\u2019s challenges to his removal proceedings for lack of jurisdiction, as the REAL ID Act \u201celiminate[d] the district courts\u2019 habeas corpus jurisdiction ... over final orders of removal in nearly all cases.\u201d <em>Francois v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 645, 647 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Thus, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to the limited extent that it dismissed Ufele\u2019s challenge to his removal proceedings. We will dismiss the remainder of the appeal as moot. Ufele\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-13\">. Our records do not indicate that Ufele has sought review of the BIA\u2019s order of removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\">. We note that Ufele's situation is distinguishable from that of the petitioner in <em>Diop v. ICE/Homeland Sec., </em>656 F.3d 221 (3d Cir. 2011). In <em>Diop, </em>we held that a challenge to an 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c) detention was not moot even though the petitioner had been released from custody after determining that the challenge fell within the \"special mootness exception for cases that are capable of repetition while evading review.\u201d 656 F.3d at 227 (internal citation and quotation omitted). However, unlike Ufele, Diop was not subject to a final order of removal and had been released from detention after his criminal conviction was vacated. We thus explained that Diop\u2019s claim was capable of repetition because the Government could once again detain him under \u00a7 1226(c) if the vacatur of his conviction was overturned on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 228.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
