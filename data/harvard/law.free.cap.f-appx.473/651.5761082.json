We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Shakur v. Schriro, </em>514 F.3d 878, 883 (9th Cir.2008), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-25\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Florer\u2019s First Amendment free exercise and Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\u201cRLUIPA\u201d) claims because he failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact that the defendants\u2019 provision of meals had substantially burdened his ability to exercise his religion. <em>See Warsoldier v. Woodford, </em>418 F.3d 989, 994 (9th Cir.2005) (under RLUIPA, prisoner has the initial burden to demonstrate a prima facie claim that prison policies constitute a substantial burden on the exercise of his religious beliefs); <em>Freeman v. Arpaio, </em>125 F.3d 732, 736 (9th Cir.1997) (plaintiff must show that defendants burdened the practice of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>religion), <em>abrogated on other grounds as recognized in Shakur, </em>514 F.3d at 884-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Florer\u2019s retaliation claim because he failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to retaliatory animus. <em>See Brodheim v. Cry, </em>584 F.3d 1262, 1271 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201cTo show the presence of this element on a motion for summary judgment, [the plaintiff] need only put forth evidence of retaliatory motive, that, taken in the light most favorable to him, presents a genuine issue of material fact as to [defendant\u2019s] intent .... \u201d (internal citation and quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Florer\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because Florer failed to demonstrate a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether defendants deprived him of the \u201cminimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities,\u201d or acted with deliberate indifference towards his health or safety. <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1132-33 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc); <em>LeMaire v. Maass, </em>12 F.3d 1444, 1456 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cThe Eighth Amendment requires only that prisoners receive food that is adequate to maintain health.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Florer\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b683-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
