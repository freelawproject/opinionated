Reviewing de novo, <em>see Mendoza v. Carey, </em>449 F.3d 1065, 1068 (9th Cir.2006), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">The parties agree that AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations began to run on July 13, 2006, when Gipson\u2019s 90-day window for petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court for certiorari expired. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Gipson is correct that he is entitled to statutory tolling while he pursued timely state post-conviction relief\u2014that is, from when Gipson\u2019s conviction became final on July 13, 2006 until October 25, 2007, when the time for Gipson to file a petition for review for post-conviction relief (after receiving one extension of time) expired. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2). Gipson filed his federal habeas petition one year and 122 days later, on February 23, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Gipson argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling of that one year and 122 days based on (1) the state trial court\u2019s inexplicable decision to forward Gipson\u2019s pro se transcript request to his appointed counsel, with whom Gipson allegedly could not communicate, and (2) the state trial court\u2019s miscalculation of his filing deadline and concomitant denial of his second request for an extension of time to file a petition for review for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">A petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling only when he shows \u201c \u2018(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way\u2019 and prevented timely filing.\u201d <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2562, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-17\">Here, even if Gipson had pursued his rights diligently, the state trial court\u2019s errors did not prevent him from filing a timely federal habeas petition. First, with respect to the miscommunication about Gipson\u2019s transcript request, Gipson has failed to identify anything in the transcript that was necessary for him to be able to file his federal habeas petition. Furthermore, Gipson received the transcript on October 3, 2008, more than three weeks before AEDPA\u2019s limitations period ran, but has failed to show that it was impossible for him to file his petition within those three weeks. And second, with respect to the denial of the extension of time as a result of the miscalculated filing deadline, even after Gipson exhausted his state appeals of that denial, he still had five months left on AEDPA\u2019s limitations period to timely file his petition. Alternatively, as the Supreme Court has noted, Gipson could have filed a \u201cprotective\u201d petition with the district court and asked it to \u201cstay and abey the federal habeas proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>until state remedies are exhausted.\u201d <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 416, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005). Accordingly, Gipson has not met his burden to show that extraordinary circumstances made it impossible for him to file a timely habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Thus, because Gipson filed his \u00a7 2254 petition 122 days after AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period expired, and because he is not entitled to equitable tolling, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition as untimely. We therefore need not address Gipson\u2019s argument that the state court\u2019s denial of his motion for a second extension of time amounted to an inadequate state procedural bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b610-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
