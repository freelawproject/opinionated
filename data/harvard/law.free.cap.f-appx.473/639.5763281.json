We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment because Fosselman failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether defendants Brager, Lee, and Kates were aware of his need for surgery and therefore responsible for its delay. <em>See id. </em>at 1057 (no deliberate indifference unless prison officials know of and disregard an excessive risk to inmate health or safety).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to continue defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion because Fosselman failed to explain how the additional information he sought would have been essential to defeat summary judgment. <em>See California ex rel. Cal. Dep\u2019t of Toxic Substances Control v. Campbell, </em>138 F.3d 772, 779-80 (9th Cir.1998) (reviewing for an abuse of discretion and setting forth relevant factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing without prejudice defendants Gibbs and Mattews for failure to effect timely service of process. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(m) (requiring service within 120 days after the complaint is filed); <em>Oyama v. Sheehan (In re Sheehan), </em>253 F.3d 507, 511-13 (9th Cir.2001) (discussing good cause and the district court\u2019s broad discretion to extend time for service or to dismiss without prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Fosselman\u2019s motions for reconsideration because Fosselman failed to show grounds warranting reconsideration. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cnty., Or. v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (9th Cir.1993) (reviewing for an abuse of discretion and setting forth requirements for reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">Fosselman\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b672-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
