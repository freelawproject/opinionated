For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-27\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b805-28\">The district court did not err in dismissing Velasquez\u2019s Eighth Amendment allegations because he cannot demonstrate that appellees acted with deliberate indifference in delaying his hernia surgery. The Eighth Amendment requires the government to provide a certain level of medical care to its prisoners. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). Not every breach of this duty, however, amounts to a constitutional violation. <em>Hutchinson v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number><em>States, </em>838 F.2d 390, 394 (9th Cir.1988). Instead, the relevant inquiry when an inmate contends that prison officials neglected his medical needs is whether these officials demonstrated \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 104, 97 S.Ct. 285. To state a claim under the deliberate indifference standard, an inmate must allege more than mere negligence, but rather plead facts sufficient to support the conclusion that prison officials were aware of a substantial risk to the prisoner\u2019s health, yet purposefully disregarded it. <em>See Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1058 (9th Cir.2004). Furthermore, when, as here, a claim is based on a delay in treatment, such a delay only rises to a constitutional violation if it caused the prisoner \u201csubstantial harm.\u201d <em>Wood v. Housewright, </em>900 F.2d 1332, 1335 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Velasquez maintains appellees were aware of his condition, yet unreasonably delayed his hernia operation for over a year. None of his allegations, however, demonstrates the existence of deliberate indifference. In fact, the undisputed facts reflect that appellees attended to Velasquez\u2019s needs by providing him with pain medication after his hernia diagnosis, meeting with him on a number of occasions to discuss his pain treatment, responding to his numerous administrative appeals, placing him on the high priority list for surgery, and scheduling the procedure as soon as a surgeon was available. Accordingly, Velasquez\u2019s \u00a7 1983 Eighth Amendment claim was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The district court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim alleging that appellees violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights in refusing to fulfill his pleas for immediate treatment. Appellees\u2019 delay or inaction in responding to Velasquez\u2019s appeals cannot alone serve as the basis for a due process claim because a prison\u2019s grievance procedures do not confer any Fourteenth Amendment rights upon inmates. <em>Ramirez v. Galaza, </em>334 F.3d 850, 860 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[I]nmates lack a separate constitutional entitlement to a specific prison grievance procedure.\u201d). Consequently, an official\u2019s action or inaction with respect to a prisoner\u2019s appeal cannot give rise to \u00a7 1983 liability. Velasquez\u2019s frustration with the prison\u2019s handling of his medical requests, therefore, is an insufficient basis for a due process claim and it was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff leave to amend. Dismissal of a <em>pro se </em>complaint with prejudice is proper only if it is \u201cabsolutely clear that the deficiencies of the complaint could not be cured by amendment.\u201d <em>Schucker v. Rockwood, </em>846 F.2d 1202, 1203-04 (9th Cir.1988) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the district court appropriately dismissed Velasquez\u2019s complaint without leave to amend because any amendment would have been futile. There is no evidence that appellees\u2019 conduct rose to the level of a constitutional violation on which Velasquez could base a \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b805-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
