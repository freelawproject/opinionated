We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s findings of fact, review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, and review de novo due process claims. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Brooks\u2019 motion to reopen where she filed the motion more than a year and a half after her final order of removal, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(iii), and did not establish that she acted with the due diligence required for equitable tolling, <em>see Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). It follows that Brooks\u2019 due process claim fails. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error and prejudice for a petitioner to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to rescind Brooks\u2019 in absentia removal order because substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Brooks was removable due to alien smuggling, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(I), where her Form 1-213 reflects that she \u201cprovided some form of affirmative assistance to the illegally entering alien,\u201d <em>Altamirano v. Gonzales, 427 </em>F.3d 586, 592 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b770-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
