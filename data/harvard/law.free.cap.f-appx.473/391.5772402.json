The district court dismissed the action because: it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction; Arteta had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies; and, he had no liberty interest at stake. Arteta contends the court erred because: his claim was properly brought under \u00a7 2241; he was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies; exclusion from the program violated his due-process rights; and, exclusion violated his equal-protection rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-25\">Arteta, a native of Mexico, was convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A). He was sentenced to, <em>inter alia, </em>60 months of imprisonment. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a detainer against him pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c) based on its determination that he is subject to immediate removal from the United States upon his release from Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP) custody. While in prison, Arteta filed a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, asserting that the BOP improperly denied him certain benefits and opportunities made available under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3621 and 3624 on the basis that he is not a U.S. citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-26\">This petition is foreclosed by our court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Ricardo Gallegos-Her</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>nandez v.
