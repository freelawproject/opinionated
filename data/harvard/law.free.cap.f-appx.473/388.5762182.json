She argues that the district court erred by enhancing her sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6) based on a finding that she intentionally or recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to the alien by transporting him in the trunk of her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo and reviews the district court\u2019s fact findings relative to the \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6) enhancement for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>630 F.3d 377, 380 (5th Cir.2011). The transportation of aliens in the trunk of a vehicle is specifically listed in the comments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6) as the type of conduct contemplated by the Sentencing Commission in drafting the guideline provision. \u00a7 2L1.1, comment, (n.5).
