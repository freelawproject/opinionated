He requested a one-year reduction in his sentence for completing the Bureau of Prisons drug rehabilitation program and transfer to a facility that would afford him access to the same benefits and programs as other federal prisoners. Jaquez-Munoz now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">We are required to examine our jurisdiction sua sponte, if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). As Jaquez-Munoz has been released from custody and removed from the United States, we can no longer grant him the relief he seeks so his appeal is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 381-82 (5th Cir.2007). His appeal is therefore DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
