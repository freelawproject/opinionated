We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-23\">Even if He\u2019s testimony was credible, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that he did not suffer past persecution where he was not physically harmed and was detained for short periods of time. <em>See Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1019-21 (9th Cir.2006). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that He does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003); <em>see also Li v. INS, </em>92 F.3d 985, 988 (9th Cir.1996) (no persecution where the petitioner would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>face the same punishment as any other returning migrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Because He failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, it follows that he has not met the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Finally, substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because He failed to establish that it is more likely than not he will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government of China. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066,1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b662-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
