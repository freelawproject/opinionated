(Supervalu) challenges the district court\u2019s partial grant of summary judgment in favor of Appellees Richard R. Morris, Jr. and Richard A. Morris, and the district court\u2019s denial of Supervalu\u2019s motion for reconsideration. During negotiations for a new lease, Supervalu and Morris disputed the meaning of the undefined term \u201cloan constant,\u201d as utilized in an option provision in the new lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-18\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it held that Supervalu\u2019s hearsay evidence of the parties\u2019 understanding of the meaning of \u201cloan constant\u201d was inadmissible. <em>See In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>627 F.3d 376, 386 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cWe cannot declare that the district court reached an illogical or implausible result by excluding apparent hearsay or documents without sufficient foundational support as the rules of evidence prescribe ... \u201d); <em>see also Intermountain Fair Hous. Council v. Boise Rescue Mission Ministries, </em>657 F.3d 988, 998 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cConelusory affidavits that do not affirmatively show personal knowledge of specific facts are insufficient to defeat summary judgment.\u201d) (citation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-19\">Even if admissible, Supervalu\u2019s extrinsic evidence did not raise a material factual dispute regarding the parties\u2019 respective interpretations of the meaning of \u201cloan constant.\u201d The extrinsic evidence was limited to Supervalu\u2019s subjective intent during negotiations subsequent to the signing of the original lease. <em>See Renfro v. Kaur, </em>156 Wash.App. 655, 235 P.3d 800, 803 (2010) (\u201c[Ejxtrinsic evidence may not be used (1) to establish a party\u2019s unilateral or subjective intent as to the meaning of a contract word or term; (2) to show an intention independent of the instrument; or (3) to vary, contradict, or modify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>written word.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Because Supervalu failed to provide any contrary definition of \u201cloan constant\u201d that was adopted by the parties, the district court properly granted summary judgment premised on the ordinary meaning of \u201cloan constant.\u201d <em>See Hearst Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Seattle Times Co., </em>154 Wash.2d 493, 115 P.3d 262, 267 (2005) (en banc) (\u201cWe generally give words in a contract their ordinary, usual, and popular meaning unless the entirety of the agreement clearly demonstrates a contrary intent. We do not interpret what was intended to be written but what was written.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Additionally, summary judgment was warranted because Supervalu conditioned its exercise of the option on Morris\u2019 acceptance of Supervalu\u2019s interpretation of the disputed term \u201cloan constant.\u201d <em>See Duprey v. Donahoe, </em>52 Wash.2d 129, 323 P.2d 903, 906 (1958) (\u201cIf the optionee attaches conditions riot warranted by the terms of the option to his acceptance ... this itself amounts to a rejection ... \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b848-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
