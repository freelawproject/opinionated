The district court sentenced him to thirty-six months\u2019 imprisonment. The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2G2.2 (b)(7)(C) (2009), based on the relevant conduct of receiving child pornography that included video fragments found in the temporary cache of Roszczipka\u2019s computer. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Layton, </em>564 F.3d 330, 334 (4th Cir.2009). A defendant may \u201creceive\u201d child pornography by viewing it online, regardless of whether he downloads the material. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Pruitt, </em>638 F.3d 763, 766 (11th Cir.) (\u201cA person \u2018knowingly receives\u2019 child pornography ... when he intentionally views, acquires, or accepts child pornography on a computer from an outside source.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 113,181 L.Ed.2d 38 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">Here, the Government obtained evidence that Roszczipka subscribed to multiple child pornography websites and that he admitted he viewed the videos. Accordingly, the district court did not err in enhancing Roszczipka\u2019s sentence pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2G2.2 (b)(7)(C), notwithstanding the fact that Roszczipka was not aware that viewing the videos would result in storage of video fragments on his computer. Roszczipka\u2019s arguments to the contrary conflate knowing possession and knowing receipt. Unlike the out-of-circuit authority Roszczipka advances, the possibility that the video fragments appeared on his machine by means other than his own intention to view the content is not in issue. <em>See United States v. Winkler, </em>639 F.3d 692, 699 (5th Cir.2011) (finding sufficient evidence for knowing receipt of child pornography given evidence that defendant paid for members-only child pornography sites and only way files could have appeared in cache was by defendant\u2019s decision to view videos).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
