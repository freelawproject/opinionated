Pursuant to the plea agreement, the government recommended a sentence of 46 months. The district court imposed a sentence of 60 months, and Kuhn appeals his sentence. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The district court did not err when it increased Kuhn\u2019s base offense level by four levels for possession of a video containing sadistic content. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4). A single video can support this enhancement. <em>See United States v. Holt, </em>510 F.3d 1007, 1011 (9th Cir.2007). There was sufficient evidence of knowing possession of the video with sadistic content to satisfy that requirement. <em>See United States v. Rearden, </em>349 F.3d 608, 616 (9th Cir.2003). The video had been downloaded to Kuhn\u2019s computer, was saved in his \u201cMy Documents\u201d file, had been accessed at least once after being downloaded, and had not been deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">We do not have jurisdiction to review whether the district court erred when it declined to apply a one-level downward departure recommended by the government for Kuhn\u2019s early resolution of the case. \u201cWe lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s decision not to grant a discretionary downward departure absent evidence that the district court believed it lacked the authority to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Tam, </em>240 F.3d 797, 805 (9th Cir.2001). There is no evidence that the district court believed it lacked the authority to grant the departure recommended by the government. The district court recognized that the government was recommending a one-level departure for \u201cexpedited disposition,\u201d but it chose to adopt the guideline range calculated by the probation department, which did not include the one-level departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">Finally, the district court\u2019s sentence of 60 months\u2014which reflects its decision to vary downward from the range of 78-97 months recommended by the probation department\u2014was not substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
