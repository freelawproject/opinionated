We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Chandra failed to establish that several of the incidents she experienced in Indonesia were on account of a protected ground. <em>See Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 742 (9th Cir. 2009) (assailants\u2019 reference to petitioner\u2019s ethnicity did not compel the conclusion that ethnicity was a central motivating reason for the attack); <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir.1998) (petitioner must establish mistreatment was targeted particularly toward her and occurred because of racial or religious animus). Further, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that petitioners\u2019 remaining experiences did not amount to past persecution. <em>See Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 975-76 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1059-60. Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination that, even as a member of a disfavored group, Chandra has not established a well-founded fear of persecution in Indonesia because she has not demonstrated sufficient individualized risk. <em>Cf. Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Because petitioners failed to establish eligibility for asylum, they necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Singh, </em>134 F.3d at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Finally, petitioners fail to raise any substantive challenge to the denial of their CAT claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not addressed in the argument portion of a brief are deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
