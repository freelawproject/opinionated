The district court properly dismissed the action because Mobley has not shown that his convictions have been overturned or called into question. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (holding that a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) suit for monetary damages is barred if prevailing in the action would necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction); <em>Harvey v. Horan, </em>278 F.3d 370, 375 (4th Cir.2002) (applying <em>Heck </em>to claims for injunctive relief), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Skinner v. Switzer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 1298-1300, 179 L.Ed.2d 233 (2011); <em>Clemente v. Allen, </em>120 F.3d 703, 705 (7th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (stating that the rationale in <em>Heck </em>applies to actions under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-25\">However, we modify the district court\u2019s order to reflect that the dismissal is without prejudice to Mobley\u2019s ability to re-file his claims if his federal convictions are overturned or called into question by the appropriate court and affirm the order as modified. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>terials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
