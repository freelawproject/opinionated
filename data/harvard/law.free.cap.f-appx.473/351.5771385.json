Flores argues on appeal that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court granted him only a forty percent reduction in accordance with the Government\u2019s motion under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2010) instead of the fifty percent reduction he requested at sentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Flores does not challenge the district court\u2019s computation of his Guidelines range or the district court\u2019s selection of sentence before application of the \u00a7 5K1.1 departure. Flores only challenges the extent of the district court\u2019s departure. However, the extent of the district court\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 departure is generally unreviewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>313 F.3d 219, 222 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201cwe do not have the authority to review the extent to which a district court departs downward unless the departure decision resulted in a sentence imposed in violation of law or resulted from an incorrect application of the Guidelines\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">To the extent Flores otherwise challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, he points to no sentencing factor that rebuts the presumption of reasonableness for his below-Guidelines sentence. We therefore conclude that his sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
