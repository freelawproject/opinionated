Terry, a District of Columbia prisoner housed in federal custody, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241 (West 2006 &amp; Supp.2011) petition. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (2006); <em>Madley v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>278 F.3d 1306, 1309 (D.C.Cir.2002) (\u2018We conclude that a court of the District [of Columbia] is a state court for the purpose of [\u00a7 2253(c) ].\u201d). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the petition states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-23\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Terry has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Terry\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
