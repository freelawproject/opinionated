He argues that the district court\u2019s admission of hearsay testimony at his revocation hearing violated his due process rights, the district court improperly admitted statements he made to the police in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. </em>436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and there was insufficient evidence to revoke his supervised release. The facts underlying this case are known to the parties and need not be repeated here. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">We review de novo whether the district court violated Holden\u2019s due process rights. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>526 F.3d 543, 547 (9th Cir.2008). We review a district court\u2019s decision to revoke a term of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>Perez, </em>526 F.3d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">The Sixth Amendment right of confrontation does not apply in supervised release revocation hearings, <em>United States v. Hall, </em>419 F.3d 980, 985 (9th Cir.2005); and hearsay may be admissible, <em>see United States v. Comito, </em>177 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir. 1999). However, Holden has a \u201cdue process right to confront witnesses against him during his supervised release proceedings, ... unless the government shows good cause for not producing the witnesses.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>419 F.3d at 986 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">Holden challenges the district court\u2019s admission of out-of-court statements by Mathis and Barnett. Holden\u2019s interest in confrontation does not outweigh the government\u2019s good cause for denying it. <em>See id. </em>at 986-88. The government in this case provided a good reason for not producing Mathis and Barnett\u2014both witnesses expressed fear of retaliation from the commencement of their involvement in the case and both witnesses recanted their testimony as the prospect of further involvement increased. <em>See id. </em>at 988. Additionally, Mathis\u2019 and Barnett\u2019s statements bore indicia of reliability because they were consistent with each other and with Mathis\u2019 injuries. <em>See id. </em>Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the. challenged statements fall under the excited utterance hearsay exception. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(2); <em>see also Hall, </em>419 F.3d at 987 (\u201c[Ljong-standing exceptions to the hearsay rule that meet the more demanding requirements for criminal prosecutions should satisfy the lesser standard of due process accorded the respondent in a revocation proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">Holden\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>argument also fails. Even assuming arguendo that the district court erred in admitting Holden\u2019s <em>pre-Miranda </em>statement, the error was harmless because Holden\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>statements alone fully supported the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>court\u2019s finding. <em>See United States v. Reyes-Bosque, </em>596 F.3d 1017,1031-32 (9th Cir.2010). Because Holden\u2019s due process and <em>Miranda </em>arguments fad, Holden\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence argument fails as well. <em>See Perez, </em>526 F.3d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b792-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
