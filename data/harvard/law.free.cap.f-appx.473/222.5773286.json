Sneed\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether Sneed\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. Sneed was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. The Government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as moot because Sneed has completed his term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-18\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and determined that Sneed has been discharged from federal custody and that his sentence did not include a term of supervised release. Because Sneed has not alleged continuing collateral consequences from the district court\u2019s judgment on revocation of probation, and no such consequences are apparent from the record, we conclude Sneed\u2019s appeal is moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 12-18, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion and dismiss Sneed\u2019s appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-19\">This court requires that counsel inform Sneed, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Sneed requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Sneed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-20\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
