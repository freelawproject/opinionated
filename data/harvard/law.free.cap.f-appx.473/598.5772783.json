We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Valdivia first contends that the district court proeedurally erred by failing adequately to explain the sentence imposed. The record belies this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Valdivia next contends that the district court erred by misunderstanding its authority to depart downward based on cultural assimilation. The district court appears to have based its denial of a downward departure, at least in part, on a mistaken belief that a previously deported alien cannot rely on cultural assimilation as a ground for a departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 8. However, any error is harmless because it did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Ali, </em>620 F.3d 1062, 1074 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
