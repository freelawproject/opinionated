Rohan, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Shkodran Dacaj, </em>No. A088 524 989 (B.I.A. Aug. 10, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A088 524 989 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 23, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA, <em>i.e., </em>minus the arguments for denying relief that were not considered by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">For applications, such as this one, governed by the REAL ID Act, in order to demonstrate eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal, \u201cthe applicant must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>see Castro v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 93,104 (2d Cir.2010); <em>see also Matter of C-T-L- </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 341, 344-46 (BIA 2010) (extending \u201cone central reason\u201d standard to withholding of removal). Here, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Dacaj\u2019s testimony lacked sufficient detail to show that his political opinion was \u201cone central reason\u201d for the harm he suffered and feared in Kosovo.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">An alien\u2019s uncorroborated testimony may suffice to carry his burden only where it is \u201cconsistent, detailed, and credible.\u201d <em>Chuilu Liu v. Holder, </em>575 F.3d 193, 196\u2014 97 (2d Cir.2009); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(C). In this case, the agency reasonably found that Dacaj\u2019s testimony alone, even if credible and consistent, was not sufficiently detailed to support his assertion that the harm he suffered and feared in Kosovo was at the hands of political parties who targeted him on account of his membership in the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (\u201cAAK\u201d), in light of substantial evidence of financial motives for the attacks. <em>See Chuilu, </em>575 F.3d at 196. Moreover, the agency was entitled to conclude that the statements by Dacaj\u2019s family members and other evidence submitted by Dacaj were insufficient to corroborate his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-19\">Further, even if Dacaj could show past persecution creating a presumption of future persecution, the agency properly found that this presumption was rebutted by evidence of changed country conditions. <em>See Lecaj v. Holder, </em>616 F.3d 111, 119 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Cir.2010). As the agency found, Kosovo declared its independence in 2008 and Dacaj has provided no evidence of recent inter-party strife or violence against ethnic Albanians. Nor do Dacaj\u2019s generalized assertions of recent \u201cpolitically motivated killings\u201d or Kosovo\u2019s continuing \u201cpolitical problems\u201d establish a fear of future persecution absent a presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Accordingly, we find no error in the agency\u2019s determination that Dacaj failed to meet his burden of proof as to his claims for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1281(b)(3)(C); <em>see also Chuilu, 575 </em>F.3d at 196-99. Dacaj does not challenge the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief. We lack jurisdiction to consider Dacaj\u2019s argument that he is eligible for humanitarian relief because he failed to exhaust that claim before the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113,119 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
