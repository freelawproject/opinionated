We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Aguilera v. Baca, </em>510 F.3d 1161, 1167 (9th Cir.2007), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds because Banga failed to file her action within two years of when she knew or should have known that defendant disclosed her credit report to third parties for promotional or other improper purposes. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 p (action under Fair Credit Reporting Act must be filed two years after plaintiff discovers the violation or five years after the violation occurs, whichever is earlier); Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1785.33 (action under California Consumer Credit Reporting Act must be filed within two years after plaintiff knows or should have known of the violation but no more than seven years after the earliest violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Banga\u2019s remaining contentions, including her alleged claims against Cal State 9 Credit Union, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Banga\u2019s motion for referral to the court\u2019s pro bono program is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b745-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
