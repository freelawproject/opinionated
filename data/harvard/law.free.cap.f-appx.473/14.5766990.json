Davis appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Oyster Bay-East Norwich Central School District (the \u201cSchool District\u201d), dismissing her employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>ment discrimination complaint. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>see Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003), and its application of res judicata and collateral estoppel principles, <em>see O\u2019Connor v. Pierson, </em>568 F.3d 64, 69 (2d Cir.2009); <em>Chartier v. Marlin Mgmt, LLC, </em>202 F.3d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 2000). For the reasons articulated by the magistrate judge in his well-reasoned report and recommendation, <em>see Davis v. Oyster Bay-E. Norwich Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>No. 09-cv-1823, 2010 WL 3924681 (E.D.N.Y. June 17, 2010), which the district court adopted in full, <em>see Davis v. Oyster Bay-E. Norwich Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>No. 09-cv-1823, 2010 WL 3855237 (E.D.N.Y. Sept.28, 2010), Davis\u2019s action against the School District was precluded insofar as she sought to relitigate issues stemming from her first and third complaints filed with the New York State Division of Human Rights (\u201cNYSDHR\u201d) or from her termination hearing held pursuant to New York Civil Service Law \u00a7 75 (\u201csection 75\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and time-barred insofar as she sought to raise the claim underlying her second NYSDHR complaint. Furthermore, we agree with the district court that even if Davis\u2019s claims were not procedurally barred, she would lose on the merits, as she has failed to put forth evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find unlawful retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Davis contends that the district court was required to conduct a de novo hearing before it accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations. However, the Federal Magistrates Act, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), \u201ccalls for a <em>de novo </em>determination, not a <em>de novo </em>hearing\u201d of contested issues. <em>United States v. Raddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 674, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980). Nothing in the record suggests that the district court did not conduct a de novo determination, and the court expressly stated that it did so. In our own de novo review, we find no error in the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">Finally, Davis argues on appeal that she was denied due process at her section 75 hearing and seeks a new termination hearing. However, she did not make that argument to the district court. Indeed, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>expressly represented to the district court, in her objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, that she was <em>not </em>seeking to have the findings made by the section 75 hearing officer reversed in this matter, or to relitigate that hearing. Thus, we decline to address her due process claim. <em>See Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (\u201cIt is the general rule, of course, that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.\u201d); <em>Aslanidis v. U.S. Lines, Inc., </em>7 F.3d 1067, 1077 (2d Cir.1993) (\u201c[A] party opposing summary disposition of a case must raise all arguments against such remedy in the trial court and may not raise them for the first time on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">We have considered Davis\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\">. The Supreme Court has held that a New York state court decision affirming a rejection of a discrimination complaint by the NYSDHR is entitled to preclusive effect in a later federal discrimination lawsuit based on the same facts. <em>Kremer v. Chem. Constr. Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982). At oral argument, Davis\u2019s counsel argued that three of our opinions somehow modify this rule. As we have no authority to disregard binding authority, it is unsurprising that the cited cases are inapposite. In <em>Vargas v. City of New York, </em>377 F.3d 200 (2d Cir.2004), the issue was whether the <em>Rooker-Fetdman </em>doctrine prevented the district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s equal protection claim, an issue not presented by this case. Moreover, the Court noted that Vargas had not even raised his equal protection claim in the state court proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 208. In <em>Owens v. New York City Housing Authority, </em>934 F.2d 405 (2d Cir. 1991), \"the state court issue\u2014misconduct\u2014was necessarily resolved after a full and fair opportunity to contest it,\u201d but that issue \"was not the same as the one [that the district court found] to be precluded\u2014job qualification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409. And in <em>Sinicropi v. Nassau County, </em>634 F.2d 45 (2d Cir. 1980)\u2014which, in any event, preceded Kremer\u2014the plaintiff challenged a termination that did not even occur \"until more than four months after the last court decision on the merits of her earlier complaint,\u201d and thus \"no state court ha[d] passed on the merits of appellant's claim of retaliatory termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47. In the present case, by contrast, we agree with the district court that Davis \"raised, and the state court necessarily determined\u201d the very issues that are presented by her present federal complaint. <em>Davis, </em>2010 WL 3855237, at *4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
