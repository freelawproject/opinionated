We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Garcia v. Holder, </em>621 F.3d 906, 912 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Hernandez-Hernandez\u2019s motion to reopen to submit evidence of his indigenous heritage because he failed to demonstrate that the evidence was previously unavailable, given that Hernandez-Hernandez was aware that he was indigenous at the time of his hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>Goel v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 735, 738 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cIf [the new evidence] was available or capable of being discovered at [the time of the movant\u2019s hearing], it cannot provide a basis for reopening.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in denying Hernandez-Hernandez\u2019s motion to reopen on the ground that the hardship evidence he submitted was insufficient to establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal. <em>See Garcia, </em>621 F.3d at 912 (prima facie eligibility is demonstrated by a showing that there is a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied); <em>Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b712-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
