Economus, United States Senior District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b529-20\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b529-21\">Joshua Brandon White appeals his twenty-four month sentence, imposed for conspiring to distribute, and for possessing with intent to distribute, pills containing Oxycodone, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-22\">White pleaded guilty to conspiring with his co-defendants and others to sell Oxycodone. White\u2019s presentence report calculated a base offense level of eighteen. The report reduced that level by three because White timely accepted responsibility pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b), resulting in a total offense level of fifteen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Combined with White\u2019s Criminal History Category of IV, his advisory sentencing guidelines range was thirty to thirty-seven months of imprisonment. White objected to the report\u2019s use of two juvenile adjudications in his sentence calculation, but the district court overruled White\u2019s objection and adopted the report\u2019s calculations. The United States filed a motion for a downward departure, requesting that White\u2019s offense level be reduced by two levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1. The district court granted that motion and reduced White\u2019s sentencing range to twenty-four to thirty months of imprisonment. The court then sentenced White to twenty-four months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">On appeal, White argues that the district court erred in calculating his Criminal History Category by counting his two juvenile adjudications that were reflected in his presentence report. The United States moves to dismiss this appeal based on the waiver provision in White\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We review de novo the issue of whether White, through his plea agreement, has waived his right to appeal his sentence. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>344 F.3d 479, 483 (6th Cir.2003). Plea agreements are strictly construed, and any ambiguities are interpreted against the government. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>605 F.3d 300, 312 (6th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>569 F.3d 569, 573 (6th Cir.2009). \u201cA defendant may waive any right, including a constitutional right, in a plea agreement so long as the waiver is knowing and voluntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Coker, </em>514 F.3d 562, 573 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The plea agreement expressly forecloses this appeal. The provision at issue states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am2T\">14. (a) In consideration of the concessions made by the United States in this agreement and as a further demonstration of the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility for the offense committed, the defendant agrees not to file a direct appeal of the defendant\u2019s conviction or sentence except the defendant retains the right to appeal a sentence imposed above the sentencing guideline range or any applicable mandatory minimum sentence (whichever is greater) determined by the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">White does not allege that he was sentenced above the sentencing guidelines range. Further, no party claims that a statutory minimum affects this case. White does not contend that his plea was involuntary or was not knowingly and intelligently made. White argues only that the phrase \u201cdetermined by the district court\u201d modifies only \u201cany applicable mandatory minimum sentence,\u201d and, therefore, the reference to \u201csentence imposed above the sentencing guideline range\u201d actually means that he may appeal any \u201csentence imposed above [an objectively correct, properly calculated] sentencing guideline range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">We do not agree with that interpretation. The \u201cdetermined by the district court\u201d clause modifies both the reference to a mandatory minimum and the phrase \u201csentence imposed above the sentencing guideline range.\u201d Immediately before the language \u201cdetermined by the district court,\u201d the sentence specifically refers back to both the mandatory minimum phrase and the guidelines range phrase by stating \u201c(whichever is greater).\u201d This language refers to more than one option. If the language \u201cdetermined by the district court\u201d was intended to modify only the mandatory minimum phrase, as White claims, it would have been placed before the \u201c(whichever is greater)\u201d phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">\u201cWhen a[d]efendant waives his right to appeal his sentence in a valid plea agreement, this Court is bound by that agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>ment and will not review the sentence except in limited circumstances,\u201d such as where the sentence exceeded the statutory maximum or was imposed based on racial discrimination. <em>Smith, </em>344 F.3d at 483 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Ferguson, </em>669 F.3d 756, 764 (6th Cir.2012). White has not alleged that any such circumstances exist in this case. Accordingly, the waiver provision precludes White\u2019s appeal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Luebbert, </em>411 F.3d 602, 603-04 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The motion to dismiss is granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
