The order is not appeal-able unless a circuit justice or judge issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (2006). A certif\u00edcate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the petition states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Ramsey has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We deny Ramsey\u2019s request for DNA testing at the Government\u2019s expense. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
