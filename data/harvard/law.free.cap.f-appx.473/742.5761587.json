R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b775-11\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">Nosa Daniel Aghedo appeals his 57-month sentence and order of restitution in the amount of $1,231,250.91 following his conviction for conspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349 and possession of five or more false identification documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(3). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm the 57-month sentence that Aghedo received after pleading guilty to these offenses, but vacate and remand the order of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">As part of his plea agreement, Aghedo waived his right to appeal the sentence imposed as long as the term of imprisonment was not greater than 120 months. Aghedo\u2019s appeal of the 57-month sentence is barred by this valid waiver. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>628 F.3d 1203, 1205 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">The parties stipulated that Aghedo\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal the restitution order was invalid because the plea agreement did not specify, or cap, the amount of restitution. <em>See United States v. Gordon, </em>393 F.3d 1044, 1050 (9th Cir.2004). At his sentencing hearing, Aghedo challenged the government\u2019s evidence regarding the loss calculations supporting the restitution amount. The evidence of the loss caused by the conspiracy consisted of unsupported statements in the probation department\u2019s Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) listing the amount of \u201cactual loss\u201d suffered by several financial institutions. The PSR referred to, but did not include as an attachment, a chart prepared by an investigator that may have provided additional support for the loss calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-19\">When a defendant objects to a PSR, the district court \u201cmay not simply rely on the factual statements in the PSR.\u201d <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073,1086 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). Supplemental affidavits provided by the government only justified some amount greater than $264,700 and did not constitute a showing \u201cthat it is more likely than not that the defendant\u2019s offense proximately caused the losses for which restitution was awarded and that it did so in the amounts awarded.\u201d <em>United States v. Tsosie, </em>639 F.3d 1213, 1222 (9th Cir.2011). We therefore vacate the order of restitution and remand to allow the district court to reassess the amount of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-20\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b775-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid-. ed by 9th Cir.
