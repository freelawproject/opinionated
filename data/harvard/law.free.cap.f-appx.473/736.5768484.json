We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Ferdik v. Bonzelet, </em>963 F.2d 1258, 1260 (9th Cir.1992), and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The district court dismissed for failure to comply with its order requiring Smith to return within thirty days the Notice of Submission of Documents and the documents necessary for service of the summons and complaint. However, Smith\u2019s motion to stay proceedings shows that Smith was unable to file these documents within the time limit for reasons beyond his control, and that he attempted to alert the court to his situation at least twice prior to dismissal. Because the district court failed to consider the reasons for Smith\u2019s delay or explore less harsh alternatives before dismissing, we reverse and remand for further proceedings. <em>See Pagtalunan v. Galaza, </em>291 F.3d 639, 642-43 &amp; n. 4 (9th Cir.2002) (listing factors to consider before dismissing for failure to comply with a court order and explaining that less drastic alternatives must be pursued after disobedience); <em>Oliva v. Sullivan, </em>958 F.2d 272, 274 (9th Cir.1992) (reversing dismissal where the ease did not \u201cpresent the egregious circumstances, or the court\u2019s use of less drastic measures prior to dismissal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
