Cade, </em>236 F.3d 463, 466 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cAs provided by [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3583(e)(3), a defendant is not entitled to credit against the revocation sentence for time served on supervised release before revocation____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The district court did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause by imposing a 77-month sentence for Bravo-Cuevas\u2019 new violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 as well as a consecutive 6-month sentence for violation of his supervised release conditions, despite the fact that both violations resulted from the same conduct. <em>See United States v. Soto-Olivas, </em>44 F.3d 788, 790-91 (9th Cir.1995). The transcript of the sentencing hearing indicates that the district court appropriately imposed the 6-month sentence as a sanction for Bravo-Cuevas\u2019 breach of trust, and not <em>\u201csolely, </em>or even primarily based on the severity of the new criminal offense underlying the revocation ...\u201d <em>United States v. Simtob, </em>485 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir.2007) (citation omitted) (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Hammons, </em>558 F.3d 1100, 1104 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b844-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-9\">. The government argues that Bravo-Cuevas waived this argument by failing to raise it in his prior appeal. We need not resolve this issue because Bravo-Cuevas' claim fails on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
