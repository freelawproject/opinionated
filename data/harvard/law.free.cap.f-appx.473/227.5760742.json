We affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In 2001, Scott pled guilty to drug and firearm offenses and was sentenced to 156 months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to a Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Scott did not appeal his conviction or sentence. In 2008, the district court granted Scott\u2019s first motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 706 of the Guidelines and reduced Scott\u2019s sentence to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment. In 2011, Scott filed a second motion under \u00a7 3582 requesting relief pursuant to Amendment 750 of the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court denied the motion. Scott filed a motion for reconsideration of that order, which the district court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We review an order granting or denying a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Goines, </em>357 F.3d 469, 478 (4th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>59 F.3d 481, 483 (4th Cir.1995). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), \u201ca defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a [Guidelines] range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d and made retroactive is generally eligible for a sentence reduction at the discretion of the district court. Because Scott\u2019s sentence was imposed pursuant to a Rule 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement and not as a result of the applicable Guidelines range, the district court lacked discretion to reduce Scott\u2019s sentence pursuant to an amendment to the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>653 F.3d 337, 340 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1003, 181 L.Ed.2d 791 (2012). The district court therefore properly denied Scott\u2019s motion to reconsider.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\">. Rule 11(e)(1)(C) was redesignated as Rule 11(c)(1)(C) in the 2002 amendments to Rule 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\">. We note that the district court did not have authority to grant the motion in any event, because a motion to reconsider is not a proper vehicle to seek review of a ruling on a \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>United States v. Goodwyn, </em>596 F.3d 233, 235-36 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
