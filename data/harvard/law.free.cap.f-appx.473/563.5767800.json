Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we repeat only those facts necessary to resolve the issues raised on appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate his sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Martinez-Grijalva raises a claim of sentencing entrapment, citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 Application Note 12 (\u201cNote 12\u201d). Although he argued the substance of Note 12 before the district court\u2014i.e., that the quantities discussed were \u201cpuffing\u201d and that the issue of \u201ccapacity or ability to truly deliver on what they promised, is something that the court ought to take into account in determining sentence\u201d\u2014he failed to cite to or object under Note 12. The government claims that Martinez-Grijalva\u2019s arguments were insufficient to preserve this claim. Nonetheless, even if it is forfeited, we review for plain error. Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (plain error standard permits an appellate court to reverse if there was (a) an error, (b) that was plain, and (c) that affected substantial rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">\u201cSentencing entrapment or \u2018sentence factor manipulation\u2019 occurs when \u2018a defendant, although predisposed to commit a minor or lesser offense, is entrapped in[to] committing a greater offense subject to greater punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Staufer, </em>38 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir.1994). When sentencing entrapment occurs, \u201cthe amount of drugs used in calculating the defendant\u2019s sentence should be reduced by the amount that \u2018flows from the entrapment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Briggs, </em>623 F.3d 724, 729 (9th Cir.2010). Under Note 12, if a defendant makes a proper showing that he \u201cwas not reasonably capable of providing ... the agreed-upon quantity,\u201d the court must exclude the quantity that he establishes he was not reasonably capable of providing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 App. n. 12. Finally, under our circuit precedent, \u201cApplication Notes 12 and 17 [now incorporated into Note 12] clearly require the district court to determine whether sentencing entrapment has occurred. Under Note 12, the district court \u2018shall exclude\u2019 from the calculation the amount of drugs which flow from sentencing entrapment.\u201d <em>United States v. Naranjo, </em>52 F.3d 245, 250 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">At sentencing, the district court rejected arguments relating to sentencing entrapment because it concluded that any relief would require the court to invalidate the jury\u2019s verdict. That conclusion was erroneous, at odds with our precedent, and affected Martinez-Grijalva\u2019s substantial rights. The ultimate determination of sentencing entrapment is within the province of the sentencing judge, and the mere fact of conviction does not trump this obligation. Under <em>Naranjo, </em>Martinez-Grijalva\u2019s inability to produce 100 kilograms of cocaine\u2014instead producing two kilograms of cocaine and fifty-nine kilograms of building plaster\u2014raises a significant issue. We vacate Martinez-Grijalva\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. We take no position on whether relief should be granted, and, on remand, Grajeda-Eneinas has the burden of proving sentencing entrap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ment by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Naranjo, </em>52 F.3d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
