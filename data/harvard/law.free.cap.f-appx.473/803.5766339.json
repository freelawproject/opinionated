Klein met his threshold burden of showing that Cusano\u2019s right of publicity claim arises out of \u201cconduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of ... free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\u201d Cal. Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 425.16(e)(4); see <em>Equilon Enterprises, LLC v. Consumer Cause, Inc., </em>29 Cal.4th 53, 124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685, 694 (2002). Dissemination of the television program and DVD set constitutes conduct in furtherance of free speech. <em>See Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim, </em>452 U.S. 61, 65, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981) (\u201cEntertainment, as well as political and ideological speech, is protected; motion pictures, programs broadcast by radio and television, and live entertainment, such as musical and dramatic works fall within the First Amendment guarantee.\u201d); <em>Cinevision Corp. v. City of Burbank, </em>745 F.2d 560, 567-68 (9th Cir.1984) (recognizing that making expressive materials available to the public \u201cfurther[s] a first amendment interest\u201d). The challenged activities were in connection with a public issue because they related to KISS and its members, individuals or entities who are in the public eye or are of widespread, public interest. <em>See No Doubt v. Activision Publishing, Inc., </em>192 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1027, 122 Cal.Rptr.3d 397 (Cal.App.2011) (holding that use of band members\u2019 likenesses in a video game was a matter of public interest because of the widespread fame the band had achieved); <em>Nygard, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula, </em>159 Cal. App.4th 1027, 1042, 72 Cal.Rptr.3d 210 (Cal.App.2008) (holding that \u201can issue of public interest\u201d is \u201cany issue in which the public is interested\u201d and concluding that an article about a \u201cprominent businessman and celebrity\u201d met the standard (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">3. Cusano has not met his burden of showing a probability of prevailing on his state law right of publicity claim, <em>see </em>Equilon Enterprises, 124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d at 694, because that claim is preempted by federal copyright law, <em>see </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(a). The still and video footage of Cusano\u2019s performances and public appearances as a member of KISS are \u201coriginal works of authorship fixed in [a] tangible medium of expression\u201d within the subject matter of copyright. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a); <em>see also Laws v. Sony Music Entertainment, Inc., </em>448 F.3d 1134, 1137-38 (9th Cir.2006) (setting forth two-part test for copyright preemption). In addition, the right Cusano seeks to vindicate under state law\u2014to control the reproduction and dissemination of copyrightable work\u2014is \u201cequivalent to ... rights contained in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106, which articulates the exclusive rights of copyright holders.\u201d <em>Laws, </em>448 F.3d at 1138. In short, \u201cthe underlying nature of [Cusano\u2019s] state law claim[ ] is part and parcel of a copyright claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1144. It is therefore preempted by the Copyright Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the district court\u2019s order and remand for dismissal of Cusano\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b835-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-14\">. SLAPP is an acronym for \"strategic lawsuit against public participation.\u201d <em>Equilon Enterprises, LLC v. Consumer Cause, Inc., 29 </em>Cal.4th 53, 124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685, 687 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-26\">. The district court did not deny Klein\u2019s motion pursuant to California Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 425.17, so Cusano's contention that the order is not appealable per subparagraph (e) of that section is inapposite. <em>See </em>Cal.Civ. Proc.Code \u00a7 425.17(e) (providing that an order denying an anti-SLAPP motion to strike under this section in not immediately appeal-able).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
