Sayegh argues that the court abused its discretion by denying him an opportunity to amend his complaint to allege facts that would support tolling the statute of limitations. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">Sayegh\u2019s proffer to the district court of the kind of facts that he would allege if he were given the opportunity to amend his complaint was insufficient to support either equitable tolling or equitable estoppel. On appeal, Sayegh has not advanced any facts that would plausibly support tolling the statute of limitations. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied leave to amend based on futility. <em>See Deutsch v. Turner Corp., </em>324 F.3d 692, 717-18 (9th Cir.2003) (upholding denial of leave to amend on the basis of futility where the plaintiffs proffered facts to the district court that were insufficient to support tolling and failed to offer additional facts on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
