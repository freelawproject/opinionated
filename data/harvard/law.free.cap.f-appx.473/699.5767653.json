R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, Ex-pel\u00edan Information Solutions, Inc.\u2019s request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Kamlesh Banga appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s summary judgment and award of costs in her action alleging that defendants Experian Information Solutions, Inc. (\u201cExperian\u201d) and Kohl\u2019s Department Stores, Inc. (\u201cKohl\u2019s\u201d) violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the grant of summary judgment, <em>Rene v. MGM Grand Hotel, Inc., </em>305 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc), and for an abuse of discretion an award of costs to the prevailing party, <em>Dawson v. City of Seattle, </em>435 F.3d 1054,1070 (9th Cir.2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Banga\u2019s claims for willful violations under \u00a7 1681n of the Act because, as she conceded to the district court, defendants were not objectively unreasonable in accessing Banga\u2019s credit report for account review purposes while she closed her Kohl\u2019s account. <em>See Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, </em>551 U.S. 47, 69-70 &amp; n. 20,127 S.Ct. 2201,167 L.Ed.2d 1045 (2007) (no willful violation if defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u201cless-than-pellucid\u201d statutory text is \u201cnot objectively unreasonable\u201d and there is no guidance from courts or relevant agencies); <em>see also Reynoso v. Giurbino, </em>462 F.3d 1099,1110 (9th Cir.2006) (party is bound by concession to the district court</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">notwithstanding contrary position on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Banga\u2019s claims for negligent violations under \u00a7 1681o of the Act because she failed to raise a triable dispute as to whether defendants\u2019 conduct resulted in actual damages. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681o(a); <em>cf. also Weinberg v. Whatcom, Cnty., </em>241 F.3d 746, 751-52 (9th Cir.2001) (affirming summary judgment where plaintiff \u201cfailed to offer competent evidence of damages\u201d for a claim in which plaintiff \u201cbore the burden of establishing the amount of actual harm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on issue preclusion grounds as to Banga\u2019s claim that defendant Experian violated \u00a7 1681r of the Act because she unsuccessfully litigated this issue in a prior lawsuit. <em>See San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. San Francisco City and Cnty., </em>364 F.3d 1088, 1094 (9th Cir.2004) (party cannot relitigate issues actually and necessarily decided in earlier litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding defendants their costs in connection with Banga\u2019s deposition. <em>See Cherry v. Champion Int\u2019l Corp., </em>186 F.3d 442, 448-49 (9th Cir.1999) (costs of transcribing and videotaping deposition are recoverable if they are necessarily obtained for use in the case).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">Banga\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">Banga\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel for purposes of oral argument on appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
