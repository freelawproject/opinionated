We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we REVERSE and REMAND to the district court with instructions to remand to the Administrative Law Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits <em>de novo. Edlund v. Massanari, </em>253 F.3d 1152, 1156 (9th Cir.2001). We reverse the Commissioner\u2019s decision only when it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">There is no question that Swims Under has several severe impairments, including, as the ALJ found, problems with her left rotator cuff, right hip degenerative joint disease, and left knee degenerative joint disease, with history of replacements and surgical interventions. The legal dispute is on impacts of these impairments, and on the intensity, persistence and limiting effects they generated. Swims Under contends that the ALJ improperly discounted her credibility regarding the intensity, persistence, and limiting effect of her symptoms. The general rule is that \u201c[t]o discredit a claimant\u2019s testimony when a medical impairment has been established,\u201d the ALJ must \u201ccite the reasons why the claimant\u2019s testimony is unpersuasive.\u201d <em>Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 635 (9th Cir.2007) (internal citations, quotation marks, and alterations omitted). Because \u201cthe ALJ did not find \u2018affirmative evidence\u2019 that the claimant was a malingerer,\u201d those reasons must be \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We conclude that in light of Swims Under\u2019s serious impairments, her restricted activities of daily living and her limited and sporadic work history, clear and convincing reasons to disbelieve her statements about intensity of pain, persistence of problems and limiting effects of her symptoms were not shown by the ALJ. On the record before us, we do not sustain the negative credibility assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">The ALJ concluded that Swims Under\u2019s daily activities were \u201cnot indicative of disabling or uncontrolled pain and incapacitating limitations.\u201d But \u201c[t]he Social Security Act does not require that claimants be utterly incapacitated to be eligible for benefits,\u201d <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1989). In our view, Swims Under\u2019s daily activities are neither inconsistent with her claimed limitations and pain, nor do they imply that she could return to work. Her past work record as a personal care assistant, cooking at McDonalds, and cleaning rooms and making beds at motels was not extensive. As for work at home, Swims Under testified that her husband and teenage son do the housework, that she grocery shops once a month using a riding cart with the help of another member of her household, that she watches her 3-year-old grandson for a few hours during the day, and that she spends a great part of her waking hours in her recliner resting her back and legs. These restricted activities of daily living do not undermine the credibility of Swims Under\u2019s subjective complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">Because the ALJ\u2019s reasons for finding that Swims Under was not entirely credible were not in our view clear and convincing, we reverse the decision of the district court and instruct it to remand this case to the ALJ for a redetermination of Swims Under\u2019s credibility and residual functional capacity and for further determinations consistent with this decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b584-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">. Swims Under also contends that the Magistrate Judge erred by entering his findings and recommendations before the deadline to file her reply brief. The Magistrate Judge erred procedurally, but this error was harmless because Swims Under does not identify any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>prejudice she suffered as a result. She was, moreover, able to present all arguments to the district court that she might have placed in a reply before the ALJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
