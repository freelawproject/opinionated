Respondents also appeal the district court\u2019s decision that Celaya\u2019s trial was fundamentally unfair, entitling her to habeas relief. Celaya cross-appeals the lower court\u2019s holding that she procedurally defaulted on her ineffective assistance of counsel claims. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b826-25\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act provides, \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction ... review ... is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). The pendency of such an application is determined by state law. <em>See Wixom v. Washington, </em>264 F.3d 894, 897 (9th Cir.2001) (applying Washington law). Under Arizona law, Celaya\u2019s PCR petition was \u201cpending\u201d until the Arizona Court of Appeals issued the mandate concluding its review of that petition on November 30, 2000. <em>See Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 219-20, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002); <em>see also Hemmerle v. Schriro, </em>495 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>F.3d 1069, 1077 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Borrow v. El Dorado Lodge, Inc., </em>75 Ariz. 218, 254 P.2d 1027, 1028 (1953). Accordingly, Celaya\u2019s habeas petition, filed on November 28, 2001, was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The trial court\u2019s exclusion of Celaya\u2019s proffered witnesses rendered her trial fundamentally unfair in violation of clearly established federal law. Arizona Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides that \u201cevidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Ariz. R. Evid. 404(b). Celaya sought to introduce testimony that was probative of Lopez\u2019s motive and intent. The three witnesses that the trial court excluded would have corroborated Celaya\u2019s testimony; indeed, they were vital to Celaya\u2019s defense. The trial court erred when it excluded that evidence, rendering the trial fundamentally unfair. <em>See State v. Fish, </em>222 Ariz. 109, 213 P.3d 258 (Ariz.Ct. App.2009); <em>see also Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973) (\u201cFew rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense.\u201d); <em>Jammal v. Van de Kamp, </em>926 F.2d 918, 919 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">This error \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). The Arizona Court of Appeals\u2019s denial of relief for this constitutional violation was contrary to clearly established federal law under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">We need not reach any other issue raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b826-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
