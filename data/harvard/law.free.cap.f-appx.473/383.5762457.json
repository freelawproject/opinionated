By moving for IFP status, Hayward is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Hayward argues that it would be a hardship to pay the costs of his appeal and that justice requires that the appeal be heard. He does not address the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith or any of the court\u2019s reasons for its decision. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Accordingly, his challenge is deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dall. Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Additionally, Hayward has not shown that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (per curiam). The motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">Because Hayward was incarcerated at the time he filed his notice of appeal, this dismissal counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Hayward is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. See \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
