McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b893-21\">Appellant seeks a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition. In 2010, Appellant pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute less than five grams of methamphetamine, and he was sentenced to 188 months of imprisonment. Appellant filed an appeal, but his appeal was dismissed pursuant to the plea agreement\u2019s waiver of appellate rights. In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Appellant claimed he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his plea negotiations, plea hearing, and sentencing, based mainly on the fact he received a much longer sentence than expected. However, the magistrate judge considered each of Appellant\u2019s arguments and concluded that Appellant' had not shown ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The district court agreed and therefore denied habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-22\">After thoroughly reviewing the record and Appellant\u2019s filings on appeal, we conclude that reasonable jurists would not debate the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Most of Appellant\u2019s arguments revolve around the fact he received a longer sentence than expected. However, while the record shows the prosecutor and defense counsel both estimated a lower sentencing guidelines range than the 188-235 month range the PSR later calculated, Appellant was repeatedly warned the sentencing court would not be bound by the plea agreement\u2019s stipulations or the parties\u2019 estimates. He chose to plead guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>knowing his sentence could be much higher than estimated. The record simply does not support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the plea bargaining and change of plea phases. <em>See United States v. Gordon, </em>4 F.3d 1567, 1570 (10th Cir.1993) (\u201cA miscalculation or erroneous sentence estimation by defense counsel is not a constitutionally deficient performance rising to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d). As for Appellant\u2019s claims regarding counsel\u2019s alleged failure to raise certain objections during the sentencing proceeding, Appellant does not show a reasonable probability he would have received a lower sentence if counsel had raised these objections.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Contrary to Appellant\u2019s assertions, the sentencing guidelines range was correctly calculated, and the district court was not bound by the stipulations in the plea agreement. Moreover, counsel in fact requested a downward variance based on these stipulations, and the court\u2019s rejection of this request does not show ineffective assistance on counsel\u2019s part. Appellant has not shown either that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s purported errors at sentencing. Therefore, for substantially the same reasons given by the magistrate judge and district court, we DENY Appellant\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-5\">. Appellant also argues counsel should have requested a downward variance based on Appellant's low level of intelligence. This argument was raised for the first time in his objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and is thus deemed waived. <em>See Marshall v. Chater, </em>75 F.3d 1421, 1426 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b893-18\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
