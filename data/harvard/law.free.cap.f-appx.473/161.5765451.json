Heiser challenges the District Court\u2019s rulings denying his motion to dismiss his indictment, or, in the alternative, to suppress evidence, and denying his motion to continue jury selection. Heiser also brings various challenges related to his sentence. For the following reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">I. Factual Background and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">A. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZu\">On May 6, 2004, Heiser\u2019s then fifteen-year-old adopted daughter, J.H., informed a school resource officer employed by the Berwick Police Department that Heiser began sexually abusing her when she was nine years old.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Berwick Police Department initiated a criminal investigation, and, on May 18, 2004, executed a search warrant at Heiser\u2019s residence, resulting in the seizure of, among other things, his computer. The computer was turned over to the Pennsylvania State Police for forensic analysis, and a police computer crime analyst, Dale Young, proceeded to make a mirror image of the computer\u2019s hard drive. Due to the hard drive\u2019s poor condition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Young initially had difficulty with that task but was eventually successful. Examination of that mirror image revealed 495 images of child pornography in unallocated space<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 21 images of child pornography in allocated space. Sexually explicit pictures of J.H. were recovered among those images. The original mirror image of the hard drive was stored on a state police forensic storage device. The state police returned to the Berwick Police Department the original computer and hard drive, along with a CD that contained a copy of the mirror image and a CD with the child pornography images.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">On August 8, 2004, Heiser was indicted in the District Court for production of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(b) (\u201cCount One\u201d), and receipt of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) (\u201cCount Two\u201d). He responded by filing a motion to compel production of the mirror image of the hard drive, and the District Court granted that motion. When attempting to comply with the Court\u2019s order, however, Young discovered that the storage device which contained the mirror image of Heiser\u2019s hard drive had crashed and, therefore, that the mirror image was no longer accessible. Young requested that the Berwick Police Department provide him with the back-up copy of the mirror image previously given to them. The department, however, was unable to locate the CD with that data. Young then attempted to create a new mirror image using Heiser\u2019s original hard drive, but the attempt was unsuccessful due to the hard drive\u2019s deteriorated condition. The Berwick Police Department still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>had possession of the CD that contained copies of the child pornography images originally retrieved from Heiser\u2019s hard drive, and the government provided a copy of that CD to Heiser but did not disclose to him the unsuccessful efforts to recover the mirror image until almost two months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">After learning that he was not going to receive a copy of the mirror image, Heiser filed a motion seeking dismissal of the indictment, or, in the alternative, suppression of all of the computer evidence. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing and denied that motion because it found there was no evidence that the government had acted in bad faith, and, despite not having a copy of the mirror image, Heiser still had \u201cthe necessary discovery in his possession in order to prepare a defense.\u201d (App.289.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Over two years later, and after the District Court had granted over a dozen continuances sought by Heiser, the Court authorized Reclamere, Inc., a forensic data recovery business, to perform a forensic data recovery operation on Heiser\u2019s original hard drive. Reclamere was ultimately successful in reading data from roughly 97% of the hard drive\u2019s surface, and it issued a \u201cCertified Data Recovery Outcome Report\u201d on December 11, 2008, which was provided to Heiser\u2019s counsel for review. Using the recovered data, Young found, in unallocated space, 490 of the 495 images of child pornography that had been previously copied onto a CD provided to Heiser.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">After the District Court granted seven additional motions to continue filed by Heiser, it scheduled jury selection for April 27, 2010. On the evening of April 26, 2010, Heiser filed another motion to continue jury selection and trial, based on the government\u2019s alleged failure to provide him with a list of files that would be used at trial and the consequent failure to allow defense experts to search those files for any metadata that existed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Prior to the scheduled jury selection the following day, the Court conferred with counsel to discuss the pending motion. During that hearing, Heiser\u2019s counsel emphasized the importance of defense experts having enough time prior to trial to analyze the recovered files for any metadata that might exist. Heiser\u2019s counsel admitted that, \u201cbased on the motions and other things that are in progress and the discussions that [he] had with Reclamere, [he] believe[d] that [such analysis] [could] be ready for trial,\u201d (App. at 303a) but that he had filed the motion to continue because Heiser had directed him to do so. The District Court denied the continuance and trial commenced on May 10, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">During trial, J.H. testified that Heiser had taken pictures of her in various stages of undress and that some of those pictures captured sexual acts between her and Heiser as they occurred. She said that Heiser would sometimes view those pictures on the computer with her, and critique them. During those critiques, Heiser would show her other child pornography on the computer and suggest that she and Heiser engage in sexual acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>similar to what they had viewed. J.H. expressed that she \u201cthought it was normal ...,\u201d \u201cdidn\u2019t know any better,\u201d and \u201cthought [that] is just how it [was supposed to be] ... -with a child and a father.\u201d (App. at 422a.) On May 19, 2010, the jury found Heiser guilty on both Counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">C. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The probation officer circulated an initial pre-sentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) on November 80, 2010, which calculated a sentencing guideline range of 180-188 months. On January 14, 2011, Heiser filed numerous objections to the report, which, if adopted, would have resulted in a calculated advisory guideline range of 135-168 months. The government did not lodge any objections to that PSR. On April 29, 2011, a revised PSR was circulated that adopted the majority of Heiser\u2019s objections. However, it also included other changes that were not among Heiser\u2019s objections. Specifically, the revised PSR included, among other revisions, a two level-enhancement for using a computer to solicit participation with a minor in sexually explicit conduct, and a five-level enhancement for engaging in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct. The changes in the revised PSR resulted in a guidelines sentencing range of 324-405 months. The District Court permitted Heiser to object to the revised PSR, but it subsequently overruled those objections. The Court ultimately sentenced Heiser to 282 months\u2019 imprisonment, 240 months on Count One and 42 months on Count Two, to run concurrently with his previously-imposed state sentence. <em>See supra </em>note 1. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">II. Discussion<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">On appeal, Heiser argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, to suppress evidence, and he also asserts that the Court abused its discretion in denying his final motion to continue. Heiser further brings three challenges related to his sentencing, claiming that his right to due process was violated by the revisions made to portions of the initial PSR, that the Court erred in assessing a two-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3), and that the Court erred in assessing a five-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.5(b)(l). We reject all of Heiser\u2019s contentions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">A. <em>Motion to </em>Dismiss/Suppress<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">Heiser first argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment, or, in the alternative, to suppress the computer evidence. He says that the computer evidence \u201cclearly had important exculpatory value,\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 18) and claims that his due process rights were violated since he was deprived of the opportunity \u201cto have [his] own expert undertake an evaluation of the hard drive information for the purpose of securing the exculpatory information contained thereon.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">We disagree. First, the evidence that was allegedly \u201cdestroyed\u201d was substantial<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ly recovered through a forensic data recovery operation, and that data was provided to Heiser prior to trial. Second, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the forensic data recovery did not afford Heiser with the equivalent level of information that the actual hard drive, or mirror image copy, would have provided, Heiser\u2019s due process claim still fails. Although destruction of evidence may constitute a due process violation, <em>California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 489, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984), \u201c[a] defendant who claims destroyed evidence might have proved exculpatory ... has to show the prosecution\u2019s bad faith in ordering or permitting its destruction,\u201d <em>United States v. Deaner, </em>1 F.3d 192, 200 (3d Cir.1993). Absent proof of bad faith, \u201cfailure to preserve evidence that might be of use to a criminal defendant ... is not a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988)). To prove bad faith, the Supreme Court has explained that there must be a \u201cshowing that the Government intentionally [acted] to gain some tactical advantage over [the defendant].... \u201d <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. at 57, 109 S.Ct. 333 (citation and internal quotations marks omitted); <em>see Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. at 488, 104 S.Ct. 2528 (explaining bad faith as \u201cofficial animus toward[ ] [a defendant] or ... a conscious effort to suppress exculpatory evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Heiser has not proven that the government acted in bad faith. Neither the catastrophic failure of the computer storage device nor Young\u2019s inability to create a second mirror image from Heiser\u2019s original hard drive rises to the level of an intentional act to gain a tactical advantage over Heiser. <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. at 57, 109 S.Ct. 333. Heiser\u2019s own expert witness acknowledged that he had experienced unexpected crashes while working with computers, and that expert confirmed that he did not believe that the government intentionally damaged Heiser\u2019s hard drive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the Berwick Police Department\u2019s loss of the back-up copy of the mirror image might be characterized as negligent, Heiser has failed to demonstrate any \u201cofficial animus [was directed] towards [him] or ... [that there was] a conscious effort to suppress exculpatory evidence.\u201d <em>Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. at 488,104 S.Ct. 2528; <em>see Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. at 58, 109 S.Ct. 333 (finding no bad faith where the failure of police to preserve evidence \u201c[could] at worst be described as negligent\u201d). Therefore, the District Court did not err in denying Heiser\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, or, in the alternative, suppress the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">B. <em>Motion to Continue Jury Selection and </em>Trial<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Heiser next contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied his final motion to continue because, he says, the Court knew that the government still needed to provide him with metadata from the files recovered from Reclamere and that \u201cmetadata was crucial information that needed to be ... absorbed so that the defense could properly move forward.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Trial judges \u201care given wide latitude\u201d in deciding whether to grant a continuance, although \u201ca rigid insistence on expedition in the face of a justifiable request for delay can amount to a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Rankin, </em>779 F.2d 956, 960 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>(3d Cir.1986). \u201cBecause there is no mechanical test[] to determine where there exists a violation of due process, courts must examine the particular circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>United States v. Olfano, </em>503 F.3d 240, 245-46 (3d Cir.2007) (alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). When deciding on a motion to continue, a district court should consider both \u201cthe efficient administration of criminal justice [and] the accused\u2019s rights ...,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 246 (citation omitted), which \u201cincludfes] an adequate opportunity to prepare a defense ...,\u201d <em>United States v. Kikumura, </em>947 F.2d 72, 78 (3d Cir.1991) (citation omitted). A court may also consider the diligence of counsel in requesting a continuance and the timeliness of the request. <em>See United States v. Fisher, </em>10 F.3d 115, 117, 118 (3d Cir.1993) (finding motion for a continuance filed approximately ten days before jury selection after the Court \u201chad already granted numerous continuances and had put off the scheduled trial date for eight months\u201d to be \u201cunjustifiable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Looking at the particular circumstances of this case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to continue. At the continuance hearing, Heiser\u2019s own counsel told the Court that defense experts would have enough time to analyze the forensic report prior to trial and that he had only filed the motion because Heiser wanted him to. Moreover, that motion to continue, one of over two dozen filed by Heiser over the course of four years, was not filed in a timely manner, as it came on the eve of jury selection. In light of those facts, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">C. <em>Sentencing </em>Claims<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">1. <em>Revised PSR</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Heiser contends that the probation officer\u2019s revisions to \u201cunobjected to\u201d portions of the initial PSR, which resulted in an increase in the recommended sentencing range, constituted a violation of his due process rights. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 33.) Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(f) addresses objections to a pre-sentence report, providing, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]fter receiving objections, the probation officer may meet with the parties to discuss the objections. The probation officer may then investigate further and revise the presentence report as appropriate.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(f)(3). Despite Heiser\u2019s contention to the contrary, nothing in that rule limits the probation officer\u2019s review to those portions of the report that have drawn objections. Thus, revisions can be made to a pre-sentence report with or without objections from the parties. The revisions that Heiser specifically challenges, as discussed herein, <em>infra </em>Part II. C.2-3, were appropriate. Moreover, the Court gave Heiser an opportunity to object to the revisions. Accordingly, the revisions did not constitute a violation of Heiser\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">2. <em>Two-Level Increase Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1 (b)(3)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">Heiser contends that the District Court erred in applying the two-level offense increase under the 2003 version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1 (b)(3) because he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>use a computer to solicit participation with J.H. in sexually explicit conduct. The 2003 version of \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3) provides:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\">If, for the purpose of producing sexually explicit material, the offense involved (A) the knowing misrepresentation of a participant\u2019s identity to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage [sic] sexually explicit conduct; or (B) <em>the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to </em>(i) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct, or to otherwise solicit participation by a minor in such conduct; or <em>(ii) solicit participation with a minor in sexually explicit conduct, increase by 2 levels.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3) (2003) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Here, Heiser did use a computer to solicit J.H. to participate in sexually explicit conduct. He took sexually explicit photographs of her and placed them on his computer. He would later review those pictures with her to critique them and propose suggestions on how to improve certain poses. Heiser also showed J.H. child pornography on the computer and suggested that they try some of the sex acts that they had viewed. <em>See United States v. Reaves, </em>253 F.3d 1201, 1205 (10th Cir.2001) (applying the same two-level enhancement because defendant had showed images of child pornography on his computer to children \u201cin order to entice and lure [them] into sexual relationships for the purpose of producing sexually explicit materials\u201d). Furthermore, J.H. also expressed that viewing such material led her to believe that such conduct was normal. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>237 F.3d 625, 629 (6th Cir.2001) (applying the same two-level enhancement because the victims, by viewing the child pornography, \u201cwere given the impression that this [was] acceptable conduct, [which] aid[ed] [defendant] in continuing to film them,\u201d and \u201c[i]n using the computer to desensitize his victims to deviant sexual activity, [defendant used] it to solicit participation in that activity\u201d). Accordingly, the Court properly applied the two-level offense increase under the 2003 version of \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">3. <em>Five-Level Increase Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.5(b)(1)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Heiser additionally argues that the District Court erred in applying the five-level enhancement for a pattern of activity involving sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.5(b)(l), because, he contends, abuse of a single victim is insufficient to establish a pattern of sexual abuse or exploitation. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>4B1.5(b)(1) provides that, \u201c[i]n any case in which the ... conviction is a covered sex crime ... and the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct[,] ... [t]he offense level shall be [increased by] 5\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.5(b)(1) (2003). The commentary to subsection (b) provides that a \u201cdefendant [has] engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct if on at least two separate occasions, the defendant engaged in prohibited sexual conduct with a minor.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.5(b)(l) cmt. n. 4(13)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Heiser clearly engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct. He sexually abused J.H. over the course of a number of years. Moreover, he took many sexually explicit photos of J.H. and placed them on his computer. The commentary to \u00a7 4B1.5(b)(l) specifically forecloses Heiser\u2019s argument that a single victim is insufficient to establish a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s application of the five-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.5(b)(l) was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-8\">. On May 26, 2005, Heiser was convicted in Pennsylvania state court on charges of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, statutory sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault, and sexual abuse of children, for which he received an aggregate sentence of 12 years and 10 months to 27 years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-14\">.

Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11(b), the 2003 edition of the Guidelines Manual, rather than the 2010 version, was used in calculating Heiser\u2019s sentence because the use of the 2010 version would have resulted in a more severe advisory guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11(b)(1) (\"If the court determines that use of the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced would violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause ... the court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was committed.\u201d); <em>United States v.

Accordingly, the 2003 Guidelines were applied in determining Heiser\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11(b)(2) (\"The Guidelines Manual in effect on a particular date shall be applied in its entirety.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
