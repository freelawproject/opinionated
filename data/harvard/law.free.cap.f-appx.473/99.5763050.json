Sept. 18, 2007). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 157-58, 168-69 (2d Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen was based on her claim that she fears persecution on account of the birth of her U.S. citizen children in violation of China\u2019s population control program. For largely the same reasons as this Court set forth in <em>Jian Hui Shao, </em>546 F.3d 138, we find no error in the BIA\u2019s denial of Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See id. </em>at 158-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">To the extent that Zheng argues that she was eligible to file a successive asylum application based solely on her changed personal circumstances, her argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
