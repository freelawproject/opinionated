We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision on whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and review de novo a court\u2019s conclusion on the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c). <em>United States v. Munn, </em>595 F.3d 183, 186 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-20\">Section 3582(c)(2) is inapplicable to Mercer because he was not sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range\u201d that was subsequently lowered by the United States Sentencing Commission. Rather, as the district court correctly found, he was sentenced to the mandatory statutory minimum term of imprisonment. Mercer\u2019s sentence was therefore not subject to reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 187 (\u201c[A] defendant who was convicted of a [cocaine base] offense but sentenced pursuant to a mandatory statutory minimum sentence is ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d). Further, Mercer\u2019s assertion of errors in the original sentencing proceeding should have been raised on direct appeal or in a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2011) and does not provide a basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Torres-Aquino, </em>334 F.3d 939, 941 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-21\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
