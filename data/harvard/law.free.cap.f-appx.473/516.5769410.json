This offense carries a statutory minimum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). Because Nelson provided substantial assistance in the investigation of other persons, the government moved pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) to reduce his sentence below the statutory minimum. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted the motion and sentenced Nelson to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-22\">A reduction below the statutory minimum sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3553(e) must be based exclusively on assistance-related considerations. <em>United States v. Burns, </em>577 F.3d 887, 894 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc). In this case, the district judge told the defendant that he disagreed with the law, and would give \u201ca substantially lower sentence\u201d if he had discretion to reduce the sentence further based on the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Nelson now appeals, arguing that the district court should have relied on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to reduce his sentence further.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-23\">We do not reach the merits of this contention, because Nelson waived his right to appeal the sentence on this ground. In his plea agreement, Nelson waived the right to appeal the sentence imposed, except in the following limited circumstances: \u201c(1) if the sentence is not in accordance with this plea agreement; (2) if the sentence imposed exceeds the maximum statutory penalty; and (3) if the sentence is constitutionally defective.\u201d R. Doc. 51, at 15 \u00b6 41. Nelson argues that his sentence is \u201cconstitutionally defective,\u201d because <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny \u201chave demonstrated that there have been too many restrictions place[d] upon the authority of the sentencing court.\u201d Reply Br. 1. The Sixth Amendment, however, does not forbid all determinate sentencing schemes. <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 308, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The Supreme Court recognized the policy goals of legislatures to make sentences proportional to the gravity of the offenses and to achieve pari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ty among defendants, and emphasized that nothing in its Sixth Amendment decisions \u201cimpugns those salutary objectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court held after <em>Booker </em>and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), that district courts are still bound by the strictures set forth in \u00a7 3553(e). <em>Bums, </em>577 F.3d at 894. Therefore, the sentence imposed in this case is not \u201cconstitutionally defective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The ground on which Nelson seeks to appeal falls within the scope of the appeal waiver. Nelson does not dispute that his waiver was knowing and voluntary, and he does not suggest that enforcement of the agreement would result in a miscarriage of justice. We therefore enforce the waiver. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc). The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-19\">.
