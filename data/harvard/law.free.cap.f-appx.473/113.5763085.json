Abdullah sought damages for an alleged violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 as well as violations of the First, Seventh, and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court granted in forma pauperis status and dismissed the complaint sua sponte under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), finding that the suit was time-barred under the statute of limitations. The District Court also noted that the lack of diversity among the parties precluded jurisdiction over any state-law claims for medical malpractice. Abdullah appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-23\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-24\">The District Court correctly concluded that this suit is barred. As explained by the District Court, Abdullah\u2019s claims are plainly time-barred under the statute of limitations. <em>See Jones v. R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., </em>541 U.S. 369, 382-84,124 S.Ct. 1836,158 L.Ed.2d 645 (2004) (holding four-year statute of limitations governs \u00a7 1981 claims based on amended version of \u00a7 1981; otherwise, most analogous state limitations period governs); <em>Ahmed v. Dragovich, </em>297 F.3d 201, 206 (3d Cir.2002) (noting Pennsylvania\u2019s two-year statute of limitations governs 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>claims). Accordingly, because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-13\">. Although we need not reach the issue, Abdullah's complaint indicated that he has filed numerous lawsuits based on the events in question, suggesting that his claims would be precluded even if they were timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
