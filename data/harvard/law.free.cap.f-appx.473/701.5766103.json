SMITH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b733-19\"> The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b733-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-18\">Patricia Ann Ensign appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s orders dismissing for lack of jurisdiction her motion for declaratory and injunctive relief from the Internal Revenue Services\u2019s (\u201cIRS\u201d) assessment of administrative penalties for selling tax evasion schemes. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Hughes v. United States, </em>953 F.2d 531, 535 (9th Cir.1992), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-22\">Dismissal on jurisdictional grounds of Ensign\u2019s motion for relief from the assessment of penalties under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6700 was proper because the government is immune from being sued regarding such penalties except under limited circumstances that Ensign failed to establish. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6703(c) (to contest \u00a7 6700 penalty, claimant must pay 15% of penalty and file a refund claim with IRS); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a) (prohibiting suit to recover penalties until refund claim is filed); <em>see also Korobkin v. United States, </em>988 F.2d 975, 976 (1993) (per curiam) (court lacks jurisdiction over challenge to \u00a7 6700 penalty if party fails to comply with statutory administrative claim requirement); <em>Dunn &amp; Black, P.S. v. United States, </em>492 F.3d 1084, 1087-88 (9th Cir.2007) (waivers of sovereign immunity must be unequivocal and strictly construed in the government\u2019s favor).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-23\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ensign\u2019s motion for reconsideration because she failed to establish grounds for such relief. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cnty., Or. v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (9th Cir.1993) (reviewing denial of reconsideration under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 60(b) for an abuse of discretion and setting forth requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-24\">Ensign\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b733-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and except as provided by 9th Cir.
