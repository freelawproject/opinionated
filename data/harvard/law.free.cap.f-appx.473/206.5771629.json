The record does not contain a transcript of the jury proceedings. An appellant has the burden of including in the record on appeal a transcript of all parts of the proceedings material to the issues raised on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 10(b); 4th Cir. R. 10(c). Springer has neither provided a transcript of the trial nor moved for a transcript at government expense. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) (2006). By failing to produce a transcript or to qualify for the production of a transcript at government expense, Springer has waived review of the issues on appeal that depend on the transcript to show error. <em>Powell v. Estelle, </em>959 F.2d 22, 26 (5th Cir.1992) (per curiam); <em>Keller v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>827 F.2d 952, 954 n. 1 (4th Cir.1987). As no error appears on the record before us, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
