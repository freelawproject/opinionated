(collectively, USC) appeal from a decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board) awarding priority to DePuy Spine, Inc. (DePuy) in an interference between USC and DePuy. For the reasons set forth below, we <em>vacate </em>and <em>remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">This case involves an interference between USC\u2019s U.S. Patent Application No. 10/230,671 (\u2019671 application), filed on August 29, 2002, and DePuy\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 6,812,211 (\u2019211 patent), filed on March 19, 2002. In 2005, USC copied claims into the '671 application from DePuy\u2019s '211 patent. The Board declared an interference and defined Count 1, the sole count, as claim 1 of the '211 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">The Board initially designated USC as the senior party in the interference because it accorded the '671 application the benefit of the August 31, 2001 filing date of USC\u2019s provisional application 60/316,287. The Board, however, subsequently held that the specification of USC\u2019s provisional application did not expressly disclose one of the limitations in Count 1, and thus granted DePuy\u2019s motion to deny USC the benefit of the provisional application\u2019s filing date. In response, USC filed a motion to substitute a new count. USC argued that the Board should modify Count 1 to permit USC to rely on its best proof of priority, namely its provisional application. USC proposed a count (Count 2) that omitted the limitation the Board held was not disclosed in the provisional application. The Board rejected the broader count USC proposed, which it held was invalid over a prior art patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">The Board next rejected several of De-Puy\u2019s involved claims, including claim 1, as obvious over the prior art. Because De-Puy\u2019s claim 1 defined Count 1, the Board redeclared the interference and proposed a new count (Count 3), which it defined as claim 24 of USC\u2019s '671 application. The Board authorized the parties to file comments on proposed Count 3. USC pointed out that Count 3 would still prevent it from relying on its provisional application as proof of priority because the count included the same limitation that the Board found was missing in the provisional application\u2019s specification. USC proposed claim 7 from the '671 application as an alternative count.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">The Board again declined to modify the count. It concluded that it did not need to modify the count because USC\u2019s concerns were \u201cstrictly hypothetical.\u201d Board Decision (Dec. 23, 2009). The Board then rejected USC\u2019s request for authorization to file a motion to change the count. After rejecting DePuy\u2019s remaining claims as obvious over prior art, the Board awarded priority to DePuy and refused USC\u2019s claims corresponding to the count. USC now appeals the Board\u2019s denial of its mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>tion for a broader count<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and denial of authorization to file a motion to change the count. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">We see no error with two aspects of the Board\u2019s decision. First, the Board correctly construed the language \u201cin a living being\u201d from the preamble of Count 3 as a limitation. Second, we reject USC\u2019s argument that all of its claims corresponding to the count do not stand or fall together based on the priority decision. For the reasons stated below, however, we vacate the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">The Board has recognized that allowing a party to rely on its best proofs of priority \u201cis an accepted reason in interference practice for granting\u201d a motion to modify the count. <em>Grose v. Plank, </em>15 U.S.P.Q.2d 1338, 1341 (B.P.A.I.1990). In this case, the Board adopted a count that prevented USC from relying on its provisional application\u2014which USC argues is its best proof of priority\u2014and repeatedly rejected USC\u2019s requests to modify the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">When the Board redeclared the interference and proposed Count 3, it sought comments from the parties. USC pointed out potential problems with Count 3 and proposed claim 7 of its '671 application as an alternative that would allow it to rely on its provisional application as proof of priority. USC also noted that claim 7 was found to be patentable over the same prior art reference the Board used to reject USC\u2019s proposed Count 2. Despite soliciting this feedback on Count 3, the Board did not respond in a meaningful way to any of USC\u2019s comments, stating only that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-9\">In general, a count should not encompass prior art; otherwise, a \u201cpriority proof\u2019 might simply be a replication of someone else\u2019s work. On the record developed so far, however, it appears that each party will have work of its own on which it will rely. Since, in this case, the concern is strictly hypothetical, there is insufficient reason at present to change the count further.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">Board Decision (Dec. 23, 2009). This passage does not offer any coherent justification for declining to modify the count so USC could rely on its provisional application. The Board similarly ignored this issue in its decision denying USC authorization to file a motion to modify the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">The Board\u2019s subsequent decision on USC\u2019s request for rehearing did not clarify its reasoning. Once again, the Board offered no explanation for its decision to continue using a count that prevented USC from relying on its provisional application. Moreover, the Board perplexingly stated that USC \u201conly suggested a new count in a comment, but never actually moved for the new count,\u201d despite the fact that the Board denied USC authorization to file such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">\u201c[A] Board opinion must contain sufficient findings and reasoning to permit meaningful appellate scrutiny.\u201d <em>Gechter v. Davidson, </em>116 F.3d 1454, 1458 (Fed.Cir. 1997). A Board decision that does not articulate sufficient reasoning must be vacated. <em>Id. </em>at 1457-58. The Board erred by insufficiently explaining its decision not to modify Count 3 to allow USC to claim priority to its provisional application. This failure is particularly troublesome because a party typically should be allowed to rely on its best priority proofs. The Board compounded its error by denying USC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>authorization to file a motion to modify the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">On remand, USC should be afforded the opportunity to file a motion to change the count. The Board\u2019s decision must, at the very least, squarely address the issues USC raises and set out the reasoning supporting the Board\u2019s conclusions in sufficient detail to permit meaningful review.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Costs to appellants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-10\">. On appeal, USC does not argue that Count 2 is not rendered anticipated or obvious over Aksan.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
