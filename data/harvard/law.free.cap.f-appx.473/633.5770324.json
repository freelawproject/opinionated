We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the new standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the Real ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-22\">The agency concluded Lakha was not credible for a number of reasons, including the discrepancies between his testimony and declaration regarding the reports he made to the police of the attacks against him. <em>See id. </em>at 1048 (adverse credibility finding reasonable under totality of circumstances). Accordingly, in the absence of credible testimony, we deny the petition as to Lahka\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153,1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-23\">In addition, the record supports the agency\u2019s denial of Lahka\u2019s CAT claim because it is made on the basis of the same statements the agency found not credible, and he does not point to any other evidence in the record that shows it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to India. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57. Accordingly, Lahka\u2019s CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b665-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
