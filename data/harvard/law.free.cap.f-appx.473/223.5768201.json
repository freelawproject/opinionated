Coleman appeals his sentence, arguing that imposition of the fifteen-year sentence was error because mandatory minimum sentences conflict with the mandate in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) (2006) to impose a sentence \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary.\u201d He further contends that a fifteen-year sentence is greater than necessary in his case to achieve the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-20\">The Sentencing Reform Act, of which \u00a7 3553(a) is part, dictates that a defendant should be sentenced in accordance with its provisions to achieve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2) \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551(a) (2006). Courts have generally held that mandatory minimum sentences are \u201cotherwise specifically provided\u201d and thus do not conflict with \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary\u201d clause. <em>See United States v. Sutton, </em>625 F.3d 526, 529 (8th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Kellum, </em>356 F.3d 285, 289 (3d Cir.2004) (\u201c[T]he mandatory minimum sentences [the defendant] was exposed to pursuant to [statute] clearly fit within the \u2018except as otherwise specifically provided\u2019 exclusion of \u00a7 3551(a).\u201d). \u201cCourts have uniformly rejected the claim that \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s \u2018no greater than necessary\u2019 language authorizes a district court to sentence below the statutory minimum.\u201d <em>United States v. Cirilo-Mu\u00f1oz, </em>582 F.3d 54, 55 (1st Cir.2009) (per curiam) (listing cases); <em>see also United States v. Franklin, </em>499 F.3d 578, 585 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201c[Section] 3553(a) factors do not apply to congressionally mandated sentences\u201d); <em>United States v. Roberson, </em>474 F.3d 432, 436 (7th Cir.2007) (although acknowledging the tension between \u00a7 3553(a) and statutorily-mandated sentences, holding that \u00a7 3553(a) as a \u201cvery general statute cannot be understood to authorize courts to sentence below m\u00ednimums specifically prescribed by Congress.\u201d). In <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850 (4th Cir.2005), we held that, <em>post-Booker, </em>except in limit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ed circumstances not present here, \u201ca district court still may not depart below a statutory minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 862. Coleman\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Raby, </em>575 F.3d 876 (4th Cir.2009), is misplaced, as that case provides no guidance on sentencing below a mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
