The Brunats argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to IndyMac on their claims that IndyMac violated the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>\u00a7 1635, by failing to provide the Brunats two copies of their right to rescind the loan; and that their loan is repayable in the form of real property upon recission. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Alaska Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Feldman, </em>504 F.3d 840, 848 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">There is no evidence that IndyMac failed to provide two copies of the right to rescind. IndyMac offers a document signed by the Brunats in September 2006, acknowledging that they received two copies of the right to rescind. The only evidence that the Brunats offer that they did not get the notice is a conclusory statement that Vladimir Brunat does \u201cnot recall\u201d getting any notice. \u201cWhen opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769,167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">As IndyMac did not violate TILA, the Brunats have no right to rescind, and we need not consider whether the loan is repayable in real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b681-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
