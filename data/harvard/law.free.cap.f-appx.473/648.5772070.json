Our jurisdiction is governed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 992 (9th Cir.2008), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Kumar\u2019s second motion to reopen as untimely where the motion was filed over a year and a half after the BIA\u2019s final decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Kumar failed to present sufficient evidence of changed circumstances in India to qualify for an exception to the time limit, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also Toufighi, </em>538 F.3d at 996-97 (evidence must demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief in order to reopen proceedings based on changed country conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">This court lacks jurisdiction to review Kumar\u2019s contention that his former counsel was ineffective. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Finally, Kumar\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b680-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
