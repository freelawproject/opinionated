Wells Fargo removed the case to the District Court for the Central District of California. The district court subsequently granted Wells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss, finding that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Plaintiffs timely appealed to this court, but failed to request a stay of the foreclosure sale pending appeal. As a result, the foreclosure sale was completed on May 11, 2012.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under California law, \u201cthe remedy for noncompliance [with section 2923.5] is a simple postponement of the foreclosure sale, nothing more.\u201d <em>Mabry v. Superior Court, </em>185 Cal.App.4th 208, 110 Cal. Rptr.3d 201, 204 (2010). If a foreclosure sale has already occurred, section 2923.5 has no effect on the finality of that sale. <em>Id. </em>at 221, 110 Cal.Rptr.3d 201. Because the foreclosure sale has been completed, Plaintiffs no longer have any potential remedy. We therefore dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal as moot. <em>See Am. Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa. v. Baker, </em>22 F.3d 880, 896 (9th Cir.1994) (A case is moot when there is no longer \u201ca present controversy as to which effective relief can be granted.\u201d (quoting <em>Vill. of Gambell v. Babbitt, </em>999 F.2d 403, 406 (9th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted))).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The district court\u2019s order granting Wells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss, District Court Docket Item No. 20, is vacated. <em>See ACLU of Nev. v. Masto, </em>670 F.3d 1046, 1065 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">The court expresses no opinion as to the merits of the jurisdiction or preemption issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">The appeal is DISMISSED and the order below is VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b839-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>by 9th Cir.
