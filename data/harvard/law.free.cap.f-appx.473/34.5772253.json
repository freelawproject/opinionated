We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. <em>Molinari v. Bloomberg, </em>564 F.3d 587, 595 (2d Cir.2009). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and, based on the undisputed facts, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>10 Ellicott Square Court Corp. v. Mtn. Valley Indem. Co., </em>634 F.3d 112, 119 (2d Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The burden is on the moving party to demonstrate that no genuine issue respecting any material fact exists. <em>See id. </em>In reviewing a court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment, the appellate court must consider \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw[ ] all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <em>Palmieri v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>445 F.3d 179, 187 (2d Cir.2006). \u201cNevertheless, the non[-]moving party must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial.\u201d <em>Shannon v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., </em>332 F.3d 95, 99 (2d Cir.2003). \u201cConclusory allegations, conjecture, and speculation ... are insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., </em>224 F.3d 33, 41 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201c[Unsupported allegations do not create a material issue of fact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">First, we agree with the magistrate judge that Joseph failed to adduce sufficient evidence of a disability to satisfy that element of a <em>prima facie </em>ADA claim. <em>See Giordano v. City of N.Y., </em>274 F.3d 740, 747 (2d Cir.2001). The version of the ADA in effect at the time of Joseph\u2019s termination in 2007 defined \u201cdisability\u201d as: \u201c(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d <em>EEOC v. J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., </em>321 F.3d 69, 74 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2) (1991)), <em>superseded by </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(3) (2009). On <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we identify evidence that Joseph suffered from a bunion and pain on her toenail following surgery which prevented her from wearing stockings with closed shoes. While these symptoms caused Joseph some difficulty with walking,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(0 (1991), Joseph did not adduce sufficient evidence to support a finding that she was \u201csignificantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i) (1991), <em>superseded by </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j) (2011). Indeed, Joseph testified that she was not limited in performing her work duties by her foot condition. Further, Joseph failed to demonstrate that the Hospital perceived her as suffering from a disability, as her doctors\u2019 communications to the Hospital indicate no more than that she was suffering from foot pain and therefore could not wear stockings. <em>See Colwell v. Suffolk Cnty. Police </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>Dep\u2019t, </em>158 F.3d 635, 646 (2d Cir.1998) (requiring showing that employer regarded plaintiff as having \u201can impairment that substantially limited a major life activity\u201d). We therefore find no error in the granting of summary judgment to the Hospital on Joseph\u2019s ADA claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We next conclude that Joseph failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination on the basis of her national origin. Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework applicable to Title VII claims, a plaintiff must first demonstrate a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by showing that: 1) she was in a protected group; 2) she was qualified for the position; 3) she was subject to an adverse employment action; and 4) the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. <em>See Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137-38 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Collins v. N.Y. City Trans. Auth., </em>305 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir.2002). Joseph principally cited as evidence of discrimination on the basis of her Haitian origin an August 14, 2007 disciplinary notice reprimanding her for speaking in her native French in violation of the Hospital\u2019s policy to speak English in the office unless the employee was assisting a patient who spoke another language. However, Joseph adduced no evidence to support her claim that other employees were permitted to speak Spanish in the workplace without being disciplined and thus no evidence that she was treated differently by the Hospital because of her Haitian origin. <em>See Soberal-Perez v. Heckler, </em>717 F.2d 36, 42 (2d Cir.1983) (observing that a policy having a preference for English over all other languages is not evidence of discriminatory intent). Accordingly, the magistrate judge did not err in granting summary judgment to the Hospital on Joseph\u2019s discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Finally, we conclude that Joseph did not establish a claim for a hostile work environment based on either disability or national origin discrimination. Harassment is actionable when it creates a hostile work environment which is \u201cso severely permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that the terms and conditions of [plaintiffs] employment were thereby altered.\u201d <em>Alfano v. Costello, </em>294 F.3d 365, 373 (2d Cir.2002). The record is devoid of evidence suggesting that Joseph was disabled within the meaning of the ADA, or that she was ridiculed or harassed because of an alleged disability. Nor does the record support a claim that Joseph was discriminated against on the basis of her Haitian origin or that she was harassed or ridiculed on this basis. <em>See Brennan v. Metro. Opera Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>192 F.3d 310, 318 (2d Cir.1999) (\u201cA plaintiff must also demonstrate that she was subjected to the hostility because of her membership in a protected class.\u201d). Consequently, the magistrate judge did not err in rejecting this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be moot, waived, or 2 without merit. <em>See Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 1998). The judgment of the 3 district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-14\">. The parties consented to the magistrate judge's exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b68-5\">. Although Joseph indicated that she had some difficulty standing, standing was not considered a \"major life activity\u201d under the prior version of the regulations applicable here. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2 (1991) (\u201cMajor Life Activities means functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b69-6\">. Because Joseph has not established that she is a person with a disability within the meaning of the ADA, her failure to accommodate claim against the Hospital also fails. <em>See McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., Inc., </em>583 F.3d 92, 96-97 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
