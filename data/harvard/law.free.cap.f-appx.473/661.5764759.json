R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Charles Mark Rousseau, a native and citizen of Indonesia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, and we review de novo the agency\u2019s legal determinations. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Rousseau established changed circumstances to excuse his untimely asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4). Accordingly, his asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Rousseau\u2019s experiences with militant Muslims and the Indonesian police, cumulatively considered, rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir.2006) (Eritrean government\u2019s seizure of father\u2019s business, along with some degree of social ostracism, did not rise to the level of persecution); <em>Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 975-76 (9th Cir.2009) (incidents suffered by ethnic Chinese petitioner in Indonesia, considered in the aggregate, did not amount to persecution). Further, even under a disfavored group analysis, the record does not compel the conclusion that Rousseau established a clear probability of persecution, because he did not demonstrate sufficient individualized risk. <em>See Halim, </em>590 F.3d at 977-80; <em>Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1066 (\u201c[a]n applicant for withholding of removal will need to adduce a considerably larger quantum of individualized-risk evidence\u201d). Accordingly, Rousseau\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Rousseau failed to show it is more likely than not he will be tortured with the consent or acquiescence of the government if returned to Indonesia. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
