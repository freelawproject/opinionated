Vaughn, convicted of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, argued in that motion that he was entitled to a reduction in sentence pursuant to Amendment 750 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Reviewing the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, we affirm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). In 2008 Vaughn had successfully argued that he was entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction pursuant to Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Our review of the entire record, including the original sentencing and the prior \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, establishes that on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) review, the career offender offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1 was greater than the amended cocaine base level under \u00a7 2D1.1. As such, Vaughn was entitled only to a reduction within the career offender range. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>596 F.3d 273, 276-77 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 93, 178 L.Ed.2d 58 (2010); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). Application of the career offender Guideline for purposes of the instant motion resulted in the same guideline range applicable in Vaughn\u2019s earlier \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table). Consequently, Vaughn was ineligible for a reduction in sentence based on Amendment 750 because the amendment did not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">To the extent that Vaughn argues in his reply brief that he should not have received a two-level enhancement for possessing a firearm, that issue is waived. <em>See United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379, 1386 (5th Cir.1989). Finally, to the extent Vaughn argues that the district court otherwise had the discretion to resentence him to a lesser sentence, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resentencings. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The principles of Booker<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and its progeny do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and a sentencing court lacks discretion to reduce the sentence any further than the reduction allowed under \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>Id:, Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
