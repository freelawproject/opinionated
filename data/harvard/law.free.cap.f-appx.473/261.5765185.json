The Desouzas provide no argument in their informal briefs addressing the district court\u2019s dis-positive holding that their complaint failed to state a claim. Because we confine our review to the issues raised in the informal brief, <em>see </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b), the Desouzas have forfeited appellate review of the district court\u2019s dismissal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-22\">Turning to the appeal of the court\u2019s order granting reconsideration and revoking IFP status, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. The district court\u2019s certification that the appeal of the dismissal order is taken in bad faith controls in the absence of a showing that the district court itself made the determination in bad faith. <em>See Maloney v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>396 F.2d 939, 940 (D.C.Cir.1967). Because the Desouzas have failed to demonstrate on appeal that the certification itself was taken in bad faith, we conclude the certification is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-23\">Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed IFP and dismiss the appeals for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Desouza v. First Mount Vernon ILA, </em>No. 1:11-cv-00845-AJT-TRJ (E.D. Va. Oct. 21, 2011; filed Feb. 1, 2012, and entered Feb. 2, 2012). We deny as moot FMV\u2019s motion to dismiss and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
