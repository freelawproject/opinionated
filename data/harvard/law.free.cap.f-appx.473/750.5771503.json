We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s summary judgment and its grant of a motion to dismiss. <em>Doe v. Abbott Labs., </em>571 F.3d 930, 933 (9th Cir.2009). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-21\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Endsley\u2019s substantive due process claim because Endsley failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the denial of his requests for a personal computer was reasonably related to the legitimate, non-punitive governmental interests of safety and security. <em>See Jones v. Blanas, </em>393 F.3d 918, 931-32 (9th Cir.2004) (consistent with substantive due process, civilly committed individuals are subject to \u201c[Ilegit\u00edmate, non-punitive government interests,\u201d such as facility management and security); <em>Valdez v. Rosenbaum, </em>302 F.3d 1039, 1046 (9th Cir. 2002) (\u201cA reasonable relationship between the governmental interest and the challenged restriction does not require ... showing a \u2018least restrictive alternative.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-22\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Endsley\u2019s equal protection claim because Endsley failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether he was treated differently from other similarly situated individuals. <em>See Nelson v. City of Irvine, </em>143 F.3d 1196, 1205 (9th Cir.1998) (alleged disparities in treatment arising from different agencies\u2019 policies did not establish equal protection claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-23\">The district court properly dismissed Endsley\u2019s .inadequate mental health treatment claim because Endsley failed to allege facts sufficient to show that the denial of a personal computer resulted in constitutionally inadequate treatment. <em>See Sharp v. Weston, </em>233 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2000) (civilly committed individuals have a constitutional right to \u201caccess to mental health treatment that gives them a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>realistic opportunity to be cured and released\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Endsley\u2019s motion to compel documents concerning contraband found at the hospital. <em>See Hallett v. Morgan, </em>296 F.3d 732, 751 (9th Cir.2002) (setting forth standard of review and describing district court\u2019s broad discretion to permit or deny discovery).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Endsley\u2019s remaining contentions, including those regarding the denial of joinder of another defendant, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">We do not consider matters not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the opening brief. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b782-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
