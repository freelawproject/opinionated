R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b741-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-16\">Glenn Litwak appeals from the Tax Court\u2019s decision after a bench trial, upholding the Commissioner of Internal Revenue\u2019s (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) determination to reject Litwak\u2019s offer-in-compromise and collect on his unpaid tax liabilities for tax years 2000, 2001, and 2002. We have jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). We review de novo the Tax Court\u2019s conclusions, and for an abuse of discretion the Commissioner\u2019s rejection of an offer-incompromise. <em>Keller v. Comm\u2019r, </em>568 F.3d 710, 716 (9th Cir.2009). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-20\">The Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in rejecting as inadequate Litwak\u2019s offer-in-compromise because Litwak failed to establish that special circumstances existed to support his offer to pay less than the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) could collect if he filed for bankruptcy. <em>See id. </em>at 717-18 &amp; n. 8 (listing \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d that must be present for IRS to accept an offer that is less than the taxpayer\u2019s \u201creasonable collection potential\u201d); <em>see also Fargo v. Comm\u2019r, </em>447 F.3d 706, 710-12 (9th Cir.2006) (IRS has discretion to decide whether to reject an offer-incompromise after evaluating all facts and circumstances). Moreover, the Commissioner\u2019s error in determining which of Litwak\u2019s outstanding tax liabilities would be dischargeable in bankruptcy was harmless because Litwak failed to show that the error affected the determination that he could still afford to pay more than his offer. <em>See Keller, </em>568 F.3d at 718 (taxpayers relying on miscalculations must demonstrate that, allowing for the errors, their offers do not remain below their ability to pay).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-21\">Litwak\u2019s remaining contentions, including arguments raised for the first time on appeal, are unpersuasive. <em>See id. </em>(reviewing court is confined to the record at the time the IRS rendered its decision); <em>McFarland v. Guardsmark, LLC, </em>588 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>1236, 1236 (9th Cir.2009) (order) (issues raised for the first time on appeal need not be considered).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Litwak\u2019s request for judicial notice is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b741-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
