The district court denied relief on three claims. The court construed the fourth claim, in which Fincher sought retroactive application of a recent amendment to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, as an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2006) motion for reduction of sentence. The court denied that motion. Fincher now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-20\">With respect to the \u00a7 2255 claims, the district court\u2019s order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2006). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595. We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Fincher has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The district court denied relief on the \u00a7 3582(c) motion because Amendment 748 to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines had not been declared retroactive at the time the court issued its order. Amendment 750, the successor to Amendment 748, became retroactive effective November 11, 2011. In light of this development, and in order to give Fincher the ability to raise his claim in a separate \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, this portion of the district court\u2019s order is modified to reflect that the motion is dismissed without prejudice to Fincher\u2019s right to file another \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. With this modification, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
