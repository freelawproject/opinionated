We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm, but remand to correct the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-21\">Armenta-Moroyoqui contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to consider the reason for an alleged sentencing disparity with a co-defendant, by failing to appreciate fully its discretion to vary below the Guidelines range based on a policy disagreement, and by failing adequately to explain its exercise of that discretion. The district court did not procedurally err. The record reflects that the district court considered the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, as well as Armenta-Moroyoqui\u2019s arguments in mitigation, and adequately explained its decision not to grant a variance below the Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 992-93 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-22\">We remand the case to the district court with instructions that it amend the judgment to reflect that the second charge to which Armenta-Moroyoqui pled guilty is possession with intent to distribute at least 1,000 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-23\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED to correct the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
