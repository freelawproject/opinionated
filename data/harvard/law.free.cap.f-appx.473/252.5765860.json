We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S. Ct. 2360,168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on December 20, 2011. Accordingly, the latest day for filing a timely notice of appeal was Thursday, January 19, 2012. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(1). Northrup\u2019s notice of appeal, however, was not received for filing until Friday, January 20, 2012. Because Northrup failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we are constrained to dismiss the appeal as untimely. We also deny leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
