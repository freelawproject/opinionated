He argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in that he failed to present mitigating evidence and seek a lesser sentence on the following grounds: (1) he met the safety valve requirements; (2) he was willing to stipulate that he was deportable; and (3) the district court had discretion to impose a sentence below the advisory guidelines range under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Spears v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 261, 129 S.Ct. 840, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">\u201c[T]he general rule in this circuit is that a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087,1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because we conclude that \u201cwe cannot fairly evaluate the claim from the record,\u201d we decline to consider Pedrizco Gutierrez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim on appeal without prejudice to his right to raise his claim in a timely 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See United States v. Gulley, </em>526 F.3d 809, 821 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
