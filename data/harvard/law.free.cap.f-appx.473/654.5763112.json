We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law and review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Jap did not experience harms in Indonesia amounting to past persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1059-60; <em>see also Khourassany v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 1096, 1100-1101 (9th Cir.2000) (petitioner failed to establish past persecution based on harassment and forced closure of business). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Jap failed to establish it is more likely than not she will be persecuted if returned to Indonesia, because, even as a member of a disfavored group, Jap has not demonstrated the requisite individualized risk of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179,1185 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1066 (\u201c[a]n applicant for withholding of removal will need to adduce a considerably larger quantum of individualized-risk evidence\u201d). Further, Jap has not established a pattern or practice of persecution of people similarly situated to her. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1060-62. Accordingly, Jap\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Jap failed to establish it is more likely than not she will be tortured if returned to Indonesia. <em>See id. </em>at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Finally, we reject Jap\u2019s contention that the IJ failed to consider the country conditions materials, because she has not overcome the presumption the agency reviewed the record. <em>See Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095-96 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b686-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
