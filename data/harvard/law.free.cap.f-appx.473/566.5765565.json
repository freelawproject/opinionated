We disagree. Absent an exception, the law of the case doctrine applies. <em>See Old Person v. Brown, </em>312 F.3d 1036, 1039 (9th Cir. 2002); <em>Jeffries v. Wood, </em>114 F.3d 1484, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>1489 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>389 F.3d 944, 948-49 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam); <em>Beecher v. Leavenworth State Bank, </em>209 F.2d 20, 22 (9th Cir.1953). Of course, we agree that we can decline to apply that doctrine when there is clear error and manifest injustice,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or where there has been \u201cintervening controlling authority\u201d that changed the law. <em>Old Person, </em>312 F.3d at 1039; <em>see also Jeffries, </em>114 F.3d at 1489.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">(2) Price, in effect, asserts that the law of the case doctrine should not apply because the prior residual functional capacity determination was clearly erroneous. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Price claims that the decision was based, in part, on determinations regarding medical evidence that were clearly erroneous. We have reviewed the record and are satisfied that the ALJ\u2019s characterization of those sources as examining physicians was not clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">We also agree with the district court that there have not been intervening changes in the law that require a refusal to follow law of the case doctrine. Price refers to a Social Security Ruling,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but that was simply intended to clarify, not substantially change,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the law; as before, each case must simply be \u201cadjudicated on its own merits\u201d upon \u201cweighing of all the evidence in [the] particular case.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ALJ had done precisely that. Similarly, <em>while </em>we have issued a number of opinions dealing with harmless error,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> they have made no change that would cause us to deny application of the law of the case. Indeed, the case that Price most heavily relies upon pointed out that its \u201cconclusion is consistent with our prior harmless error cases in this area.\u201d <em>Stout, </em>454 F.3d at 1056. In fine, the law of the case doctrine was properly applied, and there was no error in treating Price\u2019s residual functional capacity as established.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">(3) Price asserts that the ALJ erred in her determination at Step 5 that there were significant numbers of jobs in the national economy that Price could perform. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1569, 404.1569a(a), 416.969, 416.969a(a). Again, we disagree. Essentially, Price asserts that the ALJ erred because the vocational expert answered a hypothetical, which included Price\u2019s reaching limitations, in a way that violated the provisions of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, but, in fact, there was no inconsistency. The vocational expert was well aware of the reaching limitations and upon specific questioning by the ALJ testified that they were within the classifications in the Dictionary. <em>See Massachi v. Astrue, </em>486 F.3d 1149, 1152 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Johnson v. Shalala, </em>60 F.3d 1428, 1435-36 (9th Cir.1995). We detect no error in the vocational expert\u2019s testimony or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ALJ\u2019s determination in that respect. Thus, the ALJ did not err in determining that Price was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">(4) Price also argues that the first ALJ\u2019s determination regarding Price\u2019s ability to perform past relevant work (library technician) was clearly erroneous. Even if that is so, an issue we do not decide, we need not consider it because the determination of nondisability at Step 5 makes any error at Step 4 harmless. <em>See Tommasetti v. Astrue, </em>533 F.3d 1035, 1042 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b599-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
