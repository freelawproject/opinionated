June 16, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A095 370 353 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 18, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-23\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). Because the BIA declined to address the IJ\u2019s credibility determination and found that even assuming Sulollari\u2019s credibility, the government had demonstrated a fundamental change in country conditions, we address only the agency\u2019s dispositive future persecution finding. <em>See Aliyev v. Mukasey, </em>549 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir.2008) (assuming credibility when the BIA does not affirm the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination); <em>see also Yang, </em>426 F.3d at 522. We conclude that the agency reasonably found that Sulollari failed to demonstrate that he would suffer any harm if returned to Albania. <em>See Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179,187 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The government may rebut a finding of past persecution, and the resulting presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, by showing a fundamental change in conditions in the country where the petitioner suffered past persecution such that the applicant\u2019s fear of persecution is no longer well-founded. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1); <em>Niang v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 138, 148 (2d Cir.2007). Sulollari\u2019s application is based on his membership in the Democratic Party (\u201cDP\u201d) and his fear of harm at the hands of members of the Socialist Party (\u201cSP\u201d), who were in control of the local and national government of Albania when Sulollari applied for asylum in 2002. Given the fundamental change in Albania\u2014namely the DP\u2019s 2005 takeover of the government\u2014 Sulollari had the burden to establish that he has a well-founded fear of harm at the hands of the government, now controlled by the DP. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1); <em>see also Hoxhallari </em>468 F.3d at 187-88 (concluding that alien\u2019s fear of future persecution based on his affiliation with the DP was not well-founded in light of the \u201cfundamental change in the political structure and government of Albania\u201d). Sulollari argues that he fears harm if returned to Albania due to local police corruption and his previous DP activities, but he has not identified any evidence that the local police force is SP-aligned or that DP activists have been persecuted by the local police. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). Moreover, Sulollari failed to demonstrate that he could not relocate to a DP-controlled area; the agency reasonably found DP-led government controls the security apparatus throughout Albania. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Because the agency reasonably found that there had been a fundamental change in Albania and that Sulollari had not otherwise shown a well-founded fear of harm, the agency did not err in denying asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because all three claims were based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148,156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2) and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
