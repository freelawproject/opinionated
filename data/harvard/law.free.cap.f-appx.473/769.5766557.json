It further found that this seizure was unreasonable because Silva, as a Deputy Animal Control Officer within the Yavapai County Sheriffs Office, lacked the authority to conduct an arrest. Although Silva was not authorized under Arizona law to arrest Saunders, \u201cstate restrictions [on arrest authority] do not alter the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections.\u201d <em>Virginia v. Moore, </em>553 U.S. 164, 176, 128 S.Ct. 1598, 170 L.Ed.2d 559 (2008). To constitute a Fourth Amendment violation, an arrest by a state officer must be unreasonable under the United States Constitution, rather than simply not in compliance with state laws. <em>See United States v. Becerra-Garcia, </em>397 F.3d 1167, 1174-75 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">In general, the \u201cconstitutionality of a warrantless arrest is determined by the existence of probable cause.\u201d <em>Barry v. Fowler, </em>902 F.2d 770, 772 (9th Cir.1990). In this case, Silva observed, at Saunders\u2019 residence, animals with no water and animals that Saunders was not permitted to possess under the terms of her probation agreement. Probable cause exists when \u201cthe facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge are sufficient to warrant a prudent person to believe that the suspect has committed ... an offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 773 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Based on Silva\u2019s observations, he had sufficient cause to believe that Saunders had committed a misdemeanor violation of Arizona\u2019s animal control law. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-2910(A)(1). \u201cIf an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed even a very minor criminal offense in his presence, he may, without violating the Fourth Amendment, arrest the offender.\u201d <em>Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, </em>532 U.S. 318, 354, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001). Silva\u2019s arrest of Saunders, although outside of the scope of his authority, was supported by probable cause, and thus the mere fact of her arrest did not violate the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">Although \u201c[a]n otherwise lawful seizure can violate the Fourth Amendment if it is executed in an unreasonable manner,\u201d <em>United States v. Alverez-Tejeda, </em>491 F.3d 1013, 1016 (9th Cir.2007), the district court did not consider whether the manner in which Saunders was seized was unreasonable, and the Appellee did not raise this argument on appeal. We therefore do not consider any other potential sources of unreasonableness and hold that Silva\u2019s seizure of Saunders, supported by probable cause, was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. We reverse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>judgment of the district court and remand for the entry of judgment in favor of Silva.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b802-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
