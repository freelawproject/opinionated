He raises a single issue on appeal: whether the magistrate judge erred as a matter of law when he failed to construe a pro se filing, styled as a Rule 60(b) motion, as Johnson\u2019s attempt to amend his pending habeas petition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-21\">Johnson filed a pro se motion in August 2005 (the \u201cAugust motion\u201d) when his habeas petition was pending. Johnson styled that document as a \u201cMotion for Relief From Judgment/Vacate Judgment F.R.C.P. 60(b)(1)(2)(3)(4)(6) Void Judgment (Fraud) Vacate State Judgment F.R.C.P. 60(b)(H) Brady.\u201d In it, Johnson reiterated at least one argument from his habeas petition and raised additional instances of ineffective assistance of counsel. He also asserted that DNA evidence recovered at the scene did not point to him, and attached an earlier motion from his state appellate counsel that faulted his trial counsel for withdrawing a \u201cheat of passion\u201d defense. Johnson asked the district court \u201cto rule on this motion 60(b) before it rules on the writ of habeas corpus.\u201d The magistrate judge denied the August motion on March 3, 2006, explaining that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) was an inappropriate vehicle to challenge a state court conviction. The magistrate judge noted, however, that \u201cpetitioner [would] be permitted to proceed with [his] habeas action in which he challenges the state court judgment of conviction on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Johnson requested reconsideration on April 19, 2006, but the district court rejected that request as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-22\">A party who \u201cfails to file timely objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s nondispositive order with the district judge to whom the case is assigned forfeits its right to appellate review of that order.\u201d <em>Simpson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number><em>Lear Astronics Corp., </em>77 F.3d 1170, 1174 (9th Cir.1996); <em>see also Glenbrook Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>425 F.3d 611, 619 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that appeal of a discovery denial was foreclosed by parties\u2019 failure to object to a magistrate\u2019s order within' the specified time). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a) requires a district court to consider any timely objections to a magistrate\u2019s order on a nondispositive motion and \u201cmodify or set aside any part of the order that is clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.\u201d It cautions that a party \u201cmay not assign as error\u201d a defect not objected to in a timely manner. Because Johnson did not timely object to the magistrate\u2019s order in district court, he has forfeited his right to appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">Johnson alternatively contends that his August motion was really a motion to amend. A motion to amend is also nondispositive. <em>U.S. Dominator, Inc. v. Factory Ship Robert E. Resoff, </em>768 F.2d 1099, 1102 n. 1 (9th Cir.1985) superseded by rule on other grounds as recognized in <em>Simpson, </em>77 F.3d at 1174 (noting that a motion for leave to amend was properly treated as nondispositive). Thus, even if the magistrate should have characterized the August motion in the manner Johnson suggests, Johnson\u2019s failure to timely seek review again forecloses review.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Johnson reliance on <em>Robbins v. Carey, </em>481 F.3d 1143, 1147 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Martinez v. Ylst, </em>951 F.2d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.1991); and <em>Pollard v. GEO, Inc., </em>629 F.3d 843, 853 (9th Cir.2010), is misplaced because each of those cases involved a party\u2019s failure to object to a magistrate\u2019s recommendation on a dispositive matter, not a nondispositive order. None of these cases discuss appellate review of a magistrate\u2019s determination of non-dispositive issues of law without prior review by the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b818-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
