Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 161.405, 163.115, and 161.610. Notwithstanding the deferential standard of review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), the district court held that Beck was denied effective assistance of counsel when Beck\u2019s trial counsel failed to move for a competency hearing before allowing Beck to plead guilty, and that Beck was denied due process when the trial court did not sua sponte order such a hearing. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The district court erred in holding that the state court\u2019s determination that Beck\u2019s trial counsel was not ineffective was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Based on the transcript and the trial counsel\u2019s affidavit, the state court could reasonably determine that Beck had \u201c(1) a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him, and (2) sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\u201d <em>Stanley v. Cullen, </em>633 F.3d 852, 860 (9th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960) (per curiam)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even assuming that the district court properly considered the Pre-Sentence Report and the psychological evaluation, Beck has failed to present evidence showing that trial counsel\u2019s performance was so clearly ineffective under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), that no fair-minded jurist could agree with the state court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary. See <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The district court also erred in its holding that there was no reasonable basis to support the state court\u2019s rejection of Beck\u2019s due process claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The state post-conviction review court held that there was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to raise a \u201cbona fide doubt\u201d as to Beck\u2019s competence to stand trial. <em>See Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 385, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966). The record supports that conclusion, even considering all the information then available to the trial court, and Beck has therefore not shown that the state court\u2019s determination was so objectively unreasonable that habeas relief is warranted. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409-10, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions to DENY the application for federal habeas relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b747-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
