We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">In his amended complaint, Nitz alleged that employees of the Illinois River Correctional Center and Illinois Department of Corrections violated his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment when they confiscated DVDs that had been mailed to him by his former appointed counsel in <em>Nitz v. Doe, </em>No. 08-cv-0334 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 15, 2008), a civil case in which he was now proceeding pro se. Nitz alleged that the prison employees had opened, outside of his presence, his legal mail (clearly labeled as such, he says) including legal documents and at least four DVDs depicting video surveillance related to his criminal cases. According to the complaint, Nitz informed prison employees that he needed the DVDs to proceed in the pending litigation, but the employees took the DVDs as contraband and refused to provide accurate \u201cshakedown slips\u201d inventorying the number of DVDs taken. As a result of the employees\u2019 actions, Nitz says, his petition for review of his state criminal conviction was denied, <em>see People v. Nitz, </em>No. 11-1456, 239 Ill.2d 576, 348 Ill.Dec. 196, 943 N.E.2d 1106 (Ill.2011); his civil case in <em>Nitz v. Harvey, </em>No. 09-cv-0015 (N.D.Ill. July 27, 2009), was dismissed; summary judgment was granted for two defendants in <em>Nitz v. Doe, </em>No. 08-cv-0334 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 18 and 22, 2010); and his social security disability appeal was denied. He further alleged that prison employees intentionally \u201cmessed up\u201d legal copies by copying only one side of two-sided documents and refused to provide him with the original materials; that prison grievance officers \u201crefused to investigate\u201d grievances he had filed against prison library staff; and that his former parole officer thwarted his success in his criminal and civil cases by neither testifying on his behalf nor providing exculpatory evidence. Nitz requested access to an unidentified \u201coriginal source\u201d of the DVDs.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">At screening, the district court dismissed Nitz\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1). According to the court, Nitz\u2019s allegations regarding the confiscation of his legal materials did not state a claim because he did not allege prejudice; he did not allege that he had been prevented from pursuing non-frivolous claims in any of his pending lawsuits. As for the claim at the center of this appeal\u2014the denial of due process resulting from the confiscation of legal materials in <em>Nitz v. </em>Doe\u2014the court determined that there was no injury because the DVDs were irrelevant to the dismissal of the two defendants in that case\u2014a police detective who, Nitz claimed, retaliated against him for filing a prior lawsuit; and the City of Wheaton, which was said to have had a practice of permitting its police officers to use excessive force. Nitz\u2019s remaining allegations, the court concluded, did not state claims of constitutional violations. In dismissing Nitz\u2019s complaint, the court imposed one \u201cstrike,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1915(g). The court also dismissed Nitz\u2019s claim against the parole officer without prejudice due to improper venue, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1391(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">On appeal, Nitz primarily challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that he did not adequately allege harm from the confiscation of legal materials as they pertained to his suit in <em>Nitz v. Doe </em>against the police detective and the City of Wheaton. Without these materials, he asserts generally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>he was \u201cprevented\u201d from pursuing arguments that \u201cwould have caused him to prevail\u201d at summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We agree with the district court that Nitz\u2019s complaint failed to state a denial-of-access claim. To state such a claim, Nitz had to allege an actual injury, <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 353, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996)\u2014in other words, explaining \u201cthe connection between the alleged denial of access to legal materials and an inability to pursue a legitimate challenge to a conviction, sentence, or prison conditions,\u201d <em>Ortiz v. Downey, </em>561 F.3d 664, 671 (7th Cir.2009) (internal quotation and citation omitted). He alleged that the prison prevented him from effectively litigating actions that were pending, but the right of access protects prisoners from \u201cbeing shut out of court,\u201d <em>Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415,122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002); it does-not exist to \u201cenable the prisoners ... to <em>litigate effectively </em>once in court,\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>518 U.S. at 354, 116 S.Ct. 2174 (emphasis in original); <em>see Marshall v. Knight, </em>445 F.3d 965, 968 (7th Cir.2006); <em>accord Williams v. Hobbs, </em>658 F.3d 842, 852 (8th Cir.2011). Because Nitz never alleged that confiscation of legal materials hindered his ability to bring suit against the police detective and the City of Wheaton, the district court properly dismissed his denial-of-access claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Nitz has now accrued at least three strikes under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g): one for the dismissal of his complaint in <em>Nitz v. Birkette, </em>No. 11-C-0044, 2011 WL 893035 (N.D.Ill. Mar. 11, 2011); a second for the dismissal of his complaint in this case, <em>Nitz v. Hall, </em>No. 11-1143 (N.D. Ill. June 16, 2011); and a third for this frivolous appeal, <em>see Hains v. Washington, </em>131 F.3d 1248, 1250 (7th Cir.1997). Accordingly, he is barred from bringing civil suits in forma pauperis. In any future civil action, he must alert the court to his three-strike status and prepay all filing fees unless he can demonstrate, at the time of filing, that he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>Ammons v. Gerlinger, </em>547 F.3d 724, 725 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The judgment is AFFIRMED. Nitz\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is DENIED. (We had provisionally granted his motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal on the condition that he persuade us that the district court erred in imposing a strike below, <em>see Turley v. Gaetz, </em>625 F.3d 1005, 1013 (7th Cir.2010); he has failed to do so.) Now he must pay the full filing fee for this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
