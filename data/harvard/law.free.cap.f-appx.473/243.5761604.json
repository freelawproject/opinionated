Simmons pleaded guilty, without a plea agreement, to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) (2006). The district court sentenced Simmons to eighty-four months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. On appeal, Simmons\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>886 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which she states that she can find no meritorious issues for appeal. Counsel seeks our review of the district court\u2019s compliance with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 and the reasonableness of Simmons\u2019 sentence. Finding no reversible error on either of those fronts, or other meritorious issue elsewhere in the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">This Court requires that counsel inform Simmons, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Simmons requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this Court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Simmons.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
