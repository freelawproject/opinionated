The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) did not err in finding that Hernandez was statutorily ineligible for an adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255. Because Hernandez entered the United States illegally, he does not meet the requirement of \u00a7 1255(a) that an alien be \u201cinspected and admitted or paroled\u201d into the country. Hernandez does not otherwise qualify as having been \u201cgrandfathered\u201d into the statute. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10; <em>Landin-Molina v. Holder, </em>580 F.3d 913, 915-17 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-24\">2. Hernandez was also not eligible for <em>nunc pro tunc </em>permission to reapply for admission. Because Hernandez illegally returned to the United States and remained in the country after having been deported, the BIA properly concluded that he was among a class of \u201cillegal entrants\u201d who were \u201cinadmissible for being present without admission or parole.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-26\">3. The BIA did not err in finding Hernandez had failed to establish extraordinary circumstances excusing his untimely filing as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). The failure of the border officials to refer him to an asylum officer or immigration judge in 2007, two years before his most recent reentry, does not rise to the level of an extraordinary circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-28\">Similarly, the officers\u2019 actions did not constitute affirmative misconduct which \u2022 would subject the government to equitable estoppel. Hernandez must show more than official negligence, and nothing in the record suggests the officers engaged in a \u201cdeliberate lie\u201d or \u201cpattern of false promises.\u201d <em>See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1184 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-29\">4. We lack jurisdiction to consider Hernandez\u2019s contention that the immigration judge violated his right to due process and confrontation of witnesses. Hernandez\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>counsel waived the claim before the IJ and also failed to exhaust the issue before the BIA. <em>Barron v.
