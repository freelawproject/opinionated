We have reviewed the administrative record and Lewis\u2019s contentions and find that we lack jurisdiction to review his claims. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D) (2006); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2006); <em>Mosere v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 397, 400-01 (4th Cir.2009). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Lewis </em>(B.I.A. Oct. 21, 2011). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-24\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
