R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Eddie Ray Hall appeals from his guilty-plea conviction and 195-month sentence for distribution of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Hall contends that the district court\u2019s advisement that Hall retained the right to appeal any sentence of more than 15 years was inconsistent with the terms of the appeal waiver in his plea agreement, rendering his guilty plea involuntary and unknowing in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b). He seeks reversal of his conviction, vacation of his sentence, and remand for rehearing on the plea agreement. While a district court\u2019s oral advisement regarding appeal rights can supersede the terms of a written appeal waiver, the remedy for such a misstatement is not vacation of the conviction and sentence, but non-enforcement of the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d 914, 917-18 (9th Cir.1995). We need not decide whether the district court expanded Hall\u2019s right to appeal through its statements at his change-of-plea hearing because Hall raises no challenge to his conviction or sentence apart from the alleged infirmities in the district court\u2019s advisements regarding the appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b629-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
