On appeal, he contends that the district court erred in its drug quantity relevant conduct findings against him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-20\">We review the district court\u2019s drug quantity findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Slade, </em>631 F.3d 185, 188 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2943, 180 L.Ed.2d 234 (2011). We will reverse these findings \u201conly if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Jeffers, </em>570 F.3d 557, 570 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cNeither the Guidelines nor the courts have required precise calculations of drug quantity.\u201d <em>United States v. Uwaeme, </em>975 F.2d 1016, 1019 (4th Cir. 1992); <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 12 (2010). The district court \u201cmust only determine that it was more likely than not that the defendant was responsible for <em>at least </em>the drug quantity attributed to him.\u201d <em>United States v. Kiulin, </em>360 F.3d 456, 461 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-23\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Barrett was responsible for at least two kilograms of cocaine. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
