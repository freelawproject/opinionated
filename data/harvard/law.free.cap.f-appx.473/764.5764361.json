Because the district court certified its judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-17\">1. The district court correctly rejected plaintiffs\u2019 Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) claim that HUD, in violation of its statutory and regulatory authority, required the use of wooden foundations in the construction of plaintiffs\u2019 houses. Civil actions against federal agencies must be \u201cfiled within six years after the right of action first accrues,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a); a substantive challenge to an agency decision as beyond its authority accrues when the disputed decision is first \u201cappli[ed] ... to the challenger,\u201d <em>Wind River Mining Corp. v. United States, </em>946 F.2d 710, 715-16 (9th Cir.1991). Plaintiffs\u2019 claim against HUD accrued in the late 1970s, when the agency purportedly decided to require wooden foundations. At that time, plaintiffs knew about the decision and knew that it affected them. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 715 (agency action not immune from review simply because it occurred \u201clong before anyone discovered the true state of affairs\u201d); <em>N. Cnty. Cmty. Alliance, Inc. v. Salazar, </em>573 F.3d 738, 743 (9th Cir.2009) (allowing challenge to 14-year-old agency action to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>ceed where plaintiffs could not have known it would affect them until shortly before filing suit). That plaintiffs may not have immediately grasped the full impact that HUD\u2019s decision might eventually have on them does not mean they knew too little in 1980 to bring an APA challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">2. The district court also correctly rejected plaintiffs\u2019 claim that HUD wrongly denied, or failed to respond to, various requests made by individual homeowners and by their Indian housing authority for HUD\u2019s assistance in repairing and maintaining the houses. Agency inaction can support a claim under the APA, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1), but only where the action is \u201clegally <em>required.\u201d Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, </em>542 U.S. 55, 64-65, 124 S.Ct. 2373, 159 L.Ed.2d 137 (2004) (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs identified several instances in which HUD officials were alerted to the problems plaintiffs face as a result of the wooden foundations used in the construction of their homes, but no instances in which HUD failed to comply with a specific obligation imposed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b796-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
