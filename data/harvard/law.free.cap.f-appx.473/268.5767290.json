We have reviewed the administrative record and conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Sillah\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2011). We accordingly deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In Re: Sillah </em>(B.I.A. Oct. 31, 2011). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-25\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
