England and his wife, Julianna England, brought suit under \u00a7 1983 against Jennings, Clark, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, and several unnamed defendants (collectively, \u201cLas Vegas\u201d), raising federal claims for violations of \u00a7 1983, and state claims for negligence, assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, <em>respondeat superior </em>for torts, loss of consortium, and negligent hiring, retention, training, and supervision. The district court granted Las Vegas\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all of the Englands\u2019 claims. In a separate order, the magistrate judge imposed sanctions on England because he failed to appear for his deposition. The Englands appeal both the summary judgment order and the imposition of sanctions. We affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment order in part, reverse in part, and vacate in part; we affirm the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Because this case comes to us on Las Vegas\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the Englands and, where disputed issues of material fact exist, assume the version of the material facts asserted by the Englands to be correct. <em>See Mattos v. Agarano, </em>661 F.3d 433, 439 (9th Cir.2011) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2682, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2012), \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2681, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - ( 2012), - U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2682, - L.Ed.2d - (2012), - U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2684, - L.Ed.2d - (2012). Because England chose not to appear for his deposition, we are left with his March 26, 2007 written statement, which was adopted in his answer to interrogatories without objection by the defendants, as his version of the events. England\u2019s version of the incident differs substantially from that of Jennings in many important respects, including England\u2019s demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">1. We conclude that, based on England\u2019s limited version of events, there are material issues of fact on the present record as to whether Jennings\u2019s conduct constituted excessive force. According to England\u2019s version of the events, Jennings struck England with his baton three times as a result of England\u2019s behavior near a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint. If England\u2019s version of the events is true, a jury could find that Jennings did not have sufficient reason, under the circumstances, to use the force that he did. <em>See Young v. County of Los Angeles, </em>655 F.3d 1156, 1166-67 (9th Cir.2011); <em>Smith v. City of Hemet, </em>394 F.3d 689, 703 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">We also hold that, based on England\u2019s version of the facts before us, there is a material issue as to whether existing case law would have put Jennings on notice that his alleged actions constituted a Fourth Amendment violation. When the incident at issue occurred, baton use had already been recognized as a form of intermediate force. <em>See Headwaters Forest Def. v. County of Humboldt, </em>240 F.3d 1185, 1196 (9th Cir.2000), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>534 U.S. 801, 122 S.Ct. 24, 151 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001); <em>see also Young, </em>655 F.3d at 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">2. We also conclude that a material issue of fact exists on the present record as to whether Officer Clark acted reasonably as a matter of law. Adopting England\u2019s limited version of the events, and drawing all inferences in his favor, a reasonable jury could conclude that Clark\u2019s second and third tases exceeded the amount of force justified under the circumstances. See <em>Mattos, </em>661 F.3d at 445-46. At the time the incident occurred, however, the law governing taser usage was not yet clearly defined. <em>See id. </em>at 448; <em>Bryan v. MacPherson, </em>630 F.3d 805, 833 (9th Cir.2010). We therefore agree with the district court that Clark is entitled to qualified immunity under the second prong of <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151,150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">3. The district court relied on its excessive force decision in resolving the Eng-lands\u2019 negligence, assault and battery, <em>respondeat superior </em>for torts, and loss of consortium claims. Because we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment with regard to the excessive force issue on the current record, we vacate its resolution of these claims. We affirm, for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion, the grant of summary judgment against the Englands\u2019 \u00a7 1983 municipal liability, \u00a7 1983 conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent hiring, retention, training, and supervision claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-16\">4. Finally, we conclude that the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>when he sanctioned England for failing to appear at his deposition. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Costs on appeal awarded to Plaintiff-Appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b571-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
