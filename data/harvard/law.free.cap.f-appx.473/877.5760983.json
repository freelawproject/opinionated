Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1325 (11th Cir. 2003), and we are bound by our prior precedent rule to apply that holding here.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Macias Lucas also contends that his conviction must be reversed because the district court, over objection by Macias Lucas, gave an <em>Allen </em>charge that differed in several respects from the wording outlined in this court\u2019s pattern <em>Allen </em>charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A district court abuses its discretion in giving an <em>Allen </em>charge if, in light of \u201cthe language of the charge and the totality of the circumstances under which it was delivered,\u201d the charge was \u201cinherently coercive.\u201d <em>United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1364 (11th Cir.2008). This record does not contain the requisite evidence of coercion. Among other things, the charge given was modeled on our court\u2019s pattern <em>Allen </em>instruction, and after the charge was given, the jury continued to deliberate for an additional ninety minutes before returning its verdict the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Finally, Macias Lucas also argues that the government was erroneously permitted to use testimony admitted only for impeachment as substantive evidence of Macias Lucas\u2019s guilt, and that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of two of its witnesses. However, the record reflects that the prosecutor\u2019s use of this testimony was limited to challenging Macias Lucas\u2019s credibility as a witness. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that two U.S. Coast Guard agents had no motive to lie when testifying did not impermissibly vouch for their credibility because it did not put the government\u2019s prestige or the prosecutor\u2019s personal imprimatur upon their credibility. <em>See United States v.
