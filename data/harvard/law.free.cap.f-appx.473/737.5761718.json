We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal on qualified immunity grounds. <em>Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, </em>373 F.3d 952, 966 n. 18 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The district court properly dismissed Rhoden\u2019s action after concluding that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the law regarding the right of civil detainees to regular smoke-free outdoor exercise was not clearly established. <em>See Hope v. Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 739, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (\u201cFor a constitutional right to be clearly established, its contours must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b770-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
