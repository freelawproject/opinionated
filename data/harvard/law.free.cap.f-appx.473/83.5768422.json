Nelson, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Zongyou Li, </em>No. A089 253 378 (B.I.A. June 30, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A089 253 378 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 16, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-17\">We have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>See Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-18\">I. Adverse Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b116-19\">For asylum applications, such as Li\u2019s, governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may, \u201c[considering the totality of the circumstances, ... base a credibility determination on ... the inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s account ... [and] the internal consistency of each such statement ... without regard to whether an inconsistency ... goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 165-66. We \u201cdefer therefore to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. In making a finding that an applicant\u2019s claim is inherently implausible, the agency is not required to \u201cexplain in precise detail what made each identified act implausible.\u201d <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.2007). Rather, if \u201cthe reasons for [the IJ\u2019s] incredulity are evident,\u201d the implausibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was reasonably based on the implausibility of Li\u2019s testimony that he could not support his family because he lost his job and his wife was demoted, while he was able to pay for travel to the United States on two occasions, as well as his testimony that he returned to China following his first trip to the United States, despite that he allegedly feared persecution based on his violation of the family planning policy. <em>See Kone v. Holder, </em>596 F.3d 141, 150-51 (2d Cir.2010); <em>Wensheng Yan, </em>509 F.3d at 67. These findings provide support for the agency\u2019s credibility determination, and the agency was not required to credit Li\u2019s explanations for the inconsistencies. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">II. Burden Finding</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Even assuming Li\u2019s credibility and that Li engaged in \u201cother resistance\u201d to Chinese family planning policy, the agency reasonably found that Li failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future harm. We have held that \u201cminor bruising from an altercation with family planning officials, which required no formal medical attention and had no lasting physical effect\u201d did not amount to persecution. <em>See Jian Qiu Liu v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 820, 822 (2d Cir.2011). Although a minor injury may rise to the level of persecution when inflicted in the context of detention, <em>see Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2006), the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Li\u2019s mistreatment did not rise to the level of persecution is reasonable as the lightbulb burns he suffered required no formal medical attention, and occurred during a brief period of detention at his place of employment. Moreover, because Li did not produce any evidence that his wife underwent an abortion procedure, and, significantly, neither his wife\u2019s, mother\u2019s, nor colleague\u2019s affidavits state that she underwent an abortion, and because the agency reasonably rejected Li\u2019s argument that his affidavits can be read in the context of his overall testimony to refer to his wife\u2019s abortion, <em>see Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 81, the agency did not err in concluding that Li had failed to carry his burden of demonstrating past persecution, <em>see Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 285 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">As the agency\u2019s finding that Li did not establish past persecution obviates any presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1), and as Li has failed to allege any additional basis for his fear of future persecution, the agency did not err in denying his asylum claim, <em>see Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005). Because the agency did not err in concluding that Li failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to China, it did not err in similarly denying his application for withholding of removal and CAT relief insofar as these claims shared the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006) (withholding of removal); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005) (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
