Stone was convicted in 2006 following a guilty plea of possession with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(iii), and of possession of a firearm during the commission of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). He was sentenced to the statutory minimum term of imprisonment of 120 months for his conviction for possession with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2006). By moving to proceed IFP, Stone challenges the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-21\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>A sentence reduction is not authorized if the amendments to the Guidelines \u201cdo[] not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, p.s., comment. (n.1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">A mandatory minimum statutory penalty overrides the retroactive application of a new Guideline. <em>United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1994). Stone\u2019s sentence of 120 months of imprisonment was statutorily mandated, and, thus, he was not \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); see <em>Pardue, </em>36 F.3d at 431. Stone\u2019s suggestion that his sentence should be reduced under the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) is without merit. <em>Cf. Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2335, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2012) (\u201c[I]n federal sentencing the ordinary practice is to apply new penalties to defendants not yet sentenced.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Because Stone was not eligible for a sentence reduction, he cannot show that he will present a nonfrivolous issue with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). His request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
