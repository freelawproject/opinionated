As Witherspoon concedes in his informal brief, it is clear under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486, 114 S.Ct. 2364,129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), that his lawsuit should be construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2006) petition because it attempts only to demonstrate the invalidity of his state convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-24\">To the extent that the district court construed Witherspoon\u2019s complaint as a \u00a7 2254 petition, it dismissed the petition both as untimely and for failure to exhaust state remedies. The district court\u2019s order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (2006). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>tioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the petitioner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the petition states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85,120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Witherspoon has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Witherspoon\u2019s pending motion to appoint counsel, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
