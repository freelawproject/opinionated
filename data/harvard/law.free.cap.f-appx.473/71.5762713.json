Aug. 27, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The BIA\u2019s denial of Ke\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An alien may file one motion to reopen, generally no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceedings sought to be reopened. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). There is no dispute that Ke\u2019s 2010 motion was untimely because the agency issued the final administrative order in 2002. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The time limitation does not apply to a motion to reopen if it is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). As the BIA concluded, Ke\u2019s practice of Falun Gong in the United States is not a changed circumstance arising in China. <em>Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 273 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 155 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Ke argues, however, that she demonstrated an increase in China\u2019s persecution of Falun Gong practitioners since the 2008 Olympics. While the evidence indicates that repression of Falun Gong practitioners increased during the 2008 Olympics, Ke failed to proffer evidence indicating what conditions existed for Falun Gong practitioners in China at the time of her 2000 merits hearing. The BIA\u2019s determination that the evidence failed to demonstrate changed circumstances in China since the time of Ke\u2019s previous hearing is, therefore, supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008) (reviewing the BIA\u2019s factual findings regarding changed country conditions under the substantial evidence standard). Contrary to Ke\u2019s argument that the BIA ignored evidence, the BIA is not required to address each individual piece of evidence and its decision indicates that it considered the evidence. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Because the evidence Ke submitted was insufficient to establish changed conditions in China, and her recent dedication to Falun Gong constitutes only a change in personal circumstances, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that she failed to meet an exception to the filing deadline, and, consequently, in denying her untimely motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), (ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
