We have jurisdiction under 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Bunma contends that he is entitled to be resentenced in light of the Guideline amendments promulgated by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to the authority it was granted under the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d). The result of that directive was Amendment 750, made retroactive in part by Amendment 759, which amended the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 for offenses involving crack cocaine, and accounted for specified aggravating and mitigating factors in certain drug cases. The amendments to section 2D1.1 have no effect on Bunma\u2019s applicable Guidelines range because he was convicted of a marijuana offense, and because the portion of the amendment accounting for mitigating factors was not made retroactive. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, Amendments 750 and 759 (2011). Thus, Bunma\u2019s \u201csentence is not \u2018based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u2019 as required by \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>See United States v. Leniear, </em>574 F.3d 668, 673 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Bunma\u2019s remaining claims are not cognizable in a section 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b624-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
