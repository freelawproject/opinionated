SEYMOUR, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Christopher A. Wickliffe and Mark J. Hanson (\u201cRelators\u201d) brought this qui tam action under the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729 <em>et </em>seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action on the government\u2019s motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">Relators\u2019 complaint alleges EMC Corporation knowingly sold defective computers to government agencies and fraudulently concealed information regarding the defect. Before EMC was served with the complaint,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the government asked the district court to dismiss the action under the FCA\u2019s so-called \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d bar, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(5), after electing not to intervene.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government contended Relators\u2019 action was barred because an earlier-filed complaint (the \u201cWade complaint\u201d) alleged the same essential scheme and material elements as the Relators\u2019 complaint. After considerable procedural maneuvering, the government ultimately moved to dismiss under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A), which allows the government to dismiss a relator\u2019s suit \u201cnotwithstanding the objections of the [relator]\u201d if the relator is given notice and an opportunity for a hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>concluded the government had sufficient support for its \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) motion to dismiss, and alternatively that Relators\u2019 action was barred by the first-to-file rule of \u00a7 3730(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of the FCA and its determination of what standard to apply to the Government when it moves to dismiss a <em>qui tarn </em>action.\u201d <em>Ridenour v. Kaiser-Hill Co., </em>397 F.3d 925, 930 (10th Cir.2005). \u2018We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a <em>qui tam </em>action with prejudice for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Relators argue dismissal is improper under the FCA\u2019s first-to-file bar, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(5), contending the earlier-filed Wade complaint was defective and therefore incapable of barring subsequent actions. Complaints alleging violations of the FCA must satisfy the heightened pleading standard of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), which requires allegations of fraud to be \u201cstate[d] with particularity.\u201d <em>See United States ex rel. Lemmon v. Envirocare of Utah, Inc., </em>614 F.3d 1163, 1171 (10th Cir. 2010). Both Relators and the government maintain that the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b) is relevant to the first-to-file bar. That is, in their view, an earlier-filed complaint in a pending action does not trigger the first-to-file bar of \u00a7 3730(b)(5) unless it satisfies the heightened pleading requirement of Rule 9(b). The parties disagree, however, about whether the Wade complaint met this heightened standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">The circuits are split regarding whether the first-to-file bar incorporates Rule 9(b)\u2019s particularity requirement. <em>Compare Walburn v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>431 F.3d 966, 972-73 (6th Cir.2005) (holding earlier complaint could not preempt a later-filed action under the first-to-file bar where it failed to comply with Rule 9(b)), <em>with United States ex rel. Batiste v. SLM Corp., </em>659 F.3d 1204, 1210 (D.C.Cir.2011) (\u201c[F]irst-filed complaints need not meet the heightened standard of Rule 9(b) to bar later complaints; they must provide only sufficient notice for the government to initiate an investigation into the allegedly fraudulent practices, should it choose to do so.\u201d), <em>and United States ex rel. Branch Consultants v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>560 F.3d 371, 378 n. 10 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe sufficiency of the [earlier] complaint under Rule 9(b) is a matter for that court to decide in the first instance.\u201d). We admit to being uneasy with the parties\u2019 suggestion that Rule 9(b)\u2019s particularity requirement should be applied to the first-to-file bar. Such an interpretation of \u00a7 3730(b)(5) \u201cwould create a strange judicial dynamic, potentially requiring one district court to determine the sufficiency of a complaint filed in another district court, and possibly creating a situation in which the two district courts disagree on a complaint\u2019s sufficiency.\u201d <em>Batiste, </em>659 F.3d at 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">We need not decide the Rule 9(b) question, however, because we may resolve this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>case on the government\u2019s \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) motion to dismiss rather than on the first-to-file rule. Although we have characterized the first-to-file bar as \u201ca jurisdictional limit on the courts\u2019 power to hear certain duplicative qui tam suits,\u201d <em>Grynberg v. Koch Gateway Pipeline Co., </em>390 F.3d 1276, 1278 (10th Cir.2004), we need not reach this issue before deciding whether the government provided sufficient justification for dismissal under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A). As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201ca federal court has leeway \u2018to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l Shipping Corp., </em>549 U.S. 422, 431,127 S.Ct. 1184, 167 L.Ed.2d 15 (2007) (quoting <em>Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., </em>526 U.S. 574, 585, 119 S.Ct. 1563, 143 L.Ed.2d 760 (1999)). \u201cJurisdiction is vital only if the court proposes to issue a judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIf ... a court can readily determine that it lacks jurisdiction over the cause or the defendant, the proper course would be to dismiss on that ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 127 S.Ct. 1184. But where the jurisdictional issue \u201cis difficult to determine\u201d and a non-merits issue \u201cweights] heavily in favor of dismissal, the court properly takes the less burdensome course.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Dismissal under \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) avoids a decision on the merits, <em>see Sinochem, </em>549 U.S. at 431, 127 S.Ct. 1184, and \u201cdoes not entail any assumption by the court of substantive law-declaring power,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 433, 127 S.Ct. 1184 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we may address this issue without deciding the complicated first-impression issue of the applicability of Rule 9(b) to \u00a7 3730(b)(5). <em>See Sinochem, </em>549 U.S. at 435-36, 127 S.Ct. 1184 (resolving ease under non-merits <em>forum non conveniens </em>doctrine was proper where \u201csubject-matter jurisdiction presented an issue of first impression\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The FCA provides that the government may dismiss a qui tam action \u201cnotwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the person has been notified by the Government of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the person with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A). The government is not required to intervene in the action before moving to dismiss it under \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A). <em>Ridenour, </em>397 F.3d at 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">We have not articulated what level of scrutiny a district court should apply when the government moves to dismiss a qui tam action under \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) before the defendant has been served with the complaint. Where the defendant had been served, the Ninth Circuit held that a qui tam action may be dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) if \u201cthe government offers reasons for dismissal that are rationally related to a legitimate government interest....\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Sequoia Orange Co. v. Baird-Neece Packing Corp., </em>151 F.3d 1139, 1147 (9th Cir.1998). The D.C. Circuit subsequently declined to adopt the <em>Sequoia </em>test, holding instead that \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) provides the government a virtually \u201cunfettered right to dismiss [the] action.\u201d <em>Swift v. United States, </em>318 F.3d 250, 252 (D.C.Cir.2003). In its view, the government\u2019s decision to dismiss a qui tam action under \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) is nearly unreviewable by the court,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>\u201cthe function of a hearing when the relator requests one is simply to give the relator a formal opportunity to convince the government not to end the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253. The defendants in <em>Swift </em>had not yet been served with the complaint, <em>id. </em>at 251, but the D.C. Circuit subsequently applied <em>Swift\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) in a case where the defendant had been served. <em>See Hoyte v. Am. Nat\u2019l Red Cross, </em>518 F.3d 61, 65 (D.C.Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">In <em>Ridenour, </em>397 F.3d 925, we were asked to decide what standard applies when the government moves to dismiss a qui tam action under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) after the defendant has been served. We adopted the <em>Sequoia </em>test, which requires the government to identify a valid governmental purpose that is rationally related to dismissing the action. <em>Id. </em>at 936 (quoting <em>Sequoia, </em>151 F.3d at 1145). If the government satisfies this test, the burden shifts to the relator to show that dismissal is \u201cfraudulent, arbitrary and capricious, or illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]o establish a rational relation to a valid governmental purpose, there need not be a tight fitting relationship between the two; it is enough that there are plausible, or arguable, reasons supporting the agency decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 937 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). We expressly declined to decide \u201cwhether \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) gives the judiciary the right to pass judgment on the Government\u2019s decision to dismiss an action where the defendant has not been served and where the Government did not intervene in the action, facts of the sort presented in <em>Swift.\u201d Id. </em>at 936 n. 17. As a result, it remains an open question in this Circuit whether <em>Swift </em>or <em>Sequoia </em>provides the proper scope of judicial review in cases such as the one before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">The government urges us to apply <em>Swift, </em>and Relators ask us to extend <em>Ridenour </em>and follow <em>Sequoia. </em>The district court found it likely we would follow Swift but also concluded the government satisfied \u201cthe slightly more restrictive <em>Ridenour </em>standard.\u201d ApltApp., vol. I at 204. We need not resolve this question because even under the greater judicial scrutiny imposed by the <em>Sequoia </em>standard, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss passes muster in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">In support of its \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) motion, the government asserted it had become aware of the allegations against EMC in 2004, before Relators filed this suit, and had been investigating EMC since then. It explained that it had resolved the fraud allegations against EMC by entering into a settlement agreement with EMC and Mr. Wade in the related Wade action. The government attached the notice given to Relators in this case regarding the Wade settlement. During oral argument in this appeal, Relators\u2019 counsel conceded the Wade settlement prevents the government from recovering additional damages from EMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">The government has a valid interest in ending duplicative litigation involving resolved claims. <em>Cf. Grynberg, </em>390 F.3d at 1279 (\u201cOnce an initial qui tam complaint puts the government and the defendants on notice of its essential claim, all interested parties can expect to resolve that claim in a single lawsuit.\u201d). Dismissal of the current action is rationally related to the government\u2019s interest in ending a duplicative action that would result in no recovery for the government. Thus the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>has met the burden established in <em>Sequoia. See Ridenour, </em>397 F.3d at 936-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Because the government provided a rational reason for dismissing this action, the burden shifted to Relators under the <em>Sequoia </em>standard \u201cto demonstrate that dismissal is fraudulent, arbitrary and capricious, or illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 937 (internal quotation marks omitted). They failed to do so. Relators essentially argue that dismissal under \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) is arbitrary and capricious because they\u2014not Mr. Wade\u2014are the proper relators and are entitled to a share of any settlement with EMC. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(d). But the potential merit <em>of </em>a qui tam action is insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s rational reasons for dismissing the suit. In both <em>Sequoia, </em>151 F.3d at 1143, and <em>Ridenour, </em>397 F.3d at 930, the government conceded for purposes of its motions to dismiss that the suits were meritorious. In neither case was the merit of the qui tam action sufficient for the relator to prevent dismissal under \u00a7 3730(e)(2)(A). Even \u201ca meritorious suit may be dismissed upon a proper showing [by the government].\u201d <em>Sequoia, </em>151 F.3d at 1144. Relators also speculate that their qui tam action provided a catalyst for, or evidence used in, settlement of the Wade action. Such speculation, without more, is insufficient to demonstrate the government is engaging in fraudulent, illegal, or arbitrary and capricious action.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Finally, Relators complain that they were not afforded an adequate hearing on the \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) motion. We are not persuaded. A relator\u2019s request for a hearing under \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) is \u201conly to be granted if [the] relator[] can show a \u2018substantial and particularized need for a hearing.\u2019\u201d <em>Ridenour, </em>397 F.3d at 931 (quoting S. Rep. 99-345, at 26 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5266, 5291). We have noted that Congress intended such hearings \u201cshould not pose a significant burden for the government or courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 931 n. 10. Here, Relators made no effort to show they had a \u201csubstantial and particularized need\u201d for an evidentiary hearing. And, in any event, the issues raised in the government\u2019s \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) motion were addressed during the district court\u2019s hearing on April 28, 2010. Relators do not claim they were denied a right to present their argument against dismissal. Their displeasure with the government\u2019s proffered reasons for dismissal does not render the hearing inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b882-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
