We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to remand, <em>de Jesus Melendez v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1019, 1023 (9th Cir.2007), for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s continuous physical presence finding, <em>Landin-Zavala v. Gonzales, </em>488 F.3d 1150,1151 (9th Cir.2007), and de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings, <em>Cruz Rendon v. Holder, </em>603 F.3d 1104,1109 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Armenta\u2019s motion to remand where Armenta was not eligible for reappearing because she was already in removal proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Alcaraz v. INS, </em>384 F.3d 1150, 1154 n. 1 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201c[Eligibility for reappearing is <em>conditioned </em>on aliens being disadvantaged by the retroactive stop-time rule.\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-17\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Armenta failed to establish the requisite ten years of continuous physical presence for cancellation of removal at the time she was served with her Notice to Appear. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A), (d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-19\">We reject Armenta\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s decision was inadequate because, contrary to Armenta\u2019s assertion, the BIA adequately articulated its reasons for dismissing her appeal, <em>see Antonyan v. Holder, </em>642 F.3d 1250, 1256-57 (9th Cir.2011), Armenta failed to rebut the presumption that the BIA considered the evidence in the record, <em>see Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2000), and the BIA correctly concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of the statute and regulations it administers, <em>see Garcia-Ramirez v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-20\">Armenta\u2019s remaining constitutional claims are also unavailing. <em>See Urbano de Malaluan v. INS, </em>577 F.2d 589, 594 (9th Cir.1978) (The argument that \u201cthe deportation order would amount to a de facto deportation of the child and thus violate the constitutional rights of the child ... has been authoritatively rejected in numerous cases.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 517 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c\u2018Line-drawing\u2019 decisions made by Congress or the President in the context of immigration ... must be upheld if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>are rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
