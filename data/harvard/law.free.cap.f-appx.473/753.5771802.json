We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">When proper notice is given and forfeiture is authorized by statute, \u201cthe district court must impose criminal forfeiture in the amount of the \u2018proceeds\u2019 of the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Newman, </em>659 F.3d 1235, 1239 (9th Cir.2011). The \u201cproceeds\u201d of a \u201cfraudulently obtained loan equal the amount of the loan\u201d and, in a conspiracy, the \u201cproceeds\u201d \u201cequal the total amount of the loans obtained by the conspiracy as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Despite the fact that the government listed three forfeiture statutes in the indictment, Bilyeu had proper notice of the forfeiture because the indictment listed specific forfeiture allegations, including the specific amount of the requested money judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Bilyeu also argues the district court erred by defining the \u201cproceeds\u201d of her offense as the total amount of loans she and her co-conspirator fraudulently borrowed. However, Bilyeu\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cproceeds\u201d is foreclosed by <em>Newman, </em>659 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Sufficient evidence in the record supports the factual basis of the $2,654,000 criminal forfeiture order. Bilyeu agreed with the amounts alleged in the indictment at her change of plea hearing. The government also supported its requested forfeiture amount by filing evidentiary exhibits with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">The district court did not plainly err by misstating Bilyeu\u2019s possible term of supervised release during the Rule 11 colloquy. \u201c[A] defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). Bilyeu has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred because the record does not show a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that she would not have entered the plea but for the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b786-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>by 9th Cir.
