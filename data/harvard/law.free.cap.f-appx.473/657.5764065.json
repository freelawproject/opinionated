We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the new standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the Real ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the discrepancies between Liu\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence he submitted, as well as numerous inconsistencies within his documentary evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 1047-48 (adverse credibility determination was reasonable under the Real ID Act\u2019s \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d standard). In the absence of credible testimony, Liu\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">Because Liu\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the agency found not credible, and he points to no other evidence showing it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to China, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
