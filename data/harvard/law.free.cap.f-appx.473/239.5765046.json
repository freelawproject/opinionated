Reed argues that the sentence is procedurally plainly unreasonable because the district court failed to address his non-frivolous arguments for a within-Guidelines sentence. The Government responds that the sentence is not plainly unreasonable. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-23\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2011), the Government sought to revoke Reed\u2019s term of supervised release based on four violations of its conditions. The district court determined that the violations of supervision were Grade C violations. Because Reed\u2019s criminal history placed him in Category VI, the applicable Guidelines range was eight to fourteen months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4, p.s. (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Reed requested a within-Guidelines sentence, noting that he had completed more than two years of his three-year term of supervised release, that he had done well under supervision, that he maintained employment for a period of time, that he participated in drug treatment classes and was a leader in those classes, and that during his imprisonment pending revocation, he had completed another drug treatment program. The district court revoked supervised release and imposed a variant sentence of twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">In reviewing a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release, this court \u201ctakes a more deferential appellate posture concerning issues of fact and the exercise of discretion than reasonableness review for [Guidelines sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 656 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). We will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>595 F.3d 544, 546 (4th Cir.2010). The first step in this review requires a determination of whether the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 438(4th Cir.2006). A supervised release revocation sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court considered Chapter Seven\u2019s advisory policy statement range and the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2011) factors applicable to supervised release revocation. <em>See Thompson, </em>595 F.3d at 547; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). \u201cA court need not be as detailed or specific when imposing a revocation sentence as it must be when imposing a post-conviction sentence, but it still must provide a statement of reasons for the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>595 F.3d at 547 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">If the sentence is unreasonable, the inquiry proceeds to the second step of the analysis\u2014determining whether the sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 438-39. For a sentence to be plainly unreasonable, \u201cit must run afoul of clearly settled law.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>595 F.3d at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Here, the district court explicitly considered Reed\u2019s violations of the law, his drug use, his violations of the terms of supervision, his difficulty complying with supervision, his criminal history, the need to protect the public, and the need for deterrence. The district court permissibly concluded that a Guidelines sentence would be inadequate and thus imposed a sentence above the Guidelines range. A review of the record confirms that the district court sufficiently explained the selected sentence and addressed Reed\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">We therefore conclude that the sentence is not procedurally unreasonable, much less plainly so, and we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-5\"> The statutory maximum term was twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (2006); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3) (2006); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
