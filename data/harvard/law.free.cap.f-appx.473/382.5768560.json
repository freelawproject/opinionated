Donahoe, Postmaster General, United States Postal Service, on her claims that her employer, the United States Postal Service, discriminated against her on the basis of sex and disability, retaliated against her for engaging in a protected activity, subjected her to a hostile work environment, and constructively discharged her. We have carefully reviewed the briefs and the pertinent portions of the record in this case, and we conclude that no error warranting reversal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>is presented by the issues Haynes asserts in this appeal. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court for substantially the same reasons articulated in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendations, which was adopted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
