Hall, United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b834-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Tracy Sisson appeals the denial of her application for disability benefits. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s decision upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits <em>de novo. Edlund v. Massanari, </em>253 F.3d 1152, 1156 (9th Cir.2001). We reverse the administrative law judge\u2019s decision only when it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Sisson contends that the ALJ committed legal error by failing to fully credit her testimony about the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of her tremors. We agree. The ALJ should not have discounted Sisson\u2019s testimony about the limiting effects of her tremors based on her reported activities because none of the evidence in the record contradicts her assertion that her tremors are only intermittently severely limiting. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">Next, Sisson contends that the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) assessment is not supported by substantial evidence. We agree. The ALJ did not set forth legitimate reasons for attributing limited weight to Dr. Duckworth\u2019s opinion that Sisson is limited to sedentary exertion by her cerebral palsy. <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1102-03 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 830-31. The ALJ also failed to provide specific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence to reject Dr. Wheeler\u2019s diagnosis of borderline intellectual functioning. <em>Tackett, </em>180 F.3d at 1102-03; <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 830-31. Lastly, the ALJ erred by failing to address or resolve the potential conflict between the testimony of Gail Sisson and Dr. Resting. <em>See Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 511 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">Other errors made by the ALJ in determining Sisson\u2019s RFC were harmless. Specifically, the ALJ\u2019s mischaraeterization of Sisson\u2019s cerebral palsy as historical and his mistake in recounting the results of Dr. Kesting\u2019s spelling examination are both harmless error. <em>Stout v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>454 F.3d 1050, 1055 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-14\">Sisson contends that the ALJ made further errors in determining her RFC by failing to mention specific pieces of evidence from the reports of Dr. Mayers, Dr. Bremer, Dr. Downes, and Gail Sisson. The evidence to which Sisson points would not have added significant, probative value when considered in conjunction with other evidence that the ALJ discusses, and therefore the ALJ was not required to discuss these pieces of evidence specifical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ly. <em>Vincent ex rel. Vincent v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1393,1394-95 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Finally, Sisson contends that the ALJ erred by determining that she could return to her past relevant work as a housekeeper, because he made that determination without establishing that such work constituted substantial gainful activity. Although we decline to decide this issue because it was not raised before the district court, we are troubled by the ALJ\u2019s failure to properly address the record on whether Sisson\u2019s past relevant work constituted substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1574(b)(3); <em>Lewis, </em>236 F.3d at 515-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">In light of these errors, we reverse the decision of the district court and instruct it to remand this case to the ALJ for further determinations consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b834-15\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
