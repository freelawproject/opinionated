Browning appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment enforcing a settlement agreement with defendants Donat and McDaniel (the \u201cState Defendants\u201d) regarding his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action arising from the prison recording Browning\u2019s telephone calls with his attorney. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Kirkland, v. Legion Ins. Co., </em>343 F.3d 1135, 1140 (9th Cir. 2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-23\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in enforcing the settlement agreement because, despite delays that did not prejudice Browning and the substitution of terms due to the impossibility of performance, the State Defendants substantially complied with the agreement. <em>See Ahern v. Cent. Pac. Freight Lines, </em>846 F.2d 47, 48 (9th Cir.1988) (the finding that a party consented to a settlement and intended to be bound by it must be affirmed unless clearly erroneous); <em>see also Nebaco, Inc. v. Riverview Realty Co., </em>87 Nev. 55, 482 P.2d 305, 307 (1971) (defense of impossibility applies where performance of a contract term is made impossible or highly impractical by the occurrence of unforeseen contingencies).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-24\">Browning\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b734-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
