Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The ALJ did not err in relying on Dr. Fair\u2019s and Dr. Gallucci\u2019s translations of Yasuda\u2019s limitations (including the moderate limitations in areas of sustained concentration and persistence identified by Dr. House) into concrete work restrictions. <em>See Stubbs-Danielson v. Astrue, </em>539 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir.2008). Therefore, the ALJ did not err in determining that Yasuda had the residual functional capacity to perform \u201csimple, unskilled work,\u201d nor was this determination inconsistent with Dr. House\u2019s findings. <em>See id. </em>Program Operations Manual System Section DI 25020.010 is not to the contrary, as it provides guidance with respect to more extensive limitations than those identified by the relevant medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b820-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b820-7\">THOMAS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8A\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">I respectfully dissent. The ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity assessment limiting Yasuda to simple, unskilled work and occasional, superficial contact with colleagues does not capture all of his moderate limitations and work restrictions as identified by Dr. House. Specifically, the assessment did not take into consideration Dr. House\u2019s limitations relating to Yasuda\u2019s difficulty: (1) maintaining regular attendance with punctuality; (2) performing activities within a schedule; (3) sustaining an ordinary routine without special supervision; (4) working in coordination or proximity to others without being distracted by them; or (5) completing a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychological symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">These limitations were not included in the residual functional capacity assessment or in the hypothetical posed by the ALJ to the vocational expert. A vocational expert\u2019s testimony constitutes substantial evidence only if the hypothetical question posed considers \u201call of the claimant\u2019s limitations.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1044 (9th Cir.1995). Because the hypothetical question was flawed, reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">An ALJ\u2019s summarized assessment of a claimant may adequately capture restrictions related to concentration, persistence, or pace where the assessment is consistent with restrictions identified in the medical testimony. <em>Stubbs-Danielson v. Astrue, </em>539 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir.2008). However, <em>Stubbs-Danielson </em>does not stand for the proposition that all moderate psychological limitations can always be conflated by the ALJ into descriptive phrases. Indeed, the ALJ\u2019s description in <em>Stubbs-Danielson </em>contained far more restrictive language, even though the applicant in that case had far fewer limitations than Yasuda. Here, the reference to \u201csimple, unskilled work\u201d simply did not capture the work limitations imposed by Dr. House.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">Therefore, I would reverse and remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
