SMITH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-17\"> The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">Gustavo Mendoza-Bustos appeals from the 70-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for distribution of a controlled substance and possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B)(viii). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">Mendoza-Bustos contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to explain adequately the sentence imposed. The record belies this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">Mendoza-Bustos next contends that the district court erred by failing to make any findings of fact, or to conduct an evidentiary hearing, regarding his assertion that the government\u2019s refusal to move for a sentence reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 was based on a desire to punish him for not entering into a plea agreement. The court was not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing, or to make findings of fact, because Mendoza-Bustos did not make a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d that the government had unconstitutional motives or acted arbitrarily. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>see also United States v. Murphy, </em>65 F.3d 758, 764 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cMaintaining the effectiveness of the plea negotiation process is a legitimate governmental interest.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-15\">Finally, Mendoza-Bustos contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. In light of the totality of the circumstances and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, Mendoza-Bustos\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b642-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
