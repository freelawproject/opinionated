Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a continuance and review de novo due process claims. <em>Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243,1246 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The IJ did not abuse her discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 request for a continuance where petitioners did not show that they were eligible for any relief other than voluntary departure and did not demonstrate good cause for a continuance. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (an immigration judge may grant a motion to continue for good cause shown); <em>see also Sandoval-Luna, </em>526 F.3d at 1247 (IJ\u2019s denial of an additional continuance was within discretion where relief was not immediately available to petitioner). It follows that their due process challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial fails. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cTo prevail on a due process challenge to deportation proceedings, [a petitioner] must show error and substantial prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">We lack jurisdiction to consider petitioners\u2019 contention that the IJ violated their right to due process by failing to further question them regarding their eligibility for asylum because they failed to exhaust this contention before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir. 2004) (no jurisdiction over claims not presented below).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b756-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
