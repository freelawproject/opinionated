Leyva-Rodriguez\u2019s sole assertion on appeal is that his attorney provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to object to the absence of a Spanish interpreter during Leyva-Rodriguez\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Leyva-Rodriguez must satisfy both parts of the two-part test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Richardson v. Branker, </em>668 F.3d 128,139 (4th Cir.2012). First, Leyva-Rodriguez must show that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cIn making this determination, a court ... must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>668 F.3d at 139 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u201cIf counsel\u2019s performance is found to have been deficient under the first part of the <em>Strickland </em>standard, to obtain relief the petitioner must also show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome and the likelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just conceivable!).]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139-40 (internal quotation marks, italics and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are not generally cognizable on direct appeal, however, unless ineffective assistance \u201cconclusively appears\u201d on the record. <em>See United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.2006). Rather, such a claim should generally be raised by a habeas corpus motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2011). <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1999). After review of the record, we find no conclusive evidence that counsel rendered ineffective assistance, and we accordingly decline to consider this claim on direct appeal. We of course intimate no view as to the validity or lack of validity of any ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
