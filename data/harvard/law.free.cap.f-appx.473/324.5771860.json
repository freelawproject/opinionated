On appeal, Mata-Rosales challenges only the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that he rebutted the presumption of reasonableness afforded to his within-Guidelines sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-23\">In reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the sentence imposed is within the appropriate Sentencing Guidelines range, we presume it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 216 (4th Cir. 2010). This presumption may be rebutted by a showing \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (2006) ] factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>marks omitted). Upon review, we conclude that Mata-Rosales failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Mata-Rosales to seventy-eight months\u2019 imprisonment, a sentence within the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 (providing standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
