A jury found Lopez guilty on both counts. Lopez appeals his convictions and sentence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. We address Lopez\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">1. Lopez\u2019s collateral attack under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) on his prior order of removal fails because Lopez cannot establish that he had a \u201cplausible ground for relief from [removal].\u201d <em>United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d 1042, 1050 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Lopez cannot establish that he had a plausible ground for relief from removal because his 2008 conviction for \u201creceipt of a stolen vehicle,\u201d in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 496d(a), was categorically an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). <em>See Alvarez-Reynaga v. Holder, </em>596 F.3d 534, 536-37 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that alien\u2019s conviction for \u201creceipt of a stolen vehicle,\u201d in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 496d(a), was categorically an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(43)(G)); <em>Verdugo-Gonzalez v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 1059, 1062 (9th Cir.2009) (holding that alien\u2019s conviction for \u201creceipt of stolen property,\u201d in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 496(a), was categorically an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G)). Because Lopez\u2019s conviction was categorically an aggravated felony, Lopez was removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, and was also ineligible for cancellation of removal or voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(a)(3), 1229c(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">2. Even if the district court erred when it applied a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) for Lopez\u2019s prior conviction under California Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a), any such error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Ali, </em>620 F.3d 1062, 1074 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cWhen an \u2018alleged error is harmless, it is not a ground for resentencing.\u2019\u201d) (internal alteration omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Garro, </em>517 F.3d 1163, 1169 (9th Cir.2008)). Lopez\u2019s prior conviction under California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11351 could have justified the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
