We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Andrews v. King, </em>398 F.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir.2005). We reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The district court improperly denied Woods\u2019s request to proceed in forma pauperis because the dismissals of his appeals for lack of jurisdiction were not \u201cfrivolous\u201d solely because the appeals were premature. <em>See id. </em>at 1121 (district court erred in counting dismissal of an appeal for lack of jurisdiction as a \u201cstrike\u201d under \u00a7 1915(g) without first determining, \u201cafter careful evaluation of the order dismissing an action, and other relevant information,\u201d that the action was frivolous, malicious or failed to state a claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Woods\u2019s motions for injunctive relief because it had dismissed Woods\u2019s complaint prior to service. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(1) (court may issue preliminary injunction only on notice to adverse party).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">All outstanding motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">Woods shall bear his own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">REVERSED in part; AFFIRMED in part; and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b768-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
