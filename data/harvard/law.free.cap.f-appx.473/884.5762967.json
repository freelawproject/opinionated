On September 20, 2010, the Tax Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. On October 14, 2010, Overton filed a notice of appeal, seeking review by this court. Overton\u2019s mailing address indicates that his residence is in Oklahoma, which is within the regional jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-22\">This court is a court of limited jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295. We have no jurisdiction to review decisions of the Tax Court. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1) (\u201cThe United States Courts of Appeals (other than the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Tax Court.... \u201d). Because we lack jurisdiction, we transfer this appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (\u201cWhenever a civil action ... or an appeal ... is noticed for or filed with such a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal to any other court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-24\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b916-25\">It is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b916-26\">This appeal is transferred to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
