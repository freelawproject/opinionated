Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them further except as neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>sary to explain our decision. We have jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Mays did not establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination as required under <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Mays failed to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact that she was qualified for the Lee Circle fiber splicing position in 2007 because the uncontroverted evidence showed that she did not request a transfer to fiber splicing at Lee Circle on her LMR form at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Supposing she made out a prima facie case under <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas, Mays\u2019 claim further fails for the independent reason that she has failed to create a triable issue of material fact as to pretext. 411 U.S. at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Finally, since Mays was transferred to Lee Circle as soon as she was eligible after filing a request to transfer to Lee Circle, under <em>Bradley v. Harcourt, Brace and Co., </em>104 F.3d 267, 270 (9th Cir.1996), there is a strong inference that no one at Qwest held a discriminatory animus against Mays.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b845-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
