We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-18\">The denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-19\">Petitioners\u2019 motion is both number\u2014 and timebarred. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). They filed their first motion to reopen on December 22, 2005, triggering the number bar. Their second motion to reopen was filed almost three years after entry of the immigration judge\u2019s decision, well beyond the ninety-day filing deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-20\">Even if petitioners were eligible for equitable tolling of these procedural bars, <em>see Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir.2003), petitioners do not have a basis for equitable tolling. Under <em>Iturribarria, </em>the ninety-day window for equitable tolling begins to run when the immigrant meets with new counsel and discovers the fraud, deceit, or error. <em>Id. </em>at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-21\">Petitioners allege that they did not know of their former counsel\u2019s fraudulent conduct until meeting with new counsel in \u201cabout the middle of March\u201d 2007. Thus, the new ninety-day deadline, triggered by equitable tolling, was in mid-June. The petitioners\u2019 second motion to reopen was filed on June 22, 2007. Nothing in petitioners\u2019 motion or the briefs addresses this delay in filing. In fact, the brief suggests that the petitioners discovered the full extent of what happened in February 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-22\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
