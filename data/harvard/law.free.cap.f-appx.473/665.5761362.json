We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to remand, reopen or reconsider. <em>Ghahremani v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 993, 997 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to remand on the ground that petitioners were bound by their attorney\u2019s admissions of alienage and removability at their hearing. <em>See Torres-Chavez v. Holder, </em>567 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir.2009) (because petitioner was not \u201cdeprived of due process by the conduct of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>lawyer, he is bound to his admissions of alienage and removability before the [immigration judge]\u201d). Regardless of whether constitutional violations occurred during petitioners\u2019 arrests, petitioners have not provided grounds that would prevent the agency from relying on their voluntary admissions at the subsequent removal hearing. <em>See Rodriguez-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>640 F.2d 1139, 1140-41 (9th Cir.1981) (\u201ca constitutionally invalid arrest,\u201d standing alone, does not \u201ctaint the deportation proceeding itself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because the motion failed to identify any material error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior denial of their motion to remand that warranted reconsideration. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen because petitioners did not establish that the newly submitted evidence \u201cwas not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also Guzman v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 911, 913 (9th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Petitioners\u2019 period of voluntary departure has not been stayed by this court. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(e)(1), (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b697-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
