R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b616-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Luis Alberto Chipana-Nunez, a native and citizen of Peru, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Chawla v. Holder, </em>599 F.3d 998, 1001 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Chipana-Nunez established changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a). Accordingly, his asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">With respect to withholding of removal, Chipana-Nunez does not claim he suffered any harm in Peru in the past, but he fears returning to Peru because of the Shining Path. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Chipana-Nunez has not established a clear probability of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">Finally, Chipana-Nunez\u2019s CAT claim fails because the record evidence does not show it is more likely than not he would be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government if returned to Peru. See Wak<em>kary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
