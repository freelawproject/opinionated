Donaldson appeals the district court\u2019s order granting a reduced attorney\u2019s fees award after he successfully represented Christine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Johnson in her claim for Social Security benefits. We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Crawford v. Astrue, </em>586 F.3d 1142,1146-47 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc). Having reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal, we vacate the district court\u2019s fee award and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">District courts are authorized to order payment of \u201ca reasonable fee for ... representation, not in excess of 25 percent of the total of past-due benefits\u201d following successful representation of Social Security benefit claimants. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A). When awarding fees, district courts are to look first to the contingent-fee agreement, and then independently \u201creview for reasonableness [the] fees yielded by those agreements.\u201d <em>Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, </em>535 U.S. 789, 808-09, 122 S.Ct. 1817, 152 L.Ed.2d 996 (2002) (directing lower courts to consider \u201cthe character of the representation and the results the representative achieved\u201d when reviewing for reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Pursuant to the express terms of his contingent-fee agreement, Donaldson was entitled to 25% of the past-due benefits awarded to Johnson and her children. The district court reduced the requested fee award below this amount, but did not provide an explanation. <em>See Crawford, </em>586 F.3d at 1152 (the district court must provide a \u201cconcise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award.\u201d) (internal quotations and citation omitted). As such, we are unable to engage in a meaningful review of either the basis for the award or the award itself. <em>See Tutor-Saliba Corp. v. City of Hailey, </em>452 F.3d 1055, 1065 (9th Cir.2006) (without reasoning to support fee award, \u201cit is simply not possible for this court to review [the] award in a meaningful manner.\u201d) (internal quotations and citation omitted). The total past-due benefits paid to Johnson <em>and </em>her children is $205,502.50. But the amount the district court awarded to Donaldson ($34,263.12) is 25 percent of the past-due benefits paid to Johnson only (25 percent of $137,052.50 is $34,263.12). We infer that the district court excluded the children\u2019s awards ($68,-450) from the fee calculation. We see no basis in the record for doing so. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and remand this case to the district court for reassessment of an appropriate fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b831-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
