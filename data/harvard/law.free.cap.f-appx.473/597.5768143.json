We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Stott contends that the district court procedurally erred when it ordered his sentence to run consecutive to his undischarged state sentence. Specifically, he contends that the district court failed to consult U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 and its application notes, failed to consider the sentencing disparity allegedly caused by imposition of a consecutive sentence, and relied on a clearly erroneous finding that the state offense was unrelated to the instant offense. The record does not support his contentions. The court was aware of its discretion to impose a concurrent or consecutive sentence, and considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors before imposing a consecutive term. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c); <em>United States v. Treadwell, </em>593 F.3d 990, 1012 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201c[Sentencing disparity is only one factor a court considers in crafting an individualized sentence under \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d). Moreover, the court\u2019s finding that there is not a direct relationship between the state conviction and the instant conviction is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Treadwell, </em>593 F.3d at 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Scott further contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. The record reflects that Stott\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the section 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
