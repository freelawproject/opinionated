For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-23\">Since we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with the background of this case, we discuss the events leading to this appeal only briefly. In 2008, Appellants filed an amended complaint in the District Court against Isara Isabella Serene (David Bush\u2019s ex-wife), two officers from the Richmond, Virginia Police Department (\u201cthe Richmond officers\u201d), and three officers from the Pennsylvania State Police (\u201cthe PSP officers\u201d), raising claims under Pennsylvania state law and the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-24\">The Richmond officers moved to dismiss the claims against them for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Serene moved to dismiss the claims against her for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The District Court ultimately granted both motions. Thereafter, the remaining defendants\u2014the PSP officers\u2014 moved for summary judgment. The District Court subsequently granted their motion and closed the case. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-25\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-26\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction, <em>O\u2019Connor v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>Sandy Lane Hotel Co., 496 </em>F.3d 312, 316 (3d Cir.2007), and we also review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment or dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Barefoot Architect, Inc. v. Bunge, </em>632 F.3d 822, 826 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Having considered the parties\u2019 arguments, and reviewed the District Court\u2019s thorough and cogent opinions accompanying orders it entered on November 4, 2008, January 28, 2009, and May 19, 2011, respectively, we conclude that the District Court adequately explained its rulings and we agree with that court\u2019s resolution of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 contention that the District Court did not address David Bush\u2019s equal protection/interference with family rights claim is belied by the record. <em>(See </em>J.A. at 51-52.) To the extent Appellants contest a June 2010 order entered by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia\u2014a court outside this Circuit\u2014granting Serene\u2019s motion to quash a subpoena that had been issued against her, we lack jurisdiction to review that decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1294(1) (providing that, except under narrow circumstances not present here, an appeal from a district court shall be taken to the court of appeals for the circuit embracing that district).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In light of the above, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s November 4, 2008, January 28, 2009, and May 19, 2011 orders substantially for the reasons set forth by the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">. Appellants argue, inter alia, that Serene's \"maintenance of a post office box and reception of mail within Pennsylvania,\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. 40), constituted \u201c[pjresence in th[e] Commonwealth at the time when process is served,\u201d 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 5301(a)(l)(i), thereby establishing personal jurisdiction over her under Pennsylvania law. Appellants provide no authority for the proposition that \u00a7 5301(a)(l)(i)\u2019s \"presence\u201d requirement is satisfied merely by having a post office box in the forum, and we find this argument unpersuasive. Although Appellants also point to other \"activities\u201d as evidence of Serene's purported \"presence\u201d in the Commonwealth, that evidence does not establish that she was present there <em>at the time of service.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-22\"><em>. </em>Although Appellants could have appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the time to do so has long since passed. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (providing that, in a civil case in which the United States is not a party, a notice of appeal must be filed no later than thirty days after entry of the order or judgment in question).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
