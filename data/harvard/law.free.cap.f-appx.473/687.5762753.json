We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-27\">In supervised release revocation proceedings, a releasee \u201cenjoys a due process right to confront witnesses against him.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number><em>United States v. Hall, </em>419 F.3d 980, 986 (9th Cir.2005). To determine \u201cwhether the admission of hearsay evidence violates the releasee\u2019s right to confrontation in a particular case, the court must weigh the releasee\u2019s interest in his constitutionally guaranteed right to confrontation against the Government\u2019s good cause for denying it.\u201d <em>United States v. Comito, </em>177 F.3d 1166,1170 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Price had a strong interest in confronting Keisha Kagawa, the key witness against him. The evidence of Kagawa\u2019s statements to the police officer, probation officer, Price\u2019s neighbor, and Price\u2019s boss was crucial to the court\u2019s ultimate finding; it was the government\u2019s only evidence that Price was responsible for the assault. <em>See Hall, </em>419 F.3d at 987; <em>Comito, </em>177 F.3d at 1171. Moreover, Kagawa\u2019s statements were oral and unsworn, the \u201cleast reliable form of hearsay,\u201d <em>Comito, </em>177 F.3d at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The government made no showing of good cause to justify denying Price his right to confront Kagawa. It made no efforts to produce Kagawa at the hearing; it did not explain to the district court its failure to produce her; and its post-hearing unsworn representations in a brief to the court could not establish good cause. <em>See Orion Tire Corp. v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>268 F.3d 1133, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[Unsubstantiated versions of events proffered by counsel on appeal are, of course, not evidence.\u201d). Accordingly, the absence of Kagawa at the revocation hearing violated Price\u2019s due process right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The violation was not harmless. Without the hearsay evidence, there was evidence only that Kagawa had been assaulted\u2014not that Price was the culprit. <em>See Comito, </em>177 F.3d at 1170-71,1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">The order of the district court revoking Price\u2019s supervised release is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b719-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
