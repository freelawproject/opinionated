Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion the agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 992 (9th Cir.2008). We deny in part, dismiss in part, and grant in part the petition for review, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Andres and Martha\u2019s motion to reopen because it was untimely, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and petitioners failed to establish changed circumstances in Colombia to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limit for filing motions to reopen, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Toufighi, </em>538 F.3d at 996-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-25\">We lack jurisdiction to review petitioners\u2019 contentions regarding the BIA\u2019s October 28, 2004 order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying their underlying claims for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture, because this petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-26\">Finally, we grant the government\u2019s request to remand the petition for review as to Yuri\u2019s (A095-198-961) separate motion to reopen, in order for the BIA to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>her claims in the first instance. <em>See Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he BIA [is] not free to ignore arguments raised by a [party].\u201d); <em>see also INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Each party shall bear its own costs for this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b613-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
