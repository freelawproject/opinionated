We will dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-25\">Contant\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition challenged the calculation of his criminal sentence by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d). Contant alleged that the BOP should have credited his criminal sentence for time spent in custody of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d). In response, the respondents indicated that the United States Attorney\u2019s Office had contacted the BOP, and that the BOP had determined that Contant was entitled to 8 days of credit against his criminal sentence. The respondents explained that the additional 36 days of credit that Contant requested were not warranted, because that time frame was prior to the date when ICE referred Contant for criminal prosecution. The Magistrate Judge assigned to the case recommended that the District Court dismiss the petition as moot with regard to the 8 days that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Contant had been credited, and that the Court deny the petition with respect to the request for the remaining days of credit. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, and additionally held that Contant\u2019s petition should be denied because he had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Contant filed a timely notice of appeal. Several days later, Contant satisfied his sentence and was released from BOP custody to ICE custody.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellees then filed a motion for summary action, arguing that we should dismiss the appeal as moot or, in the alternative, affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Contant\u2019s habeas petition. Contant argues that the appeal is not moot, because he intends to \u201cfile an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and/or an action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Agents Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), so that he can recover monetary damages for his wrongful imprisonment\u201d for 36 days. He also argues that the appeal raises substantial questions regarding the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In order to exercise jurisdiction over this appeal, we must assure ourselves that the appeal raises an Article III \u00a7 2 case or controversy. <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). When a habeas petitioner\u2019s sentence has expired, he must demonstrate that some \u201ccollateral consequence\u201d of the conviction still exists to show that a case or controversy continues. <em>Id. </em>If an appellant is attacking an expired sentence, \u201ccollateral consequences will not be presumed, but must be proven.\u201d <em>Burkey v. Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 148 (3d Cir.2009) (citing <em>United States v. Cottman, </em>142 F.3d 160, 165 (3d Cir.1998)). The Supreme Court has indicated that one may establish collateral consequences only when there is a likelihood that a favorable decision would redress the injury or wrong. <em>Burkey, </em>556 F.3d at 148 (citing <em>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990) and <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998)). In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Contant sought credit against his criminal sentence; he did not attack his conviction in any way. As he has finished serving his sentence, a favorable decision here would not afford him the relief that he sought. Although Contant argues that he intends to file a civil rights complaint for monetary damages, such an allegation does not constitute the type of continuing injury that is sufficient for mootness purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 121 (3d Cir.2002) (appellant must demonstrate that he has suffered or is threatened with actual injury traceable to district court\u2019s decision that can be redressed by favorable decision in appellate court).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the appeal. The order of the District Court entered November 23, 2011 will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>vacated and the matter remanded to the District Court, with instructions to dismiss the habeas petition as moot. <em>See United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., </em>840 U.S. 36, 39, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\">. Contant was removed to Trinidad and Tobago on February 8, 2012. <em>See </em>Motion to Dismiss, <em>Contant v. Holder, </em>No. 12-1479, filed March 8, 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">. It appears that if Contant were to file a civil rights lawsuit to contest the length of his sentence, such suit would be barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. <em>477, </em>114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See Williams v. Consovoy, </em>453 F.3d 173, 177-78 (3d Cir.2006) <em>(Heck's </em>favorable-termination requirement applies and civil rights lawsuit not available to litigant for whom habeas relief is no longer available); <em>Gilies v. Davis, 427 </em>F.3d 197, 210 (3d Cir.2005) (same). However, even if Contant\u2019s appeal were not moot, we would affirm the District Court\u2019s holding on the merits, as we do not believe that he was in \"official detention\u201d until ICE officials requested that he be prosecuted. Contant thus would not be able to fulfill the favorable-termination requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
