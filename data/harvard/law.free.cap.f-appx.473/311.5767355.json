He was sentenced to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal his sole claim is that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">\u201cA defendant has no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>348 F.3d 408, 413 (4th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, once the district court has accepted a guilty plea, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion whether to grant a motion to withdraw it based on the defendant\u2019s showing of a \u201cfair and just reason.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Battle, </em>499 F.3d 315, 319 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">When considering whether to allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea, the trial court must conduct a six-factor analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">(1) whether the defendant has offered credible evidence that his plea was not knowing or not voluntary, (2) whether the defendant has credibly asserted his legal innocence, (3) whether there has been a delay between the entering of the plea and the filing of the motion, (4) whether defendant has had close assistance of competent counsel, (5) whether withdrawal will cause prejudice to the government, and (6) whether it will inconvenience the court and waste judicial resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-13\"><em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991). Although all of the <em>Moore </em>factors should be considered, the key one is whether the Rule 11 hearing was properly conducted. <em>Bowman, </em>348 F.3d at 414. Thus, this court closely scrutinizes the Rule 11 colloquy and attaches a strong presumption that the plea is final and binding if the Rule 11 proceeding is adequate. <em>United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389,1394 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">Having reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the materials submitted to the court, we conclude the district court properly weighed the <em>Moore </em>factors and did not abuse its discretion in denying London\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to withdraw the plea and affirm London\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
