We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Guzman v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 911, 912 n. 1 (9th Cir.2003) (per curiam). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">Gao contends that the BIA erred in denying her motion to reopen because it failed to recognize that Chinese authorities distinguish between activist and non-activist members of the China Democracy Party (\u201cCDP\u201d) and that the latter have been subject to increased mistreatment since her in absentia removal order in 2002. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Gao\u2019s untimely motion to reopen because the record, including the State Department\u2019s 2006 country report, does not show a material change in conditions in China for CDP members since Gao was first ordered removed. <em>See Almaraz v. Holder, </em>608 F.3d 638, 640-42 (9th Cir. 2010). Accordingly, Gao\u2019s motion to reopen fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b731-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
