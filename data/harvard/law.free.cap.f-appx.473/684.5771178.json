Although his Rule 36 motion was granted, Parker now seeks to challenge the validity of his sentence of imprisonment under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which was decided after he was sentenced but before the conclusion of his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Regardless of whether the district court acted properly by amending, under Rule 36, Parker\u2019s judgment of conviction to reflect the reduction of his fine, it is apparent that the ministerial amendment of the judgment\u2014reflecting a decision made years before\u2014does not entitle Parker to file a new challenge to his sentence of imprisonment. Parker has had two previous opportunities to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to his sentence: on direct appeal, where he failed to make this argument, and in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, where he argued that his original counsel had been constitutionally defective for failing to raise <em>Apprendi </em>on appeal. On appeal from the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief, this court rejected that argument, holding that any <em>Apprendi </em>error was harmless, as the evidence against Parker was \u201coverwhelming and virtually uncontested.\u201d <em>United States v. Parker, </em>173 Fed.Appx. 582 (9th Cir.2006) (unpublished decision). The district court\u2019s grant of Parker\u2019s Rule 36 motion does not entitle him to raise this issue again.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The cases Parker cites are not to the contrary. <em>United States v. Colvin, </em>204 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir.2000), and <em>United States v. LaFromboise, </em>427 F.3d 680 (9th Cir.2005), held that the time for filing a collateral attack under \u00a7 2255 is measured from the entry of an amended judgment when portions of the original judgment have been vacated on appeal. <em>See Colvin, </em>204 F.3d at 1225. These cases do not apply here. Parker\u2019s fine was reduced as a result of the collateral attack under \u00a7 2255, not as a result of a direct appeal, and there has already been an appeal of the \u00a7 2255 ruling. Parker\u2019s Rule 36 motion sought only to conform his judgment to the reduced fine. Accordingly, that motion could not have triggered a second collateral proceeding and did not require\u2014 or allow\u2014the district court to \u201creweigh the sentencing factors and come to an independent sentencing decision.\u201d <em>LaFromboise, </em>427 F.3d at 685 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
