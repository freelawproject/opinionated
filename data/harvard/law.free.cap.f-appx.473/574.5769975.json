West American\u2019s motion to resolve a dispute regarding its entitlement to the $170,000 judgment under the mortgage clause sought relief that was unavailable under Rule 60(b)(6) because it rested on a claim that was not litigated as part of the underlying judgment. <em>See Delay v. Gordon, </em>475 F.3d 1039, 1044^6 (9th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. $119,980, </em>680 F.2d 106, 107-08 (11th Cir. 1982). West American did not appeal the district court\u2019s prior denials of its motion to adjudicate that dispute, and Rule 60(b) is not available for adjudication of claims not adjudicated in the underlying order or judgment. <em>See Delay, </em>475 F.3d at 1046-47. Nor was relief available under Rule 60(b)(5): The judgment had not \u201cbeen satisfied, released or discharged,\u201d and circumstances had not changed since the judgment was entered such that \u201capplying it prospectively [was] no longer equitable.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P: 60(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">West American\u2019s motions under Rules 62 and 67 became moot when the district court decided its Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b606-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
