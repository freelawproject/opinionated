He claims his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to show him before trial a silent videotape of his participation in one small episode in the conspiracy charge he faced. He claims he had no knowledge of what was on the videotape because trial counsel failed to tell him what was on it before the trial, and that, had he known of the content of the tape, he would have pleaded guilty, thereby lessening his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-22\">Based on the record, the trial court did not believe this claim, finding it to be \u201cnot credible.\u201d The court concluded that, because Dais\u2019s attorney had in fact told him pretrial what was on the videotape and provided him with \u201call the discovery\u201d the government had turned over\u2014which included transcripts of extensive incriminating intercepted telephone conversations\u2014 her failure to show him the silent video before trial did not fall below any objective standard of reasonableness. Moreover, given the overwhelming quantity and quality of the government\u2019s evidence, the district court also concluded that Dais could not demonstrate any prejudice whatsoever from not having seen the video until the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-23\">After a careful review of the record, we agree with the district court on both counts. Dais\u2019s claim is demonstrably not credible. Counsel told him what he faced and that he should consider pleading guilty because the government had \u201ca lot of evidence\u201d against him. Instead, he chose to go to trial. Even after he saw the videotape during trial, at no time or in any way did he attempt to change his plea in order to gain the sentencing benefit of acceptance of responsibility he now desires.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Because Dais\u2019s motion has no merit, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b551-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
