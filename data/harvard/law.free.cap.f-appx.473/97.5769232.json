April 19, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case. We review the agency\u2019s denial of motions to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-20\">The BIA denied Momen\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than 90 days after the BIA issued its final order of removal, and because Momen did not identify any ground that would excuse the motion from the 90-day statutory filing deadline. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (providing that motions to reopen \u201cshall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3) (setting forth certain exceptions to the 90 day time limit for filing a motion to reopen). Momen does not now contend that his motion to reopen was timely or that it falls within any recognized exception to the statutory timeliness requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
