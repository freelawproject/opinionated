HSB filed its response opposing the motion and, further, asking that the Court allow it to collect the proceeds from the policy upon surrender of the policy. This dispute arises six years\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Christians, as chapter 7 debtors, received their discharge in bankruptcy. For the reasons stated below, the Court denies the Christians' request and both grants in part and denies in part HSB's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Christians filed their chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on February 29, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Several years prior to their bankruptcy, the Christians assigned, as collateral, the life insurance policy to HSB.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The policy is identified as \"Policy No. 50 14700IU\" and was issued by Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This policy, along with other items of collateral, secured the debts of the Christians to HSB, including a $ 70,000 promissory note made by the Christians to HSB on August 5, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The current dispute centers on who-HSB or the Christians-is entitled to the proceeds of the life insurance policy now that the Christians seek to redeem the policy for its cash value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Included with their bankruptcy petition, the Christians filed Schedule B that lists their interests in certain personal property; this schedule included a \"Life Insurance Policy\" with an assigned value of $ 16,359.20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Schedule D included HSB as a secured creditor holding several \"Purchase Money\" liens against personal property, including the life insurance policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (The Court assumes that HSB's interest in the policy is not a purchase money lien.)

A few months later, HSB and the Christians entered into an agreement that resolved the adversary proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Their joint motion that requested approval of their settlement agreement was granted, with an agreed order entered on November 2, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   This agreement provided for mutual releases and dismissal of the adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Of importance here, the Court-approved settlement agreement contained the following joint releases:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   4.

Second, it says that the signature is not that of Mr. Crabtree's but is instead Dewain Trayler's, another bank officer. And third, it points out that the purported release bears no attestation, date, or corporate seal. Mr. Crabtree credibly testified that the signature appeared to be Mr. Trayler's; he also testified that HSB does not have a copy of this document. It is unclear if the stamped-date, \"Nov 27 2006,\" on the document coincides with the purported release. By all accounts, the authenticity of this document is questionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, in support of their claim that they are entitled to the proceeds of the life insurance policy, the Christians note that they have been dutifully making monthly premium payments as required by the insurer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   HSB counters that, under the original assignment of life insurance policy, it was under no obligation to make premium payments on the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   HSB thus contends that the Christians' payment of premiums does not \"disqualif[y] HSB's recovery of the proceeds.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the hearing, in addition to Mr. Crabtree's testimony, the Court also received testimony from Mr. Christian. At the conclusion of argument and evidence, the Court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1334. This matter is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A), (K).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Release of Assignment, if valid, resolves the issues here in favor of the Christians. But its validity has been challenged. First, it is not clear when the release was signed. The Christians, through counsel, argue that the release may have been signed on November 27, 2006, but then state that the insurance company acknowledged the\n   <em>\n    assignment\n   </em>\n   in December 2006,\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the purported release date. Documentation of the claimed acknowledgement was not admitted into evidence. Second, the Christians claim that Doak Crabtree signed the release. Mr. Crabtree's testimony, however, contradicts this. He testified that the signature appears to be that of the Christians' loan officer, Dewain Trayler. Third, the evidence reflects that the Christians pledged the life insurance policy as collateral for an August 5, 2011 loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither HSB nor the Christians produced an original of the purported Release of Assignment. The Court cannot conclude that this document is authentic and thus assigns no weight to it. Indeed, the Christians' main argument is that the release granted them as part of the joint releases\n   <em>\n    under the parties' settlement agreement\n   </em>\n   caused HSB to release its interest in the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court turns to the release under the settlement agreement. Each of HSB and the Christians released the other of \"all liability, claims, demands, damages, actions, or suits ... of any kind ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Christians argue that the unlimited scope of the release means that HSB effectively released its claim to the life insurance policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   HSB submits that this is an improper reading of the release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   It argues that their settlement agreement resolved disputes between the parties that specifically did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   include any dispute over the life insurance policy. Thus the release language cannot be construed to affect the validity of the bank's interest in the claim against the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Local law, generally applicable to contracts, governs the construction and enforcement of settlement agreements.\n   <em>\n    Lake Eugenie Land Dev., Inc. v.

The purpose is to discern the parties' intent as expressed under the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The settlement agreement itself provides context. Its recitals state that HSB filed its complaint seeking a determination of the dischargeability of its debt under \u00a7 523 and relief from the automatic stay. In particular, it stated that the \"disputes and controversies\" resolved by the agreement concerned the \"dischargeability of [d]ebt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The May 3, 2012 joint motion for stay relief, the agreed order on such motion, and HSB's complaint that initiated the adversary proceeding also provide context to the parties' settlement agreement and further inform its terms. And they do so by not altering or inserting ambiguity into the terms of the agreement. The joint motion stated that HSB and the Christians agreed that the stay would be lifted and that certain items of HSB's collateral-including the life insurance policy-would be surrendered by the Christians.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agreed order confirmed and directed the parties' agreement. Then, a month later, HSB's complaint referenced the joint motion and agreed order and clarified that it addressed \"additional secured assets\" to those covered by the joint motion and agreed order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The settlement agreement and, in particular, its joint release provision are not ambiguous. The settlement agreement addressed the dischargeability of the Christians' debt to HSB and whether the stay should be lifted to the\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   collateral, i.e., the collateral that was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   subject of the prior joint stay motion and agreed order. Though the release language is broad and all-encompassing, it must be considered within the confines of the entire agreement. The parties' settlement agreement resolved the dischargeability of the Christians' debt to HSB and the parties' dispute concerning collateral not previously addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the specified consideration from the Christians, HSB agreed to release and discharge the balance of the Christians' debt to the bank. The release language does not state that the bank's interest in the insurance policy, which had already been dealt with, was released or waived. The extant facts and circumstances confirm this construction\n   of the settlement and the language of the release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although not critical to the Court's analysis, Mr. Crabtree testified to why HSB did not immediately liquidate the life insurance policy upon lifting of the stay. He stated that the bank made a business decision to hold the policy and thus potentially realize more value on its collateral. (It is not clear from the evidence if HSB, between May 7, 2012 and the filing date of the adversary proceeding, June 7, 2012, liquidated the other collateral (other than the life insurance policy) addressed by the joint stay motion.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In support of their position, the Christians state that they had, since the assignment of the policy, made all monthly premium payments to the insurer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument is an equitable one. Importantly, however, the assignment signed by the Christians and HSB specifically provides that HSB is not required to make premium payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence reveals that the Christians did indeed make monthly premium payments in an amount between $ 74 and $ 80 from November 2012 to December 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eighty-one months have passed since the stay was lifted on the life insurance policy on May 7, 2012. Had the Christians discontinued payment of the monthly premium when the life insurance policy was surrendered under the Court's order in 2012, HSB would have needed to either make the continuing premium payments (while it considered its options) or cash-in the policy for its value at that time to avoid cancellation of the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   While sympathetic to the Christians' position, the Court notes that its equitable powers are not limitless.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    UTSA Apartments, L.L.C. v.

Thus, where the requested fees are not disallowed by one or more of the enumerated exceptions of \u00a7 502, the Court concluded that a claim for attorney's fees is not disallowed solely because the fees were incurred by litigating issues of bankruptcy law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 449-54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553749\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/443/#p445\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Pride\n   </em>\n   , the Court considered both the majority and minority opinions on the issue and concluded that an unsecured creditor is not entitled to recover its postpetition fees from the debtor's estate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1173807\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/285/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1173807\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/285/366/\">\n    at 370-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). In accord with the majority opinions' analysis, the Court relied on four arguments to reach its conclusions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1173807\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/285/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1173807\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/285/366/\">\n    at 372-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, as \u00a7 506(b) permits\n   <em>\n    oversecured creditors\n   </em>\n   to recover their postpetition attorney's fees, it follows that such language prevents\n   <em>\n    unsecured or undersecured creditors\n   </em>\n   from recovering such fees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1173807\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/285/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1173807\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/285/366/\">\n    at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, and relying on the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Timbers\n   </em>\n   decision that denied recovery of an unsecured creditor's postpetition interest on its claim, the Court inferred that an unsecured creditor's attorney's fees are non-recoverable because \"[\u00a7] 506(b) speaks identically to attorney's fees as it does to interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1173807\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/285/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 372-73 (citing\n   <em>\n    United Sav.

Fourth, and finally, as a policy reason, \"[a]llowing unsecured creditors to recover postpetition fees is inequitable to other unsecured creditors and may, in some cases, consume the estate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"599703\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/365/#p372\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is so even if an unsecured creditor's attorney's fees arise as a matter of contract. \"[B]ankruptcy routinely alters creditors rights, and this is simply a situation where the policy of ratable distribution and equitable treatment of the varying interests in bankruptcy should override any asserted rights by unsecured creditors to recover attorney's fees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"599703\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/365/#p372\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"599703\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/365/#p372\">\n    at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, and most important, an analysis under \u00a7 506(b) is unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 506.04[3][a] (Richard Levin &amp; Henry J.
