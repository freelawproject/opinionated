Seidemann, to recover damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k) for an alleged violation of the automatic stay imposed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges defendants willfully violated the automatic stay when they continued to litigate a motion to hold plaintiff in contempt in the parties' state court matrimonial action after plaintiff filed his chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. Plaintiff's view is that litigation of the contempt motion, which sought to enforce a money judgment consisting of attorneys' fees awarded to Tomor as a result of plaintiff's alleged default under their divorce agreement, is not exempt from the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B) as an act to collect a domestic support obligation. Plaintiff also asks the Court to permanently enjoin defendants from litigating the contempt motion. In response, defendants argue that while matters were proceeding in state court post-petition, no action was taken by them to enforce the pre-petition money judgment. Additionally, defendants argue that even if their actions in the state court proceeding post-petition are construed as a demand for payment of the money judgment, those actions sought to collect upon a domestic support obligation and are exempt from the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B). Last but not least, defendants contend that if their post-petition conduct is not exempt from the automatic stay, such conduct was not taken in willful violation of the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Standing Order of Reference entered by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), dated August 28, 1986, as amended by Order dated December 5, 2012, effective\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   as of June 23, 2011.

To the extent that a finding of fact includes a conclusion of law, it is deemed a conclusion of law and vice versa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the following reasons, the Court finds in favor of plaintiff. Defendants willfully violated the automatic stay and, by statute, are liable for actual damages, including costs and attorneys' fees under \u00a7 362(k). The Court reserves judgment on actual damages pending submission of supplemental briefing, and will issue a separate order scheduling a hearing to determine the amount of appropriate damages. The Court declines to award plaintiff punitive damages and dismisses plaintiff's request for permanent injunctive relief as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. Findings of Fact\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following findings of fact are based on the trial record, which include the trial testimony, exhibits entered into evidence, and the parties' stipulation of certain facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Pre-Petition State Court Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff and Tomor are former spouses and have two children together. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3. They entered into a divorce stipulation of settlement (the \"Settlement\") dated July 27, 2010. Defs.' Ex. A; Stip. \u00b6 4. The Settlement provides that if either plaintiff or Tomor failed to comply with their respective obligations under the Settlement, the defaulting party will reimburse the non-defaulting party for legal fees incurred in connection with enforcing the Settlement, so long as the non-defaulting party prevails. Stip. \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. A at 41 (\"[T]he defaulting party ... agrees to indemnify the non-defaulting party against and/or to reimburse him/her for any and all expenses, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees resulting from or made necessary by the bringing of any suit or other legal proceeding to enforce any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this [Settlement].\"). If the non-defaulting party loses, he or she must reimburse the legal fees incurred by the other party. Defs.' Ex. A at 41. On May 3, 2011, a judgment of divorce was entered. Defs.' Ex. B; Stip.\u00b6 6. The judgment of divorce incorporated the Settlement. Stip. \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In May 2013, Tomor sought to enforce plaintiff's obligations under the Settlement and plaintiff sought to decrease his child support payments. Defs.' Ex. E at 2. Thereafter, Nassau County Supreme Court Judge Edward Maron entered a Consent Order, dated July 1, 2013, that required plaintiff to reinstate his child support payments and to cure any arrears, pay for one of his children's therapy, and restore Tomor as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy. Defs.' Ex. E \u00b6\u00b6 2, 12, 19; Stip. \u00b6 8. The Consent Order also provided that plaintiff must pay Tomor $ 18,000 for attorneys' fees she incurred during the enforcement proceeding. Defs.' Ex. E \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff defaulted under the Consent Order, and Tomor obtained a money judgment against plaintiff in the amount of $ 18,372.61, which consisted of the attorneys' fees owed to Tomor plus accrued interest (the \"Money Judgment\"). Defs.' Ex. I; Stip. \u00b6 9. On or about September 9, 2013, defendant Seidemann, Tomor's attorney in the post-judgment phase of her state court matrimonial action, served\n   plaintiff with an \"Information Subpoena.\" Defs.' Ex. J; Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10. Plaintiff did not respond to the Information Subpoena or fulfill his obligations set forth in the Consent Order, which included payment of the Money Judgment. Stip. \u00b6 11. As a result, on or about November 14, 2013, Seidemann moved by order to show cause to hold plaintiff in contempt for his alleged non-compliance with the Consent Order and for him to be imprisoned, again seeking to enforce the Money Judgment and obtain answers to the Information Subpoena (the \"Contempt Motion\"). Pl.'s Ex. 6; Stip. \u00b6 11; Tr. 17:14-18:1. The Contempt Motion did not request relief related to custody or visitation rights of plaintiff and Tomor's children. Stip. \u00b6 12. The return date of the Contempt Motion was December 5, 2013. Stip. \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 2, 2013, plaintiff, by his then-counsel in the state court proceeding, Steven Borofsky, submitted answers to the Information Subpoena. Stip. \u00b6 14. However, Seidemann was dissatisfied with plaintiff's answers. Seidemann emailed Borofsky and stated \"[he] will give [plaintiff] till [sic] Thursday to answer [the Information Subpoena] again truthfully. Otherwise, [he] will seek his incarceration.\" Stip. \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B. Plaintiff's Bankruptcy Case and Post-Petition State Court Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on December 3, 2013. Stip. \u00b6 1. On the petition date, plaintiff's bankruptcy counsel, Richard Kanter, faxed Seidemann a letter and called Seidemann's cellphone to advise him of plaintiff's bankruptcy filing. Pl.'s Ex. 9; Tr. 133:18-24, 134:7-139:1. However, Seidemann testified that he was not in his office on December 3 to receive the fax, Tr. 135:5-7, and that he was not definitively told by Kanter during the phone call that plaintiff actually filed a bankruptcy petition, Tr. 134:2-6. Although Seidemann claimed he did not have actual knowledge of the bankruptcy filing on December 3, the parties stipulated that both Seidemann and Tomor had actual notice of the filing \"at least prior to December 5, the return date of the Contempt Motion.\" Stip. \u00b6 16. Seidemann testified to the same. Tr. 146:14-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 5, 2013, the parties appeared in state court on the Contempt Motion. Stip. \u00b6 18. Debtor arrived in state court on this day under the impression that he would be sent to jail if he did not pay the Money Judgment. Tr. 106:10-107:10. Although it is defendants' position that the Contempt Motion was exempt from the automatic stay, Stip. \u00b6 17, Seidemann advised Judge Maron that it's possible that the relief he was seeking in the Contempt Motion was subject to the stay, Tr. 171:6-9. In spite of this awareness, Seidemann continued to prosecute the Contempt Motion in its entirety. Adv. Dkt. No. 34-13 at 24:9-16. Seidemann testified that Judge Maron was going to carry the motion \"to the end of time,\" Tr. 173:12-13, and Borofsky stated it to be \"the practice of Judge Mar[o]n to carry ... motions when he's not sure what to do with them,\" Adv. Dkt. No. 34-13 at 31:8-10. At the December 5 hearing, Judge Maron asked the parties to file briefs on the applicability of the automatic stay to the Money Judgment, and entered an order that directed the parties to appear for a conference on January 4, 2014 and appointed Jeffrey Halberich as the children's attorney. Adv. Dkt. No. 34-13 at 38:7-17, 41:4-7; Stip. \u00b6 19; Tr. 265:14-19. Thereafter, Seidemann submitted a brief and a proposed order to Judge Maron. Defs.' Ex. O. Borofsky did not file a brief because he was relieved as plaintiff's counsel shortly after the hearing and replaced by Danielle Seid-Vazana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following the December 5 hearing, there were five court appearances by the parties: December 19, January 14, February 6, April 17, and April 29. Stip. \u00b6 20; Tr. 256:24-257:2. There are no transcripts or other records of any of these hearings because of more than forty appearances before Judge Maron, the parties were on the record \"twice, maybe three times at most.\" Tr. 174:10-21. Seidemann testified he did not move forward with the Contempt Motion at any of these court proceedings and that there was \"zero discussion\" of it. Tr. 257:3-6. However, Seidemann's testimony is contradicted by both a letter he wrote to Seid-Vazana on December 16, 2013, which he claims Judge Maron instructed him to send, and Seid-Vazana's testimony. Seidemann's letter advised Seid-Vazana that she was \"scheduled to appear before Judge Maron on the Contempt Motion on January 14, 201[4],\" Pl.'s Ex. 15, and Seid-Vazana testified she appeared on January 14 for the Contempt Motion, Tr. 81:8-13. The Contempt Motion and Seidemann's letter caused Seid-Vazana to believe that plaintiff could potentially be incarcerated because she testified that she has had clients in the past who have been arrested and \"taken away in handcuffs.\" Tr. 20:18-21:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With respect to the December 19, February 6, and April 17 appearances, there is a lack of evidence to support a finding by this Court that they concerned the Contempt Motion. Seid-Vazana could not recall what matters those court appearances concerned, Tr. 41:22-44:7, and Halbreich had no knowledge of any discussions related to the Contempt Motion on those days because he only attended court conferences related to the children, Tr. 94:17-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Seidemann's December 16, 2013 letter to Seid-Vazana not only told her to appear in state court for the Contempt Motion on January 14, 2014, but it sought her opposition papers as well. Plaintiff's opposition to the Contempt Motion was filed in advance of the January 14, 2014 court conference, and Tomor's reply, which included her affidavit and an affirmation signed by Seidemann, was filed in March 2014. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25. Seidemann's affirmation and Tomor's affidavit both requested that the state court grant the Contempt Motion \"in its entirety.\" Stip. \u00b6 26. The Contempt Motion was marked fully submitted on or about April 29, 2014. Stip. \u00b6 29. Despite the Contempt Motion being marked fully submitted, on April 29, 2014, Seidemann advised the state court to \"hold off decision on any part of the [Contempt Motion], including the request to enforce the Money Judgment or compel answers to the Information Subpoena.\" Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 29. Also on April 29, 2014, Seidemann advised the state court that he was withdrawing the Information Subpoena. Stip. \u00b6 27. At no point prior to April 29, 2014 did Seidemann seek to withdraw or modify the Contempt Motion to exclude the demand for payment of the Money Judgment or advise plaintiff not to respond to the Information Subpoena. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 21, 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Money Judgment has since been vacated. Tr. 58:10-13. In August 2014, Seidemann withdrew the Contempt Motion. Tr. 223:4-9. No ruling was made by Judge Maron as to whether the Money Judgment is a domestic support obligation or whether the automatic stay applies to the relief sought in the Contempt Motion. Stip. \u00b6 23. Defendants did not move this Court for relief from the automatic stay to allow the Contempt Motion to proceed. Stip. \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II. Conclusions of Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As noted above, plaintiff alleges that defendants willfully violated the automatic stay imposed under \u00a7 362(a) when they\n   continued to litigate the Contempt Motion in state court after plaintiff commenced his bankruptcy case. Plaintiff asks this Court to assess both actual and punitive damages under \u00a7 362(k) for defendants' willful violation of the stay. The Court will first identify the burden of proof for plaintiff's cause of action, and then consider the legal principles applicable to the automatic stay. The Court will then resolve the three primary questions presented at trial: (1) whether defendants violated the automatic stay; (2) if so, whether the Money Judgment is a domestic support obligation and defendants' conduct is therefore exempt from the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B) ; and (3) if defendants' conduct is not allowed under \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B), whether that conduct constitutes a willful violation of the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A. Burden of Proof\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To prevail on his claim, plaintiff has the burden of proof to present evidence in support of the allegations in his complaint that defendants willfully violated the automatic stay and to prove those allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    In re Manchanda\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-10222 (JLG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203034693\">\n    2016 WL 3034693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (Bankr.

Three of the listed activities covered by the automatic stay are relevant to plaintiff's claim that defendants willfully violated the stay by continuing to litigate the Contempt Motion, and in particular, enforcement of the Money Judgment. Plaintiff relies on the provisions that stay: \"(1) the commencement or continuation, including the issuance or employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title, or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title; (2) the enforcement, against the debtor or against property of the estate, of a judgment obtained before the commencement of the case under this title; ...

As discussed below, the parties dispute whether the actions taken post-petition by defendants fall under the exception set forth in \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B). Section 362(b)(2)(B) provides that the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not operate as a stay against \"the collection of a domestic support obligation from property that is not property of the estate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B). In short, defendants maintain that any acts taken by them post-petition in respect of\n   the Money Judgment are exempt from the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B) as the collection of a domestic support obligation. For his part, plaintiff contends that \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B) is inapplicable because the Money Judgment is not a \"domestic support obligation\" as that term is defined in \u00a7 101(14A). Additionally, plaintiff asserts that if the Money Judgment is determined to be a domestic support obligation, defendants' conduct still does not fall within the ambit of the exception as defendants sought to enforce, not collect, the Money Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   C. Plaintiff Has Established that Defendants Violated the Automatic Stay\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Money Judgment was entered against plaintiff in August 2013. Pl.'s Ex. 4. In November 2013, Seidemann filed the Contempt Motion in state court to enforce payment of the Money Judgment, with the motion's return date scheduled for December 5, 2013. Adv. Dkt. No. 48 at 3; Pl.'s Ex. 6. Plaintiff filed his bankruptcy petition on December 3, 2013. Adv. Dkt. No. 48 at 1. While the filing of the Contempt Motion itself did not violate the automatic stay because it was filed before plaintiff commenced his bankruptcy case, the evidence in this case reveals that defendants' post-petition conduct violated the automatic stay. Specifically, defendants' conduct in respect of the pending Contempt Motion was prohibited by \u00a7 362(a)(1), (2), and (6). Those provisions protect the bankruptcy estate by prohibiting the very acts taken here by defendants, to wit, the continuation of a legal proceeding, the enforcement of a judgment obtained pre-petition, and an act to collect or recover a claim that arose pre-petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The facts show defendants had actual knowledge of the filing of plaintiff's bankruptcy case \"at least prior to December 5, 2013, the return date of the Contempt Motion,\" Stip. \u00b6 16, and Seidemann testified that was the case, Tr. 146:14-16. Even if defendants were unaware of plaintiff's bankruptcy filing, \"a party's knowledge of the [bankruptcy] filing is 'immaterial' to a determination of whether the stay was violated.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Prusan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198169\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/495/203/#p207\">\n    495 B.R. 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 207 (Bankr.

Despite having actual knowledge of plaintiff's bankruptcy case prior to the December 5 hearing on the Contempt Motion, Seidemann did not take any action to modify the relief sought by the Contempt Motion or discontinue the Contempt Motion in its entirety. Nor did he ask this Court for relief from the automatic stay. In the end, the prudent approach would have been for Seidemann to seek declaratory relief from this Court before taking any action with respect to the pending Contempt Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crysen/Montenay Energy Co. v.

Rather than filing a motion for relief from the automatic stay before proceeding in state court against plaintiff, Seidemann concluded that his actions were permissible. That was an incorrect assumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although Seidemann testified that he \"did nothing to enforce the [Money Judgment] after December 5\" and that \"there was no danger of the Contempt Motion being heard\" because Judge Maron was going to \"carry [the Contempt Motion] to the end of time,\" Seidemann's testimony is\n   belied by the events as they actually unfolded. He continued to litigate the motion post-petition. Tr. 173:12-15, 182:1-3. Seidemann's post-petition letter to Seid-Vazana reminded her of the scheduled court appearance before Judge Maron on the Contempt Motion and the date by which plaintiff's opposition to the Contempt Motion must be filed. After plaintiff's opposition was filed, Seidemann filed a reply, which still sought for the Contempt Motion to \"be granted in its entirety.\" Pl.'s Ex. 8; Tr. 47:18-25, 48:1-10. It is hardly the case that Seidemann \"did nothing\" to enforce the Money Judgment post-petition. The evidence introduced at trial demonstrates that defendants' post-petition conduct falls squarely within the ambit of \u00a7 362(a)(1), (2), and (6), and the Court finds that Seidemann's own actions in continuing to prosecute the Contempt Motion after plaintiff commenced his bankruptcy case violated the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Picard v.

Plaintiff has a different view. He argues that the Money Judgment was not entered for the purpose of awarding support to Tomor and/or to his children. Plaintiff contends that the Money Judgment is not a domestic support obligation and defendants' conduct is not exempt from the constraints of the automatic stay. Plaintiff also asserts that even if this Court were to conclude that the Money Judgment constitutes a domestic support obligation, defendants' conduct is still not\n   permitted under \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B) because defendants sought to enforce, not collect, the Money Judgment, and while collection is a protected activity, enforcement is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, the heart of the parties' dispute is not whether defendants took steps after the bankruptcy filing to obtain payment of the Money Judgment, but rather, whether the Money Judgment constitutes a domestic support obligation and whether the term \"collection\" in \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B) includes the enforcement of a domestic support obligation through contempt proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   1.

In ruling on whether the attorneys' fees were nondischargeable in the debtor's chapter 7 case, Judge Eisenberg found them to be nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(15) as a debt incurred in the course of a divorce or separation rather than under \u00a7 523(a)(5) as a domestic support obligation. As noted above, the definition of \"domestic support obligation\" in \u00a7 101(14A) includes debts owing to a spouse, former spouse, or child of a debtor that is in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support. The definition does not include debts arising from a division of marital property under a separation agreement or divorce decree. Those obligations are covered under \u00a7 523(a)(15). In a chapter 7 case, \u00a7 523(a)(15) excepts from discharge a debt that is not of the kind described in \u00a7 523(a)(5) and \"owed to a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor\" that was \"incurred by the debtor in the course of a divorce or separation or in connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree or other order of a court record.\" 11 U.S.C.\u00a7 523(a)(15) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734728\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/393/56/\">\n    393 B.R. at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, in holding that the debt at issue was excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(15) as opposed to \u00a7 523(a)(5), Judge Eisenberg found that\n   attorneys' fees awarded to a non-defaulting party pursuant to an indemnification provision in a divorce agreement did not constitute a domestic support obligation.\n   <em>\n    Golio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734728\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/393/56/\">\n    393 B.R. at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In further support of their argument, defendants cite to cases in which an award for attorneys' fees has been held to be a domestic support obligation. Although the Court agrees with the general premise that attorneys' fees awarded in a pre-petition matrimonial action may under certain circumstances fall within the definition of a domestic support obligation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734728\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/393/56/\">\n    393 B.R. at 61-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court notes that defendants' argument overlooks the basis for the attorneys' fees awarded by the Money Judgment. It is that basis which renders the Money Judgment distinguishable from the case law defendants cite. In\n   <em>\n    Rogowski\n   </em>\n   , a debtor's pre-petition obligation to pay his ex-spouse's matrimonial attorneys' fees awarded after a trial concerning various economic issues between the parties was held to be a domestic support obligation.\n   <em>\n    In re Rogowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195835\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/462/435/#p447\">\n    462 B.R. 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2011). However,\n   <em>\n    Rogowski\n   </em>\n   was rooted in New York Domestic Relations Law. The court in\n   <em>\n    Rogowski\n   </em>\n   analyzed New York Domestic Relations Law and found that awards of matrimonial attorneys' fees are only proper if, \"at a minimum, ... the former spouse requires financial support.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195835\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/462/435/#p447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195835\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/462/435/#p447\">\n    at 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found clear evidence the debtor's former spouse required financial support because she had no prospects for work other than part time unskilled jobs and had not worked in her chosen field for over 13 years at the time of divorce, that the debtor was the sole wage earner for the last 12 years of the marriage, and that there was no equitable distribution for either party to leave the marriage with.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195835\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/462/435/#p447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195835\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/462/435/#p447\">\n    at 446-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because New York Domestic Relations Law requires matrimonial attorneys' fees to only be awarded if financial support is required, a proper award of attorneys' fees under that same law \"is in the nature of ... support\" and satisfies the definition of a domestic support obligation under \u00a7 101(14A).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195835\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/462/435/#p447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195835\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/462/435/#p447\">\n    at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not the case here. The evidence presented at trial made clear that the attorneys' fees that formed the basis of the Money Judgment were contemplated and agreed upon by Tomor and the plaintiff in the event either of them were to default under the terms of the Settlement; the legal fees at issue were not awarded because they were required for financial support. Defs.' Ex. A at 41; Stip. \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Here, the Court finds no persuasive evidence that the obligation to pay attorneys' fees in this case is in the nature of alimony, maintenance or support. Simply stated, the attorneys' fees awarded to Tomor by reason of plaintiff's noncompliance with his obligations under the Settlement do not come within \u00a7 101(14A)'s definition. As noted above, the fees were intended to incentivize the performance by the parties under the Settlement rather than to provide support for Tomor and/or the parties' children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   There are three salient facts that support the Court's finding that plaintiff's obligation to pay attorneys' fees awarded by the Money Judgment is not a domestic support obligation as defined in \u00a7 101(14A). First, the default provision in the Settlement was not intended to exclusively benefit Tomor. Rather, the default provision was meant to protect both Tomor and plaintiff in the event either of them defaulted in their respective obligations under the Settlement. In addition, if, hypothetically, Tomor brought suit as the non-defaulting party and did not secure a judgment in her favor, under the terms of the default provision, she would be responsible for plaintiff's attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. A at 41. Second, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the Settlement contained a separate provision for attorneys' fees incurred by Tomor, not inclusive of those that could potentially be awarded under the default provision.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3485160,4130886\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/69/\">\n    586 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   75 ; Defs.' Ex. A at 46. The fact that the parties already contemplated Tomor's attorneys' fees, irrespective of those in the Money Judgment, weighs against finding the Money Judgment to be a domestic support obligation.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3485160,4130886\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/69/\">\n    586 F.3d at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lastly, the structure of the Settlement suggests the attorneys' fees are not in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support because the section in the Settlement that provides for attorneys' fees in the event of a default is separate from the sections that deal with child support, medical coverage, \"maintenance/spousal support/alimony,\" and marital property division. Defs.' Ex. A at 17, 30, 33;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Romano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4172746\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/548/39/#p46\">\n    548 B.R. at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering the structure of the terms of the final divorce decree to assess whether the parties intended to create a domestic support obligation). As noted, in\n   <em>\n    Golio\n   </em>\n   , Judge Eisenberg found an award of attorneys' fees made pursuant to a clause in a divorce agreement similar to the one between plaintiff and Tomor not to be a domestic support obligation for purposes of whether the debt at issue was excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(5). The Court agrees with Judge Eisenberg's rationale and holds that the Money Judgment is not a domestic support obligation, but is instead a debt \"incurred by the debtor in the course of a divorce or separation or in connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree or other order of a court of record.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(15) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734728\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/393/56/\">\n    393 B.R. at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   2. Is Litigating the Contempt Motion \"Collection\" or \"Enforcement\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Even if the Court had determined that the Money Judgment constitutes a domestic support obligation, the inquiry of whether defendants' conduct is exempt from the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B) would not end there. Identifying the Money Judgment as a domestic support obligation is only the first step in determining whether the exemption applies. The second step is to determine whether the exemption for \"the collection of a domestic support obligation\" in \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B) permits defendants to proceed unimpeded in state court to enforce plaintiff's financial obligation under the Money Judgment. The answer turns on how the term \"collection\" is construed. In other words, what does the term \"collection\" mean? Defendants urge the Court to broadly construe the term \"collection\" to include proceedings to enforce domestic support obligations, such as contempt proceedings. Adv. Dkt. No. 49 at 4-6. If defendants' reading of the statute is correct, the exception takes hold, and their post-petition conduct with respect to the Contempt Motion is free of the constraints imposed by the automatic stay. Of course, plaintiff disagrees. Plaintiff contends a narrower reading of \"collection\" is consistent with the express language found in other exceptions to the stay under \u00a7 362(b), and that \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B) cannot be read to encompass contempt proceedings to enforce domestic support obligations. Adv. Dkt. No. 51 at 5-10. While there is a split of authority on this issue, for the reasons that follow, the Court finds persuasive the reasoning of those courts that adhere to a narrow reading of the term \"collection\" when determining whether actions to enforce domestic support obligations transgress the automatic stay. The Court agrees with plaintiff's interpretation of \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B) that post-petition enforcement of a support obligation through contempt proceedings violates the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gorokhovsky v.

Section 362(b)(2)(B)'s exception to the automatic stay applies to \"the collection of a domestic support obligation that is not property of the estate.\" The word \"enforcement\" is notably omitted from \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B), but is included elsewhere in \u00a7 362(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 362(b)(2)(G), (4), (20), (21), (25)(A), (25)(B).

Adv. Dkt. No. 2-12; Tr. 220:24-221:5. Defendants did not produce a transcript of any hearing at which Judge Maron made such a ruling.

Accordingly, the Court does not find Seidemann's actions constituted \"aggravated circumstances that would warrant punitive damages.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Velichko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141053\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/473/64/#p70\">\n    473 B.R. 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 70 (Bankr.

Plaintiff's Request for a Permanent Injunction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiff also asks the Court to permanently enjoin defendants from enforcing the Money Judgment and compelling plaintiff to answer the Information Subpoena. Adv. Dkt. No. 51 at 1. The Court need not address plaintiff's request for permanent injunctive relief because Seidemann withdrew the Contempt Motion, plaintiff answered the Information Subpoena, and the Money Judgment was vacated\n   by the state court. Moreover, there is nothing in the trial record to support a finding that Seidemann will file another contempt motion seeking to relitigate issues regarding the Money Judgment or Information Subpoena. Tr. 247:20-248:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that defendants willfully violated the automatic stay. Having determined that a willful violation of the stay occurred, the Court reserves judgment on actual damages pending submission of supplemental briefing. The Court will issue a separate order setting forth a briefing schedule and a hearing date on actual damages. No other or further damages are appropriate. Plaintiff's request for a permanent injunction is dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    All statutory references to sections of the United States Bankruptcy Code,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    , will hereinafter be referred to as \"\u00a7 (section number)\".\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    For convenience, the Court will refer to filings in the adversary proceeding as \"Adv.

At trial, the contempt motion was referred to as both civil and criminal in nature. Tr. 21:7-8, 203:18. However, the language appearing on the face of the Contempt Motion is required by N.Y.C.P.L.R. \u00a7 756 for civil contempt and the type of relief sought was to vindicate Tomor's private rights under her divorce agreement with plaintiff, which is indicative of civil contempt, as opposed to the vindication of an offense against the public, which is indicative of criminal contempt.\n    <em>\n     In re White\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151397\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/478/177/#p182\">\n     478 B.R. 177\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 182 (Bankr.
