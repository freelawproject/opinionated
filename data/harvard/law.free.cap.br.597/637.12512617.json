Their counsel first submitted a fee application, CM-ECF Doc. No. 39, on October 17, 2018. The request stated \"[c]ounsel believes that interim compensation will not create an undue hardship on any party, since payments can be made in the usual course of the Chapter 13 plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20783\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 4. The application requests \"this amount to be paid as an administrative claim by the Chapter 13 Trustee pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20330\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 503(b), and 1326.\" Counsel's proposed order likewise asked that fees be paid through the debtors' plan. CM-ECF Doc. No. 41, at 2. The proposed order, but not the application, added that \"if the Debtors' case is dismissed, or converted, before this claim is paid in full, the Trustee will pay this administrative priority claim prior to refunding any funds to the Debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20330\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court deleted that last sentence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, on November 19, 2018, simply ordered that counsel's fees be paid through the plan. CM-ECF Doc. No. 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   But there was no confirmed plan at the time the fee order was signed. That same day, the trustee objected to confirmation of the debtors' plan, an objection the Court sustained. The Court's December 10, 2018 order (docketed on December 11) required the debtors to file an amended plan or convert their case to Chapter 7 on or before December 28, 2018. CM-ECF Doc. No. 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 21, 2018, the debtors' counsel filed correspondence, noting the differences between their original proposed fee order and the edited order signed by the Court. Counsel stated \"the original Application should have been clearer as to the Debtors' intentions. The Debtors are under an existing Order to convert the case or file a Modified Plan.... Counsel wishes to be paid the awarded fees upon conversion of the case.\" CM-ECF Doc. No. 50. Counsel attached another copy of their original proposed order for fees, and asked the Court to vacate its November 19, 2018 order, and instead enter the originally proposed order with the alternative language about payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 28, 2018, the Court directed counsel to file their letter request in the form of a formal motion with supporting\n   memorandum. The Court also directed counsel to address\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Viegelahn\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116248\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1829/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20783\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), and the ensuing split among courts on the question of whether the Chapter 13 trustee can pay approved administrative expenses when a preconfirmation case is to be converted to Chapter 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court requested a responsive memorandum from the trustee, and extended the time for the debtors to amend their plan or convert. CM-ECF Doc. No. 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Counsel thereafter submitted a motion to vacate and memorandum of law. CM-ECF Doc. Nos. 55, 54, 57. The motion reiterated that \"it is the intention of the debtors to convert this case to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy prior to confirmation, and counsel therefore wishes to be paid the approved fees prior to conversion.... Should the Court agree the approved fees can be paid prior to conversion, any remaining funds the Trustee is holding above and beyond the fees awarded and paid to counsel will be paid to debtors upon conversion.\" The motion also stated, \"[c]ounsel for debtors hereby requests that the order is corrected so as to account for the likelihood that this case will be converted to Chapter 7, and that any approved fees are paid to counsel prior to conversion.\" CM-ECF Doc. No. 55, at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trustee also filed a legal memorandum. CM-ECF Doc. No. 58. The Chapter 13 trustee has $ 5,735.88 on hand. The fee application seeks $ 2,750.00. No parties have objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Rule 60 Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The debtors' counsel filed a motion to vacate this Court's order of November 19, 2018, an order which allowed counsel's fees to be paid through the debtors' plan. Counsel's motion cites Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9024, which incorporates Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60, to support their request to vacate due to \"an omission from that order, as well as any other reason that justifies relief.\" CM-ECF Doc. No. 55, at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a), made applicable by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9024, provides that \"[t]he court may correct a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission whenever one is found in a judgment, order, or other part of the record. The court may do so on motion or on its own, with or without notice.\" The bankruptcy court may correct an order under Rule 60(a) if the error was mechanical in nature and not the result of a deliberate choice, and the correction reflects the intent of the bankruptcy court at the time it entered the order.\n   <em>\n    In re McClellan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191123\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/459/371/#p373\">\n    459 B.R. 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 373 (Bankr.

Counsel wishes to be paid the awarded fees upon conversion of the case.\" CM-ECF Doc. No. 50. Attorney oversight rarely warrants relief from an order.\n   <em>\n    In re Kellogg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633568,12148380\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/197/1116/\">\n    197 F.3d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1120 n.3 (11th Cir. 1999) (addressing Rule 60 relief generally). In any event, and as will be discussed further below, the Court's deletion of one sentence from counsel's proposed order was consistent with the application requesting that fees be paid through the plan and was a deliberate edit by the Court. If an error of \"substantive judgment\" is alleged, correction of such errors is outside the ambit of Rule 60(a),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Whelan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420722\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/157/\">\n    582 B.R. 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167 n.16 (Bankr. E.D. Tex. 2018). Accordingly, Rule 60(a) is not a basis to vacate the November 19, 2018 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rule 60(b), also cited by the Letties' counsel, provides other grounds for relief from an order. On motion and just terms, the Court may relieve a party from a final order for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (4) the judgment is void;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (6) any other reason that justifies relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The first five clauses and the catchall clause, clause (6), are mutually exclusive, so that if the asserted grounds for relief fall within one of the first five clauses, relief under the catchall section is not available.\n   <em>\n    Webb v. James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358856\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/617/#p622\">\n    147 F.3d 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 622 (7th Cir. 1998). Counsel's motion invokes the catchall section. Courts repeatedly caution, however, that Rule 60(b), and thus Rule 9024, \" 'is an extraordinary remedy' which is to be granted only 'in exceptional circumstances.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Dorff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5899886\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/480/919/#p922\">\n    480 B.R. 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 922 (Bankr. E.D. Wis. 2012) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Counsel has effectively conceded that exceptional circumstances are absent: \"Counsel now realizes that the original Application should have been clearer as to the Debtors' intentions.\" Counsel submitted the application and plainly and solely asked that fees be paid as part of the debtors' plan. Although the relief sought in counsel's application and proposed order didn't match up exactly, the Court edited the order before entering it. If Rule 60(b)(6), the catchall provision, is mutually exclusive of 60(b)(1), which concerns mistake or neglect,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webb v. James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358856\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/617/#p622\">\n    147 F.3d at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , then counsel's err in \"lack of clarity\" cannot constitute the exceptional circumstances envisioned by Rule 60(b)(6) to otherwise justify relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   But there may be another circumstance that could justify relief. Arguably, a portion of the Court's own directive to counsel to follow proper procedure, and seek reconsideration or vacation of an order not by letter but by formal motion, could have created a basis to justify reconsideration under Rule 60(b)(6). It is the second part of the Court's December 28, 2018 directive, the part which requested both the debtors' counsel and the Chapter 13 trustee to address the\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Viegelahn\n   </em>\n   holding and progeny, that could be read to open the door to reconsideration. Accordingly, the Court will take a second look.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Counsels' Argument on Reconsideration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The debtors' counsel contend that\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Viegelahn\n   </em>\n   does not preclude payment of approved fees upon conversion, but simply requires that any such approved fees must be paid before the conversion, citing --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116248\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1829/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1837-38,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20783\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Counsel also cite\n   <em>\n    Molloy v. Sikes\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 16-0218,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20794708\">\n    2018 WL 794708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. La. Feb. 7, 2018). There, a bankruptcy court denied a Chapter 13 debtor's counsel's request for fees, after the debtor had filed a request to convert the case to a Chapter 7 before any plan confirmation. The district court reversed, finding that the bankruptcy court had abused its discretion in applying the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   to deny the fee application. The\n   <em>\n    Molloy\n   </em>\n   court disagreed that a historical practice of requiring confirmation before approving fee requests was a sufficient basis, citing the high failure rate of Chapter 13 cases.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20794708\">\n    2018 WL 794708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Next, the Letties' counsel argue that 11 U.S.C. section 330 is silent as to whether confirmation is required before a Chapter 13 trustee may pay counsel fees. Counsel look for support from\n   <em>\n    In re Woerner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148752,4162436\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/783/266/\">\n    783 F.3d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274 (5th Cir. 2015), to argue that section 330 contemplates that counsel ought to be reimbursed, even if unable to achieve the desired result for his or her client. A \"good gamble\" should be compensated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CM-ECF Doc. No. 54, at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As a last argument, the debtors' counsel note that 11 U.S.C. section 331 permits interim compensation, even occasionally in Chapter 13 cases. Counsel assert that \"nothing in section 331 requires confirmation of the plan as a prerequisite to awarding interim compensation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   While not advocating a particular outcome, the Chapter 13 trustee filed a memorandum outlining some of the caselaw on either side of the fee disbursement question. First, the trustee points to\n   <em>\n    In re Brandon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329363\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/537/231/\">\n    537 B.R. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. Md. 2015) and\n   <em>\n    In re Hayden\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-12619-BMW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203047782\">\n    2018 WL 3047782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

D. Ariz. June 25, 2018). According to the trustee, those cases involve Chapter 13 debtors who converted their cases, preconfirmation, to Chapter 7 cases. In\n   <em>\n    Brandon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329363\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/537/231/\">\n    537 B.R. at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Maryland bankruptcy court noted \"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   does not preclude the court from directing Chapter 13 trustees to pay funds remaining in their possession to debtor's counsel up to the amount of the attorney's fee allowed in cases that are dismissed or converted prior to confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Brandon\n   </em>\n   agreed with\n   <em>\n    In re Michael\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632816,4161855\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/305/\">\n    699 F.3d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2012), and both courts relied on the third sentence of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), \"[i]f a plan is not confirmed, the trustee shall return any such payments not previously paid and not yet due and owing to creditors pursuant to paragraph (3) to the debtor, after deducting any unpaid claim allowed under section 503(b).\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hayden\n   </em>\n   concluded that \"the decision in the\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   case does not preclude this Court from approving the payment of allowed administrative expenses, including attorneys' fees, from funds held by the Chapter 13 trustee in a case converted to Chapter 7 prior to confirmation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203047782\">\n    2018 WL 3047782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The trustee then acknowledged that a number of courts disagree with\n   <em>\n    Brandon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hayden\n   </em>\n   , and require that funds be returned to the debtor upon conversion, including\n   <em>\n    In re Beckman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317339\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/536/446/\">\n    536 B.R. 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

D.N.M. 2015). Similarly, a more recent decision granted the administrative claim of the debtor's counsel for fees, but denied the request that the Chapter 13 trustee be ordered to pay plan payments she had on hand to cover the attorney fees.\n   <em>\n    In re Brown\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-00189,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20122832\">\n    2019 WL 122832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D.D.C. Jan. 7, 2019). In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the debtor converted his case on the same day his counsel filed the application for administrative expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the outset, it should be clear that whether counsel ably represented Mr. and Mrs. Lettie is not at issue. The record amply manifests counsel's efforts to advocate for these debtors-not only the filing of the petition and a proposed plan, but preparation of a motion to continue the stay, marshalling of several affidavits, and appearance at several hearings and \u00a7 341 meetings. These items necessarily required multiple discussions with the debtors themselves, other witnesses, and communication with the debtors' primary creditor as well as with the Chapter 13 trustee. Dealing with the debtors' housefire on the eve of a motion to continue the stay hearing, while primarily traumatic for the debtors, certainly required additional advocacy resources from counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The legal question presented, whether the trustee can pay allowed fees on the eve of conversion when no plan has been confirmed, assumes that the initial inquiries of reasonable and beneficial service to the debtor, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20330\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , are satisfied. Moreover, the Court does not read counsel's Rule 60(b) motion to seek to vacate the conclusion that fees were reasonable. That conclusion stands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, counsel argues briefly that interim compensation is allowed in some instances, citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20331\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But section 331 itself has little bearing on the present question, as, despite counsel's argument now, the instant application cannot fairly be read to seek \"interim\" payment. One sentence in the application does use the term: \"Counsel believes that interim compensation will not create an undue hardship on any party, since payments can be made in the usual course of the Chapter 13 plan.\" CM-ECF Doc.

Courts are now divided over whether the trustee can pay administrative expenses such as the debtor's attorney before refunding funds to the debtor; most courts hold that compensation can be paid to an attorney only on a preconfirmation\n    <em>\n     dismissal\n    </em>\n    , when the attorney's compensation has been allowed as an administrative claim under \u00a7 503(b).\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Persuasive caselaw recognizes that the text of section 331, which provides court discretion to award interim compensation where counsel has been employed under section 327, is seldom if ever applicable to Chapter 13 counsel, whose employment need not be approved by the bankruptcy court.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Stevens\n    </em>\n    , No. 05-12056 MER,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202711467\">\n     2006 WL 2711467\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , *1-2 (Bankr.
