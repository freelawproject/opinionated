Payments under clauses (i) through (iii) above shall be made annually over a five year period, with the first payment payable within five (5) business days following the freeze, adoption or election, respectively. Any deferred payments of incentive bonuses shall be immediately accelerated and paid in full in the event of (A) the Executive's termination without Cause, termination by the Executive for Good Reason or as a result of the Executive's death or Disability or (B) upon a 'Change in Control'....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Article 5 of the Employment Contract, captioned \"Payments upon Termination,\" provides in relevant part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"(a)\n   <em>\n    Involuntary Termination\n   </em>\n   . If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company during the Term, the\n   Executive shall be entitled to receive his Base Salary and unreimbursed expenses accrued and unpaid through the date of termination (the \"\n   <em>\n    Termination Date\n   </em>\n   \"). The Executive shall also receive any nonforfeitable benefits already earned and payable to him under the terms of any deferred compensation, incentive or other benefit plan maintained by the Company, payable in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan. The payments and benefits that the Executive shall be entitled to pursuant to this\n   <em>\n    Section 5(a)\n   </em>\n   are collectively referred to as the Executive's '\n   <em>\n    Accrued Compensation\n   </em>\n   .'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"(b)\n   <em>\n    Severance Payments\n   </em>\n   . If the Executive's employment is terminated (i) by the Company without Cause or (ii) by the Executive for Good Reason, then in addition to payment of the Accrued Compensation and any deferred payments of performance incentive bonuses pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Section 3(b)\n   </em>\n   , the Company shall also be obligated to make a series of monthly payments to the Executive for a period of twenty-four (24) months immediately following the Termination Date so long as the Executive continues to comply with\n   <em>\n    Sections 8\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    9\n   </em>\n   hereof\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Paragraphs 5(d) and 5(e) of the Employment Contract provide that if Woods' employment is terminated for Cause or if Woods voluntarily terminates his employment not for Good Reason, he shall be entitled only to the Accrued Compensation. Paragraph 5(f) provides, \"In order to receive the severance payments and benefits hereunder (other than the Accrued Compensation), the Executive must execute and not revoke a general release of claims in favor of the Company [in the form attached to the Contract] ... within 60 days following the Termination Date.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, as provided in Employment Contract \u00b6 3(b), Woods shall be entitled to three specifically described incentive bonuses, which shall be payable annually over five years after the applicable triggering event but which shall be accelerated and paid fully upon certain events, including Woods' termination without Cause. The right to such acceleration is confirmed in Employment Contract \u00b6 5(b) under the heading \"Severance Payments,\" along with the provision of twenty-four months of separate severance payments equal to Base Salary for each year. Employment Contract \u00b6\u00b6 5(d) and (e) make it clear, however, that the incentive bonuses and twenty-four months of severance payments shall not be paid if Woods is terminated for Cause or voluntarily terminates his employment without Good Reason, in contrast with \"Accrued Compensation,\" which shall be paid to him in such circumstances, and under \u00b6 5(f) they never will be paid unless he timely signs the release described therein (the \"Release\"). Paragraph 5(a)'s definition of \"Accrued Compensation\" encompasses \"nonforfeitable benefits already earned\n   <em>\n    and payable\n   </em>\n   to [Woods] under the terms of any deferred compensation, incentive or other benefit\n   <em>\n    plan\n   </em>\n   maintained by [21C]...\" (emphasis added). It therefore does not include the specific incentive bonuses set out in paragraph 3(b), which are not part of a 21C compensation, incentive or other benefit plan, and, in any event, would not cover them to the extent that they are not yet payable under the five-year payout terms of paragraph 3(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Claim asserts that all three incentive bonuses in Employment Contract \u00b6 3(b)(i)-(iii) were triggered prepetition -\n   on December 28, 2015, in February 2015 and on or about July, 2015, respectively. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 43, 46 and 49, and 52. The Claim seeks only $ 9 million of such bonuses because 21C made the initial, $ 1 million payment on the first, $ 5 million bonus in January 2016.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    Id. \u00b6 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition to the two issues presently before the Court, the Debtors originally objected to $ 500,000 of Woods' \"severance\" claim and raised or reserved the right to raise other defenses to the Claim, including Woods' delay in executing the Release, and counterclaims. They have since waived all such objections, defenses and counterclaims, however, on the conditions that the Court decide the two remaining issues and Woods sign the Release. Hearing Tr. at 24-27; Debtors' Reply Memorandum, dated August 24, 2018, at \u00b6 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Implicitly, this means that the Debtors have conceded that the triggers for the incentive bonuses under Employment Contract \u00b6 3(b)(i)-(iii) have occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Debtors of course continue to contend that the portion of those bonuses that were not due and payable before or on Woods' termination, except by acceleration under Employment Contract \u00b6\u00b6 3(b) and 5(b), are subject to the cap on allowance under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7). They also contend that section 502(b)(7) precludes Woods' claims to pre-judgment interest and attorneys fees in their entirety. Nor have they conceded that Woods would be entitled to both of the bonuses described in Employment Contract \u00b6 3(b)(ii) and (iii), as opposed to one or the other. Because of these remaining objections, the Debtors contend that the Claim should be reduced and allowed in the amount of $ 3,515,000, as follows: (a) $ 1,000,000 of \"severance\" equal to one year's Base Salary, (b) $ 1,000,000 of incentive bonus under Employment Contract \u00b6 3(b)(i), comprising one year's installment of the remaining four years of such bonus payable post-termination without acceleration, (c) $ 1,500,000 of incentive bonus under Employment Contract \u00b6 3(b)(ii), comprising (i) two payments due and owing pre-termination and (ii) one year's installment of the remaining bonus payments payable post-termination without acceleration, and (d) a $ 15,000 COBRA benefit under Employment Contract \u00b6 5(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Woods' right to attorneys fees under applicable non-bankruptcy law also is not absolute, unlike his Florida law right to prejudgment interest.

The Debtors have not meaningfully disputed the other elements of Woods' Claim, so there was nothing there for Woods to prevail on. Therefore, Woods is not now entitled to allowance of any postpetition attorneys fees under Florida law, although if he prevails in the dispute over whether the bonuses in \u00b6 3(b)(ii) and (iii) are mutually exclusive, he might be entitled under Florida law to attorneys fees related thereto, unless they are precluded by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The parties make essentially the same arguments under section 502(b)(7) regarding Woods' right to prevailing party attorneys fees as they do with respect to his prejudgment interest claim, and the Court applies the same analysis. As discussed above, Woods' claim to attorneys fees as damages arising from termination of the Employment Contract should be read as \"compensation\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7) for such breach, even if provided for by statute, as discussed above. However, also as discussed above, because such fees are not \"provided by the contract,\" Woods' claimed attorneys fees should be disallowed under the plain terms of section 502(b)(7)(A) to the extent they pertain to compensation that had not accrued without acceleration before termination, that is, the disputed capped portion of the Claim. On the other hand, if Woods prevails on this claim to a third bonus, under Florida Statutes \u00a7 448.08 Woods' attorney fee claim should be allowed to the extent incurred litigating that issue as to the non-capped portion of the Claim, as an incident to or derivative of the compensation due under the Employment Contract, without acceleration, on or before the termination date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This latter conclusion applied in\n   <em>\n    Irvine-Pacific Commer.

D. Del. 2001), the court addressed the right to legal fees relating, instead, to a capped claim, holding that that if the entitlement to fees had been agreed by the contract parties, they would be included in the claim,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9442997\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/274/111/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9442997\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/274/111/\">\n    at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subject to the cap, which is consistent with this Court's view of section 502(b)(7)(A)'s \"provided by such contract\" requirement.

In determining whether an ambiguity exists, the Court may rely on its own logic when interpreting an ambiguous provision and should favor a rational result.\n   <em>\n    Royal Oak Landing Homeowner's Ass'n v.

The first, that the bonus in \u00b6 3(b)(i) is separated by a semi-colon from the other available bonuses in that paragraph, while the remaining bonuses are separated by commas, is not persuasive. The list of available bonuses following \u00b6 3(b)(1) that are separated by commas includes not only the two that the Debtors contend are mutually exclusive but also, in \u00b6 3(b)(iv), \"other cash bonuses as agreed to in writing in the future between [Woods] and the Chief Executive Officer with approval from the Compensation Committee.\" Moreover, none of the bonuses listed in \u00b6 3(b)(ii) through (iv), are separated by the word \"or,\" and the last item in the list is preceded by the word \"and,\" not \"or\", which suggests that each possible bonus is separate, not that they are mutually exclusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Debtors' other argument is more plausible. The only difference between the triggers for the bonuses found in \u00b6 3(b)(ii) and (iii) is that in \u00b6 3(b)(iii) 21C has\n   <em>\n    initially elected to participate\n   </em>\n   in any way in the \"new multi-bundled payment system for freestanding radiation therapy centers\" whose mere adoption by the government,\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   21C's election to participate, is the trigger for the bonus in \u00b6 3(b)(ii). Thus, if one were to portray the two possible bonuses by a Venn diagram, the latter would be wholly subsumed by the former.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Under Woods' interpretation of \u00b6 3(b), 21C could trigger \u00b6 3(b)(iii)'s bonus on top of \u00b6 3(b)(ii)'s bonus - payable, of course, over five years unless accelerated on Contract termination - by making such an election mere minutes after the payment system's adoption. Indeed, under Woods'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   interpretation, 21C could initially elect to participate in the government's new payment system, triggering the \u00b6 3b(iii) bonus, and then elect not to participate, triggering the \u00b6 3(b)(ii) bonus, although 21C's subsequent election not to participate surely would connote a lesser value to 21C from the government's mere adoption of the payment system. Could it really be logical, then, that the two bonuses be separately earned when the former is so easily subsumed by the latter?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The portion of Employment Contract \u00b6 3(b) that states how the bonuses are to be paid gives some context, but of only limited utility. It provides that \"the first payment [of a bonus is] payable within five (5) business days following\n   <em>\n    the freeze, adoption or election, respectively\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added). A serial comma between \"adoption\" and \"or election\" clearly would have helped Woods' interpretation. Its absence is not dispositive for the Debtors' interpretation, however, because a comma's inclusion in such a series is not a strict grammatical requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Telenor Mobile Commc'ns AS v.
