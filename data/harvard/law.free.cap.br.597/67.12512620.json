Mangan (\"Chapter 7 Trustee\") in this Chapter 7 avoidance action. Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550, and 551 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Chapter 7 Trustee seeks to recover as constructive fraudulent transfers certain payments made by Michael Hamadi (\"Debtor Husband\") and Mirna Y. Hamadi (collectively, \"Debtors\") to UConn for college tuition and fees paid on behalf of their adult son Ali Hamadi (\"Ali\"). For the reasons stated herein, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II. JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and may hear and determine this matter pursuant to the District Court's General Order of Reference dated September 21, 1984. UConn filed the instant Motion in this adversary proceeding, which the Chapter 7 Trustee asserts is a core proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and (H).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Venue is proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court notes the following undisputed material facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Debtors filed a voluntary petition (Case No. 16-20653 (JJT), ECF No. 1) for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection on April 26, 2016 (\"Petition Date\"). Def.'s D. Conn. L. Civ. R. 56(a)(1) Statement \u00b6 1, ECF No. 16; Pl.'s D. Conn. L. Civ. R. 56(a)(2) Statement \u00b6 1, ECF No. 21. On December 14, 2017, the Chapter 7 Trustee commenced this adversary proceeding by filing the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ali is the Debtors' son, who was an adult at all times relevant to this adversary proceeding. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 3; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 3. Ali enrolled as an undergraduate student at UConn from August 2014 through September 2016. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 4; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 4. UConn received tuition payments and fees in exchange for providing the value of a college education to Ali. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 14; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   UConn bills each of its students for tuition, fees, and expenses through an online portal called the Student Administration System (\"Online Portal\"). Def.'s Statement \u00b6 5; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 5. UConn maintains the Online Portal, and every student possesses a unique NetID and password, giving him access to the Online Portal. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 6; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 6. UConn treats every payment to a student's account as credit belonging to the individual student, rather than the third-party individual who made the payment on the student's behalf. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 11; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 11. If a student chooses to enroll in university classes at UConn, UConn thereafter retains the money paid and applies it to the student's tuition bill. Def.'s Aff. \u00b6 9, ECF No. 15-2; Def.'s Statement \u00b6 12; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 12. If a student chooses not to register for classes or withdraws from UConn, then UConn issues a refund directly to the student, regardless of who paid the money to the student account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s Aff. \u00b6 10; Def.'s Statement \u00b6 13; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ali held his student account (\"Account\") in the Online Portal in his name only. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 7; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 7. The Debtors exerted no ownership or control over his Account and did not have any rights in or to the Account. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 7; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 7. In the two years preceding the Petition Date, the Debtor Husband made four electronic payments to Ali's Account through the Online Portal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s \u00b6 8; Pl.'s \u00b6 8. UConn retained\n   and applied each of the pre-petition payments to Ali's tuition bill when he registered for 2014 fall semester, 2015 spring semester, and 2016 spring semester classes. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 12; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 12. Although the payments made on August 25, 2014 and January 20, 2015 would have entitled Ali to a full refund, he would have only been entitled to a 90% refund on January 22, 2016 and a 25% refund on February 15, 2016 if he decided not to register for classes or to withdraw from UConn (\"Refundable Payments\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Suppl. Aff. \u00b6 5. Ali would have been unable to receive a refund for the remaining 10%, totaling $ 636.35, and 75%, totaling $ 2,393.81, respectively, even if he withdrew from UConn or did not enroll in classes (\"Nonrefundable Payments\").\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After the Petition Date, on September 1, 2016, the Debtor Husband made three additional electronic payments totaling $ 3,426.75 into Ali's Account via the Online Portal (\"Post-Petition Payments\"). Def.'s Statement \u00b6\u00b6 9-10; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   UConn accepted the Refundable Payments and Nonrefundable Payments in good faith. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 15; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 15. UConn only first learned that the Refundable Payments, Nonrefundable Payments, and Post-Petition Payments were in dispute in February 2017 when it received a demand letter from the Chapter 7 Trustee. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 16; Pl.'s Statement \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In connection to this Motion, UConn submitted the Affidavit of Margaret Selleck, UConn's Bursar (\"Affidavit,\" ECF No. 15-2). UConn also filed the Supplemental Affidavit in Support of the Motion sworn to by Nicole LeBlanc, Associate Bursar for UConn (\"Supplemental Affidavit,\" ECF No. 35). The Chapter 7 Trustee does not dispute that the payments made to Ali's Account were treated according to the school policies laid out in the Affidavit and Supplemental Affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   IV. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.

Constructive Fraudulent Avoidance Claims Asserted in the Complaint\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court is tasked with determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the alleged constructive fraudulent conveyances preventing the Court from granting summary judgment in UConn's favor. The Chapter 7 Trustee bases her claims against UConn on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), 550, and 551. Noticeably\n   absent in the Chapter 7 Trustee's Complaint is any claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20549\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to avoid the Debtor Husband's Post-Petition Payments. UConn seeks summary judgment on all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   UConn asserts two defenses in its Motion: 1) that Ali was the initial transferee of the tuition payments, and pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), UConn acted as Ali's immediate transferee when it received the tuition payments, which it took for value, in good faith, and without knowledge of the voidability of the transfers, and 2) that any tuition payments made on September 1, 2016 occurred post-petition. The Chapter 7 Trustee counters in her Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Motion (\"Opposition Memo,\" ECF No. 20) that UConn is an initial transferee because it exercised dominion and control over the monies once the Debtor Husband deposited them into Ali's Account. The Chapter 7 Trustee does not raise material issues of fact relating to the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) good faith defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After reviewing the Motion, the parties' Local Rule 56(a) Statements, the Opposition Memo, UConn's Reply to the Opposition Memo (ECF No. 27), the Affidavit, and the Supplemental Affidavit, this Court finds and adjudges that: 1) UConn is both an initial transferee and an immediate transferee under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), depending on the transfer date of the tuition payments; 2) UConn has established the elements of a good faith defense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) as an immediate transferee; and 3) the Post-Petition Payments are not avoidable or recoverable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   or 550.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C. Payment Timing Determines UConn's Status as an Initial Transferee or Immediate Transferee of Such Initial Transferee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To determine the status of an initial transferee, the Second Circuit has adopted the \"mere conduit\" test in\n   <em>\n    Christy v.

This Court expressly adopts the reasoning of these two decisions, as applied below, as determinative of this Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the Refundable Payments here were placed in an account maintained by UConn, they were ultimately property of Ali, and UConn did not immediately have the right to use the Refundable Payments for its own purposes.

Under this arrangement, Ali was the initial transferee, and UConn served as a mere conduit who did not have dominion and control over the Refundable Payments until only thereafter accepting the tuition payments, as an immediate transferee, once Ali enrolled. The same however cannot be said for UConn's treatment of the Nonrefundable Payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, timing is everything.

The \"good faith\" prong is uncontested here, and the \"without knowledge\" component was ostensibly conceded by the Chapter 7 Trustee when she agreed that UConn only learned about the payments being in dispute in February 2017, well after UConn received the Refundable Payments in satisfaction of Ali's tuition obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As for the \"for value\" piece, the Chapter 7 Trustee does not dispute that UConn provided value to Ali in exchange for the Refundable Payments. She also does not make any arguments that the Debtors must be the parties to receive value, and even if she did, the case law does not support such an outcome. As Chief Judge Craig laid out in her decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Adamo\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he statute does not say 'value to the debtor'; it says 'value'....
