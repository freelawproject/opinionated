This opinion concerns only the Cash Collateral Motion.

There are also several violations to the Stefanini lease detailed below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   The elevators in Tower 100 parking deck are completely inoperable. One elevator is boarded up completely. In talking with the facility manager at Stefanini, there has been an ongoing water issue with the roof of the walk way between the building and the parking deck that has allowed water to run down to the\n   elevator pits.... Tenant expressed that when the elevators would go down in the building in the past that the owner was non-responsive and per the lease (Section 8.05) there are [to] be two elevators operational 24/7....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   The HVAC equipment has been an issue for Stefanini, the existing tenant in the building. They have not had heat dating back to last winter and were told several pipes burst last year on the vacant floors. In walking the vacant floors, it was observed that much of the baseboard piping is broken, some beyond repair, and needing immediate replacement....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   During rain storms the roof to the walkway would leak. In addition, the broken drain pipe was causing water to pour into the parking deck. This would make the entrance to the parking deck and walkway a slip hazard for the tenant. Stefanini has minor leaks on their 7th floor from the roof that have not been addressed....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   The parking deck security system is inoperable. The gates to the parking deck were removed since it would not open. The cameras are inoperable in the parking deck as well. Since the elevators do not work, the parking deck is not ADA compliant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   There are several cracked/broken windows throughout the property.

The lobby has not been completed. There are no ceiling tiles, no flooring, or bathrooms. Most of the 1st floor has been gutted but very little has been started. Mold was found on the wallcovering, peeled back from the wall. There is an ongoing leak in what was the men's restroom that was not addressed but a trash can was put in place to catch water.... The heating units put in place in the corridor on the 1st floor do not work according to the facility manager at Stefanini. In addition, because the tenant cannot get a Certificate of Occupancy, a 24/7 fire watch is in place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Per the lease for Stefanini (Section 8.09 of the Lease) and Federal Mogul, 24/7 security is to be provided. This was not in place upon arrival to the property but the receiver has [contacted] the service and security guards are not monitoring the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Per the Stefanini lease, janitorial service was to be provided by ownership. Janitorial companies have turned over many times due to lack of payment. Stefanini currently contracts their own janitorial service for their space....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   There are two generators at the property, one is rented (payment status unknown) and does not have the capacity to service Federal Mogul and Stefanini. The original generator was removed because it was inoperable and replaced with a smaller one knowing that it would need to be upgraded if another tenant moved in besides Federal Mogul. Per Stefanini lease, owner is to provide back-up generator service (Section 8.10). With respect to the generator, the fuel tanks are half full and to everyone's knowledge the fuel is long overdue for testing....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Stefanini's facility manager mentioned that there is condensation in the stairwells....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   There are outstanding balances with DTE for Tower 100 and Tower 300 and shut off notices were issued....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Tax Parcel 76-24-18-351-018 - 2018 taxes and water currently due equate to $ 120,763.63.

Discussion of the Cash Collateral Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The Cash Collateral Motion seeks an order permitting SPE to use, as \"cash collateral,\" the rental income derived from leases of space in Towers 100, 200, and 300. The Lender filed an objection to the Cash Collateral Motion (Docket # 72, the \"Lender's Objection\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The assignment of rents issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Lender objects to the Cash Collateral Motion on several grounds. First and foremost, the Lender argues that there is no \"cash collateral\" that either Debtor can use in these cases. In the case of Skymark II, it is undisputed that the Debtor has no income and no property that currently can be considered cash collateral. The real estate owned by that Debtor, referred to by the parties as Tower 400, is vacant and is not generating any rental income or other income. Nor is there any other asset that is, or that can become, cash collateral in that Debtor's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   In the case of SPE, that Debtor's real estate, referred to by the parties as Towers 200, 300, and 300, does generate rental income, paid on a monthly basis by existing tenants. SPE contends that such income, as well as the rental income that has been collected by the Receiver, is cash collateral that SPE can use, if it provides adequate protection in the form proposed by the Cash Collateral Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Lender argues that none of the rental income is property of the bankruptcy estate, so none of it can be used by SPE as cash collateral. It is not property of the bankruptcy estate, according to the Lender, because of the assignment of rents granted to the Lender by SPE in the Mortgage. According to the Lender, because of that assignment of rents and because pre-petition, SPE defaulted under its Promissory Note and Mortgage, ownership of the rents belong to the Lender, and SPE has no ownership interest in rents. SPE disputes the Lender's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The parties agree that the ownership of the rents is determined under Michigan law. And SPE agrees to this much: that when the mortgage contains an assignment of rents like the one in this case, the assignment of rents is effective to transfer ownership of the rents to the mortgage creditor, when the following five events have occurred: \"(1) execution of assignment of rents; (2) recording of assignment of rents; (3) default under the mortgage; (4) recording of notice of default; and (5) service of recorded notice of default and instrument creating assignment of rents on tenants.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   SPE concedes that where all five of these steps have occurred before the filing of a bankruptcy case, the bankruptcy debtor has no ownership interest in rents that can be considered property of the bankruptcy estate, and cannot use rents as cash collateral under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

That is what happened in this case. As SPE's counsel correctly admitted during the hearing, steps 1-3 above occurred before the filing of this bankruptcy\n   case. It is undisputed that SPE executed the assignment of rents as part of its execution of the Mortgage, that the Mortgage and its assignment of rents were recorded, and that SPE defaulted under the Mortgage, all pre-petition. And the parties agree that steps 4 and 5 did not occur. That is, it is undisputed that there was no notice of default recorded, and that no notice of default was served upon the tenants. SPE argues that because these steps did not occur, SPE retains its ownership interest in the rents, subject to a security interest in favor of the Lender, and that SPE's interest in the rents is property of the bankruptcy estate, which may be used as cash collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The Court agrees with the Lender on this issue, and concludes that the occurrence of steps 1-3 is sufficient to transfer ownership of the rents to the mortgage creditor under Michigan law, without the occurrence of steps 4 and 5. Steps 4 and 5 are necessary only to place the tenants on notice of the requirement to pay rent to the mortgage creditor instead of SPE, and to bind the tenants to do so. But after steps 1-3 have occurred, any rent paid by the tenants to SPE are the property of the Lender, not SPE, and SPE merely holds those rents it receives as property of the Lender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Support for these conclusions is found in the wording of the relevant Michigan statutes, and the case law construing such statutes, including the most recent decisions of the Michigan Court of Appeals, and the recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the\n   <em>\n    Town Center Flats\n   </em>\n   case, cited above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   First, the relevant Michigan statutes clearly draw a distinction between the events that must occur in order to deem the assignment of rents binding and effective against the debtor/mortgagor (also referred to in the statutes as the \"assignor\"), on the one hand, and the further events that must occur for such assignment to be binding and effective against the debtor's tenants. The two statutes are\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20554.231\">\n    Mich. Comp.

But to that extent, the Court respectfully disagrees with that case.\n   <em>\n    Mt.

In that situation, however, rents paid to the debtor are, and remain, property of the mortgage creditor, and the debtor holds such rents as such. In a case like this one, where a receiver was appointed to collect the rents, the receiver holds the rents collected for the mortgagee, who owns the rents under the assignment of rents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WBCMT 2003-C9 Island Living, LLC v.

Other issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   For the reasons described above, the Court concludes that there is no cash collateral that SPE can use in this case. The rental income from the SPE's tenants, and the right to receive that income, belongs entirely to the Lender, unless and until SPE fully pays its debt to the Lender, or redeems SPE's real estate after a foreclosure sale. The Cash Collateral Motion therefore must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   SPE makes several other arguments in support of its Cash Collateral Motion, but none of those arguments changes the result just described.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <strong>\n    1. SPE's argument based on Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 552(b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   SPE argues that for various reasons, the Lender's security interest in the rents should not be deemed to extend to rents paid by SPE's tenants after the commencement of the bankruptcy case, \"based on the equities of the case,\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). This argument fails because the \"equities of the case\" exception, which is an exception to the general rule that pre-petition security interests extend to collateral acquired post-petition, applies only to the question of whether a creditor's \"security interest\" will extend to such post-petition acquired property. It does not apply to the Lender's\n   <em>\n    ownership\n   </em>\n   of rents that come due and that are paid by SPE's tenants post-petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Because the Lender owns such post-petition rents, and SPE does not, \u00a7 552(b) does not permit the Court to limit the Lender's ownership rights in the rents that are paid post-petition. Section 552 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section,\n   <strong>\n    property acquired by the estate or by the debtor\n   </strong>\n   after the commencement of the case is not subject to any lien resulting from any security agreement entered into by the debtor before the commencement of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   (b)(1) Except as provided in sections 363, 506(c), 522, 544, 545, 547, and 548 of this title, if the debtor and an entity entered into a security agreement before the commencement of the case and if the security interest created by such security agreement extends to property of the debtor acquired before the commencement of the case and to proceeds, products, offspring, or profits of such property,\n   <strong>\n    then such security interest extends to such proceeds, products, offspring, or profits acquired by the estate after the commencement of the case\n   </strong>\n   to the extent provided by such security agreement and by applicable nonbankruptcy law,\n   <strong>\n    except to any extent that the court, after notice and a hearing and based on the equities of the case, orders otherwise.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   (2) Except as provided in sections 363, 506(c), 522, 544, 545, 547, and 548 of this title, and notwithstanding section 546(b) of this title, if the debtor and an entity entered into a security agreement before the commencement of the case and\n   <strong>\n    if the security interest created by such security agreement extends to property of the debtor acquired before the commencement of the case and to amounts paid as rents of such property\n   </strong>\n   or the fees, charges, accounts, or other payments for the use or occupancy of rooms and other public facilities in hotels, motels, or other lodging properties,\n   <strong>\n    then such security interest extends to such rents\n   </strong>\n   and such fees, charges, accounts, or other payments\n   <strong>\n    acquired by the estate after the commencement of the case to the extent provided in such security agreement, except to any extent that the court, after notice and a hearing and based on the equities of the case, orders otherwise.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Based on the bolded language quoted above, \u00a7 552(a) does not apply here, because the rents are not property \"acquired by the estate or by the debtor\" after the commencement of the case. Sections 552(b)(1) and 552(b)(2) do not apply, because the issue is whether the Lender's\n   <em>\n    ownership\n   </em>\n   of the rents extends to post-petition rents. Sections 552(b)(1) and 552(b)(2) do not address that issue, and are limited in application to rents acquired by \"the estate\" post-petition. Because the rents are not property of the estate, they are not acquired \"by the estate.\" So these sections do not give the Court any authority to limit the Lender's\n   <em>\n    ownership rights\n   </em>\n   in the post-petition rents, based on the \"equities of the case\" or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   SPE has cited no contrary authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Even if the \u00a7 552(b)\"equities of the case\" exception could apply here, the Court would not exercise its discretion under that exception to limit the Lender's security interest or ownership interest in the rents acquired post-petition. The \"equities of the case\" would not justify such a limitation in this case. SPE's arguments about the \"equities of the case\" are not persuasive. SPE's equities arguments are (1) that the Lender has failed to provide SPE with a loan payoff statement, as requested by SPE's counsel on January 25, 2019, which SPE says is needed so it can\n   continue to seek to refinance the Loan with another lender; and (2) that the Lender is charging a \"criminally usurious interest rate\" on its loan, in violation of Michigan law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   These arguments fail. First, at this point in time, the detailed Acceleration Notice that the Lender provided to the Debtors on December 24, 2018 is sufficient under the circumstances to inform the Debtors of the approximate amount currently needed to pay off the Loan, and the exact amount can easily be calculated and obtained from the Lender if and when SPE actually obtains approval of a refinancing loan from another lender. Second, the Court finds that the Lender is not violating the Michigan usury statute, for the reasons discussed in subsection (d) below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that SPE would not be entitled to any relief any under \u00a7 552(b) based on the \"equities of the case,\" even if that section could apply to the Lender's ownership interest of post-petition rents, which it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Lender's failure to file a U.C.C. financing statement in Delaware\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   SPE argues that because SPE is a Delaware limited liability company, the Lender had to file a U.C.C. financing statement in Delaware, the state of the Borrower's incorporation, citing 6 Del. C. \u00a7 9-307(e). A U.C.C. financing statement was filed in Michigan, but not in Delaware. SPE argues that the Lender's failure to file in Delaware means that the Lender is \"not perfected in any of the Skymark Properties, SPE's personal property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   In an argument SPE made only in the hearing, and not in its pre-hearing brief or other papers, SPE argues that all rents paid by SPE's tenants to the Receiver became SPE's personal property once they were paid to the Receiver, and held by the Receiver in the form of cash or a bank deposit. As such, the paid rents became collateral for which the Lender had to have filed a U.C.C. financing statement in Delaware. Thus, SPE argues, the Lender did not have a perfected security interest in the paid rents. From this, SPE argues that any claimed security interest or claim of ownership by the Lender in the rents that were paid to the Receiver is subject to challenge and avoidable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   SPE has not cited any authority in support of this argument, and the Court must reject it. SPE does not dispute that the Lender has had at all times a perfected mortgage in SPE's real property and a perfected interest by virtue of the assignments of rents, by virtue of the recording in 2016 of the Lender's Mortgage. And, as this Court has discussed in Part IV.A of this opinion, the SPE's right to receive rents and the rents became the sole property of the Lender as soon as SPE defaulted under the Mortgage. The first default by SPE under the Mortgage occurred at least as early as the date on which the Receiver was appointed, on September 26, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.B.1 of this opinion (appointment of a receiver is an Event of Default). This means that all rents that were paid to the Receiver by the tenants were property of the Lender, and the Receiver has been holding all such rents as property of the Lender. Because the rents paid to the Receiver at all times were property of the Lender, there was no need for the Lender to perfect a security interest in\n   <em>\n    SPE's personal property\n   </em>\n   - the paid rents were not SPE's property. For these\n   reasons, SPE is simply wrong in asserting, without authority, that the Lender's security interest and assignment of rents became unperfected when the rents were paid by the tenants to the Receiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The alleged error in the legal description of SPE's property in the Mortgage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   In their brief, the Debtors asserted that the Lender's \"mortgage (and amendment) contains several errors in the legal description,\" as noted in \"a draft title commitment policy from First American Title [Insurance Company] (Exhibit 8).\" SPE then stated that the \"Debtors reserve all rights to challenge the validity, priority, and extent of [the Lender's] lien on [the] Debtors' real properties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vandenbosch v. Edlund\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Vandenbosch\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087046\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/405/253/#p264\">\n    405 B.R. 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264 (Bankr. W.D. Mich. 2009) [.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The Court construes this argument by SPE as nothing more than a reservation of rights to later challenge the validity, priority, and/or extent of the Lender's Mortgage lien, rather than a present challenge of any of those things. This is apparent from the wording of SPE's brief, quoted above, and from the fact that SPE failed to properly support or develop any argument about the validity of the Lender's Mortgage. SPE has failed to allege any specific facts about alleged error(s) in the Mortgage's legal description that could even arguably make the Lender's Mortgage invalid, or otherwise limit the scope of that Mortgage in any way, under Michigan law. In their brief, and during the hearing, SPE's counsel did not identify what the alleged errors in the Mortgage's legal description were, and in fact, said that he did not know what the alleged errors were. Nor did he present any sort of reasoned argument as to why any alleged error(s) affected the validity or extent, or the possible avoidability, of the Lender's Mortgage in any way under applicable law. The \"Exhibit 8\" cited in SPE's brief, a draft title commitment policy from First American Title [Insurance Company], merely stated, with respect to the Mortgage, the following \"NOTE: Above document contains an error in the legal description.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the hearing, the Court asked SPE's counsel what the error was in the legal description, and SPE's counsel stated that he did not know.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   The factual and legal assertions and the argument made by SPE regarding any alleged error in the Mortgage's legal description clearly are insufficient to permit the Court to question the validity, priority, or extent of the Lender's Mortgage lien. And they are insufficient to negate the Court's conclusion, which the Court now makes, that the Lender has sufficiently demonstrated, for purposes of the Court's decision on the Cash Collateral Motion, the validity, priority, and extent of the Lender's Mortgage lien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

It is the specific intent of the Borrower and Lender that this [Promissory] Note bear a lawful rate of interest, and if any court of competent jurisdiction should determine that the rate herein provided for exceeds that which is statutorily permitted for the type of transaction evidenced hereby, the interest rate shall be reduced to the highest rate permitted by applicable law, with any excess interest theretofore collected being applied against principal or, if such principal has been fully repaid, returned to Borrower on demand. More specifically, the calculation of Interest in this [Promissory] Note shall not exceed 25% when considering all fees or other costs which are interpreted as interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Under the Promissory Note, by definition, the interest due under the Loan contract between the parties cannot exceed the maximum rate allowed by Michigan's usury statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Furthermore, even if the Loan was in violation of the Michigan usury statute, the Lender would still be entitled to recover repayment of the full principal amount of its Loan, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20438.32\">\n    Mich.

Because of such debt, the fact remains that the Lender owns the rents from SPE's real estate, which means that there is no \"cash collateral\" that SPE can use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   <strong>\n    5. SPE's \"net rents\" argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   SPE argued during the hearing that even if the Lender did become the owner of the rents upon the SPE's default, that ownership only extends to the \"net rents,\" meaning only the rents left over after the rents are first used to pay the reasonable expenses of maintaining and operating SPE's commercial office property. But SPE has cited no authority under Michigan\n   law to support this argument, and the Court is not aware of any such authority. Rather, the statutes and cases discussed in Part IV.A of this opinion clearly indicate that the Lender obtained ownership of all rents, not just the \"net rents,\" under the assignment of rents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
