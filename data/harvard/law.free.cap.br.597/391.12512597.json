Application of relevant factors to these cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Under the circumstances of these cases, the Court concludes that an evidentiary hearing on the Dismissal Motions is not necessary. And the Court finds and concludes that there is cause to dismiss these cases, and that these cases should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court has considered all of the arguments of the parties, and all of the \u00a7\u00a7 1112(b), 543(d)(1) and 305(a)(1) standards and factors identified in this opinion above. But the most important factor in these cases, which overwhelms all other factors, is that the Court has denied the\n   Debtor SPE's Cash Collateral Motion, and has ruled that SPE's only source of income, namely the rent from the tenants of SPE, is not property of the bankruptcy estate and cannot be used by the Debtors without the consent of the owner of that property. The owner is the Lender. The Lender has consented to the Receiver using the rental income, according to a budget approved in the state court case. But the Lender does not consent to the Debtors using any of the rental income in these bankruptcy cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Debtor Skymark II has no income; rather, it has only a vacant, uninhabitable building that generates no income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Thus, the Debtors have no income or source of income whatsoever. Thus, the Debtors cannot pay any of the expenses necessary to maintain, operate, or improve their commercial real estate properties. Nor can the Debtors fund the administrative expenses necessary to continue in these Chapter 11 cases. In short, the Debtors cannot operate or continue in these Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Debtors' stated \"go-forward plan\" in these Chapter 11 cases relies heavily on the Debtors being able to use the monthly rental income from SPE's tenants, in order to meet (and, they say, exceed) their monthly operating and maintenance expenses. But today the Court has ruled that the Debtors cannot use\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the rental income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In addition to the rental income, the Debtors assert that one of their \"affiliates,\" Skymark Capital Corporation, \"has available capital in the amount of $ 1.5 million to inject into Debtors' Properties to cover any shortfalls.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This assertion is much too vague and speculative. The Canadian non-bankruptcy affiliate, Skymark Capital Corporation, itself has not been heard from. And the Debtors have not specified any of the following: what is the nature and form of this alleged \"injection\" of money, and when, and on what terms, would it be provided? Presumably, it would be the form of some sort of loan that would require this Court's approval under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20364\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet the Debtors have not filed any motion for approval of any sort of debtor-in-possession financing under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20364\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor have the Debtors presented any sort of loan commitment or even a loan term sheet from this affiliate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   There is another problem with the vague evidence submitted by the Debtors about this alleged funding available from the Debtors' affiliate. It does not indicate that this funding source will be available if and after the Court rules, as it now has, that the Debtors cannot use\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the rental income from SPE's Properties. To the contrary, the evidence indicates that this funding source would be available only to\n   <em>\n    supplement\n   </em>\n   the Debtors' use of the rental income. The Debtors' evidence, in the form of a Declaration of the Debtors' purported managing agent Troy Wilson, stated that \"[t]he injection monies\" would \"be used for purposes of funding expenses or other capital expenditures needed at the properties that exceed the amounts [the] Debtors have available from rents.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Dismissal of these bankruptcy cases is clearly in the best interest of the creditors and the Debtors' estates, as well as in the best interests of the Debtors and the Debtors' equity holder. If the cases are dismissed, the Receiver will continue, under\n   the supervision of the state court, to use the rental income from SPE's tenants to operate and maintain the Debtor SPE's commercial office properties. If these cases are not dismissed, and the Court allows the Receiver to be displaced by the Debtor SPE as debtor-in-possession,\n   <em>\n    no one\n   </em>\n   can use the SPE rental income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   And it would make no sense for the Court to dismiss SPE's bankruptcy case without also dismissing Skymark II's bankruptcy case. Otherwise, Skymark II would be left alone in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with a vacant, uninhabitable office building, no tenants, and no income or source of income whatsoever. A dismissal of the Skymark II bankruptcy case most likely will lead quickly to the appointment of a state court receiver over the Skymark II property. Skymark II filed its bankruptcy case only one day before a hearing was to be held on a receivership motion filed by the Lender in the 2019 state court lawsuit. There is every reason to believe that promptly after dismissal of the Skymark II case, the state court will appoint a receiver for Skymark II. And the goals of Skymark II's \"go-forward plan\" can best and most quickly be achieved by such a state court receiver, as discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Another important factor that strongly favors dismissal is that SPE's large, major tenants, Stefanini and Tenneco, both strongly oppose the SPE management being restored to control and management of the properties. Indeed, Stefanini has so strongly opposed the Debtors' management that Stefanini took the step - extraordinary for a tenant - of filing the 2018 State Court Lawsuit and obtaining the appointment of the Receiver to begin with. And both Stefanini and Tenneco have concurred in the Dismissal Motions. As the major tenants, Stefanini and Tenneco provide the lifeblood of SPE's business, and keeping them satisfied as tenants obviously is in the best interest of everyone in these cases - the creditors, the estate, the Debtors, and the Debtors' equity holder. That goal is best satisfied by dismissing these bankruptcy cases and leaving the Receiver in place to move forward, under the supervision of the state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Debtors have stated that their \"go-forward plan\" in these Chapter 11 cases is, in order of the Debtors' preferences, (1) locating another lender to provide financing to pay off the Lender (\"[p]aying off [the Lender's] lien and moving to a new lending facility\"); (2) selling one or more of the Debtors' Properties \"in order to satisfy [the Lender's] claim;\" and (3) confirming a plan of reorganization, apparently involving neither a refinancing or a sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Without the ability to use any rental income, however, there is no apparent way in which the Debtors' can confirm or perform a plan of reorganization that does not involve either a refinancing or a sale of their Properties. As to the refinancing option, there is no reason why the Debtors cannot pursue refinancing with a new lender outside of bankruptcy, while the state court receivership continues. And Debtors have offered no such reason. The same is true about the option of selling some or all of the Debtors' Properties, and presumably realizing the benefit of the equity that the Debtors believe they have in the Properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In both the pending state court receivership action against SPE, and the receivership that no doubt will quickly result for Skymark II's property upon dismissal of Skymark II's bankruptcy case, the Debtors\n   can just as well seek to obtain the refinance-or-sell objectives they wish to pursue in these bankruptcy cases, under Michigan law, including the provisions of the \"Uniform Commercial Real Estate Receivership Act (\"the 2018 Receivership Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20554-1101\">\n    Mich.

And the Court finds that \"the interests of creditors and ... of equity security holders would be better served by permitting a custodian to continue in possession, custody, or control of\" property of the estates in theses cases, within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20543\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). These findings lead the Court to conclude that it should dismiss these bankruptcy cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   So the Court will dismiss these bankruptcy cases. And in order to prevent any attempted evasion by anyone of the Court's decisions today, the Court will bar the filing of any new bankruptcy case, by or against the Debtors, for a period of two years. This should give ample time for the state court receiverships to substantially conclude. Imposing this bar to a new bankruptcy filing is within the Court's discretion and authority, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and also under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20349\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Packard Square LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269439\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/575/768/\">\n    575 B.R. 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783 (Bankr.
