The bankruptcy court in\n   <em>\n    Multibank\n   </em>\n   thought that the\n   <em>\n    Dunlap\n   </em>\n   court was incorrect because it had equated the language of Section 1475-which included the \"arises in\" and \"related to\" language-with that of Section 1412.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512405\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/594/618/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Section 1412 could not apply to a transfer of a non-bankruptcy action, necessarily meaning that Section 1404 is the appropriate mechanism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512405\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/594/618/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512405\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/594/618/\">\n    at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Other courts have also maintained that Section 1404(a) controls.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rumore v.

Each of these factors are addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Fitzgibbon's Choice of Forum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"As a general rule, a plaintiff's 'choice of venue is entitled to substantial weight in determining whether transfer is appropriate.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274314\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/436/#p444\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Trs. v.

Va. April 28, 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As Radack notes, Fitzgibbon is no longer a citizen of Virginia, although he was at the time of the underlying events. He is now, and was when this action was filed, a citizen of North Carolina. Further, the underlying events happened in the District of Columbia. So, in her view, this factor favors a transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court finds that Fitzgibbon's choice of forum does not carry its usual strong weight here, because Fitzgibbon does not live in Virginia and because the underlying facts did not occur here. However, Fitzgibbon's choice of forum is nonetheless entitled to significant weight because Fitzgibbon resided in Richmond, Virginia during the relevant events and most of his witnesses live in and around the Richmond. And, the effects of the allegedly defamatory remarks were felt in this forum. Thus, there is a substantial connection to the forum that logically supports Fitzgibbon's decision to bring the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Convenience of the Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The second factor to be weighed is the convenience to the parties in litigating in either venue.\n   <em>\n    Koh v.

Va. 2003). The first consideration when weighing the convenience of the parties is their residency. But \"residence is not a controlling factor and may be outweighed in the context of a particular case by countervailing considerations relevant to the convenience of the witnesses and the interest of justice.\" 15 Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Juris. \u00a7 3849 (4th ed.). Radack, as the movant, must show (1) that the original forum is inconvenient for her and (2) that Fitzgibbon will not be substantially inconvenienced by the transfer.\n   <em>\n    Koh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9506621\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/250/627/#p636\">\n    250 F.Supp.2d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Radack resides in the District of Columbia, so transferring the case to her\n   home district will be more convenient for her. Further, Radack states that she suffers from Multiple Sclerosis and that she is unable to drive for more than 15 minutes and would have to secure a driver for every proceeding. Radack also asserts that Fitzgibbon would not be inconvenienced by the action being transferred to the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Fitzgibbon, on the other hand, points to a video of Radack where she sat on a stage for over an hour, and he thinks that Radack can easily travel to Richmond.

Convenience of the Witnesses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The convenience of the witnesses is of considerable importance when considering a transfer, especially the convenience of non-party witnesses, whose location should be afforded greater weight in deciding a motion to transfer venue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9506621\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/250/627/#p636\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9506621\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/250/627/#p636\">\n    at 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Va. 1988) (footnote omitted). To satisfy her burden that a forum is inconvenient for witnesses, a movant must provide particularized information of a witness's potential testimony, how that testimony is material and non-cumulative, or the degree to which it will be inconvenient to access that testimony in this district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9506621\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/250/627/#p636\">\n    250 F.Supp.2d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Radack argues that the clear majority of non-party witnesses live in the District of Columbia. As support, Radack cites her OB/GYN, her former therapist, an eyewitness to the events, Radack's husband, and an unspecified number of former employees of Fitzgibbon Media. Radack, however, fails to state what information each of these witnesses will provide, how important they are to the case, or how they will be inconvenienced by having to come to Richmond. So, in total, she lists four definitive witnesses, but it is unclear to the Court how necessary each is to the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Fitzgibbon lists four witnesses who reside in Richmond, one who resides in Charlottesville, and one who resides in Arlington. So, five of his witnesses are located closer to Richmond and one is located closer to the District of Columbia. But, like Radack, Fitzgibbon fails to state what information each of these witnesses will provide or how important they are to the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The burden of showing that the forum is inconvenient for witnesses is upon Radack, and she has failed to carry her burden. The Court has been given no information that any witness located in or around the\n   District of Columbia will be burdened by coming to Richmond, and Radack has failed to provide any information about her witnesses' expected testimony. Further, transferring the case to the District of Columbia will essentially benefit Radack at the expense of Fitzgibbon. So, this factor weighs in favor of Fitzgibbon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Interest of Justice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, the Court must consider the \"interest of justice,\" which encompasses public interest factors aimed at \"systemic integrity and fairness.\"\n   <em>\n    Stewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774917\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/22/#p29\">\n    487 U.S. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774917\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/22/#p29\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774917\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/22/#p29\">\n    101 L.Ed.2d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). Judicial economy and the avoidance of inconsistent judgments are prominent among the principal elements of systemic integrity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Ship Mgmt., Inc. v. Maersk Line, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9174281\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/357/924/#p937\">\n    357 F.Supp.2d 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 937-38 (E.D. Va. 2005). Other factors include \"the pendency of a related action, the court's familiarity with the applicable law, docket conditions, access to premises that might have to be viewed, the possibility of unfair trial, the ability to join other parties, and the possibility of harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    Koh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9506621\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/250/627/#p636\">\n    250 F.Supp.2d at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Outside of her above-listed reasons, Radack says that the interests of justice favor her for two reasons. First, she argues that a federal district court located in the District of Columbia is better able to apply the substantive law of that district than this Court. Second, Radack argues that the two locations in which the alleged sexual assault took place are in the District of Columbia, so it should be transferred in case those locations need to be visited. Fitzgibbon does not respond to these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court finds that Radack once again has failed to carry her burden for this factor. Even if Radack is correct that the substantive law of the District of Columbia applies to this case, she has failed to explain whether that law is substantially different from Virginia law. Moreover, it appears that the tort of \"malicious prosecution\" contains the same elements in both the District of Columbia and Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeWitt v.

Nor has Radack shown a material difference in the law of the two districts that controls the defamation claim, where it appears that the law is the same.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zapata v.

Indeed, there is nothing unique about Fitzgibbon's substantial claims that would make it difficult for any district court to apply the governing law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, Radack has not explained what circumstances would require a visit to the locations of the alleged events. And, the Court does not foresee any need for a visit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thus, in the Court's view, the interest of justice does not warrant transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, even though the Court finds that Radack may have some difficulty getting to Richmond due to her health condition, that factor does not outweigh Fitzgibbon's choice of forum, the convenience of the witnesses, or the interests of justice. At best, the factors are at \"dead center,\" which is not enough for Radack to fulfill her burden of proving that a transfer is warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medicenters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3386034\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/371/1180/#p1184\">\n    371 F.Supp. at 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not enough to meet Radack's burden. For the reasons set forth above, the RENEWED MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE (ECF No. 76) will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is so ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Section 1404(a) says, \"For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Section 1412 says, \"A district court may transfer a case or proceeding under title 11 to a district court for another district, in the interest of justice or for the convenience of the parties.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Further, it seems clear to the Court that, as Fitzgibbon argues, Radack's bankruptcy action was filed solely to avoid this litigation. In her December 2018 status report, Radack said that\n    <em>\n     zero\n    </em>\n    creditors appeared at her statutory meeting of creditors. ECF No. 80 at 1. She also did not mention any debts in this status report outside of \"the claims against her.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2. In her January 2019 status report, Radack said only that she had \"commenced the examination of claims against her to be addressed in a Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization.\" ECF No. 81 at 1. And in a conference call on October 29, 2018, Radack's counsel said that any judgment in this case would be the biggest claim against Radack. Thus, there is a substantial evidentiary basis for Fitzgibbon's contention that Radack's bankruptcy action was not filed in good faith. Instead, it appears to be a tactic to try to secure transfer of this case to the District of Columbia.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    No one has alleged that there is a risk that a trial will be conducted fairly in one district and not the other; that a trial in either district will affect the integrity of the decision; or that there is any other factor for the Court to consider.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
