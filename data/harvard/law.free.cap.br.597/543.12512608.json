James S. Feltman (the \"Trustee\") filed an opposition to the Motion (\"Opposition,\" ECF Doc. # 10) and Defendants filed a reply. (\"Reply,\" ECF Doc. # 12.) For the reasons explained below, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice and with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This adversary proceeding was commenced by the Chapter 11 Trustee of TS Employment, Inc.'s (TSE) against TSE's former accountants. Because of their conduct, TSE and its creditors allegedly suffered more than $ 100 million in losses before TSE filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2015. (Compl. \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Until its bankruptcy, TSE served as the professional employer organization (\"PEO\") for Corporate Resource Services, Inc. (\"CRS\") and its subsidiaries (the \"CRS Subsidiaries\" and, together with CRS, the \"CRS Debtors\"). The CRS Debtors were publicly traded companies. As the PEO, TSE was the employer of record for hundreds of thousands of temporary workers supplied under the CRS Debtors' contracts with their customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   CRS experienced dramatic growth from 2010 to 2015 by offering its customers competitive pricing and financing options. CRS's ability to rapidly expand its business largely depended on purported financial\n   accommodations made by TSE, including the forgiveness or deferral of more than $ 70 million owed to TSE under its PEO agreement with CRS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   TSE never had the capital or liquidity needed to make financial accommodations to CRS. TSE \"financed\" its accommodations to CRS by failing to pay federal employment taxes for TSE employees that were supplied to CRS customers. Moreover, most of TSE's funds were commingled in the accounts of its affiliate, Tri-State Employment Service, Inc. (\"Tri-State\" and collectively with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, \"Tri-State Group\"), where tens of millions of dollars were used for purposes unrelated to TSE. As a result, TSE ultimately failed to pay more than $ 100 million (exclusive of interest and penalties) in federal employment tax obligations, as well as other non-tax obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants acted as TSE's accountants since its incorporation in 2010. They kept TSE's books and records, prepared its financial statements, prepared dozens of tax returns, and allegedly had direct and unfettered input and access to the financial reporting systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Since 2011, TSE was insolvent and engaged in an unsustainable and under-capitalized business. Defendants' actions hid this reality from the outside world, thus permitting TSE to continue to amass unpaid liabilities while its corporate life was wrongfully prolonged. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) The Trustee seeks to recover from Defendants more than $ 100 million in losses that allegedly would not have occurred had Defendants provided competent accounting services to TSE. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Complaint asserts two sets of claims. The first count is an accounting malpractice/negligence claim, alleging that the losses were due to Defendants' negligence and breach of the duty of care. The second count is a fraud claim, alleging that Defendants' misconduct involved an \"intentional or reckless\" misrepresentation. During the period covered by the Complaint, TSE allegedly transferred \"tens of millions of dollars to Tri-State Group entities and incur[red] tens of millions of dollars in additional liabilities that remain unpaid today.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants argue that the Complaint should be dismissed under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Wagoner\n   </em>\n   rule, because the Trustee alleges that the Defendants-an 80-year old retired accountant who lives in Florida and his former firm located in Goshen, New York-should be held liable, under accounting malpractice/negligence and fraud theories, for conduct that helped TSE and Robert Cassera (\"Cassera\") mask the extent of TSE's unpaid federal payroll tax obligations. (Motion \u00b6 1.) Cassera owned the majority of CRS's stock and 100% of TSE's stock. Cassera also owned 100% of Tri-State Employment Service, Inc. Cassera is the alleged mastermind of the CRS Debtors massive fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Specifically, the Trustee contends that Defendants were for all practical purposes the chief financial officer, treasurer, and controller of TSE, and thus non-statutory\n   insiders of TSE. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-25.) Irrespective of their title, they enjoyed unfettered control over the maintenance of TSE's books and records, prepared TSE's financial reports, and prepared and filed all of TSE's tax forms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Trustee further contends that the Defendants acted with autonomy. TSE had no employees or acting senior management, who assisted, provided or supervised the services rendered by Defendants. Thus, Defendants allegedly were not third parties conspiring with management-they\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   management. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Since the Complaint sufficiently alleges a close relationship between the Debtor and Defendants, the first factor weighs in favor of insider status. Since at least 1995, Defendants had been providing accounting services to Tri-State Group entities and/or Cassera. (Compl. \u00b6 36.) After TSE was incorporated and began providing PEO services to CRS in 2011, Defendants expanded the scope of their work to provide outside accounting services to TSE as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Kossoff and Cassera traveled together regularly by private jet from Florida to New York, where Tri-State and CRS were headquartered. (Compl. \u00b6 40.) They met frequently concerning Tri-State and Cassera's businesses, and Defendants advised on all financial matters involving Tri-State and Cassera's other businesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Indeed, after TSE's massive unpaid tax liabilities were discovered, Mr. Kossoff made presentations on behalf of Cassera to CRS's board of directors, claiming that the unpaid payroll tax liability was a \"surprise\" and had been \"unknown.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The allegations in the Complaint fail to satisfy the second factor-degree of involvement. The Complaint alleges that Defendants \"provided accounting services to TSE, kept its books and records, prepared TSE financial statements, prepared dozens of TSE tax returns, and had direct and unfettered input and access to TSE's financial reporting systems.\" (Compl. \u00b6 5.) It is unclear from these allegations whether Defendants' involvement essentially fulfilled the roles ordinarily carried out by a company's senior internal financial and accounting personnel (since TSE did not have a CFO or Treasurer), such as making decisions regarding how to account for the Debtor's business activities, which would arguably trigger the non-statutory insider exception, or, rather, whether Defendants only acted in the traditional role of outside accountants. The Complaint here does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   allege that Defendants exerted significant influence over decisions that affected the Debtor's operations. The distinction between the roles of senior internal financial and accounting personnel and of outside accountants is important in deciding whether the Defendants were non-statutory insiders. The\n   <em>\n    Wagoner\n   </em>\n   rule has often been applied to dismiss claims against a debtor's outside accountants. For instance, the court in\n   <em>\n    CBI\n   </em>\n   stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"[B]reach of contract, negligence, and fraud, when committed by auditors, are a single form of wrongdoing under different names,\" and therefore, under the logic of\n   <em>\n    Wagoner\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   a bankruptcy trustee does not have standing to bring any claims related to professional malpractice in the context of cooperative wrongdoing between the debtor and its auditors.\n   <em>\n    Cenco Inc. v.

E.D.N.Y. 2018). The Court concludes that the allegations in the Complaint do not plausibly allege that Defendants exercised the requisite degree of control over TSE. First, the Complaint alleges that Cassera, not Defendants, exerted \"total control\" over TSE's operations. (Compl. \u00b6 28.) Additionally, the Complaint portrays Cassera as the mastermind of the alleged fraud relating to the massive tax liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Since Defendants' role as accountant is facilitative in nature, the Court cannot plausibly infer from the Complaint that Defendants exerted any degree of control in perpetrating the alleged fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Given that only the first factor favors the Trustee's position, the Court concludes that the Complaint does not support a plausible inference of the non-statutory insider exception. During oral argument, however, the Trustee's counsel argued that there are additional facts that can be alleged in good faith demonstrating that these Defendants acted effectively as TSE's CFO, Treasurer or other senior finance and accounting personnel, who made important accounting decisions that facilitated the massive fraud. It is clear to the Court that through the extensive investigation conducted by the Trustee relating to the CRS Debtors since this Complaint was filed in October 2018, the Trustee may well have developed sufficient facts to satisfy the requirements for the non-statutory insider exception. He deserves a chance to do so. Consequently, dismissal here will be\n   <strong>\n    WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   and with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Furthermore, the Complaint makes it clear that TSE's continued existence prolonged the existence of the corporate group which includes the CRS Debtors. The Court reaches this conclusion by reading together several allegations in the Complaint. First, TSE served as the PEO for the CRS Debtors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) As the PEO, TSE was the employer of record for hundreds of thousands of temporary workers supplied under the CRS Debtors' contracts with their customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Second, TSE made financial accommodations-including the forgiveness or deferral of more than $ 70 million that CRS owed TSE under the PEO agreement-so that CRS could pursue dramatic growth by offering customers competitive pricing and financing options. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Importantly, \"TSE 'financed' its accommodations to CRS by failing to pay federal employment taxes for TSE employees that were supplied to CRS customers....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Lastly, Defendants' alleged wrongdoing facilitated these accommodations by masking TSE's tax liabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.) Viewing these allegations in their entirety, the stringent standards of the adverse interest exception cannot be satisfied here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Cassera's wrongdoing (as the alleged mastermind of the scheme) was not solely for his own personal benefit. The allegations of the Complaint show that funds collected but diverted from paying withholding taxes were used in substantial part for funding and expanding the business. Defendants' behavior (in allegedly hiding the substantial unpaid taxes) \"benefited\" not only TSE itself but also the CRS Debtors in the corporate group. The Court deems this benefit sufficient to defeat the adverse interest exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Furthermore, there are no allegations that Defendants' conduct amounted to outright theft, looting, or embezzlement-the kinds of behaviors that would suggest that their actions benefited only themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Trustee does not allege that either Cassera or Defendants acted solely for their personal benefit. Nor did the Trustee allege that the Defendants totally abandoned the interests of TSE. Therefore, the adverse interest exception fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the Complaint does not satisfy the non-statutory insider exception, and it defeats the adverse interest exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Therefore, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   , with leave to amend within 21 days from the date of this Order, to allege enough facts to satisfy the non-statutory insider exception but not the adverse interest exception to the\n   <em>\n    Wagoner\n   </em>\n   rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
