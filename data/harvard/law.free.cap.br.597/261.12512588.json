Findings - Points in Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On June 18, 2015 the Debtor and the Defendant entered into the Timber Sale Agreement. Compl. \u00b6 10, Answer \u00b6 10. Pursuant to this agreement the Defendant was permitted to cut timber on Debtor's real estate for a limited time and for consideration of $ 10,000. Compl. Ex. A. However, the actual consideration which the Defendant paid the Debtor for that right was $ 55,000. Pl.'s Mem. at 2, Def.'s Mem. at 9;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On July 16, 2015, the Defendant sold the same timber rights which he acquired from the Debtor to a third party, Patterson Lumber Co., Inc. (PLC). Compl. \u00b6 12, Answer \u00b6 12. The agreement with PLC provided that PLC shall pay consideration of $ 105,000 for the timber rights but itemized some of the consideration in the form of non-cash property. Compl. Ex. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   V. Findings - Points in Dispute\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties disagree on the value of the timber rights which the Debtor transferred to the Defendant and which the Defendant subsequently transferred to PLC.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 2 with Def.'s Mem. at 3-4. The parties also disagree as to whether the Debtor was insolvent, under-capitalized, or unable to pay her debts when she made the transfer.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Compl. and Answer \u00b6\u00b6 34-36. Thus, the record reveals that the points of disagreement are limited to the following: first, whether the Debtor received reasonably equivalent value\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in exchange for the\n   property which she transferred to the Defendant; and second, whether the Debtor was in a financially straitened state at the time of the transfer;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    A. Reasonably Equivalent Value\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Third Circuit has explained that the determination of whether reasonably equivalent value was exchanged for a transfer is a factual one. See\n   <em>\n    Mellon Bank, N.A. v. Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of R.M.L., Inc. (In re R.M.L., Inc.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7624834,6474646\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/139/\">\n    92 F.3d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 153 (3d Cir. 1996). The Third Circuit further explained that a court making that finding must examine the totality of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7624834,6474646\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/139/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Trustee's contention that the Debtor did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for her sale of the timber rights is based on what the Defendant did with those rights less than one month later: he sold them for a sum almost twice ($ 105,000) what he ultimately paid the Debtor ($ 55,000). Pl.'s Mem. at 2. For the Plaintiff, that sale price establishes what the value of the timber rights were.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7624834,6474646\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/139/\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Because the Defendant paid the Debtor only $ 55,000 for those rights, the value which she received in exchange for the timber rights cannot be considered as reasonably equivalent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7624834,6474646\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/139/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant disputes the valuation of the timber rights at $ 105,000 on two separate grounds. First, he attempts to establish that the $ 55,000 which he paid the Debtor is the value of the timber rights by comparing that transaction to the Trustee's sale of the Debtor's \u00bd interest in the 113 acres in Sabinsville, Pennsylvania. See Trustee's Motion to Sell, Order approving Sale, and Report of Sale. Case No. 16-12925, Docket ## 269, 279, and 282. That sale yielded a value of $ 1,116 per acre. A sale of just the timber right for 4 years shows that $ 55,000 has to be considered as fair market value.\" Def's Mem. at 5. Second, he contends that of the total consideration of $ 105,000, the non-cash component of the agreement, the 32.4-acre parcel valued at $ 44,812, did not go to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. That parcel, he insists, was transferred to an entity referred to as the Foulkrod Family Trust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As proof of this contention, he has attached to his response documents which purport to show that the parcel was transferred to that entity, and not to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Assuming that both of these premises are true, the court does not see how or where they shed light on the question of what the timber rights were worth. Whatever price per acre that the land in Sabinsville sold for, it is not probative of what the value of the timber on nearby land might have been. In the same way, the fact that some of the consideration went to someone other than the Defendant does not mean that the value of the timber rights is not equal to the purchase price. Both arguments are simply beside the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   What does call into question the Trustee's valuation of the timber rights is the structure of the consideration. In pertinent part, the agreement provides that PLC would pay the Defendant for the timber rights as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-45\">Buyer agrees to pay Seller the total sum of <em>$105,000.00 full consideration</em>. Payment shall be made as follows: Timber payment $ 105,000.00 For marked timber $25,000.00 down -$ 42,140.00 PLC sale of 32.4 acres land $35,000 start of logging <em>-$ 2,672.00</em> Survey of 32.4 acres $60,188 _____________ $ 60,188.00 Net for timber</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mot. Ex. B. So, in addition to cash payments totaling $ 60,188, PLC would also tender noncash consideration in the form of real estate: a 32.4-acre parcel. The parties' agreement ascribes a dollar value to that parcel of $ 44,812. Adding that figure to the amount of the cash consideration of $ 60,188 yields total payment of $ 105,000 which is what the Trustee values the timber rights at.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Defendant disputes that valuation. Although he appears to have signed the agreement which values the 32.4 acres at $ 44,812, he now alleges that it is worth $ 9,800. See Answer \u00b6 12f. He explains that the parcel has no value for timber cutting but is useful for hunting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12h; Def.'s Mem. at 3-4. The parties have offered conflicting evidence as to what the timber rights were worth. A trial, then, will be necessary to arrive at a value of the timbers rights in order to determine if they were sold for reasonably equivalent value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the Debtor was Insolvent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Plaintiff maintains that at the time of the transfer (June 18, 2015) the Debtor was either insolvent, insufficiently capitalized, or unable to pay her debts. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 34-36; Pl.'s Mem. at 10-12. The Defendant disputes the claim of insolvency. Answer \u00b6\u00b6 34-36; Def.'s Mem. at 5-7, 11;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code specifically defines insolvency as a \"financial condition such that the sum of such entity's debts is greater than all of such entity's property, at a fair valuation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (32)(A).

See Trustee's Motion to Sell, Order approving Sale, and Report of Sale. Case No. 16-12925, Docket ## 269, 279, and 282. That amount is substantially more than the $ 36,000 valuation set forth in Schedule A/B. Mot., Ex. E;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   With regard to the Defendant's claim that the Norristown property is worth more than twice the value stated on the schedules (Resp. 6), the Debtor's claim of exemption of the entire amount of that property excludes it from the insolvency calculation (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (32)(A)(ii) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With respect to the $ 55,000 which the Defendant contends that he gave to the Debtor from the sale of the timber rights to PLC during the 9 months prior to her bankruptcy filing, that would also have constituted an asset which should have altered the insolvency calculation, yet the Plaintiff does not mention it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On the liability side of the ledger, Plaintiff relies on the Schedule E/F to arrive at total unsecured debts of $ 83,800; however, the claims register (attached as Ex. H to the Motion) lists only $ 34,810 in unsecured claims after subtracting out the claims to which the Debtor filed objections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet a comparison of the unsecured\n   claims total listed on Schedule E/F ($ 83,800) with the total of\n   <em>\n    undisputed\n   </em>\n   unsecured claims listed on the claims register ($ 34,810) reveals a difference of $ 48,990. The bulk of the difference is comprised of a $ 45,000 debt owed to the Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schedule E/F.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Schedule E/F fails to provide an explanation of the nature of the debt owed to the Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the court finds that the Plaintiff's evidence as to Debtor's financial state on the date of the transfer is either unprobative or self-contradictory. For that reason, the court finds that the Plaintiff has not carried her initial burden of proof on the issue of insolvency for purposes of a summary judgment ruling;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   VI. Ruling\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Based on the Trustee's failure (1) to show beyond dispute that the record demonstrates that the Debtor did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the timber rights; and (2) to demonstrate that the Debtor was insolvent, left with unreasonably small capital, or unable to pay her debts when she made the transfer or as a result of the transfer of the timber rights, the court concludes that the Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Count II must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Because this matter involves the avoidance and recovery of a fraudulent transfer, it is within this court's \"core\" jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(2)(H).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Made applicable to adversary proceedings by B.R. 7056.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Section 544(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code makes the Pennsylvania voidable transfer statute available to a trustee.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The statute was amended in 2018 but the changes were stylistic only: the word \"fraudulent\" in the first sentence was changed to \"voidable.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The parties agree that value was exchanged, which is the threshold finding for a determination of reasonably equivalent value for purposes of fraudulent transfer law.
