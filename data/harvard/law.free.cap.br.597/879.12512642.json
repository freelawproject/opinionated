Article 1 of the Purchase Agreement, argues Auro, clearly confirms that Auro purchased Great Elm's secured loan and security interests in the patents and inventions. Filing No. 18, # 15, Ex. H to Amended Complaint (Purchase Agreement, pp. 1-2, Section 1.01(b) ). The Debtor relies on Section 3.04(f) of the Purchase Agreement to argue otherwise.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, Auro contends this section only deals with representations and warranties. It deals with that which Great Elm is representing and warranting to Auro as a first priority security interest. Auro contends that the Purchase Agreement, Article I, states that \"all of Seller's right, title and interest in the Loan, including all security interests, mortgages, assignments, UCC financing statements, collateral assignments, indemnities, agreements and any and all other written instruments or documents evidencing, securing, perfecting or otherwise pertaining to the Loan,\" exist without any exceptions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Section 1.01(b).

(g), (p) ). The financing statement was perfected at all times contends Auro.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Court has carefully reviewed the Purchase Agreement as well as the supporting documents. The Court finds that the original documents clearly encompass general intangibles, including patents and patent applications. The section of the Purchase Agreement relied upon by Debtor clearly focuses on representations and warranties, not on the particulars of the purchase. In fact, the preamble in Article III specifically states: \"Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that the statements contained in this Article III are true and correct as of the date hereof.\" Filing No. 18, Attach. 15, Ex. H, Purchase Agreement, Art. III (Representations and Warranties). On the other hand, the Sections relied on by Auro in both the Purchase Agreement as well as the original Financing Statement include general intangibles and patents. Article I of the purchase agreement clearly states that this is a secured loan and is entitled \"PURCHASE AND SALE\".\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Article 1. The Purchase Agreement includes \"all of Seller's right, title and interest in the Loan, including all security interests, mortgages, assignments, UCC financing statements, collateral assignments, indemnities, agreements and any and all other written instruments or documents evidencing, securing, perfecting or otherwise pertaining to the Loan,\" without any exceptions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%206444551\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Purchase Agreement, Section 1.01(b). Also included is the assignment of the security interest granted to Auro. Filing No. 18, Attach.10-C, Security Agreement, pp. 2-4, Section 1.1(g), (p). The Court finds the contractual language clearly includes general intangibles and patents, and such was assigned to Auro by Great Elm via the Purchase Agreement, the Security Agreement and the Loan Agreement. The Court finds that Auro is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Count II - UCC Amendments\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Debtor argues in Count II that the Auro UCC Amendments constitute an avoidable preferential transfer under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , contending that either Auro did not purchase from Great Elm a security interest in the intellectual property, or Auro waived its security interest in the intellectual property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint, p. 11, \u00b6\u00b6 75, 76. The Debtor argues that Auro did not already have a perfected security interest in his intellectual property at the time Auro's UCC Amendments were filed. Thus, such amendments would constitute an antecedent debt within 90 days before the bankruptcy, allowing Auro to recover more than it would have recovered in a pure Chapter 7 distribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   This claim, contends Auro, is without merit, because no transfer of the Debtor's property occurred. The security interest\n   pursuant to the Loan Agreement and Security Agreement, contends Auro, covers the patents as previously discussed. This security agreement was continuously perfected from the time of the original financing statement in 2014, and there was no transfer of an interest of the Debtor within that 90-day time period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (transfer is made \"at the time the transfer takes effect between the transferor and the transferee, if such transfer is perfected at, or within 30 days after, such time, ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Court finds the Debtor's claim is without merit. First, the Court agrees that Auro is correct that there was no transfer of property as a result of the Auro UCC Amendments. This was property belonging to Auro.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re El Paso Refinery, LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11634595,11636709\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/171/249/\">\n    171 F.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 254-55 (5th Cir. 1999) ( Section 547(b)(5) is not met \"[e]ven if the payment in question was applied to the unsecured portion of an undersecured creditor's claim, the creditor will not be deemed to have received a greater percentage as a result of the payment if the source of the payment is the creditor's own collateral. A creditor who merely recovers its own collateral receives no more as a result than it would have received anyway had the funds been retained by the Debtor, subject to the creditor's security interest.).\" As stated herein, the Loan Agreement and Security Agreement already covered the general intangibles, including patents. Debtor granted Full Circle these rights in June 30, 2014, and the documents were perfected on July 7, 2014. These rights then proceeded to Great Elm and then to Auro.

For all of the following reasons, there is no preferential transfer: the alleged security interest transfer to Auro occurred before the ninety-day preference period; in any event there was no actual transfer of an interest of the Debtor in any property; Full Circle's security interest was perfected in June of 2014, and a mere change in information about a secured party does not render the financing statement as misleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Neb.

An extension of\n   <em>\n    Doty\n   </em>\n   as suggested by the Debtor would severely curtail the rights of many creditors. Further, the Court finds the\n   <em>\n    Melikian\n   </em>\n   case cited by Debtor is likewise not helpful. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Melikian\n   </em>\n   addressed an issue under Arizona law where the deficiency statute was different than the Nebraska statute. The Court agrees\n   <em>\n    Melikian\n   </em>\n   is not applicable. Likewise, the Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Gatewood\n   </em>\n   is not helpful to the Debtor either. The Court notes that\n   <em>\n    Gatewood\n   </em>\n   is a Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and is not on point with the case at hand. The Court concludes that \u00a7 76-1013 does not bar Auro's claim in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Further, in the alternative, the Court finds that Auro has a valid deficiency claim in any event. Nebraska Revised Statutes \u00a7 25-216 provides in relevant part: \"In any cause founded on contract, when any part of the principal or interest shall have\n   been voluntarily paid, or an acknowledgment of an existing liability, debt or claim, or any promise to pay the same shall have been made in writing, an action may be brought in such case within the period prescribed for the same, after such payment, acknowledgment or promise; ....\" After a foreclosure in this case, the Debtor signed an acknowledgement of its liability on the loan and signed a Forbearance Agreement admitting to the same. Filing No. 18, Attach. 23, Ex. 2. He acknowledged his default; the original principal amount of $ 3,5000,000.00; and agreed to forbear any defenses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2076-1013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 1-2. In January of 2017, the Debtor through his counsel again acknowledged this debt. Filing No. 18, Attach. 25, Ex. 4. Moss Messages. Further, the Debtor filed multiple court documents acknowledging this indebtedness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   All of these circumstances, contends Auro, serve to restart any argument that the statute of limitations has passed on the underlying obligation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rolfe v.

The Debtor signed the Forbearance Agreement; the attorney letters from Moss acknowledge the existence of the debt with a promise to pay; and the Debtor agreed in court filings that he owes the debt. For these reasons, as stated herein, the Court finds the summary judgment filed by the defendant will be granted as a matter of law as to Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Count IV - Plausible claim\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Auro contends that there are no claims for relief in Count IV of the Amended Complaint.

The Court has carefully looked at Count IV of the Amended Complaint and agrees with the arguments set forth by Auro. The Amended Complaint shows that the Loan Agreement was executed, security interests granted and perfected, and that the loan and the rights thereunder transferred to Auro. There is nothing in Count IV that sets forth any new claims, other than the ones set forth in the other claims of the Amended Complaint. The Court finds that Count IV does not state a cause of action and cannot withstand the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Agency/Standing\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Debtor next argues that Auro does not have standing to pursue its rights under the Loan agreement, because Auro is not the \"Agent\" under the terms of the agreement. Auro disagrees contending it is the Agent under the Loan Agreement. Debtor contends that Full Circle never properly resigned its agency, never properly appointed a successor agent, and thus Full Circle remains the agent under the Loan Agreement. Thus, only Full Circle can enforce the Loan Agreement. Therefore, argues Debtor, defendant lacks standing to pursue this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Section 16(e) of the Loan Agreement provides that Great Elm has the right to transfer the rights and powers of \"Agent\" under the Loan Agreement to Auro, without any requirement that it consult or give notice to the Debtor. Filing No. 18, Attach. 8, Ex. A, Loan Agreement, Sec. 16(e). Additionally, the Debtor has no rights under Section 17, where in it states the provisions of \"Section 17 are solely for the benefit of the Agent and Lender\" and section 16(e) states \"notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary Agent and Lender may, without the consent of Borrower or any other Loan Party, grant a security interest in, sell or assign, grant or sell participations or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and/or under one or more other Loan Documents to one or more other Persons.\" in the Loan Agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 17(a). Further, as stated in the Assignment Agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   To the extent that the appointment of [Auro] as Agent is not contemporaneous with the Effective Date [February 3, 2017], then [Great Elm] shall, and hereby does, appoint [Auro] as its exclusive agent, authorized and empowered solely to act in [Great Elm's] behalf as Agent under the Loan, and [Great Elm] hereby delegates to [Auro] all rights of the Agent under the Loan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Filing No.18, Attach. 15, Ex. I, Assignment Agreement, Sec. 3(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Court finds the language is clear. Section 16(e) allows Great Elm to transfer the rights and powers of \"Agent\" under the loan agreement. It says nothing about consulting or notifying the debtor. Filing No. 18, Attach. 8, Ex. A, Loan Agreement, Sec. 16(e). This section also allows the Agent or Lender:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   without the consent of Borrower (i.e., the Debtor] or any other Loan Party, grant a security interest in, sell or assign, grant or sell participations or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and/or under one or more other Loan Documents to one or more other Persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, the Court agrees that section 17 is solely for the agent and the lender and is not intended to benefit the debtor. Additionally, Section 16 is specific to the Loan Agreement. Loan Agreement, \u00a7 17(a) (explaining that provisions of \"Section 17 are solely for the benefit of Agent and Lender\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, as stated in the Assignment Agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   To the extent that the appointment of [Auro] as Agent is not contemporaneous with the Effective Date [February 3, 2017], then [Great Elm] shall, and hereby does, appoint [Auro] as its exclusive agent, authorized and empowered solely to act in [Great Elm's] behalf as Agent under the Loan, and [Great Elm] hereby delegates to [Auro] all rights of the Agent under the Loan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Filing No. 18, Attach. 15, Ex. I, Assignment Agreement, p. 12, Sec. 3(b). Thus, this provision makes clear that even if Auro had not formally become the successor agent, it was empowered to act as the agent. The Court finds that the language of the documents grants the right of Agent to Auro. In the alternative, the Court concludes that the language empowered Auro to act as the agent of the Agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Post-petition interest, default interest, attorneys' fees, and expenses\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Auro asks for post-petition interest, default interest, attorneys' fees, and expenses.

The Debtor, however, does not make a\n   strong, specific argument as to why these fees and expenses are not allowed.

Ex. A, Loan Agreement \u00a7 3(a). With respect to post-petition interest, Debtor contends that \u00a7 506 only allows this if there is excess value of the collateral.
