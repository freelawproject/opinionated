BERNSTEIN, United States Bankruptcy Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Defendants filed proofs of claim and the Trustee responded with a fraudulent transfer action. The Defendants subsequently withdrew their claims with prejudice, moved in the District Court to withdraw the reference and moved in this Court to stay a previously scheduled trial of this adversary proceeding. The latter motion raises the question of whether a bankruptcy court loses its equitable jurisdiction over a fraudulent transfer action because the defendant-creditor withdraws his proof of claim after the adversary proceeding was filed but before the bankruptcy court has tried the matter. The Court concludes that it acquired equitable jurisdiction over the Trustee's fraudulent transfer action when it was commenced under the time-of-filing rule, and the Defendants' withdrawal of their claims did not destroy it. Accordingly, the Defendants' motion to stay the trial on that basis is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This adversary proceeding arises out of the Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Bernard Madoff through Bernard L.

Claims Allowance Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   SIPA \u00a7 78fff-2 sets out the general parameters of the claims procedure in a SIPA liquidation. Following his or her appointment, the SIPA trustee must publish notice of the proceedings and mail notice to each customer. SIPA imposes two time limits for filing a statement of claim keyed to the notice of publication - an initial time limit of sixty days or less and an outer time limit of six-months. A customer who files the claim during the initial period has greater rights regarding the satisfaction of his net equity claim than the customer who files after the initial period but before the six-month deadline,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Camp v.

Fla. 1989), but the distinction is irrelevant in this case. After receipt of the written statement of claim, the SIPA trustee is required to promptly discharge the obligations or net equity claims owed to the customer \"insofar as such obligations are ascertainable from the books and records of the debtor or are otherwise established to the satisfaction of the trustee.\" SIPA \u00a7 78fff-2(b). SIPA does not set out a claims objection or claims resolution procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, the Court established a thorough procedure for resolving claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peskin v.

The\n   <em>\n    Claims Procedure Order\n   </em>\n   tracked the time limits under SIPA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Claims Procedure Order\n   </em>\n   at 7.) In the event the Trustee determined that the customer's statement of claim was not supported by BLMIS' books and records, the following procedures governed the resolution of the dispute: (i) the Trustee notified the customer in writing of his determination to disallow the claim, in whole or in part, and his reasons, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6); (ii) if the customer disagreed with the Trustee's determination, he had thirty days to file a written statement of his opposition along with supporting documentation, failing which \"the Trustee's determination shall be deemed approved by the Court and binding on the\n   claimant,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7); and (iii) upon receipt of the customer's opposition, the Trustee would obtain a hearing date from the Court and notify the customer.

The Defendants' Claims and the Trustee's Determinations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Per the\n   <em>\n    Claims Procedure Order\n   </em>\n   , Michael Mann and Meryl Mann served the Trustee with a statement of claim, dated June 16, 2009, for BLMIS Account No. 1CM363 (the \"Mann Claim\"), in the amount $ 7,192,467.45.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Mann Claim was based on the handwritten, corrected balance shown on the Manns' last customer statement, dated November 30, 2008. BAM L.P. (\"BAM\") served the Trustee with the BAM Claim, dated June 16, 2009, regarding Account No. 1CM579, in the amount of $ 714,333.85. The BAM Claim was also based on the handwritten, corrected balance shown on BAM's last customer statement, dated November 30, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Trustee denied the Defendants' Claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Determinations.) He explained that no securities were ever purchased for their BLMIS accounts, and the Defendants withdrew more than they deposited into their accounts over the lives of the accounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Manns withdrew $ 5.8 million more than they deposited, and BAM withdrew $ 1,135,993.39 more than it deposited. Each Determination included a chart showing all deposits into and withdrawals from the account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Defendants filed the same Objections to the Determinations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the most part, the Objections raised purely legal issues. They primarily argued that the Last Statement Method, under which net equity was determined by the balance shown in the November 30, 2008 monthly customer statement, rather than the Trustee's Net Investment Method, which offset withdrawals against deposits, should control. They further argued that the Trustee's net equity calculation was barred by the statute of limitations on avoidance actions and should include interest or a similar adjustment to reflect the passage of time. In paragraph 10 of the Objections, the Defendants also asserted that the Determinations violated the\n   <em>\n    Claims Procedure Order\n   </em>\n   because they failed to state the reason for the disallowance of the claims and the relevant facts and legal theories on which the Determination was based (citing relevant bankruptcy law), (Mann Objection \u00b6 10(a), (c) ), failed to rebut the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   validity of the claims (citing Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 502(a) and FED. R. BANKR. P. 3001(f) ) (Mann Objection \u00b6 10(b) ), and as a factual matter, \"includes an exhibit which purportedly calculates the money deposited less subsequent withdrawals, but is completely unsubstantiated and incorrect.\" (Mann Objection \u00b6 10(d) ) (collectively, the \"Paragraph 10 Objections\"). Finally, the Defendants reserved \"the right to revise, supplement, or amend\" their Objections. (Mann Objection \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. This Adversary Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Trustee filed his original complaint commencing this adversary proceeding on November 30, 2010 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF Doc. # 1) and filed an amended complaint (the \"\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   \") in the District Court while a motion to withdraw the reference was pending. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , dated Jan. 25, 2012 (ECF Dist. Ct. No. 11 Civ. 07667 Doc. # 9).) As noted in the Determinations, the Defendants were \"net winners\" because they withdrew more than they deposited. The Trustee sought,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to avoid and recover the excess transfers to the Defendants,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the negative net equity, made during the six years and two years (the \"Two-Year Transfers\") prior to the Filing Date under bankruptcy and state fraudulent transfer law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Both the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   included, as Exhibit B, the Trustee's calculation of all deposits into and withdrawals from the Defendants' BLMIS accounts. The calculations in Exhibit B were identical to the calculations evidencing the Defendants' negative net equity included in the Determinations. Exhibit B showed that the Manns and BAM had received $ 2.25 million and $ 563,000, respectively, within two years of the Filing Date. Neither pleading included a count to disallow the Defendants' Claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) or for any other reason. Instead, they stated that \"[t]he Trustee intends to resolve the Mann Customer Claim, BAM Customer Claim, and Claims Objections to the Trustee's determination of such claims through a separate hearing as contemplated by the Claims Procedures Order.\" (\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52;\n   <em>\n    accord Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Disposition of the Defendants' Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Prior to the filing of the adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court had rejected the Last Statement Method, upheld the use of the Net Investment Method to calculate net equity, and overruled certain objections, including the Defendants' Objections, \"insofar as those objections are based upon using the Final Customer Statements rather than the Net Investment Method to determine Net Equity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Order (1) Upholding Trustee's Determination Denying Customer Claims for Amounts Listed on Last Customer Statement; (2) Affirming Trustee's Determination of Net Equity; and (3) Expunging Those Objections with Respect to the Determinations Relating to Net Equity\n   </em>\n   , dated Mar. 8, 2010 (ECF Main Case Doc. # 2020).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court's order was appealed directly to the Second Circuit which affirmed in 2011,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Net Equity Decision\n   </em>\n   , and the Supreme Court denied petitions for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   in 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Velvel v.

The Withdrawal of the Defendants' Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court conducted a pre-trial conference on September 26, 2018 and scheduled a trial for December 3, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Order Setting Trial\n   </em>\n   , dated Sept. 28, 2018 (ECF Doc. # 108).) In response, the Defendants moved one month later to withdraw the reference, and on or about November 20, 2018, moved to stay the December 3 trial. The Court scheduled a hearing for November 28, 2018. By then, the parties had submitted a proposed joint pre-trial order in which they stipulated to the deposits and withdrawals and the Two-Year Transfers in the amounts of $ 2.25 million from the Mann account and $ 563,000 from the BAM account. Putting aside the objection relating to the legal sufficiency of the Determinations (and the Defendants' reservation of their rights, if any, to amend or supplement their Objections), it seemed that the Defendants' Objections had been resolved through judicial determinations or by stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The effect of the pendency of the Defendants' Claims on this Court's ability to try the adversary proceeding was much debated. Since their Objections now appeared to have been resolved and there was no point to forcing the Defendants to litigate their claims when they no longer asserted a right to payment, the Court offered the Defendants the opportunity at the November 28 hearing to make an oral motion to withdraw the Defendants' Claims with prejudice. The Defendants accepted the invitation, (Tr. 11/28/18 at 16:6-14), and the Court granted the motion. (\n   <em>\n    Order Withdrawing Claims and Objections with Prejudice and Finally Determining Net Equity\n   </em>\n   , dated Dec. 20, 2018 (ECF Doc. # 138).) However, the order made clear that it did not determine \"this Court's jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding or any other issues in that case.\" In addition, the Trustee announced his intention to move for summary judgment (which he has done), and the Court stated that it would deal with the question of its equitable jurisdiction, which the parties had already briefed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   either before or in the context of the summary judgment motion. (Transcript of 12/19/18 Hr'g at 51:3-7 (ECF Doc. # 147).)

First, a concern animating the time-of-filing rule - improper manipulation of federal jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    New Rock Asset Partners, L.P. v. Preferred Entity Advancements, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7644363\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/1492/#p1503\">\n    101 F.3d 1492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1503 (3d Cir. 1996) ;\n   <em>\n    CIT v. 170 Willow Street Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20528163\">\n    1997 WL 528163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 - is equally applicable to a situation like the present one involving the Court's equitable jurisdiction. If equitable jurisdiction depended on the status of the defendant-creditor's claim, the defendant-creditor could manipulate the bankruptcy jurisdiction at any time simply by withdrawing the claim. Taking this argument to its logical conclusion, the defendant could seek to withdraw the claim at any time prior to final judgment if the defendant did not like the way the proceedings were unfolding. Here, the Defendants' Claims were pending for nearly ten years, but they sought to withdraw them with prejudice at the Court's invitation only a few days before the trial was scheduled to begin. Until then, the Paragraph 10 Objections continued to raise a live dispute and the Defendants' reservation of rights, if any, to amend or supplement their Objections remained a possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   It is no answer that Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3006 permits the bankruptcy court to condition the withdrawal of the claim, and consequently, could theoretically condition withdrawal on the retention of equitable jurisdiction over the companion adversary proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Kaiser Grp. Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=272%20B.R.%20852\">\n    272 B.R. 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 856 (Bankr. D. Del. 2002) (conditioning withdrawal of claim on retention of jurisdiction). First, if the bankruptcy court's equitable jurisdiction under the Supreme Court precedent discussed above depends on the\n   <em>\n    continuing\n   </em>\n   effect that the adversary proceeding will have on the claims allowance process, and the adversary proceeding will no longer have a practical effect on the claims allowance process because the defendant-creditor essentially consents to disallowance of his claim by seeking to withdraw it, there is no basis to exercise equitable jurisdiction. Second, in deciding whether to grant a motion to withdraw the claim, a trial court must consider whether the non-moving party will suffer legal prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Moses v. CashCall, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116429,4076021\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/63/\">\n    781 F.3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89 (4th Cir. 2015) (\"In general, withdrawal should be granted unless the party opposing the motion can demonstrate that it would be legally prejudiced by the withdrawal.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sempra Energy Trading Corp. v.

In the absence of any other claim of legal prejudice, the bankruptcy court would arguably abuse its discretion by refusing to grant the withdrawal motion, especially where, as here, the withdrawal is with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, the application of the time-of-filing rule is consistent with the pre-merger rule that a court's equitable jurisdiction was determined at the time of filing.\n   <em>\n    Am.

In the end, Vickie failed to show that her tortious interference counterclaim stemmed from the bankruptcy itself or that its relationship to Pierce's defamation claim was such that the determination of her counterclaim would have affected the claims allowance process or the restructuring of the debtor-creditor relationship. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court lacked the Constitutional authority to enter the judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 499,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,6049563,4332163\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2594/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Stern v.

The Court invited the Defendants to withdraw their claims with prejudice because there was no reason to \"somehow force[ ] them to continue with litigation to establish their rights to payment ... when they no longer assert any rights to payment.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Acad., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9360254\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/289/230/#p234\">\n    289 B.R. at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the withdrawal of their claims did not negate the submission to the Court's jurisdiction by virtue of their filing the statements of claim which were met with the Trustee's adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, I find meritless the Defendants' contention that this adversary proceeding did not implicate the claims allowance process because the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   did not request disallowance and alleged that the Objections would be resolved in a separate proceeding in accordance with the\n   <em>\n    Claims Procedure Order\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Defendants Memo\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.) \"In\n   <em>\n    Langenkamp,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court held that if a creditor who has filed such a claim\n   <em>\n    is met\n   </em>\n   with an adversary proceeding,\n   <em>\n    the resolution of which affects\n   </em>\n   the equitable restructuring of debtor-creditor or creditor-creditor relations, then the creditor loses its right to a jury trial even with regard to traditional legal claims.\"\n   <em>\n    CBI Holding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3627394,4043476\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/529/432/\">\n    529 F.3d at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, the Defendants' Claims were \"met\" with the Trustee's fraudulent transfer claims. Although the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   did not include a disallowance claim, the avoidance of the Two-Year Transfers would mandate the disallowance of the Defendants' Claims\n   under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 502(d). While a fraudulent transfer claim and section 502(d) disallowance objection are often joined in the same adversary proceeding, there is no requirement that they must be joined in one adversary proceeding. Instead, the equitable jurisdiction inquiry asks whether the resolution of the Trustee's claims would \"affect\" the claims allowance process, and here, it did at the time the Trustee filed his adversary proceeding. Moreover, the separation of the adversary proceeding from the claim objection was purely procedural and was based on the\n   <em>\n    Claims Procedure Order\n   </em>\n   which contemplated a separate proceeding to resolve the Trustee's objections to customer claims. The Trustee adhered to that procedure in this instance, but the adversary proceeding still affected the claims allowance process for the reasons stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that it acquired equitable jurisdiction over the Trustee's fraudulent transfer claims because the Trustee commenced this adversary proceeding after the Defendants filed their claims (and after they objected to the Trustee's Determinations), the avoidance of the transfers to the Defendants would result in the disallowance of their claims, and the withdrawal of the Defendants' Claims did not strip the Court of its equitable jurisdiction that attached at the time-of-filing.
