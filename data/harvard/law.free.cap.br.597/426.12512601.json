(Answer \u00b6 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Four days later, on or about May 5, 2018, CIVIQ offered the Debtor a separation agreement (the \"Separation Agreement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex.

The Debtor argues that the Severance Pay is not property of the estate because his receipt of that Pay is contingent on his agreement to execute the Separation Agreement and his subsequent compliance with the post-petition conditions outlined therein. According to the Debtor, the Severance Pay is thus a \"continuation of income\" excluded from the estate under \u00a7 541(a)(6). The Trustee disagrees. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Segal v. Rochelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n    382 U.S. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n    86 S.Ct. 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n    15 L.Ed.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966), he argues that the Severance Pay is \"sufficiently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past\" and therefore constitutes property of the estate. The Trustee further contends that the reaffirmation of a non-compete covenant, the release of claims against CIVIQ, and the other terms of the Separation Agreement do not require the Debtor to \"perform affirmative acts\" and do not, for that reason, constitute services performed by the Debtor after the commencement of the case for purposes of the exception under \u00a7 541(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The \"Sufficiently-Rooted\" Test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Over fifty years ago, the United States Supreme Court explained that the \"main thrust\" of what is now \u00a7 541 of the Code \"is to secure for creditors everything of value [that the debtor] may possess in alienable or leviable form when he files his petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Segal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n    382 U.S. at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n    86 S.Ct. 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To that end, the Supreme Court said, \"the term 'property' has been construed most generously and an interest is not outside its reach because it is novel or contingent or because enjoyment must be postponed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court recognized, however, that there are limits to what constitutes property of the estate, especially in light of the goal of bankruptcy, which is to \"leave the [debtor] free after the date of his petition to accumulate new wealth in the future. Accordingly, future wages of the [debtor] do not constitute 'property' at the time of bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Based on these principles, the Supreme Court found that, in determining if an asset is property of the estate, the proper inquiry is whether the asset is \"sufficiently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past and so little entangled with the [debtor's] ability to make an unencumbered fresh start that [the asset] should be regarded as 'property' \" under what is now \u00a7 541.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n    at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n    86 S.Ct. 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Meyers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049545,3774409\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/626/\">\n    616 F.3d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 628 (7th Cir. 2010) (adopting the \"sufficiently-rooted\" test in determining how to allocate tax refunds);\n   <em>\n    Jokiel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874179\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/447/868/#p871\">\n    447 B.R. at 871-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying the \"sufficiently-rooted\" test). The key question in this matter, then, is whether the Severance Pay is \"sufficiently rooted\" in the Debtor's pre-petition past or whether it constitutes excluded earnings from post-petition services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Application of the Test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based on a review of the pertinent facts, the Court finds that a portion of the Severance Pay is \"sufficiently rooted\" in the Debtor's pre-bankruptcy past that it constitutes property of the Debtor's bankruptcy estate. Specifically, prior to the filing\n   of his bankruptcy petition, the Debtor was presented with the Separation Agreement under which he was offered the Severance Pay. The offer of Severance Pay is consistent with the various terms of the Debtor's employment agreement, which was executed pre-petition. And, by its very nature, the Severance Pay offer is related to the separation of the Debtor from his employment, that separation also having occurred before the bankruptcy filing. In short, the Debtor has a right to the Severance Pay because that Pay is associated with the pre-petition termination of his pre-petition employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Severance Pay also bears a number of post-petition characteristics. First, the Debtor did not sign the Separation Agreement under which the Severance Pay was offered until after filing his chapter 7 petition. As a result, any Severance Pay that he receives was and will continue to be paid to him post-petition. Most importantly, various post-petition actions and obligations under the Separation Agreement are conditions to the Debtor's pre-petition right to receive the Severance Pay. Specifically, the Agreement conditions the Debtor's right to receive the Pay on, among other things, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (1)\n   <strong>\n    Cooperating with CIVIQ:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (a) assisting CIVIQ with any matters related to the services performed during the Debtor's employment, including transitioning his duties to others;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (b) cooperating with CIVIQ in the defense or prosecution of any lawsuit, investigation, or third-party claim or action in existence or which may be brought or threatened in the future against or on behalf of CIVIQ by, among other things, (i) meeting with CIVIQ and its legal counsel to prepare for any proceeding, (ii) providing affidavits and/or testimony, (iii) assisting with audits and inspections, and (iv) acting as a witness in connection with any litigation or other legal proceeding affecting CIVIQ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (c) promptly informing the president or HR representative of CIVIQ in writing in the event that the Debtor is contacted by any individual representing any party adverse to the business interests of CIVIQ, including anyone threatening any form of legal action against CIVIQ.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (2)\n   <strong>\n    Returning Property, Affirming Covenants, Refraining from Making Disparaging Statements:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (a) returning to CIVIQ all company property, including computer equipment, software, and access codes, as well as company files and documents;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (b) abiding by all common law and/or statutory obligations related to the protection and non-disclosure of CIVIQ's trade secrets and/or confidential and proprietary documents and information;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (c) continuing to comply with the confidentiality and non-compete restrictions set forth in the Debtor's pre-petition employment agreement; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (d) not making any statements that are professionally or personally disparaging about, or adverse to, the interests of CIVIQ and its officers, directors, and employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (3)\n   <strong>\n    Releasing Claims:\n   </strong>\n   Agreeing to a broad release of any and all legal claims that the Debtor may have against CIVIQ, including fair employment\n   practices, breach of contract, and age discrimination claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Compl., Ex. A, \u00a7\u00a7 3-6.) Only by signing the Separation Agreement, and thereby agreeing to the provisions thereunder, was the Debtor entitled to receive any Severance Pay.

However, the Separation Agreement, executed after the bankruptcy filing, requires the Debtor to perform various affirmative acts post-petition, including transitioning his duties to others at CIVIQ and meeting with CIVIQ and its legal counsel to prepare for the defense or prosecution of litigation or other legal action, now or in the future. While the Debtor may never be called upon to perform these and other services, it is also possible that CIVIQ will reach out to him and that he will be obligated for years to come.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Given the hybrid nature of the Severance Pay and the fact that the Debtor's post-petition obligations could last for years, the Court determines that a fair allocation of the Severance Pay between the bankruptcy estate and the Debtor is 50/50. As a result, the Debtor's motion for judgment on the pleadings will be granted\n   in part, with 50% of the Severance Pay being deemed post-petition earnings excluded from the estate under \u00a7 541(a)(6), and the Trustee's motion for judgment on the pleadings will be granted in part, with 50% of the Severance Pay being deemed property of the estate under \u00a7 541(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that half of the Severance Pay is property of the Debtor's bankruptcy estate and half constitutes earnings excluded therefrom.
