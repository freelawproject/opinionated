Jager\n   (the \"Debtors\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   By their Motion to Amend,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Debtors seek relief from this Court's\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   dated November 20, 2018 (ECF No. 79) granting InFirst Bank f/k/a Indiana First Bank (\"InFirst Bank\") relief from the automatic stay as to certain real property owned by the Debtors in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the Debtors have failed to show that they are entitled to relief under Rules 59 and 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (as incorporated into bankruptcy matters by operation of Rules 9023 and 9024 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure ). Accordingly, the Motion to Amend is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual &amp; Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 31, 2012, Debtor Margaret M. Jager f/k/a Margaret M. Verhagen executed a commercial promissory note whereby InFirst Bank agreed to lend to Ms. Jager the sum of $ 300,000 for the purchase of real property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    InFirst Bank Loan Documents Trial Exhibits\n   </em>\n   (\"InFirst Bank Ex.\"), ECF No. 73-14, Ex. O, pp. 7-9. To secure the loan, Mrs. Jager granted to InFirst Bank a mortgage on certain real property and improvements described more fully below (collectively, the \"Collateral\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mortgage, InFirst Bank Ex. O, ECF No. 73-14, pp. 10-19 (the \"Mortgage\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Collateral is an approximately 55-acre tract of land comprised of two separate tax parcels (Clearfield County Tax Map Parcel Nos. 106-M07-000-00074 and 106-M07-000-00060).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mortgage at 18-19. The Collateral is improved by several buildings, including a two-story farm house (the \"Farm House\"), a two-bedroom ranch-style house (the \"Small House\" or \"Rental House\"), and a barn. The barn also contains an apartment (the \"Apartment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It is uncontested that the Collateral is the subject of an action brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Environmental Protection (the \"PA DEP\") against the Debtors. Pursuant to the PA DEP action, the Debtors are under court order to remediate certain environmental issues.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , InFirst Bank Ex. Z-EE, ECF No. 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Specifically, the PA DEP issued a\n   <em>\n    Field Order\n   </em>\n   on September 1, 2015, which required that action be taken with respect to approximately 400 tons of manure located on the Collateral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   InFirst Bank Ex. Z, pp. 16-18. Since then, additional orders dated July 27, 2016 and February 1, 2017 were entered by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania directing that remediation occur, with the February 1, 2017 order finding that the Debtors were in contempt of their court-ordered responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   InFirst Bank Ex. AA &amp; BB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 26, 2015, and after Mrs. Jager fell behind on payments on her loan, InFirst Bank confessed judgment against Mrs. Jager.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   InFirst Bank Ex. N, ECF No. 73-14. Subsequently, on November 3, 2016, Mrs. Jager married Mr. Jager and on November 18, 2016 Mrs. Jager transferred\n   the Collateral to herself and Mr. Jager as tenants by the entireties. InFirst Bank has suggested that these events were designed to frustrate InFirst Bank's collection efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   InFirst Bank sought to execute on its judgment by scheduling a sheriff's sale of the Collateral which was enjoined by Mrs. Jager's filing of a chapter 7 bankruptcy case in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York. This bankruptcy case was docketed at case no. 8-17-72035 (the \"New York Bankruptcy Case\"). In those proceedings, Mrs. Jager twice unsuccessfully sought to enter the New York Bankruptcy Court's loss mitigation program relative to the InFirst Bank loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   InFirst Bank sought, and on May 25, 2018 was granted, relief from the automatic stay as to the Collateral by the New York Bankruptcy Court. A sheriff's sale was scheduled for August 2, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 30, 2018, the Debtors commenced the above-captioned bankruptcy proceeding by filing a small business case under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. When this case was commenced, Mrs. Jager's New York Bankruptcy Case remained open (although she had received a discharge) and it was uncontested that the PA DEP environmental issues remained un-remedied. Also, as of case filing, InFirst Bank had not received payment on the loan since June 2016 (i.e., for over 2 years).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Motion for Relief from Stay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 1, 2018, InFirst Bank filed its\n   <em>\n    Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay\n   </em>\n   (the \"Motion for Relief\")(ECF No. 13), whereby InFirst Bank sought relief from the automatic stay as to the Collateral pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) and/or (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Debtors contested the Motion for Relief. In litigating the Motion for Relief, the Debtors did not dispute that they owe a debt to InFirst Bank, that they have no equity in the Collateral, and that real estate taxes were delinquent and accruing. The crux of the Debtors' defense to the Motion for Relief was that the Collateral was allegedly essential to the Debtors' successful reorganization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing on the Motion for Relief held November 14, 2018 (the \"November 14th hearing\"), the Debtors presented two alternative plans for reorganization. Under the first alternative (\"Plan 1\"), the Debtors would retain all of the Collateral and under the second (\"Plan 2\") the Debtors would only retain a portion of the Collateral-the Farm House and a few surrounding acres.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Debtors' Trial Exhibit List\n   </em>\n   (\"Debtors' Ex.\"), ECF No. 70, Ex. 2, pp. 10-18. Testimony at the evidentiary hearing was given by each of the Debtors, and Mr. Elliot Heggenstaller, a Water Quality Specialist at the PA DEP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A subsequent hearing was held on November 20, 2018 (the \"November 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing\"), at which time the Court gave its findings on the record and found in favor of InFirst Bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A separate\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   granting relief from stay to InFirst Bank was entered on the docket that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In short, the Court found that neither Plan 1 nor Plan 2 were in prospect and\n   were speculative at best.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   November 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Hr'g Tr. 17:19-17:22. As to Plan 1, the Court found significant issues with the proposed funding of the plan as the Debtors' averred income was overstated and failed to account for the loss of horse stall rental income. The Court was also not convinced because the Debtors could not show that the proposed rental of the Apartment was anything more than speculative, and rental income from the Small House was unreliable. As to Plan 2, the Court found that the Debtors failed to demonstrate that they have the necessary funding or have taken any steps towards gaining the necessary approvals to subdivide the Collateral-which is essential to the plan. Finally, the Court found that both plans were impeded by the Debtors' failure to remediate the PA DEP issues for which the Debtors offered no credible plan of resolving in a reasonable amount of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Motion to Amend\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On December 4, 2018, the Debtors filed their Motion to Amend. Along with the Motion to Amend, the Debtors also filed contemporaneously therewith several exhibits docketed as a \"Supplement/Addendum\" to the Motion to Amend (\"Supplement\") (ECF No. 90).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Motion to Amend alleges that in granting relief from the automatic stay to InFirst Bank, the Court: (i) failed to appreciate the feasibility of the Debtors' plan to comply with the PA DEP orders by relocating the manure to the barn;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ii) improperly found that the two alternative plans presented at the November 14th hearing were not \"in prospect\" and that they would allegedly be \"financially (and environmentally) feasible in a reasonable period of time[;]\" (iii) presents a new proposed plan, styled as \"Plan 3\", which the Debtors allege would be feasible; and (iv) avers that the Court erred in granting relief from stay as the timing of the motion prevented the Debtors from obtaining a \"breathing spell\" in which to formulate a plan of reorganization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In conjunction with the filing of the Motion to Amend, on December 4, 2018, the Debtors also filed amendments to their Summary of Schedules\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as their bankruptcy schedules A/B (property), D (secured creditors), F (unsecured, nonpriority creditors), I (income), &amp; J (expenses).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 85 &amp; 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   InFirst Bank filed its response to the Motion to Amend on December 31, 2018 (ECF No. 97), and a hearing was held on January 11, 2019 (the \"January 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing\"). At the conclusion of the January 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing, the Court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As an initial note, in filing their Motion to Amend the Debtors do not cite to any\n   specific rule or legal authority which forms the basis of the relief they request. However, at the January 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing, the Debtors stated on the record that the Motion to Amend was brought pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 and 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although the legal source of their request for relief is now clarified (to some extent), the Court is no less frustrated by the lack of citation in the Motion to Amend itself. Motions filed without citation to the specific legal authorities which would support the granting of the relief requested are particularly troublesome. In filing a motion without support, movants attempt (whether intentionally or not) to shift the burden of identifying relevant legal authority and applying such authority to the facts of the case to either this Court or the respondent. This is troublesome because it is not the responsibility of the Court to make the case for the parties before it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaney v.

When the Court brought the absence of citation to Rules 59 and 60 to the Debtors' Counsel's attention at the January 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing, Debtors' Counsel attempted to brush off the \"oversight\" by arguing that based on the way the Motion to Amend was titled-in that it seeks to amend findings of fact, amend the judgment, relief from judgment, and a new trial-\"most lawyers including [InFirst Bank's Counsel] knows that refers to Rule 59 and 60.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument, January 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hr'g at 11:57:15-11:57:35. This rationalization-that it can be presumed or expected that opposing counsel knows the basis of the requested relief-defies pleading standards and contravenes a party's right to know on what grounds relief is sought against it. This is especially true in an instance such as this, where InFirst Bank's Counsel stated on the record at the January 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing that his requests for clarification of the basis for relief went unanswered by the Debtors' Counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Nonetheless, in the interest of resolving the matter before it, the Court will consider the Motion to Amend pursuant to Rules 59 and 60, which are made applicable to bankruptcy cases by operation of Fed.R.Bankr.P. 9023 and 9024.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Specifically, the Debtors request that this Court (i) amend its findings of fact ( Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a)(2) ), (ii) amend its judgment ( Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) ), (iii) grant relief from judgment ( Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) ), and/or (iv) grant Debtors' request for a\n   new trial ( Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a)(1)(B) ). The Court will address each of these in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Request for New Trial Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a)(1)(B)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a)(1)(B) provides that \"[t]he court may, on motion, grant a new trial on all or some of the issues-and to any party- ... after a nonjury trial, for any reason for which a rehearing has heretofore been granted in a suit in equity in federal court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the Motion to Amend, the Debtors fail to specifically identify which of their allegations support the granting of a new trial. Nor have they identified to the Court any grounds which would warrant a rehearing in a \"suit in equity in federal court.\" However, the Motion to Amend is replete with references to alleged new evidence-in particular the Debtors' Plan 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As aforementioned, Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a)(1)(B) permits the court to grant a new trial \"for any reason for which a rehearing has heretofore been granted in a suit in equity in federal court.\" While this section does not explicitly identify an assertion of \"new evidence\" as a permissible reason, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2) strongly infers as much. Rule 60(b)(2) provides that a court may grant relief from final judgment on account of \"newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial\n   <em>\n    under Rule 59(b).\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2) (italics added). Rule 59(b) speaks to the time limitations to bring a motion for new trial under Rule 59(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   That Rule 60(b)(2) provides a basis for \"new evidence\" to be considered as a reason for a new trial under Rule 59(a) was recognized by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Compass Tech., Inc. v.

In discussing permissible grounds for a new trial under Rule 59(a), the Third Circuit noted that there is no direct reference to asserted new evidence in the Rule, but that \" Rule 60(b)(2) provides that 'newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial' can give rise to relief from a judgment or order.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415860\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/1125/\">\n    71 F.3d at 1130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Debtors argue that Plan 3 is feasible in part because it requires a lower plan\n   payment than Plans 1 and 2, does not have the environmental issues of Plan 1, and does not require a survey and subdivision as is necessary for Plan 2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 25 &amp; 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   However, fatal to the Debtors' reliance on Plan 3 to merit relief, the Motion to Amend, as well as statements on the record at the January 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing, make it clear that Plan 3 was an option known to the Debtors prior to the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing and is thus, not new evidence. Specifically, in discussing Plan 3 the Debtors state that \"Debtors' counsel did not submit all possible plans at the Motion Trial, in part, because he was not authorized to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend, \u00b6 25. Likewise, in paragraph 14, Debtors state that \"There is a third Plan alternative, keeping just the Rental which Debtors' counsel\n   <em>\n    now\n   </em>\n   has authority to present (\"Plan 3\").\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend, \u00b6 14 (italics in the original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   At the hearing on the Motion to Amend, the Debtors commented that Plan 3 was essentially presented at the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing because the components of Plan 3 could be seen in the breakdown of Plan 1. The Court rejects this position. Not only is this averment in direct contradiction to the Debtors' admissions that Plan 3 was\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   presented due to lack of authorization, but acceptance of this argument would be to permit a party to \"data dump\" on the Court and opposing counsel and require them to determine all possible configurations of a potential plan. As discussed above, neither the Court nor opposing counsel are mind-readers or soothsayers.

First, that InFirst Bank's filing of the motion for relief from stay was tantamount to the filing of a liquidating plan the consideration of which deprived the Debtors of their exclusivity period. Second, that in granting the Motion for Relief, the Court either misapplied or misconstrued the standards set forth in\n   <em>\n    United Sav. Ass'n of Texas v.

Here, the Debtors argue that the\n   <em>\n    Timbers\n   </em>\n   standard should be considered a \"soft standard\" because, in the Debtors' view, the Supreme Court did not intend for a bankruptcy court to hold a plan confirmation hearing when deciding a motion for relief from stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court notes that both of these arguments could have been presented at the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing. As such, Rule 59(e) relief is not appropriate. Nonetheless, assuming that the Debtors had opaquely made such arguments, the Court does not find them convincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   With respect to the first argument, to the extent that the Debtors' position is that the filing of a motion for relief from the automatic stay during the exclusivity period is an effective violation of the Debtors' \u00a7 1121(e)(1) small business exclusivity period, such argument is unsupported by the legal authorities cited by the Debtors. As stated above, the Debtors argue that InFirst Bank's filing of the Motion for\n   Relief is tantamount to the filing of their own liquidation plan during the Debtors' 180-day small business exclusivity period. Thus, it appears that the Debtors seek a determination that the filing for and granting of relief from the automatic stay during a debtor's exclusivity period is impermissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In making their argument, the Debtors point to no authority in the Bankruptcy Code or legal precedent that would support a blanket denial of stay relief during a debtor's exclusivity period. To the contrary, the Debtors' position disregards the Supreme Court of the United States' statement in\n   <em>\n    United Sav. Ass'n of Texas v.

Moreover, as relief from stay was already found to be unwarranted due to the debtors' equity in the property and the finding of adequate protection, it is unclear whether the equitable considerations cited by the\n   <em>\n    Cardell\n   </em>\n   court would have been sufficient to deny \u00a7 362 relief if otherwise warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   While the Debtors are correct that \"in enacting chapter 11, Congress determined that an otherwise eligible debtor is entitled to an opportunity to reorganize[,]\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend, 11 n. 15 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Clinton Centrifuge, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121253\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/72/900/#p905\">\n    72 B.R. 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 905 (Bankr.

Accordingly, this Court declines the Debtors' invitation to re-write the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court now turns to the second of the Debtors' arguments-that a \"softer standard\" should apply. This argument was not explicitly advanced in the Debtors' Motion to Amend. Thus, the Court's understanding of the Debtors' arguments is limited to what was stated on the record at the January 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   At that hearing, the Debtors explained that their position is that the alleged \"soft standard\" of\n   <em>\n    Timbers\n   </em>\n   is that the more close to the petition date a motion for relief from stay is filed, doubts are resolved in favor of the debtor. Under this \"soft standard,\" the Debtors averred that\n   the essential question at the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing was whether \"any plan is possible\" and that the Debtors were not required to prove confirmability of a plan, just that a plan was possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because the Debtors failed to lay out their argument in writing, the Court sought clarification of the Debtors' position concerning the role of plan feasibility under the Debtors' theory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Counsel: The essential issue before the court was is there a reasonable probability of a successful reorganization within a reasonable time. And that's cited from\n   <em>\n    Timbers of Inwood Forest\n   </em>\n   . In our view your honor this a soft standard. In our view the Supreme Court did not intend a bankruptcy court to basically hold a plan confirmation hearing in response to a relief from stay motion. To read\n   <em>\n    Timbers\n   </em>\n   to require proof of confirmability is to turn chapter 11 on its head. In favor of one creditor to the detriment to the debtors and everyone else.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Court: So you're saying feasibility ... when\n   <em>\n    Timbers\n   </em>\n   talks about a plan in prospect, it is your view that feasibility is of no moment as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Counsel: I would not go that far....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [unrelated discussion]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Counsel: As I said, looking at feasibility on a relief from stay motion, in my view, contradicts the most fundamental policy of chapter 11.

When questioned by the Court as to the Debtors' omission of feasibility in this list of structural considerations, the Debtors averred that the question of adequate funding is the feasibility component.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Debtors' position is somewhat confusing to the Court. On one hand, the Debtors state that a court's consideration of plan feasibility when deciding a motion for relief from stay which is filed during the exclusivity period contravenes the \"most fundamental policy of chapter 11.\" At the same time, the Debtors concede that to say feasibility has no role in deciding the motion goes too far and that one of the three \"structural impediments\" cited by the Debtors (e.g., plan funding) is a feasibility component.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Moreover, the Debtors ask the Court to consider whether \"any plan\" is possible without assessing confirmability or feasibility, but also argue that the proper analysis is whether there are any structural impediments to confirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Further complicating this Court's ability to analyze the Debtors' argument is that the Debtors failed to clearly lay out their position in writing with citations to supporting legal authorities (although at the most recent hearing the Debtors averred that their position was supported by the authorities cited in the Motion to Amend).

In rendering its decision, the Supreme Court of the United States found justification for undoing the default judgment pursuant to the then newly amended Rule 60(b)(6).

In that case, the petitioner was a German born individual who had been granted U.S. citizenship by naturalization in 1933. Thereafter, he married a U.S. citizen and had a child. In May 1942, after suffering a period of severe illness and financial hardship, proceedings were instituted against the petitioner to strip him of his citizenship for alleged conduct indicative that his oath of loyalty to the U.S. was taken falsely. Unable to afford counsel, the petitioner wrote a letter to the ACLU seeking help but before he was able to mail it he was arrested on charges under the Selective Service Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. During his imprisonment, FBI agents confiscated his letter to the ACLU-not mailing it-and the time period to respond to his de-naturalization proceedings passed. A default judgment was entered. The petitioner sought help with his naturalization case from his attorney appointed to represent him in his criminal proceedings. Although the attorney promised to help, he did not do so. Ultimately, the petitioner was imprisoned for over six years and moved between three separate facilities. During that time the petitioner's conviction under the Selective Service Act was overturned and charges brought against him for sedition were dismissed. Thereafter, the petitioner was taken to Ellis Island for deportation when he sought relief from the default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In assessing whether justice would be served by granting relief, the Supreme Court found that the situation before it was that of a citizen \"stripped of his citizenship by his Government, without evidence, a hearing, or the benefit of counsel, at a time when his Government was then holding the citizen in jail with no reasonable opportunity for him to effectively to defend his right to citizenship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Klapprott\n   </em>\n   , at 615,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160607\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/335/601/\">\n    69 S.Ct. 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, that since charges could not be sustained against the petitioner in the criminal proceedings, that it would be unlikely that sufficient evidence existed to merit the stripping of his citizenship.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160607\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/335/601/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160607\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/335/601/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The extraordinary circumstances of\n   <em>\n    Klapprott\n   </em>\n   are absent from the instant case before this Court. Unlike the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Klapprott\n   </em>\n   , the Debtors only have themselves to blame for not presenting Plan 3 at the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing. Despite Plan 3 being a known option at the time of the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing, the Debtors refused their attorney's advice to present it to the Court. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Klapprott\n   </em>\n   , the Debtors have had their fair trial, they are just unhappy with the outcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klapprott\n   </em>\n   , at 615,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160607\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/335/601/\">\n    69 S.Ct. 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Petitioner is entitled to a fair trial. He has not had it.\") They now seek to undo the result by claiming that their own tactical decisions-made with the benefit of counsel-amount to injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Nor is the Debtors' predicament a change in circumstance. As stated, the Debtors knew of the option to present Plan 3 at the time of the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing. The only \"change in circumstance\" between then and now is that the Debtors are now willing to present Plan 3 because their prior decision to only submit Plans 1 and 2 for consideration did not pan out as they hoped. The Debtors effectively seek a \"do-over\" in order to present a proposed plan they themselves previously declined to utilize in the relief from stay litigation. This is the epitome of seeking an impermissible \"second bite of the apple.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   If this Court were to accept the Debtors' position, it would open the door for any litigant to withhold legal arguments and evidence at trial as a means of obtaining a second crack at their case should they lose-amounting to a proverbial adverse judgment insurance policy. This would result in endless litigation and goes against the standard that Rule 59 and 60 motions should not raise new arguments which could have been previously asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Relocation of Manure to the Barn\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In addition to the consideration of Plan 3, the Court will address some of the other arguments set forth in the Motion to Amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   One large point of contention in the Debtors' Motion to Amend is that the Court unduly failed to give consideration to the Debtors' self-described \"eve of trial\" solution to remediate the PA DEP issue-namely, to move the manure into the barn structure. In setting forth their argument, the Debtors aver that relocating the manure is an \"admitted solution\" to the problem as allegedly confirmed by the PA DEP at the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing. However, this Court finds the Debtors' characterization of the PA DEP's representative's, Mr. Elliott Heggenstaller's, testimony disingenuous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   At the hearing, Counsel for the Debtors questioned Mr. Heggenstaller about whether relocating the manure to the barn structure would satisfy PA DEP requirements. Mr. Heggenstaller testified that in the Debtors' case, an existing order of court required complete removal of the manure piles from the property-as opposed to relocation to a contained structure-and that the PA DEP would not pursue a remedy inconsistent with the terms of the court order. The Court notes that the court order dated February 1, 2017 (InFirst Bank Ex. BB) requires that the Debtors within thirty days \"remove all accumulated manure\" and either \"land apply,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   export, or dispose of the manure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   InFirst Bank Exhibit BB, \u00b6 2(b). When pressed to consider whether, notwithstanding the court order, placing the manure in the barn would satisfy PA DEP regulations, Mr. Heggenstaller hypothesized that housing the manure in barn may possibly comply with PA DEP regulations, but that the PA DEP would have to inspect the barn to make that determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument, November 14 hr'g at 1:13:55-1:15:36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Thus, moving the manure to the barn is far from an \"admitted solution.\" Even if the Debtors, specifically, Mr. Jager, were successful in timely relocating the manure piles to the barn-a feat which this Court previously found to be very unlikely especially in the 90 days proposed by the Debtors-the barn solution would contravene the existing court order. Moreover, no evidence was presented to this Court that the barn would pass PA DEP approval as a manure storage facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Accordingly, the only proposal for the manure issue has not been shown to be a plausible solution. The Debtors further appear to be without sufficient funds to cover or otherwise remove\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   the manure from the Collateral. As such, the Debtors have no realistic plans to remediate the environmental issues which is a significant impediment to both Plans 1 and 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Circling back to the Debtors' averments that the manure could be moved inside the barn within 90 days, the Court previously found this assertion non-credible and extremely unlikely. The Court's findings were rooted in the fact that Mr. Jager's testimony that he had been devoting substantially all of his time to moving the manure to a specific location (albeit not the barn) were contradicted by the reports of the PA DEP which showed little to no progress in the remediation efforts. Moreover, when Mr. Jager testified that the movement of the manure could occur within three months, the Court found such testimony to be not credible when the Debtors have been unable to complete it in over three years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   November 20, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 9:25-11:17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Further supporting this finding, Court observes that since the commencement of this case, the Debtors' self-imposed deadline for remediation has continued to shift. At the initial hearing on the Motion for Relief held September 6, 2018, Debtors' Counsel represented that Mr. Jager had assured him that the manure would be moved by December 1, 2018. In the\n   <em>\n    Debtors' Amended Pre-Trial Memorandum with Stipulations of Fact\n   </em>\n   filed two months later on November 8, 2018, the Debtors averred that remediation could be completed within five months (ECF No. 72 at \u00b6 20), and then at the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing the Debtors asserted that they only require a period of 90 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Even if the Court were to afford the Debtors the requested period of time to remediate the hundreds of tons of manure, it is doubtful the Debtors would follow through with the Court's orders. The Debtors, and specifically Mr. Jager, have shown little respect for court orders. For example, pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania dated February 1, 2017, the Debtors were afforded 30 days to remove all horses and other farm animals from the Collateral and not repopulate the Collateral with such animals absent written approval by the PA DEP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   InFirst Bank Ex. BB, \u00b6 3(c). It was uncontested that as of the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing, and indicated in the filing of the Motion to Amend, the Debtors have continued to board horses in defiance of this order. When asked at the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing about their failure to abide by the order, Mr. Jager testified that he was aware of the order, but insisted that the order did not reflect what the judge stated in court and that he would obtain the transcript-thereby indicating that he did not view the order entered well over a year and a half ago as being final, binding and authoritative. Mr. Jager further stated that he did not remove the horses because \"that's [his] livelihood\" and he has the \"right to farm.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument, November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hr'g at 10:51:30-10:53:30, 11:41:00-11:48:15. Thus, it is clear that the Debtors have conscientiously chosen to defy the order and this is not simply an issue of the Debtors not having the funds to comply as the Debtors have alleged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend, \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Moreover, the Court is disappointed by the Debtors' characterization of finally removing the horses from the Collateral as an \"accommodation the Debtors will make\" to allow for the relocation of the manure to the barn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend, \u00b6 9. Characterizing the removal of horses as an \"accommodation\" demonstrates that the Debtors continue to view their obligation to remove the horses as a personal sacrifice and not as a serious, court-ordered obligation designed to lesson an environmental hazard Mr. Jager has permeated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Further, the Court has observed Mr. Jager to be combative, dismissive of directions, and prone to outbursts. This was demonstrated by this Court's need to threaten Mr. Jager with potential sanctions when he continued to interrupt counsel and speak out of turn at the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing. Debtors' Counsel himself conceded at the January 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing that Mr. Jager does not listen, is difficult to deal with, and is ignorant of (but presumes he understands) the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument, January 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hr'g at 12:29-12:30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Based on these observations, the Court finds the Debtors' assertions that they will do what is required of them within prescribed timeframes non-credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Apartment and Small House Rental Income\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Turning to the Apartment rental income, the Debtors challenge the Court's determination that the income from the Apartment is too speculative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend, \u00b6 18. However, notwithstanding the issue of whether such additional evidence could be considered by this Court, the Debtors provided no information to address the issues with prospective Apartment rental income previously identified-specifically,\n   the Debtors' inability to show that they will be able to relocate to the Farm House, the identity of the alleged prospective tenant, and/or the existence of a lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Although the Debtors challenge the finding that the Apartment rental income is too speculative, the Debtors further allege that the Apartment rental income is not necessary for Plan 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend, \u00b6 18. Presumably, this is because by their own calculations in paragraph 16 of the Motion to Amend, there is a $ 488 monthly surplus and the elimination of $ 450 per month in Apartment rental income would still leave a $ 33 monthly surplus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, this surplus is reliant on the Debtors receiving $ 450 per month in rental income from the Small House which this Court found to be too speculative and unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Debtors have provided no evidence to challenge the Court's prior findings that the Small House income is unreliable. Specifically, that the current tenants are unreliable in payment and that the Small House is in a state of disrepair raising questions as to whether it could be re-let if the current tenants were evicted or left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   As noted on the record of the November 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing, Mr. Jager conceded at the November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing that the Small House renters had not yet made the October 2018 payment and had been unreliable in the past.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   November 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Hr'g Tr. 11:18-12:02. Moreover, Mrs. Jager testified at the November 14th hearing that the Small House renters routinely make repairs to the rental on their own volition and deduct the cost of the repairs from the rent payable to the Debtors. Mrs. Jager commented that \"it's because of [the Small House renters] that we're in the fix we're in.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument, November 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hr'g 12:32:15-12:33:15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Additionally, the Court notes that its finding that the Small House rental income is unreliable is further supported by the Debtors' year-to-date income as reported on their\n   <em>\n    Official Form 107: Statement of Financial Affairs for Individuals Filing for Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   (\"Statement of Financial Affairs\"), ECF No. 27, pgs. 27-33, of which this Court takes judicial notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Debtors reported on their Statement of Financial Affairs that between January 1, 2018 and the date of bankruptcy case filing (July 30, 2018-a period of\n   seven months less one day) the Debtors grossed from their business operations only $ 5,250-$ 2,625 each.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Statement of Financial Affairs at Part 2, No. 4. The Debtors reported no other\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   income during this time period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Statement of Financial Affairs at Part 2, No. 5. Thus, in 2018 until bankruptcy case filing the Debtors averaged $ 750 ($ 5,250/7 months = $ 750) per month in business income. This figure falls short of the $ 1,050 per month owed by the Small House tenants in combined Small House and horse stall rental fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The instability of income is also reflected in the Debtors' need to file an\n   <em>\n    Application for Individuals to Pay the Filing Fee in Installments\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 3) at the commencement of this case wherein the Debtors averred that they were unable to pay the entirety of the filing fee at once and sought to pay it over a period of four months. The filing fee ($ 1,717) is less than the initial Plan 1 monthly payments as presented at the November 14th hearing, which for months 1-6 are $ 1,793.13.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtors' Ex. 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors were unable to afford this fee at a time when they were receiving their social security benefits, Small House rental income, and horse stall rental income, but were admittedly not paying anything to InFirst Bank on the loan or paying real estate taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Finally, with respect to feasibility of Plans 1 and 2 in general, the Court observes that in Debtors' Exhibit 2 presented at the November 14th hearing (ECF NO. 70, pp. 9-18), the Debtors provide in their \"Essential Terms of Plan of Reorganization to be Proposed by Debtors\" that all administrative expense claims will be paid no later than the effective date of the plan, unless otherwise agreed to by the holder of the claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtors' Ex. 3, \u00a7 3.01. As such, no administrative claims are accounted for in the proposed monthly payments. This is true of the plans proposed at the time of the November 14th hearing as set forth in Debtors' Exhibit 2 and as proposed in the Supplement filed contemporaneous to the Motion to Amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplement, ECF No. 90, Ex. 4-6, pp. 23-25. A significant hiccup in paying the administrative claims on the plan effective date, however, is that the Debtors do not appear to have the funds to make a large\n   cash payment. This is further exacerbated by the fact that as of October 30, 2018 (even before the evidentiary hearing on the Motion for Relief and this Motion to Amend), the Debtors owed their Counsel approximately $ 20,000-substantially more than the estimated amount of $ 12,000 set forth in each of the proposed plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motion to Withdraw\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 63, \u00b6 9. Additionally, the Debtors provide that all United States Trustee Quarterly Fees will be paid timely as they accrue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtors' Ex. 2 at p. 13, \u00a7 3.03. This is an expense unaccounted for in the proposed plan payment amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that no other grounds exist to warrant Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Request to Amend Findings of Fact Pursuant to Rule 59(a)(2)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a)(2) provides that \"[a]fter a nonjury trial, the court may, on motion for a new trial, open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony,\n   <em>\n    amend findings of fact\n   </em>\n   and conclusions of law or make new ones, and direct the entry of a new judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)(2) (italics added).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   \"A court faced with a Rule 59(a)(2) motion after a nonjury trial 'should be most reluctant to set aside that which it has previously decided unless convinced that... refusal to revisit the earlier decision would work a manifest injustice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashraf-Hassan v.

Specifically, the Debtors represented that the real property collateral is comprised of two parcels-a significantly larger, approximately 55-acre parcel containing the farm, and a much smaller (approximately 1/3 acre) parcel on which the Small House sits. Further, that while the larger parcel has the previously identified 1181 Pleasant Valley Road mailing address, that the smaller parcel's address is 1115 Pleasant Valley Road. The Debtors argue that the Motion for Relief solely identified the collateral subject of the motion as having the 1181 Pleasant Valley Road address and thus, the Court's order granting the motion is only effective against the larger parcel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   As stated at the January 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing, it is clear from the record of this case that at all times both parties have considered the real property at issue to encompass the entirety of the Collateral. Throughout this litigation, the Debtors themselves have discussed the subject property as containing the Farm House, barn,\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   Small House. Moreover, while InFirst Bank does aver in its Motion for Relief that the subject real property is located at 1181 Pleasant Valley Road (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Motion for Relief at \u00b6 10), the description of the real property at issue in the Motion for Relief explicitly identifies both parcels by separate boundaries and tax map parcel numbers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion for Relief, \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   As such, the Debtors were on notice that the entirety of the real property collateral was at issue and not only did they fail to point out their present argument, but the Debtors proceeded through the litigation as though they considered that to be the case. Indeed, as recent as the Debtors' Motion to Amend, the Debtors stated that InFirst Bank sought relief from stay against their \"Property,\" which they identify as being both parcels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4. Moreover, it has also been conceded that the \"Farm\" property subject of the Motion for Relief contains the Farm House, the rental house (i.e. Small House), and the two-story barn with a second-floor apartment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4. Accordingly, the Court disagrees with the Debtors' position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   For the purpose of avoiding any confusion going forward, and to prevent any issues with InFirst Bank's ability to move forward against their collateral, the Court clarifies its\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 79) dated November 20, 2018 to make it clear that relief from stay is granted as to both parcels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the Debtors have failed to show that they are entitled to relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 and/or 60, which are made applicable by Fed.R.Bankr.P. 9023 and 9024, respectively.

However, the funds comprising Mrs. Jager's expected inheritance-then allegedly sitting in an unspecified attorney's escrow account-were unable to be paid to InFirst Bank at that time because the decedent's estate had not yet been probated (the testimony suggests that the estate may not have even been opened at that time). Mrs. Jager explained that probate had not been completed because she needed to locate and receive permission from the decedent's relatives, some of whom were located in foreign countries. Mrs. Jager testified that during the course of her New York Bankruptcy Case, her bankruptcy counsel sought her permission to go to the probate office and have her expected inheritance turned over to the trustee. Mrs. Jager testified that she refused to give her attorney permission to do so because at that time she only had ten more people-presumably relatives of the decedent-to contact and Mrs. Jager wanted to finish doing so. Mrs. Jager testified that nonetheless, \"they took it and [she] ha[s] no idea of what's going on with it. [She] has not been informed of anything.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Oral Argument, November 14\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    hr'g at 12:20:50-12:22:30, 12:25:55-12:27:30. Accordingly, what is clear from the record is that Mrs. Jager is unaware of the status of her claimed exemption in the inheritance in her New York Bankruptcy Case. What is unclear to this Court is the status of the decedent's estate-i.e. whether it has been probated or is waiting on further action by Mrs. Jager. This clarification has no effect on the Court's determination that Plan 2 is unfeasible as it does not change the fact that the Debtors have no idea when Mrs. Jager will receive her exempted funds which are necessary to pay for the proposed subdivision of the Collateral essential to Plan 2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
