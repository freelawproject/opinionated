The bottom of the form order contains the following handwritten notation: \"Judgment is hereby entered for Plaintiff Michael Draka and against Joshua Andrea, Defendant, for his wilfull [sic] and malicious conduct on 8/14/14 that harmed the [plaintiff] and his property after hearing [plaintiff's] evidence for liability : damages.\" (ECF 1-1 at Pgs. 1-2.) In his adversary complaint the Plaintiff alleges that the \"basis for the willful and malicious finding was from an occurrence on or about August 14, 2014, wherein it was adjudicated that Josh Andrea willfully drove his motorcycle into the rear tire of Michael Draka's motorcycle while riding upon Route 25 in Kane County, Illinois.\" (Compl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Debtor denied several of Draka's material allegations in his answer. After the expiration of the discovery deadline, the Plaintiff filed this motion. Asserting that there is no genuine dispute as to the material facts, Mr. Draka further relies on the McHenry Court Order to argue that the state court's judgment determined that the debt is for willful and malicious injury to him and his property so as to preclude this court's further consideration of that issue. Together with the certified copy of the order, the Plaintiff submitted an undated, signed declaration of an alleged eye witness to the accident in support of his\n   motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Nos. 15, 15:2 (Exhibit B).) In his reply brief (ECF No. 27) and at oral argument, the Plaintiff further argues that the McHenry Court Order contained an express finding that the Debtor's conduct was \"willful and malicious,\" which collaterally estops the Debtor from contesting summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In his response, the Debtor denies certain material facts asserted by the Plaintiff and alleges additional facts, supporting both with his declaration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 25.) Among other things, the Debtor alleges that his motorcycle \"contacted\" the Plaintiff's vehicle \"as a result of Michael Draka moving into [his] part of the lane\" and denies that his actions were intentional. (ECF No. 25-2 (Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5,9).) The Debtor also disputes the collateral estoppel argument, asserting that the issues of willfulness and maliciousness were not \"actually litigated\" in the state court, and submits a copy of the state court complaint and the transcript of the state court proceeding after which the McHenry Court Order was entered. (ECF No. 25-5.) Following submission of the Plaintiff's reply brief and response to the Debtor's statement of facts this court conducted a hearing on the motion during which, as discussed above, the Plaintiff's counsel clarified his motion, withdrawing certain claims and arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court has closely reviewed the parties' respective statements of facts and responses pursuant to Local Rules 7056-1 and 7056-2. It finds that the following material facts are not in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 14, 2014, the Debtor and the Plaintiff were among a group of persons riding motorcycles on Route 25 in Kane County, Illinois. At some point, they accelerated and Andrea's motorcycle \"came into contact\" with Draka's. Both drivers lost control of their motorcycles and were ejected. Michael Klatka, the third-party declarant here, was an eyewitness to the event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2017, Mr. Draka brought suit against Mr. Andrea in the McHenry County court seeking money damages for personal injuries sustained as a result of the collision. His complaint averred that certain alleged negligent acts or omissions of Mr. Andrea caused the collision and the resulting personal injuries and pain and suffering. That pleading did not assert that the defendant's conduct was willful or malicious. The records of the circuit court disclose that Mr. Andrea entered his own appearance and that he never responded to the state court complaint. The limited court record does not show that an attorney appeared for the Defendant in the McHenry County proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The state court scheduled a final pre-trial hearing for October 6, 2017 and conducted an evidentiary hearing on October\n   10, 2017. The Defendant did not attend the evidentiary hearing which began with the judge defaulting the Defendant after taking note that no answer had been filed. The court then took up the damages and heard the testimony of Mr. Draka. The Plaintiff briefly described seeing the headlights of the Debtor's and Mr. Klatka's motorcycles in his rear-view mirror and then \"just flying through the air.\" (Tr., ECF 25-5, p. 4:1-5.) Recalling hitting the ground and receiving aid from responders, the Plaintiff then proceeded to testify about his injuries and the medical attention, diagnoses and treatments he received, his medical expenses, his current mental and physical condition, and his overall well-being. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-1-20\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ) At the court's prompting, Mr. Draka also testified about his lost wage claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:12-21.) The court concluded the evidentiary portion of the hearing stating \"[s]o liability has already been established on the defendant by virtue of the default\" and asked Plaintiff's counsel for his request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1616-18.) Counsel answered that $ 2-1/2 million is sufficient \"given the severity of the crash, the injuries, Mr. Draka's age, [and] the likelihood of spinal problems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1619-22.) The court then concluded the proceeding stating: \"All right. I will award - and round it off - $ 1,000,000 by way of judgment. Okay.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:2-3.) The transcript does not refer to nor reveal evidence of willful or malicious conduct, or that the court made or was asked to make a finding whether the Defendant so acted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the hearing the Debtor's attorney used a court form to prepare the proposed judgment order. (ECF No. 15-1 (Ex. A).) The form stated, without checking the accompanying selection \"box\", \"Defendant(s) having failed to appear or otherwise respond to the summons, is found in default. Judgment for Plaintiff(s) against Defendant(s) for $ 1,000,000 plus interest of $ _____ plus attorney fees of $ _____ for a total of $ 1,000,000 plus court costs.\" (ECF No. 25-4 at Pg. 31.) At the bottom of the form, Plaintiff's counsel additionally wrote in that the judgment was entered for Defendant's \"wilfull and malicious conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There were no further proceedings before the court before the judge signed and entered the order on October 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court shall grant a motion for summary judgment where \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

The undisputed record of the state court proceedings makes clear that the Debtor did not appear or present evidence at the hearing on October 10, 2017, which consisted of an uncontested damages prove-up. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF 25-5.) According to the transcript of that hearing, when the Plaintiff's attorney suggested that he would file a motion for entry of default, the judge interrupted: \"I can do it orally. I don't see an answer having been filed. So on that basis, I will default.\" (ECF No. 25-5 at 2:14-19).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: So then the issue becomes one of damages.

The McHenry Court Order, the form order on which the Plaintiff now relies, itself states \"Defendant(s) having failed to appear or otherwise respond to the summons, is found in default. Judgment for Plaintiff(s) against Defendant(s) for $ 1,000,000 plus interest of $ _____ plus attorney fees of $ _____ for a total of $ 1,000,000 plus court costs.\" (ECF No. 25-4 at Pg. 31.) Although the selection \"box\" for this part of the form order is not checked, it is the only place in the order where the amount of the award is stated: the $ 1,000,000 judgment amount being handwritten on two separate lines found in that section. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The court need not determine at this time whether Illinois law has a bright line rule that default judgments lack or have preclusive effect. The Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the McHenry County order precludes the Debtor from contesting in the bankruptcy proceeding that the judgment is for a willful and malicious injury. The Illinois Supreme Court cautions that \"[e]ven when the threshold requirements are satisfied, the doctrine [of collateral estoppel] should not be applied unless it is clear that no unfairness will result to the party sought to be estopped.\"\n   <em>\n    Savickas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=250%20Ill.%20Dec.%20682\">\n    250 Ill.Dec. 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=739%20N.E.2d%20445\">\n    739 N.E.2d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For such a determination, the court notes the potential relevancy of \"the party's incentive to litigate the issue in the prior action\" because even \"a party who did litigate an issue in a prior case might not be estopped by the result therein if he can show that the original litigation was a side show rather than a struggle to the finish.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=739%20N.E.2d%20445\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation omitted) (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Here, the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the Debtor had sufficient incentive to litigate the issue of willfulness or malice or that it was necessary to the judgment. The October 10, 2017 order was not accompanied by any findings of fact or\n   conclusions of law. Nor does the transcript show that the court made any oral findings or conclusions other than finding the Debtor in default and awarding damages of $ 1,000,000 to Mr. Draka for his personal injuries. There are no references to willfulness or malice in the hearing transcript. When asked during oral argument on November 28, 2018 about the handwritten statement at the bottom of the form order \"Judgment is hereby entered for Plaintiff Michael Draka and against Joshua Andrea, Defendant, for his wilfull [sic] and malicious conduct on 8/14/14 that harmed the [plaintiff] and his property after hearing [plaintiff's] evidence for liability : damages\", (ECF 25-4 at Pg. 31), counsel for the Plaintiff admitted that he wrote that language on the order form he prepared for the court without being instructed to do so by the state court judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It has not been shown that the Debtor was or should have been aware that such a finding would be made if he did not appear at trial. Indeed, the two-page state court complaint did not allege willful, malicious, or even intentional conduct by the Debtor. Instead, it alleged that \"the negligence of the Defendant, JOSHUA J. ANDREA, was the proximate cause of the collision and the personal injuries alleged in this complaint\" and that the Debtor breached his duty to operate his vehicle in a safe and reasonable manner \"by operating his vehicle in a careless and negligent manner.\" (ECF No. 25-4 at Pgs. 29-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Nor does the October 10, 2017 transcript show that any evidence was presented to the state court judge from which he could find willfulness or malice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the testimony of the Plaintiff - the only witness who testified - largely concerned his injuries, medical bills and post-collision condition. While the transcript shows that the Plaintiff testified to the state court, Illinois bankruptcy courts have noted that under Illinois law, \"[e]ven where the court determines specific damages based on verified pleadings and an evidentiary prove-up hearing, that does not remedy the lack of actual, contested litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Wease\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208078316\">\n    2016 WL 8078316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

This court therefore finds any stray references to an objection to discharge or denial of discharge to be unintended, and that any contrary argument that the Plaintiff seeks such a determination having not been raised is, therefore, waived.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Curiously, the Plaintiff also attached his \"Rule 26 Disclosures.\" That document, however, merely discloses the Plaintiff and witness Klatka to be potential witnesses, stating further that the \"Plaintiff is currently in possession of no documents other than case Filings,\" without explanation how this item supports his Rule 56(c)(1) statement of uncontested facts. The Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment did raise a collateral argument that the Debtor failed to tender evidence or witness disclosures pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 and should therefore be prohibited from presenting any evidence in response to the Motion. However, during the oral argument on the motion, his counsel conceded that there is a factual dispute as to his Rule 26 argument and that he did not seek sanctions under Rule 37 and withdrew his Rule 26 argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The Debtor's Response also attached a declaration of Debtor's counsel, disputing the Plaintiff's allegation that he had not tendered Rule 26 disclosures.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Nor does the state court record reveal that the Plaintiff presented evidence of or asked the court to award him monetary relief for property damages.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     In re Fakhuri\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511681\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/583/915/\">\n     583 B.R. 915\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 920 n.5 (Bankr.
