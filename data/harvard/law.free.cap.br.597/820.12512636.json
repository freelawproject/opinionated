Beyer, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This order comes at a pivotal crossroad in a lengthy and complex lawsuit involving Diana Houck (the \"Plaintiff\") and a party involved in the foreclosure sale of her home on December 20, 2011, Substitute Trustee Services, Inc. (\"STS\" or the \"Defendant\"). Indeed, after over five years of litigation, one question remains for this court to decide: whether the actions and inactions of STS on the afternoon of December 20, 2011 violated the automatic stay as codified in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the \"Bankruptcy Code\" or the \"Code\"). As\n   more extensively outlined in this court's February 5, 2018 Order Determining the Status of This Adversary Proceeding, Examining This Court's Subject Matter Jurisdiction, Recommending Withdrawal of the Reference, and Setting Status Hearing\" (the \"Recommendation Order\"), this adversary proceeding resulted in a number of extremely complicated procedural and jurisdictional questions. Only the facts and procedural history relevant to this particular order are repeated below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For all of the reasons stated below, this court hereby grants summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and finds that STS willfully violated the automatic stay as outlined in \u00a7 362. Further, the court denies the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions because STS's actions during the deposition at issue were not worthy of sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to this lawsuit, the Plaintiff filed two pro se Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases in this court. She filed her first case, case no. 11-51141 (the \"First Bankruptcy Case\"), on September 12, 2011 by filing a \"bare-bones\" petition. The Plaintiff's petition was missing many of the schedules and statements required of all Chapter 13 debtors. This court dismissed the First Bankruptcy Case on September 30, 2011 because the Plaintiff failed to timely file the missing documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plaintiff commenced her second Chapter 13 case, case no. 11-51513 (the \"Second Bankruptcy Case\"), on December 16, 2011. Again, the Plaintiff filed a \"bare-bones\" petition; her submission was missing many of the same schedules and statements that were missing in the First Bankruptcy Case. In conjunction with her petition, the Plaintiff requested additional time to file a certificate of credit counseling with the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unfortunately, the Debtor's filing did not have its desired effect because on December 20, 2011 at 12:57 P.M. a report of sale was filed in the Ashe County Clerk of Superior Court's office indicating that the Debtor's residence had been sold (the \"Foreclosure Sale\") to Lifestore Bank (\"Lifestore\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   There are conflicting arguments about when STS received notice of the Second Bankruptcy Case. On the one hand, STS argues that it did not receive notice of the Second Bankruptcy Case until April 2, 2012, well after the Foreclosure Sale, when it got a call from the Plaintiff's husband, Richard Penley (\"Penley\"), regarding his pending bankruptcy case. Memorandum in Support of Substitute Trustee Services, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment,\n   <em>\n    Houck v. Substitute Trustee Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-5028 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. Oct. 31, 2018), ECF No. 59, at 7 (hereinafter, \"STS's Brief\"). However, STS then includes a footnote on the same page of its brief that reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   It appears that [the Plaintiff's husband's] lender, Nationstar Mortgage, LLC, alerted Hutchens to the filing of the [Second Bankruptcy Case] in connection with [Penley's foreclosure file] on December 20, 2011 at approximately 3:52 P.M - three (3) hours after the foreclosure sale had been held in connection with the Houck Foreclosure Proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   STS's Brief at 7 n.1. To reconcile these inconsistent statements, STS argued at the hearing that the \"notice\" it got from Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (\"Nationstar\") on December 20, 2011 was given to the Hutchens Law Firm (\"Hutchens\"), not STS, and was received only with respect to Penley's case, not the Plaintiff's Second Bankruptcy Case specifically. STS was represented by the Hutchens Law Firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In response, the Plaintiff asserts in its Complaint that Hutchens, and necessarily STS, actually received a call from Penley on December 16, 2011 advising the Hutchens Law Firm of the Second Bankruptcy Case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the Plaintiff notes that Lifestore was listed on the Plaintiff's creditor matrix that she included with the Second Bankruptcy Case filing; Plaintiff maintains that this undercuts STS's theory that it didn't get notice until April 2012. Finally, and most importantly, the Plaintiff argues that even if the court is not convinced that Penley called STS on December 16, 2011, STS still had notice as of December 20, 2011 at 3:52 P.M. The Plaintiff points to STS's own admissions found in the aforementioned footnote and subsequent deposition excerpts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum in Support of Defendant Substitute Trustee Services, Inc.'s Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Amend and Compel, at Ex.

Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-05028, ECF No. 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following Nationstar's call, STS took no action with respect to the Foreclosure Sale during the Second Bankruptcy Case. On December 21, 2011, this court dismissed the Second Bankruptcy Case due to the Plaintiff's failure to satisfy the credit counseling requirement. It is these events-events during the five-day lifespan of the Second Bankruptcy Case-that gave rise to the last several years of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A year and a half after this court dismissed the Second Bankruptcy Case, this adversarial proceeding began its less than traditional journey through the court system. The Plaintiff filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina (\"District Court\") on April 26, 2013. The complaint, as subsequently amended, alleges that the original defendants, Lifestore, STS, and Grid Financial Services, Inc. (\"Grid\"), fraudulently engaged in a conspiracy to cause the Plaintiff to default on her mortgage payments in violation of several state laws and then foreclosed on her property in violation of the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay. In July of 2013, the parties filed a Joint Stipulation of Consent to Exercise Jurisdiction by a United States Magistrate Judge, and the District Court assigned the lawsuit to the Honorable David S. Cayer. On October 1, 2013, Judge Cayer entered a Memorandum and Order (\"October 1 Order\") granting STS's motion to dismiss and dismissing all of the claims against STS. The Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal of the October 1 Order on October 28, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Several months later, on August 27, 2014, the Fourth Circuit entered an unpublished opinion dismissing the Plaintiff's appeal of the October 1 Order for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Eventually, the Plaintiff returned to the Fourth Circuit and filed a motion for clarification of its August 27, 2014 opinion. On December 17, 2014, the Fourth Circuit recalled its mandate and granted panel rehearing of the Plaintiff's appeal of the October 1 Order. After rehearing this matter, the Fourth Circuit entered an opinion on July 1, 2015 that, among other things, reversed the October 1 Order, and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Houck v. Substitute Tr. Servs., Inc. (In re Houck)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275368,5917484\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/473/\">\n    791 F.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 487 (4th Cir. 2015) (\" July 1 Opinion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its opinion, the Fourth Circuit panel concluded that the District Court undertook the wrong legal analysis in granting STS's motion to dismiss in the October 1 Order and found that STS's motion should have been denied under the correct standard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275368,5917484\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/473/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275368,5917484\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/473/\">\n    at 484-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the Fourth Circuit panel reviewed the Plaintiff's complaint and concluded that, contrary to STS's allegations in its motion to dismiss, the Plaintiff did sufficiently allege that STS had notice of the Second Bankruptcy Case and that the Plaintiff suffered an injury as a result of the alleged stay violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275368,5917484\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/473/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275368,5917484\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/473/\">\n    at 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The panel also rejected STS's alternative argument that there was no automatic stay in the Second Bankruptcy Case because the Plaintiff was not eligible to be a debtor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275368,5917484\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/473/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275368,5917484\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/473/\">\n    at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the Fourth Circuit determined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   While Houck's second bankruptcy petition was filed within 180 days after the dismissal of her first petition, the Substitute Trustee has not shown that the first petition was dismissed because Houck\n   <em>\n    willfully\n   </em>\n   failed to abide by the bankruptcy court's orders or to appear in proper prosecution of her case. Indeed, the record shows to the contrary. The bankruptcy court dismissed Houck's first petition, which she filed pro se, because she \"failed to file certain schedules, statements, or other documents.\" It made no mention of Houck's failure being\n   <em>\n    willful\n   </em>\n   ...[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, when Houck filed her second petition ... no party to the second petition questioned whether Houck was an eligible debtor ...[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Whether Houck was an eligible debtor when she filed her second petition is a fact-bound question that requires evidentiary support.

This court then entered an Order Requiring Briefing on Questions of Status, Jurisdiction, and Preemption on November 3, 2015 (the \"Briefing Order\"). On December 22, 2015, the Plaintiff filed a Motion to Withdraw Referral that was denied by Judge Cayer\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This court entered the Recommendation Order on February 5, 2018. As its name suggests, the order outlines the status of the lawsuit and this court's view on its subject matter jurisdiction over the Plaintiff's \u00a7 362 and state law claims. Recommendation Order, case no. 15-05028, ECF no. 27. This court concluded that the Plaintiff's appeal to the Fourth Circuit did not affect the District Court's orders dismissing the claims against Grid and Lifestore,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   n.1, and that STS is the only remaining defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Similarly, this court found that the only remaining claims in this case were the \u00a7 362(k) claim\n   against STS and some of Plaintiff's state law claims against STS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This court recommended that the District Court withdraw the reference as to the entire adversary proceeding, \u00a7 362 claim and state law claims alike, so all of the claims might be heard together.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The District Court assigned review of the Recommendation Order to the Honorable Max O. Cogburn, Jr. and, on February 7, 2018, Judge Cogburn entered an order that found that this court is \"uniquely qualified to determine whether a willful violation of the automatic stay in bankruptcy occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Houck v. Lifestore Bank\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 18-00022, at 1 (W.D.N.C. Feb. 7, 2015).

(II) STS willfully violated the automatic stay when it received notice of the Second Bankruptcy Case and took no steps to undo the effects of the Foreclosure Sale.

The words of the First Dismissal Order are unambiguous: the Debtor failed to file her schedules and statements in compliance with the rules of this court, and her case was dismissed as a result. The Honorable J. Craig Whitley made no mention of any failure \"to appear in proper prosecution of the case.\" Arguably, Judge Whitley could have chosen to bar the Plaintiff from refiling, dismissed the First Bankruptcy Case with prejudice, or even chosen to draft a more detailed order that\n   outlined the problems with the First Bankruptcy Case. He took no such actions. Based on this plain-language reading alone, STS's ineligibility argument under \u00a7 109(g) fails. More importantly, this court is not unaccompanied in this supposition. The Fourth Circuit has considered this same issue, in this same case, based on similar, if not the same, arguments from STS, and it agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     The Fourth Circuit's consideration of 109(g)\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In its July 1 Opinion, the Fourth Circuit rejected STS's argument that the Plaintiff was not eligible to be a debtor under \u00a7 109(g). \"Inconsistency is the antithesis of the rule of law,\" and under the law-of-the-case doctrine \"the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   issue presented a second time in the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   case in the\n   <em>\n    same court\n   </em>\n   should lead to the\n   <em>\n    same result\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    LaShawn A. v.

Here, the Fourth Circuit has already stated that the Plaintiff's failure to submit her schedules and statements was not equivalent to a willful failure to prosecute. The Fourth Circuit explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [STS] has not shown that the [First Bankruptcy Case] was dismissed because [the Plaintiff]\n   <em>\n    willfully\n   </em>\n   failed to abide by the bankruptcy court's orders or to appear in proper prosecution of her case.

The facts, evidence, and legal argument presented by the parties with respect to the Plaintiff's eligibility to be a debtor have not changed since the Fourth Circuit issued the July 1 Opinion. STS repeated, almost verbatim, the same argument in STS's Brief. Thus, the Fourth Circuit has spoken, and this court is bound by its mandate on the issue. This language was not dicta, it was the law of the case and subject to the mandate rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, STS's contention that the above Fourth Circuit language is dicta, and therefore not dispositive, is not persuasive. \"It is self-evident that characterization of language in a judicial opinion as\n   <em>\n    dictum\n   </em>\n   does not mean that it is legally incorrect.\"\n   <em>\n    Branch ex rel.

Furthermore, classifying the aforementioned language as dicta does not lead to the conclusion that the Fourth Circuit got it wrong. In fact, the Fourth Circuit has, in essence, foreshadowed how it would rule on this issue were it positioned to do so. Neither the facts surrounding this Debtor's eligibility nor the statutes to be applied or the arguments presented have changed since the Fourth Circuit contemplated the Plaintiff's eligibility under \u00a7 109(g). Even if dicta, the court does not see any reason why the Fourth Circuit's words would not still be subject to the mandate rule. Thus, it is just shy of futile for STS to raise this issue once more, in a fleeting hope that this court will read new meaning into the First Dismissal Order. This court concludes that the Plaintiff was eligible to be a debtor when she filed the Second Bankruptcy Case, and therefore, the automatic stay went into effect on December 16, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Like Grason, the Plaintiff filed two bankruptcy cases in a short period of time to prevent a foreclosure sale of property. Moreover, both Grason's second case and the Second Bankruptcy Case were filed on the eve of a scheduled foreclosure sale. Neither HSBC nor STS had actual knowledge of the respective pending bankruptcy cases when they conducted the foreclosure sales, and in both cases, the sales took place after the automatic stay went into effect. Initially, both were in technical violation of the stay. HSBC's technical violation became a willful violation once it got notice and failed to act, and the same reasoning renders STS's inaction a willful violation of the stay. It did not matter to the\n   <em>\n    Grason\n   </em>\n   court that Grason's second bankruptcy case had been dismissed shortly after the sale, and the short life-span of the Second Bankruptcy Case does not matter here. STS's technical violation became willful when Hutchens got the 3:52 P.M. phone call and did nothing despite Hutchens' extensive bankruptcy experience and knowledge of the Code. STS chose to not remedy its technical violation, and in fact, STS proceeded with the state court formalities of signing and recording the trustee's deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Importantly, STS does not deny that its \"practice\" after learning of a foreclosure sale in technical violation of the stay is to wait and see if the case is dismissed before taking steps to undo the sale. The court wholeheartedly agrees with the Plaintiff's contention that this practice is abhorrent. The court is dumbfounded by the cavalier position that STS has taken regarding its seemingly obvious stay violation. The essence of STS's \"wait-and-see\" approach is flawed and in direct conflict with a litany of case law. If STS learns of a technical violation, it is obligated to determine the effect of the stay and remedy its violation-not wait to see if the case will be dismissed and the \"barrier\" of the automatic stay removed.\n   <em>\n    Weatherford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4118089\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/413/273/#p283\">\n    413 B.R. at 285-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a creditor \"is obligated to determine the effect of [a] bankruptcy case\" regarding any actions it has taken in technical violation of the automatic stay before proceeding any further);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMullen v.

STS's post-dismissal recordation of the sale and execution of the trustee's deed amount to willful violations of the automatic stay; STS picked up right where it left off as though the Second Bankruptcy Case never existed. STS retained its improved position following the Foreclosure Sale, and its retention thereof amounted to an ongoing violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In summary, STS could have come to this court upon learning of the Second Bankruptcy Case and requested an emergency hearing to annul the stay. Instead, it chose to put its head in the sand. STS could have notified the state court clerk of court of this bankruptcy case; it chose to turn a blind eye. STS could have reinitiated the foreclosure sale process; it chose to carry on with a defective sale. The court acknowledges the frustration that STS experienced with the Plaintiff's tactics, jockeying between the state court and this court, but also recognizes the importance of respecting the automatic stay. STS's decision not to act was a willful violation of the automatic stay, and this order should serve as notice to other creditors that they cannot ignore the effects of the stay when it is inconvenient. A finding to the contrary would render the stay meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    iii.\n    <em>\n     Damages\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Turning to the last element necessary for recovery under \u00a7 362, the Plaintiff must show STS's willful violation of the automatic stay resulted in an injury to the Plaintiff. At this time, the amount and extent of injury are not at issue, simply the mere existence of damages. Rather than exhaustively list all the ways in which the Plaintiff could, in fact, be damaged, this court simply defers to the prior discussions of the Fourth Circuit in this case where it acknowledges that the complaint \"more than adequately\" alleged facts that, if true, would point to injury resulting from a stay violation.\n   <em>\n    In reHouck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275368,5917484\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/473/\">\n    791 F.3d at 485-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While this court still needs to determine if all of these allegations are true, suffice it to say there were injuries to the Plaintiff. The court will determine the extent of the Plaintiff's damages at a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In summary, upon consideration of all of the evidence, there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact regarding STS's willful violation of the automatic stay, and summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiff is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

STS maintains that the parties engaged in \"dialogue to set the 'ground rules' for Mr. Miller's deposition\" at the beginning of the deposition, and even then, Plaintiff's counsel admitted that he \"probably should have asked [Lan\u00e9e Borsman] questions he intended for [Miller].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7848340\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/166/356/#p363\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   STS says that it \"stipulated to answers when [Miller] lacked knowledge\" and offered to reopen Lan\u00e9e Borsman's deposition to allow her to testify as to Hutchens' business records.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7848340\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/166/356/#p363\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   STS says Plaintiff's counsel indicated he would submit written questions for any gaps in the deposition, but it never received any supplemental written questions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. In short, STS maintains that it acted amicably, and that it was blind-sided by the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Based on the arguments outlined above, the court denies the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions. Apparently, there was confusion as to the scope of Miller's deposition and, specifically, the scope of his knowledge about Hutchens and its records. The court is satisfied with STS's showing of its efforts to supplement and cure any deficiencies with this witness. Thus, the motion for sanctions is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For all of the reasons stated above, this court grants the Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment but denies the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions. The court concludes that the Debtor was eligible to be a debtor under \u00a7 109(g) when she filed the Second Bankruptcy Case, and that STS was in technical violation of the automatic stay when it conducted the Houck Foreclosure Sale. STS's technical violation of the automatic stay turned into a willful violation, which resulted in injury to the Plaintiff, when STS took no action to restore the status quo after learning about the Plaintiff's active bankruptcy case on the afternoon of December 20, 2011. STS's blatant disregard for the automatic stay is unacceptable and should not be emulated by other members of the creditors' bar. Finally, STS's actions regarding its deposition witness were not sanctionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Hutchens says that its thorough business records do not reflect a phone call from the Plaintiff or Penley between December 16, 2011 and December 20, 2011.
