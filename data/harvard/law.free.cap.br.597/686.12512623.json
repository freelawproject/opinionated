Mark, Judge United States Bankruptcy Court\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The trustee in this chapter 7 case objects to the debtors' attempt to utilize the federal personal property exemptions. On the petition date, the debtors, who are Venezuelan citizens, were lawfully residing in Florida and had the actual intent to permanently reside in Florida. The issue is, were they \"domiciled\" in Florida and, therefore, subject to Florida exemptions when, on the petition date, they had a pending application for political asylum? This Court says yes. The fact that their right to remain in the United States was subject to termination if their asylum petition was denied did not defeat Florida domicile and entitle the debtors to utilize the federal exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Debtors in this case are political asylees who have lived in Florida for nearly seven years. They entered the United States in 2012 under B-1/B-2 \"visitor\" visas that expire in 2022 but they promptly applied for political asylum \"in late 2012 or early 2013\" (the \"Asylum Application\") [DE # 58, pp.2-3]. According to the Trustee, the Debtors testified \"that since 2013[,] they knew [that] they could not return to Venezuela and had every intention of staying in Florida\" [DE # 64, p.4].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, after the Debtors filed their Asylum Application, the Debtors became immigrants seeking to stay indefinitely in the United States as opposed to visitors residing in Florida for a limited duration under a business or tourism visa. And that was their status on March 23, 2018 (the \"Petition Date\") when they filed their chapter 7 petition commencing this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the Petition Date, the Debtors did not own any real property [DE # 1, p.10], so they did not claim a homestead exemption. In Schedule \"C,\" the Debtors claim as exempt only personal property utilizing the federal exemptions in \u00a7 522(d) of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"Debtors' Claimed Exemptions\") [DE # 1, pp. 20-21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 29, 2018, the Chapter 7 Trustee, Marcia T. Dunn (the \"Trustee\"), filed an objection to the Debtors' Claimed Exemptions (the \"Objection\") [DE # 53]. In her Objection, the Trustee argues,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"the Debtors are Florida residents, and therefore, are not entitled to the federal exemptions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20222.20\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" Objection at p.3, para. 10. The Debtors filed a response (the \"Response\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   in which they counter that \"aliens residing in the United States pending an application for political asylum cannot satisfy Florida's permanency requirements nor qualify to claim Florida exemptions.\" [DE # 58, p.2]. Therefore, they argue that they are entitled to the exemptions in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (the \"Federal Exemptions\"). The issue is meaningful because the federal personal property exemptions in \u00a7 522(d) are more generous than the personal property exemptions available under Florida law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court conducted a preliminary hearing on the Trustee's Objection on September 13, 2018. After the hearing, the Court entered an order [DE # 62] setting a further hearing on \"the issue of whether the Debtors are entitled to claim the federal exemptions set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)\" (the \"Contested Matter\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, the Trustee filed a Memorandum of Law in Support of [her Objection] (the \"Trustee's Memorandum\") [DE # 64], and the Debtors filed a Response to [the Trustee's Memorandum] (the \"Debtors' Memorandum\") [DE # 65]. The Court conducted a further hearing on the Contested Matter on October 17, 2018. After the October 17th hearing, the Debtors filed a notice of supplemental authority (the \"\n   <em>\n    Lisboa\n   </em>\n   Brief\") [DE # 66], and the Court took the Contested Matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code governs exemptions in a bankruptcy case. The Federal Exemptions in section 522(d) identify property that may be exempted from a debtor's bankruptcy estate under federal law. The Federal Exemptions apply to a debtor's bankruptcy case \"unless the State law that is applicable to the debtor ... specifically does not so authorize.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). If Florida law applies, the Debtors may not claim the Federal Exemptions because Florida Statute \u00a7 222.20 (the \"Opt-Out Statute\") provides that \"residents of this state shall not be entitled to the federal exemptions provided in \u00a7 522(d) of the Bankruptcy Code.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Trustee argues that Florida's Opt-Out Statute precludes the Debtors from claiming the Federal Exemptions because they were undeniably \"residents\" of Florida on the Petition Date. The Court rejects this argument. The Florida Opt-Out Statute only applies if application of Florida law is appropriate under \u00a7 522(b)(3)(A). With certain exceptions not relevant here, Florida law is only applicable to debtors who have been\n   <em>\n    domiciled\n   </em>\n   in Florida for at least 730 days prior to filing for bankruptcy relief. In short, the determinative issue here is domicile, not residency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Arispe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9360380\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/289/245/#p248\">\n    289 B.R. 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (Bankr.

As discussed above, Florida and federal law similarly define the concept of domicile as actual residence coupled with present intention to permanently remain. Relevant jurisprudence on what is meant by \"permanent residence\" includes tax cases, cases determining eligibility for social services, and exemption cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Varied Applicability and Iterations of Permanency Under the Florida Exemption Scheme\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Constitution of the State of Florida empowers permanent Florida residents to claim two types of exemptions relating to a permanent Florida residence, one that exempts a Florida homestead (often in its entirety) from most collection actions (the \"Homestead Exemption\") and another that exempts from taxation some portion of the value of a Florida homestead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The tax exemption in article VII, section 6 of the Florida Constitution authorizes \"[e]very person who has the legal or equitable title to real estate and maintains thereon the permanent residence of the owner\" to exempt from ad valorem taxation a fixed portion of the assessed value of a Florida homestead. Fla. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 6 (the \"Tax Exemption\").

Further muddying the waters is the fact that both\n   <em>\n    Juarrero\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lisboa\n   </em>\n   are Tax Exemption cases, and an immigrant who can form a permanent intention for tax purposes might not be able to form the same intention for purposes of claiming Florida's Homestead Exemption.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fodor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2700277\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/339/519/#p522\">\n    339 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   523 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11702213\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/223/594/\">\n    223 B.R. 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599 n.3 (Bankr.

Nevertheless, Florida courts have held that permanency in the context of Tax Exemption cases is relevant to the analysis of eligibility for the Florida Homestead Exemption.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooke\n   </em>\n   at 343 (\n   <em>\n    Cooke\n   </em>\n   , a Homestead Exemption case, cites\n   <em>\n    Juarrero\n   </em>\n   , a Tax Exemption case, as \"pertinent\" authority).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Diminishing Vitality of PRUCOL Status\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Another obstacle to harmonizing Florida jurisprudence on a political asylee's ability to form a permanent intention is the fact that most Florida cases give weight to an immigrant's official immigration status, and immigration laws are a moving target. Political asylees might have been issued temporary visas at one point in time, and no visas at another. They might be considered persons PRUCOL at one point in time, and PRUCOL status later might not be recognized as an official status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Trustee and the Debtors both focus on PRUCOL classification but disagree on whether the Debtors have PRUCOL status. The Debtors argue that PRUCOL was abolished as an official immigration status in 1996, and to the extent PRUCOL status survives at all, PRUCOL's only remaining vitality is in connection with state-level social services. [DE # 58, pp.8-9; DE # 65, pp.3-4; DE # 66, pp.18-23]. The Florida Statutes explicitly made PRUCOL persons eligible for social services.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alfred v.

According to the Debtors, the Florida Statutes no longer recognize PRUCOL as a class of persons eligible for social services, and the Court should not classify any immigrants as PRUCOL. [DE # 58, pp.8-9; DE # 65, pp.3-4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Trustee argues that PRUCOL status is alive and well. [DE # 64, p.3, n.2]. The Court's independent research indicates that one of the Florida Statutes cited above eliminated its reference to PRUCOL, while another Florida Statute still uses the phrase.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20409.026\">\n    Fla.

Moreover, at least one Florida appellate case championing the rights of PRUCOL immigrants,\n   <em>\n    Lisboa v.

Nevertheless, the Florida Supreme Court dismissed the Florida Department of Revenue's application for review.\n   <em>\n    Dade County Property Appraiser v.

Under current immigration laws, the Debtors were not lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The United States Code explicitly says as much,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (2018) (\"Asylum granted under subsection (b) does not convey a right to remain permanently in the United States.\"), and imposes a one-year waiting period on adjustment to permanent residence after an application for asylum is granted.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201159\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (2018). This means that the Debtors could not obtain what is colloquially known as a \"green card\" (i.e. proof of permanent resident status) for more than a year from the Petition Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   A debtor's official immigration status is probative of the debtor's intent to establish a permanent Florida residence and, in some instances, may be determinative. However, the Court declines to base this opinion\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on the Debtors' official immigration status. As simply stated in a 2011 opinion of Florida's Third District Court of Appeal (the \"Third DCA\"), to find otherwise would \"ignore that eligibility for the Homestead Exemption depends on the intent of the homesteader rather than that of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\"\n   <em>\n    Grisolia v. Pfeffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7022859\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/77/732/#p734\">\n    77 So.3d 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735 (Fla. 3d DCA 2011) (\"\n   <em>\n    Grisolia v. Pfeffer\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Grisolia v. Pfeffer\n   </em>\n   is a Homestead Exemption case involving the family-member exception to the right-of-permanent-residence requirement. In that case, the Third DCA assessed an immigrant's ability to formulate a permanent intention. After embarking on a sweeping review of\n   <em>\n    Cooke\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Juarrero\n   </em>\n   , and their progeny, the Third DCA concluded that many of the cases discussed above are of limited precedential value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   So, where does that leave us? The Court rejects the broad conclusion reached in those cases that invariably require a green card, that is, lawful admission for permanent residence, to establish a permanent intention. That bright-line rule was not necessary to support the result reached in most, if not all, \"green-card requirement\" cases. In fact, the Court\n   agrees that an immigrant legally cannot form an intent to permanently reside in Florida if the immigrant is living in Florida illegally or under a temporary visa, such as a tourist or business visa with an expiration date. But those are not the facts here. On the Petition Date, the Debtors were lawfully living in Florida and were not here solely under a temporary visa. True, they did not have green cards, but they were residing here\n   <em>\n    indefinitely\n   </em>\n   pending a determination granting or denying their Asylum Application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Federal and Florida Jurisprudence Support an Interpretation of Permanency That is Synonymous With Indefinitely\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Lisboa\n   </em>\n   is of particular relevance to the Contested Matter before the Court because the\n   <em>\n    Lisboa\n   </em>\n   Court discussed the definition of \"permanent\" in the Immigration and Naturalization Act, which today is still defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The term \"permanent\" means a relationship of continuing or lasting nature, as distinguished from temporary, but a relationship may be permanent even though it is one that may be dissolved eventually at the instance either of the United States or of the individual, in accordance with law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Lisboa\n   </em>\n   at 706-07 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(31) (1998) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(31) (2014) (identical definition of \"permanent\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Lisboa\n   </em>\n   Court also cited to and quoted from the Florida Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services v.

In that case, the federal Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that a Canadian national (\"Holley\") residing illegally in the United States was nevertheless PRUCOL and eligible for social services.\n   <em>\n    Solis\n   </em>\n   at 148. The Immigration and Naturalization Service indicated in a letter that it did not intend to deport Holley. The Florida Supreme Court interpreted the Second Circuit's opinion as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The [Second Circuit] [c]ourt found Holley to be permanently residing in the United States because, even though she could be deported, the reality was that she would not be. \"Permanently,\" therefore, does not mean \"forever,\" but, rather means an indefinite period of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Solis\n   </em>\n   at 148 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Thus, in the context of welfare benefits, the Florida Supreme Court looked to federal cases interpreting the meaning of \"permanent residence\" and declined to adopt a bright-line rule that objectively would make immigrants without green cards incapable of forming the requisite legal intent. This Court finds persuasive the Florida Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Solis\n   </em>\n   and holds that an immigrant legally can form the permanent intention required to establish a U.S. domicile if the immigrant\n   lawfully can reside in the U.S. indefinitely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On the Petition Date, the Debtors lawfully were living in Florida indefinitely and actually intended to establish a permanent Florida residence.

This Court rejects a bright-line rule that would bar any foreign citizen without a green card from having the legal intent necessary to establish domicile in Florida. Where, as here, the Debtors entered the United States lawfully under temporary visas, promptly applied for asylum status and had the actual intent to reside permanently in the United States, the Court holds that the Debtors could and did have both the actual and legal intent for permanent residence necessary to establish domicile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Therefore, it is -\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   1.
