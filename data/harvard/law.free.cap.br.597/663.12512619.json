The Order erroneously dismissed FNBO's Second Amended Complaint (Dkt. 33), which contained claims solely arising under the Plan Note. Those claims, however, were resolved by stipulation of the parties, (Dkt. 60), and the Court entered judgment in favor of FNBO on March 28, 2017. (Dkt. 62).

KOVACHEVICH, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS CAUSE\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court for consideration on remand by the Eleventh Circuit. (Dkt. 69). Petitioner, First National Bank of Onieda, N.A. (\"\n   <strong>\n    FNBO\n   </strong>\n   \"), originally brought this action against Defendant, Donald Brandt (\"\n   <strong>\n    Brandt\n   </strong>\n   \"), to collect the remaining amounts due on several loans after the real estate securing those loans was sold and the proceeds of those sales did not cover the outstanding balances. Brandt, who had earlier filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, moved to dismiss FNBO's claims on the grounds that FNBO could not state a claim for a deficiency because it had not complied with certain provisions of Brandt's previously confirmed chapter 11 plan. This Court agreed with Brandt and dismissed FNBO's deficiency claims that related to loans made before Brandt filed his chapter 11 petition. FNBO appealed this dismissal and, after the parties had filed their briefs, Brandt moved the bankruptcy court to dismiss his chapter 11 case. The bankruptcy court granted Brandt's motion to dismiss. Given the dismissal of his underlying bankruptcy petition, none of Brandt's debts or liabilities were discharged and the automatic stay was terminated. The Eleventh Circuit, in light of what it considers a potentially significant case development, vacated this Court's dismissal of FNBO's deficiency claims and remanded for this Court to consider, in the first instance, whether the dismissal of Brandt's chapter 11 case without a discharge has any effect of FBNO's ability to pursue its deficiency claims in this case.\n   <em>\n    First National Bank of Oneida, N.A. v.

Procedural History of this Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   FNBO filed its original complaint in January 2016. (Dkt. 1). Brandt moved to dismiss that complaint arguing, among other things, that FNBO could not seek an unsecured deficiency judgment related to its pre-petition real estate loans because FNBO \"did not take the steps delineated in Class 45 [of the chapter 11 plan] to assert an unsecured deficiency claim.\" (Dkt. 9). Specifically, FNBO did not file an amended claim seeking entitlement to an unsecured claim within 30 days after the confirmation hearing. Brandt further argued that allowing FNBO to obtain a deficiency judgment would \"disrupt [the plan's] distribution scheme\" and cause Brandt to default on his payments to other creditor classes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516519\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/1255/#p1262\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In an order entered on May 13, 2016, this Court concluded that FNBO's original complaint stated a plausible claim for deficiency only with respect to the post-petition promissory note. (Dkt. 21). The Court ruled that any deficiency claims related to the pre-petition real-estate loans \"necessarily would have been classified in Class 45.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Because FNBO had not alleged \"compl[iance] with the Plan's requirements pertaining to Class 45 deficiency claims,\" this Court dismissed FNBO's deficiency claims related to the pre-petition real-estate loans and instructed FNBO that if it wished to file an amended complaint, it \"must attach copies of the Plan, Confirmation Order, and Proofs of Claim, and allege compliance with the provisions relating to Class 45 deficiency claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   FNBO then filed an amended complain that, like the original complaint, sought the remaining amounts due on both the pre-petition real-estate loans and the post-petition promissory note. (Dkt. 22). FNBO attached copies of the plan, the confirmation order, and the relevant proofs of claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It did not, however, allege compliance with the provisions relating to Class 45 deficiency claims. Instead, FNBO argued that it was not required to comply with those provisions because, by all accounts, it was oversecured during the relevant time period and because Brandt's chapter 11 plan brought Brandt current on his obligations to FNBO through August 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, FNBO claims it \"was not required to file a contingent unsecured claim in a speculative unknown amount to preserve its right to receive the full payment promised by the Plan, in the event that Brandt should perhaps default at some later date on his Plan obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This Court again dismissed FNBO's deficiency claims related to the pre-petition real-estate loans, reiterating that dismissal was warranted because FNBO failed to allege compliance with provisions of Brandt's chapter 11 plan relating to Class 45 deficiency claims, as the Court had directed it must do to state a viable claim. (Dkt. 33). This Court granted FNBO leave to file a second amended complaint to pursue only its claim under the post-petition promissory note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   FNBO filed a second amended complaint in compliance with this Court's Order. (Dkt. 33). Brandt failed to answer the second amended complaint and the clerk entered a default against him. (Dkt. 41). After this Court denied Brandt's motion to set aside that entry of default, Brandt and\n   FNBO stipulated to the entry of a judgment against Brandt for $ 180,000 related to the post-petition promissory note. (Dkt. 60). Judgment was entered on March 28, 2017. (Dkt. 62). FNBO then brought this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, on December 14, 2017, after both parties had fully briefed the appeal, Brandt moved the bankruptcy court to dismiss his bankruptcy case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516519\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/1255/#p1262\">\n    887 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1259 ; (BK Dkt. 860).

According to the dismissal, the automatic stay was terminated and \"[n]one of [Brandt's] debts, liabilities, or obligations [were] discharged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516519\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/1255/#p1262\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   FNBO requested the Eleventh Circuit take Judicial Notice of the dismissal of Brandt's bankruptcy case. The Eleventh Circuit granted that motion, vacating this Court's decision on the basis of changed circumstances and remanding for this Court to consider whether the dismissal of Brandt's chapter 11 case without a discharge-after issuance of the Order on appeal here-is a potentially significant event that affects the ultimate disposition of this case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516519\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/1255/#p1262\">\n    887 F.3d at 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Public Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Legislative history illustrates that BAPCPA was a \"comprehensive package of reform measures,\" enacted in response to the increase in consumer bankruptcy filings and to protect the interests of creditors. H.R. Rep. No. 109-31, pt. 1 at 2 (2005). Specifically, Congress noted the following reasons for the 2005 bankruptcy reforms: rapid escalation of bankruptcy filings; significant losses associated with bankruptcy filings due to creditors' inability to collect; and loopholes and incentives in the present bankruptcy system that allow and even sometimes encourage personal filings and abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-18. These reasons indicate that the public policy reason driving the 2005 bankruptcy reforms was, at least in part, to protect and empower creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   However, Brandt argues that public policy necessitates that the confirmed chapter 11 plan survives the dismissal without discharge of his bankruptcy case. Specifically, Brandt contends that FNBO conflates the definition of \"fresh start\" and \"discharge,\" and claims the two are separate terms with separate meanings in law and history. (Dkt. 76 \u00b6 16). According to Brandt, Congress \"breath[es] effectiveness into chapter 11 for debtors\" by allowing a fresh start even in the absence of discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Brandt asserts that he received a limited fresh start upon the confirmation of his chapter 11 plan because he did not receive a discharge, which prevents him from avoiding his obligations despite the survival of his plan beyond dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Brandt outlines various potentially negative consequences of dismissal, including the possibility of \"phantom income\" arising from the dismissal or interest that accrued on unsecured claims during the pendency of a plan in a dismissed case, to argue that a confirmed plan that survives dismissal of a bankruptcy case without discharge will continue to incentivize debtors toward plan completion and debt discharge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Alternatively, according to Brandt, the concept of a fresh start goes to the debtor's ability for a financial rebirth, which does not require a discharge if a debtor is able to reorganize and restructure his debts pursuant to a chapter 11 plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Yet, Brandt's arguments do not address the need for Congress to amend the statute to change the requisite conditions for a grant of discharge to an individual debtor. Furthermore, as noted by FNBO, Brandt cites only cases involving either a corporate debtor or a pre-2005 individual debtor: all cases in which discharge was granted upon plan confirmation. (Dkt. 77 at 6-11). Thus, Brandt's arguments are unpersuasive, and the Court finds that public policy supports a finding that FNBO may seek to enforce its pre-petition rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that under the facts of this case, Brandt's confirmation plan no longer precludes FNBO from pursuing its pre-petition claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

At the confirmation hearing, FNBO's attorney explained to the bankruptcy court that Brandt had granted FNBO a lien on approximately nine previously unencumbered properties worth $ 150,000 to cover interest that had accrued on six of FNBO's real-estate loans. Brandt had already issued a promissory note-for $ 142,353.65-and a deed of trust for the relevant real estate to FNBO in May 2010. The bankruptcy court approved and ratified that transaction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Notably, the standard for revoking a chapter 11 plan is the same as the standard for revoking a chapter 12 or chapter 13 plan.

Brandt asserts that because of the plan's confirmation, he \"was able to refinance and restructure his indebtedness to FNBO.\" (Dkt. 76 \u00b6 18). However, Brandt does not articulate facts sufficient to demonstrate that he relied to his detriment on the plan.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
