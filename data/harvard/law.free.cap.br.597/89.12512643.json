Wright, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In these related bankruptcy matters, Appellants/Defendants Sandipan Chowdhury and Booth Sweet LLP (Appellants) appeal the March 7, 2018 order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota, which granted summary judgment in favor of Appellee/Plaintiff Paul Hansmeier. Appellants also move to withdraw the underlying adversary proceeding (Adversary Proceeding Number 16-04124) from the bankruptcy court to this Court. For the reasons addressed below, the motion to withdraw is denied and the bankruptcy court's March 7, 2018 summary judgment order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts relevant to this dispute arose in November 2012, when AF Holdings, LLC, commenced a copyright-infringement lawsuit against Chowdhury in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Chowdhury answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims against AF Holdings. Booth Sweet, a Massachusetts law firm, has at all times represented Chowdhury in both the AF Holdings lawsuit and in the underlying bankruptcy proceedings in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court entered default judgment against AF Holdings as to Chowdhury's counterclaims on October 22, 2013. In doing so, the district court held AF Holdings, Hansmeier, and several others jointly and severally liable to Chowdhury for a total amount of $ 64,180.80 (the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment). Hansmeier moved to set aside the default judgment against him, arguing that the judgment against him was void because he was not a party to the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   lawsuit nor served with process. The district court denied Hansmeier's motion and reaffirmed its prior conclusion that AF Holdings is an alias of Hansmeier and others. Hansmeier appealed the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Meanwhile, the district court certified the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment for registration in other districts on April 3, 2014. The\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment was registered as a lien on Hansmeier's Minnesota homestead (homestead property) in October 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hansmeier filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on July 13, 2015, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota. The schedules attached to Hansmeier's petition identify his interest in the homestead property and list the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment as a disputed debt. Appellants noted their appearance in the bankruptcy proceedings as \"Judgment Creditors\" in July 2015 and filed a proof of claim as to the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment lien several months later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In November 2015, the United States Trustee moved to convert Hansmeier's bankruptcy case from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7 based on the bad faith of the debtor. Later that month, Hansmeier moved for an order permitting the sale of the homestead property, with $ 71,620.90 of the proceeds of that sale to be used to satisfy the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment lien on the property. The bankruptcy court granted both motions in December 2015 and appointed Randall L. Seaver as the Chapter 7 Trustee of Hansmeier's bankruptcy estate. The sale of the homestead property closed on December 15, 2015, and a payment of $ 71,620.90 was made to Appellants as full satisfaction of the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The First Circuit vacated the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment on August 4, 2016. As relevant here, the First Circuit observed that Hansmeier had not been properly named and served in the district court action and held that \"a judgment cannot be entered against those who are not made parties through proper service.\" The First Circuit also observed that, contrary to Chowdhury's argument on appeal, \"the fact that non-parties do not, or cannot, dispute alter ego allegations that would permit both serving them and holding them liable on the judgment does not obviate the need to call them before the court before entering judgment.\" Consequently, the First Circuit remanded the case to the district court. Because the bankruptcy proceedings remained ongoing in Minnesota, however, the remanded\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   case was automatically stayed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee filed an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy court against Appellants on November 18, 2016, seeking to recover the $ 71,620.90 that had been paid in satisfaction of the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment, plus costs and interest (the adversary proceeding). Hansmeier subsequently sought declaratory relief against the Chapter 7 Trustee as to which portion of the funds used to satisfy the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment was the property of the bankruptcy estate. Hansmeier and the Chapter 7 Trustee settled that dispute pursuant to a written settlement agreement. Under the settlement agreement, the Chapter 7 Trustee agreed to assign to Hansmeier the bankruptcy estate's interest in the claims asserted in the adversary proceeding against Appellants for the recovery of the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment. The settlement agreement also provides that, if Hansmeier recovers any portion of the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment from Appellants, the bankruptcy estate is entitled to the first $ 25,000, Hansmeier is entitled to the second $ 25,000, and any additional recovered amount will be divided equally between the bankruptcy estate and Hansmeier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement between Hansmeier and the Chapter 7 Trustee on December 6, 2017. Subsequently, in January 2018, the bankruptcy court granted Hansmeier's waiver of discharge\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and approved a stipulation to substitute Hansmeier for the Chapter 7 Trustee as the plaintiff in the adversary proceeding. Appellants subsequently moved to dismiss the adversary complaint, and Hansmeier cross-moved for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the bankruptcy court denied Appellants' motion to dismiss and granted Hansmeier's\n   motion for summary judgment on March 7, 2018. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In bankruptcy proceedings, a district court sits as an appellate court and reviews the bankruptcy court's conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v.

The bankruptcy court concluded, however, that \"these are core matters because they deal with transfers of the bankruptcy estate\" and involve \"restitution for the payment of funds from the bankruptcy estate.\" The bankruptcy court's decision does not expressly reference any of the categories enumerated in Section 157(b)(2). But the claims appear to implicate at least four of these categories-namely, matters concerning the administration of the estate, the allowance or disallowance of claims against the estate, counterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against the estate, and other proceedings affecting the liquidation of the assets of the estate or the adjustment of the debtor-creditor relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)-(C), (O).

And the payment Hansmeier subsequently made to Appellants, which he now seeks to recover, was ordered by the bankruptcy court to satisfy the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment lien. Moreover, pursuant to the settlement agreement between Hansmeier and the Chapter 7 Trustee, which the bankruptcy court approved, the bankruptcy estate is entitled to a portion of any money Hansmeier recovers from Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellants argue that Hansmeier's recovery of the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment affects neither Hansmeier nor his estate because the creditors have settled and \"there remains no estate left to administer.\" Appellants also contend that proceedings are not core proceedings \"simply because they may involve property of the estate which one day may be used to satisfy creditors.\" Hansmeier counters that the adversary proceeding is core because it relates to the gathering of assets and the division of those assets among creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Even if a proceeding arguably fits into one of the enumerated examples in Section 157(b)(2), it is not a core proceeding if it does not \"arise under or arise in a bankruptcy case.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Schmidt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180922\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/453/346/#p351\">\n    453 B.R. 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351 (8th Cir.

Appellants contend that their motion is timely because the grounds for withdrawal did not arise until the Chapter 7 Trustee transferred the claims in the adversary proceeding to Hansmeier in January 2018. But these facts were known to Appellants at least as early as December 6, 2017, when the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement between the Chapter 7 Trustee and Hansmeier. Despite this knowledge, Appellants did not move to withdraw the adversary proceeding from the bankruptcy court until more than five months later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Even assuming Appellants could not file a motion to withdraw until after the adversary claims were transferred to Hansmeier in January 2018, the \"first reasonable opportunity\" to move for withdrawal would have been at that time. But Appellants did not do so. Instead, Appellants filed a motion to dismiss on February 21, 2018; filed a brief in opposition to Hansmeier's motion\n   for summary judgment on March 2, 2018; and argued both motions before the bankruptcy judge at a March 7, 2018 hearing. After the bankruptcy judge ruled against Appellants at the March 7, 2018 hearing and entered a final judgment against them that same day, Appellants appealed the bankruptcy court's summary judgment decision to this Court on March 20, 2018. Not until more than a month after that did Appellants move to withdraw the adversary proceeding from the bankruptcy court. Even if this four-month passage of time were not significant enough to render Appellants' motion untimely, their conduct during those four months is inconsistent with a need or desire to withdraw the adversary proceeding from the bankruptcy court. Appellants continued to litigate the merits of the claims in the bankruptcy court, and only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   receiving an unfavorable dispositive ruling from the bankruptcy court did Appellants file a motion to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because Appellants' motion to withdraw the reference to the bankruptcy court is untimely, the motion is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Restitution and Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Appellants first argue that restitution is an equitable remedy for which unjust enrichment is a predicate to recovery.

But even if true, none of these facts transforms the nullified\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment into a legally enforceable judgment. As the First Circuit observed when vacating the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment, the fact that Hansmeier has not or cannot dispute alter-ego allegations against him \"does not obviate the need to call [him] before the court before entering judgment.\" Appellants undisputedly received money based on a judgment that has been vacated and thus rendered legally null and void. This fact remains true regardless of what legal conclusions or admissions by Hansmeier have been made in separate court proceedings, which have no bearing on the legal status of the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment.

Moreover, the bankruptcy court's December 3, 2015 order authorizing the sale of Hansmeier's homestead property created an additional legal obligation to pay. Even if Hansmeier subjectively\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   that the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment was improper, his subjective belief has no bearing on whether he was legally obligated to make that payment in December 2015. He indisputably was legally obligated to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For these reasons, reversal of the bankruptcy court's summary judgment decision is not warranted on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Reliance on Unbriefed Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Appellants argue that the bankruptcy court's summary judgment decision should be reversed because it relies on an issue that was not briefed by the parties. In particular, Appellants contend that the\n   bankruptcy court premised its summary judgment decision on the parties' failure to inform the bankruptcy court, in December 2015, that the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment had been appealed to the First Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   It is true that the bankruptcy court suggested at the summary judgment hearing that it would not have ordered the payment to Appellants in the first place had it known that an appeal of the\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings\n   </em>\n   judgment was pending. But when viewed in context, the bankruptcy court's statements to this effect clearly were not necessary to its decision. Reversal of the bankruptcy court's summary judgment decision is not warranted on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Judgment Granted to Non-Party\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Appellants contend that the bankruptcy court erred by granting summary judgment to a non-party, namely, the Chapter 7 Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The transcript of the bankruptcy court's oral order, the bankruptcy court's subsequent written order, and the judgment all indicate that summary judgment was granted in favor of Hansmeier. The written order states that \"the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment ... is granted,\" and both the written order and judgment provide that \"plaintiff shall recover from the defendants $ 71,620.90.\" Although the written order and judgment also state that the judgment is \"payable jointly to Randall L. Seaver, the chapter 7 trustee, and the plaintiff, Paul Hansmeier,\" this allocation of the payment merely reflects the terms of the settlement agreement between the Chapter 7 Trustee and Hansmeier. Appellants have provided no legal authority for reversing the bankruptcy court's decision based on this language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, reversal of the bankruptcy court's summary judgment decision is not warranted on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis and all the files, records and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   1. Appellants/Defendants Sandipan Chowdhury and Booth Sweet LLP's motion to withdraw the reference of the adversary proceeding from the bankruptcy court, (Case Number 18-cv-1433 at Dkt. 1), is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   2. The bankruptcy court's March 7, 2018 summary judgment order is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   LET JUDGMENT BE ENTERED ACCORDINGLY.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The record reflects that Booth Sweet retained most of these funds to cover attorneys' fees owed by Chowdhury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    As a result of this waiver of discharge, the automatic stay of the\n    <em>\n     AF Holdings\n    </em>\n    case in Massachusetts was lifted. Thereafter, Chowdhury moved to join or substitute Hansmeier as a judgment debtor in the\n    <em>\n     AF Holdings\n    </em>\n    case. The district court denied that motion on January 31, 2019.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    In light of this conclusion, the Court need not address the other factors that courts consider when evaluating a motion for discretionary withdrawal of a reference to the bankruptcy court.\n    <em>\n     See, e.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     g., Stephens\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204758354\">\n     2012 WL 4758354\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1 (denying untimely motions to withdraw reference without addressing other factors).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
