Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ronald H. Davis (\"Davis/Debtor\") filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on July 23, 2018 (\"Chapter 13 Filing\"). The Chapter 13 Filing remains open and no Chapter 13 plan has been confirmed as of the date of this Opinion. The case was reassigned to me on February 13, 2019, due to the untimely passing of my colleague, the Honorable John J. Thomas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This Adversary Proceeding was commenced on December 3, 2018, when Davis\n   filed what is titled \"Adversary Pleading\" (\"Complaint\"). The Complaint names as Defendants, Bank of America, N.A. (\"BOA\"), Successor by merger to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP f/k/a Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP, Unknown Bifurcated Debt Buyers, PK &amp; A Powers Kirn &amp; Associates, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Complaint was filed by Davis, pro se, as a self-represented party. The Complaint does not include certain standard provisions, including a wherefore clause. In summary fashion, I note that the Complaint challenges a judgment in mortgage foreclosure which was obtained by BOA in the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County and concerns real property located on Marvin Terrace, Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania (\"Residence\"). Compl., \u00b6 19, p. 5, ECF No. 1. The Complaint also includes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The mortgage itself of 2006, along with the judicial judgment of Aug/2016 was discharged in a Chapter 7 filing 2017 [sic] without objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Compl., \u00b6 19, p. 5, ECF No. 1. In the last paragraph of the Complaint, Davis states, in part, \"[t]he plaintiff wants to vacate the sheriff's sale, the final judgment ...\". Compl., \u00b6 31, p. 8, ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 20, 2018, BOA filed the Motion of Defendant Bank of America, N.A. to Dismiss Debtor's Adversary Complaint (\"Motion\"). The Motion was supported by a memorandum of law filed on the same date. The Motion alleges that the relief sought in the Complaint is barred by several doctrines, including the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   Doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Briefs were filed in support of and in opposition to the Motion and a hearing was held on February 21, 2019. The Motion is now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 201 allows a federal court to take judicial notice of facts that are not subject to reasonable dispute. A bankruptcy court may take judicial notice of the docket entries in a case and the contents of the bankruptcy schedules to determine the timing and status of case events, as well as facts not reasonably in dispute.\n   <em>\n    In re Harmony Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735850\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/393/409/#p413\">\n    393 B.R. 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413 (Bankr.

Next, I will apply the four requirements for the application of the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   Doctrine which were discussed in\n   <em>\n    Great Western Mining\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   First, did the federal plaintiff lose in federal court? Exhibit \"A\" to the Motion is a July 6, 2015, judgment in mortgage foreclosure in the State Foreclosure Action (\"Judgment\"). The Judgment names as defendants, Davis and Tanya X. Edward. Exhibit \"C\" to the Motion is an order entered in the State Foreclosure Action finding that the Superior Court of Pennsylvania quashed the defendants' appeal and that no further appeal was taken from that order, making the Judgment final on January 29, 2016. I find that Davis lost in the State Foreclosure Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The second requirement for the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   Doctrine to apply is that the plaintiff complains of injuries caused by the state court judgment. The gravamen of Davis' Complaint, as I understand it, is to void the judgment and to grant him title to the mortgaged premises, the Residence. I find that Davis is complaining of injuries caused by the Judgment.\n   <em>\n    Mohammed v.

I take judicial notice that the Judgment in the State Foreclosure Action became final on January 29, 2016. I also take judicial notice that the Complaint, which initiated this Adversary Proceeding, was filed on December 3, 2018. I find that the Judgment became final more than two and one-half years before this Adversary Proceeding was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The fourth requirement for the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   Doctrine to apply is that the plaintiff, Davis, is asking the Bankruptcy Court to review and reject the Judgment. I find that this requirement has also been met. Each of the Complaint's claims, at bottom, seek to overturn the Judgment\n   and to void the mortgage so that Davis and, presumably, Tanya X. Edward, would own the Residence free and clear of BOA's mortgage lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As directed by the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Great Western\n   </em>\n   , I give particular emphasis to the second and fourth factors in concluding that the Complaint should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based upon the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   Doctrine.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709928\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/159/#p166\">\n    615 F.3d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166 (3d Cir. 2010). I stress my finding that the Complaint asks me to review and reject the Judgment which was entered in the State Foreclosure Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Under Pennsylvania law, a judgment in mortgage foreclosure merges the underlying mortgage into the foreclosure judgment.\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia v.

This conclusion is dispositive of the Adversary Proceeding, but in the interest of thoroughness, I will briefly address two additional issues raised by Davis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

This was well after the date upon which the Judgment became final, January 29, 2016. However, respectfully, Davis misapprehends the relief which a bankruptcy discharge provides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Generally, a discharge under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code relieves the debtor from personal liability on his obligations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Further, while a bankruptcy discharge relieves a debtor of his\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   obligation on a note, it does not discharge the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   mortgage which secures the obligation.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

I also conclude that allowing for an amended complaint would be futile. Further, as noted above, the Judgment became final more than three years ago.
