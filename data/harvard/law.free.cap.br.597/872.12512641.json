He filed bankruptcy and asks the Court to determine whether the tax and penalties are dischargeable. Determination of the amount of tax or penalties and the decision on dischargeability are intertwined. In the end, determinations about whether a debt is dischargeable are substantive rights provided by\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    In sum, this Court has jurisdiction. Dischargeability is a core proceeding. It is a substantive right that does not exist outside bankruptcy. Having assessed tax and penalties, the IRS acknowledges there is a debt.

E.D.N.Y. 1990).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Contrary to the IRS argument, section 505 is not the only issue here. Simply put, there is also the effect on a core proceeding to be considered. Exercising jurisdiction here furthers the purposes of section 505(a). The Court is a more efficient forum to litigate this adversary because, unlike the Tax Court, this Court has the authority to determine the amount of tax\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    make a dischargeability determination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The IRS incorrectly asserts \"there is no bankruptcy purpose to adjudicate\" this adversary. This adversary involves the determination of a claim against Jung and whether it is nondischargeable. It invokes several sections of the Code, including 505(a) and 523(a).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The factors set forth in\n    <em>\n     Galvano\n    </em>\n    support the exercise of jurisdiction. Deciding the tax issues is not complex. The underlying dispute involves basic math. The IRS asserts the Debtors miscalculated certain income and deductions. Based on its review, the IRS assessed additional tax and calculated penalties. This indicates the IRS has the information it relies on to establish the amount of tax. It has also already imposed penalties against Jung. The Court is well-equipped to decide this adversary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The IRS says the Tax Court sits in Milwaukee on March 25, 2019. This ignores\n    the fact that no appeal to the Tax Court has been filed. It also argues that \"discovery [is] necessary to properly litigate the amount of ... tax liabilities in this Court [so] it is likely that a trial would not take place far ahead of that date.\" There is no indication any discovery is required. The IRS reviewed the tax returns and assessed additional tax suggesting it has gathered information already. This Court is prepared to schedule a hearing as soon as the parties are ready for trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Exercising jurisdiction results in a more efficient administration of the bankruptcy case and increased judicial economy. As noted, this Court has the jurisdiction to hear and decide the tax determination\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    dischargeability issues. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to make a dischargeability determination. Abstention may result in the Debtors litigating the tax dispute in Tax Court and then re-litigating the matter again in this Court. It makes little sense for the parties to litigate the issues and underlying facts in two different forums.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Neither Jung nor the IRS will be prejudiced by litigating this adversary in this Court. The Court has heard tax disputes and is competent to decide this adversary. From the perspective of the IRS, there are no material, substantive differences between litigating the tax disputes in Tax Court versus this Court. There is, however, prejudice to Jung if the matter is not heard in this Court. This is the only court with jurisdiction to determine dischargeability. The Bankruptcy Code and equity support the exercise of jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction. The Debtors seek a dischargeability determination, a core proceeding under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(2)(I)\"arising under\" the Code. In addition, the Court should not abstain from exercising jurisdiction. The tax matters are not complex. It makes little sense for the Debtors to litigate potentially similar issues twice in two different forums.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    This decision shall constitute findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 7052 and Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    An order consistent with this decision will be entered.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
