The automatic stay has been modified to permit this action to proceed to judgment, but not to execution. (Lift Stay Order, ECF No. 78).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Glassman seeks an order dismissing the bankruptcy with prejudice because, Glassman asserts, the Debtor filed the bankruptcy petition, and prosecuted this case, in bad faith. Glassman also seeks sanctions based upon the Debtor's failure to comply with two discovery orders entered in this case. For the following reasons, the motion to dismiss is granted with prejudice, and the motion for sanctions is granted in part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction of this core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and \u00a7 1334(b), and the Eastern District of New York standing order of reference dated August 28, 1986, as amended by Order dated December 5, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This Chapter 13 case was commenced on January 13, 2017. On March 9, 2017, Glassman, acting\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   , filed a \"notice of motion to dismiss the petition for cause pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 20.) There, Glassman alleged that \"the Petition was not filed to obtain protection from the Debtor's creditors, but rather for the sole, improper purpose of securing an automatic stay of [Glassman's] civil actions for legal malpractice, defamation, and several other causes of action against the Debtor ... which had been scheduled to go to trial on January 18, 2017.\" (Mot. to Dismiss 1, ECF No. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 18, 2017, Glassman filed a claim in this bankruptcy case based upon the claims asserted in the state court action, which was amended on April 14, 2017 to seek damages of $ 31,030,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Claim No. 2-2.) On April 17, 2017, Glassman,\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   , commenced an adversary proceeding against the Debtor, seeking a determination that his claim is nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and (4). (Compl. 1, ECF No. 32.) Glassman then retained an attorney, who filed a notice\n   of appearance on May 25, 2017, and who appeared on behalf of Glassman in this case and in the adversary proceeding thereafter. (Notice of Appearance, ECF No. 39.) Glassman filed an application to conduct a Rule 2004 examination of the Debtor, which was granted on July 14, 2017 (the \"2004 Order\"). (2004 Order, ECF No. 44.) By Stipulation and Order entered on August 11, 2017, the parties were to complete the Rule 2004 examination on or before September 28, 2017. (Sched. Order, ECF No. 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 10, 2017, Glassman informed the Court that the Debtor failed to comply with the 2004 Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ltr., ECF No. 50.) On November 6, 2017, after holding a conference on the matter, the Court issued an order providing as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [T]he parties hereto shall comply with the following schedule ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1. [Debtor] shall produce all documents listed in the Subpoena for Rule 2004 Examination (the \"Subpoena\") dated September 26, 2017 (the \"Requested Documents\") on or before November 30, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2. The Requested Documents must be accompanied by a statement under penalty of perjury signed by the [Debtor] which attests that the [Debtor] has turned over all documents within the [Debtor]'s possession, custody and control that are responsive to the Subpoena. The term \"control\" shall also include the ability to cause third parties to produce the Requested Documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3. The [Debtor] shall appear for a deposition at 10:00 a.m. on December 14, 2017, at the law offices of Ruta Soulios &amp; Stratis LLP\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   4. The parties shall file a joint pre-trial order on or before January 26, 2018\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   5. The parties shall appear for trial on February 1, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. in Courtroom 3529, United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York, 271-C Cadman Plaza east, Brooklyn, NY 11201;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   and it is further\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   , that failure to adhere to any of these deadlines may result in sanctions, including preclusion, dismissal of claims, dismissal of the Bankruptcy case and dismissal of [the] adversary proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Order, Adv. Pro. No. 17-01050-CEC, ECF No. 8 (the \"November 6 Order\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 27, 2018, Glassman filed a letter on the docket captioned \"Joint Request to modify scheduling order and adjourn trial to allow for completion of di[s]covery.\" (Ltr., ECF No. 53 (the \"Jan. 27, 2018 Letter\").) The Jan. 27, 2018 Letter detailed the Debtor's failure to comply with the November 6 Order, and requested that the Court modify the November 6 Order to allow the deposition to be completed on or before February 9, 2018. (Jan. 27, 2018 Ltr., ECF No. 53.) The Court adjourned the trial to May 30, 2018, and directed the parties file a joint pre-trial order by May 23, 2018. (Order Adj. Trial, ECF No. 56.) Then, on May 9, 2018, Glassman, alleging that the Debtor still refused to comply with the 2004 Order, the Subpoena for Rule 2004 Examination dated September 26, 2017 (the \"Subpoena\"), and the November 6 Order, filed a motion to sanction the Debtor (the \"Sanctions Motion\"), seeking dismissal of this bankruptcy case with prejudice as well as monetary sanctions. (Sanctions Mot., ECF No. 60.) On May 22, 2018, Glassman requested a stay of trial pending resolution of the Sanctions Motion, which the Court denied. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Denying Stay, ECF No. 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 23, 2018, the date joint pre-trial order was due, the parties requested, and the Court granted, an extension of time for the parties to submit a joint pre-trial order\n   until May 25, 2018. (Endorsed Order, Adv. Pro. No. 17-01050-CEC, ECF No. 15.) On May 25, 2018, the parties again requested, and the Court granted, an extension of time for the parties to submit a joint pre-trial order until May 29, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. (Endorsed Order, ECF No. 68.) The parties did not submit a pre-trial order. The May 30, 2018 trial proceeded nevertheless, focusing on whether the Court should grant Glassman's motion to dismiss this bankruptcy case with prejudice and whether the Court should sanction the Debtor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. (hereinafter \"Tr.\"), ECF No. 117.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the trial, the Court heard testimony from the Debtor and from Glassman. Throughout the trial, the Debtor demonstrated a dismissive attitude toward his disclosure obligations under the 2004 Order, the Subpoena, and the November 6 Order, and toward his obligations to provide truthful and complete disclosure in his Schedules and Statements of Financial Affairs in this bankruptcy case. For example,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q. Did you make an effort to get your statements from Bank of America after the subpoena was served upon you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A. I did not because I never used [that] account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Tr. 15:25-16:2.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. Is it your testimony that you don't have the ability to go into your PayPal account and get a history of your transactions that you've made on that account?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. I can, absolutely. All I do is turn on my - look at my phone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. But yet you did not do that in response to the subpoena, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. I did not....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Tr. 20:22-21:4.) The Debtor made no effort to conceal his contempt for Glassman and Glassman's attorney. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 33:15-21 (\"Talentless was the exact word I used, and I was being kind...I think 'talentless' is the perfect description [of your skills as a lawyer].\"), Tr. 30:1-8 (\"All my credit cards, all my American Express that I had in my possession I gave to my lawyer. So, yes, I blame you [Glassman's attorney] for not getting them from [my attorney].\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Each time he was confronted with false statements in his Schedules and Statement of Financial Affairs, or with information which was not disclosed, the Debtor testified that it was a mistake and his attorney's fault. For example,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. Isn't it true that the statement of financial affairs that you filed in this case declares your income for 2015 to be zero?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. That was totally incorrect mistake, and I never told anybody that. My lawyer said it was his mistake. I've made money every single year of my life. I never made zero.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (Tr. 36:23-37:2.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. On your schedules you showed that you made [$ ]96,000, when in fact your tax returns show that you made about [$ ]116,000, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A. ...I could not tell you how much I made last year, how much I made in 2017. If you told me that it's between 96 and 120, I said, that sounds right. That's -- under penalties of perjury, that is as far as my knowledge of how much I made\n   goes. I don't keep exact track in my mind of my exact income. It's all available in my tax returns. you have my tax returns. I apologize for my lawyer, or maybe it's my fault for not making sure that [the] official court filing was amended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Tr. 39:6-17.) The Debtor further testified that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [e]very time I come to Court, every time I talk to him[, my attorney, as] recently as yesterday, when he told me to come here, I said, what should I bring? What do you need? What documents? He says, nothing.... I say that every time I come here, Judge, every time I speak with him, what do you need? What does Mr. Macco need? What does the Court need? He says, just show up, and that's under the penalty of perjury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Tr. 74:23-75:19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Debtor acknowledged that his Schedules and Statements of Financial Affairs contained numerous errors, though he declared, in the petition, under penalty of perjury, that they were true and correct. At trial, the Debtor testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   THE COURT: So you didn't read your schedules before you signed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE [DEBTOR]: Apparently not carefully enough, Your Honor, because the thing with zero, the thing where it says, I'm not married, I take blame and responsibility for not reading it carefully enough, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: Before signing under penalty of perjury?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   THE [DEBTOR]: That's correct. I totally trust -- trusted my attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE COURT: ...as an attorney, don't you think you have an additional responsibility over and above what a nonattorney would have to ensure that your statement under penalty of perjury is in fact correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   THE [DEBTOR]: I absolutely do... I stand chastised and corrected. And it wasn't willful, and it wasn't intentional, Your Honor. I would say it was careless.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (Tr. 59:22-60:20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Debtor's bankruptcy filings contained numerous material errors. The Debtor's Statement of Financial Affairs incorrectly stated that in 2015 he earned $ 0 from the practice of law (Pet. 37, ECF No. 1), but he testified that he actually earned approximately $ 110,000 (Tr. 36:23-38:2); the Debtor stated his income for 2016, in his Statement of Financial Affairs, as $ 96,000 (Pet. 37, ECF No. 1), but he testified that he actually earned about $ 116,000 (Tr. 48:4-7); the Debtor is married, and his spouse is employed and contributes to the household (Tr. 44:21-46:25), but he did not include any information about his spouse in his Schedule I (Pet. 28, ECF No. 1); the Debtor filed an amended Schedule I amending his monthly income from $ 8,000 to $ 3,850 (Am. Sched. 15, ECF No. 30), but the Debtor testified at trial that the $ 3,850 monthly income figure is inaccurate (Tr. 49:1-5); the Debtor's amended Schedule I also states that his spouse is unemployed (Am. Sched. 15, ECF No. 30), but the Debtor testified that his spouse has always been employed (Tr. 44:25); the Debtor's Schedule A/B lists, as an asset, the right to receive a portion of a contingent fee in a pending case, but the Debtor testified that there are at least two cases in which he is expecting to receive a contingent fee. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Am. Sched. 8, ECF No. 30,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Tr. 52:24-54:25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In addition to filing inaccurate schedules and statements in this case, the Debtor also apparently filed a claim on behalf of his sister, Sheila Buckmaster, which is one of the few claims in this case other than\n   Glassman's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claims register shows a claim of Ms. Buckmaster in the amount of $ 20,000. The Debtor testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A. I filed it. She never asked for it. So in other words, I believe the court sent her documents, and she chose not to ask for it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Q. Isn't it true that she, in fact, filed a proof of claim in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A. I wrote her name that I owed her 20,000 dollars because it was the truth. Then the court or the trustee sent her documents. She called me. She said, I'm not going to get involved in trying to get that 20 grand out of you in bankruptcy court. We're very close.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Tr. 56:15-24.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. I'm showing you what has been marked as Claim 5-1, which was filed on May 10th, 2017. Can you describe what that document is?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. What is it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A. My handwriting. It is an official form 4010, proof of claim, apparently - - I believe my lawyer typed in Sheila Buckmaster and I handwrote her phone number, her email, but my lawyer did all the typing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Q. Who signed the signature?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   A. What signature?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Q. Right there on the third page, is that your signature?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   A. Oh, no. she - - that's obviously in her signature, yes. That's not my signature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Q. So she signed this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A. I - I - I - absent fraud, I'm sure she did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (Tr. 58:9-24.) The Debtor's denial that he signed his sister's name on the proof of claim lacks credibility. But, whether or not he did sign his sister's name, the Debtor's conduct reflects an effort to manipulate the bankruptcy process to make it appear that this case is more than a two-party dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The record at trial also demonstrates that the Debtor failed to comply with his discovery obligations, including his obligations under the November 6 Order. Specifically, the Debtor failed to produce his credit card, PayPal, and Venmo statements, and failed to provide a statement signed under penalty of perjury attesting that the Debtor has turned over all responsive documents within his possession, custody, and control. (Tr. 14-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Based upon the Debtor's conduct, Glassman asserts that the Debtor filed and prosecuted this bankruptcy case in bad faith and seeks dismissal of the case for cause pursuant to 11 U.S.C \u00a7 1307(c). (Suppl. Mem. in Supp. 7, Adv. Pro. No. 17-01050-CEC, ECF No. 22.) Glassman argues that the Debtor's dishonesty, both in his schedules and testimony, and his failure to comply with his disclosure obligations under the November 6 Order, demonstrates bad faith warranting dismissal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Glassman also argues that the Debtor's bad faith in commencing this bankruptcy case is evidenced by the following facts: (1) other than Glassman,\n   whose claim he disputes, the Debtor has few creditors, whose claims he could have easily satisfied pre-petition; (2) the Debtor filed this petition on the eve of trial in the state court action by Glassman against the Debtor, apparently to prevent that trial from going forward; and (3) any reorganization essentially would consist of the resolution of Glassman's disputed claim against the Debtor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Glassman seeks dismissal of this case with prejudice to re-filing for one year pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The Debtor repeatedly disobeyed this Court's orders by failing to provide Glassman with documents called for by the Subpoena issued in connection with the Rule 2004 examination. For example, the Subpoena directed the Debtor to produce PayPal statements (Tr. at 19-20), and to produce\n   all credit card statements from January 2013 to the present. (Sanctions Mot. Ex. B, ECF No. 60-2; Tr. 31-32.) The Debtor, however, believed he had the discretion to decide whether or not to produce the PayPal statements, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   \"I did not [provide them], because all my PayPal transactions were contained and paid through Citibank, and it clearly states PayPal every time the three dollars or five dollars that PayPal would use or the hundred dollars, clearly on each Citibank.

On cross-examination, the Debtor admitted that payments made to his PayPal account were not necessarily reflected in his Citibank account; that he had received payments from clients in his PayPal account; that PayPal could be used in effect as a bank account; and that he could easily have obtained the transaction history as required by the Subpoena. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 22:2-24:8.) The Debtor also failed to comply with the provisions of the November 6 Order requiring the Debtor to provide a statement signed under penalty of perjury affirming that the Debtor turned over all responsive documents within his possession, custody, and control. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 19:5-18.) Here, again, the Debtor attempted to blame his counsel for his failure to comply. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 19:17 (\"I signed what my lawyer asked me to sign.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Failure to comply with a discovery order is grounds for dismissal pursuant Bankruptcy Rule 7037.

It is clear that the Debtor filed this bankruptcy case to obtain a stay of the upcoming trial in New York County Supreme\n   Court on Glassman's underlying claim. The Debtor, an attorney, stated under penalty of perjury that he provided true and correct information in his Schedules and Statements of Financial Affairs; however, he misstated and omitted numerous material facts in those filings. He failed to produce financial records as required by the 2004 Order and the November 6 Order. He repeatedly attempted to excuse his conduct by blaming his attorney.

On October 10, 2017, Glassman informed the Court that the Debtor failed to comply with the 2004 Order (the \"Oct. 10, 2017 Letter\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 10, 2017 Ltr., ECF No. 50). This letter represents the first expense \"caused by\" the Debtor's failure to comply with his discovery obligations. Yet, Glassman seeks fees dating back to May 10, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Invoices 2, Adv. Pro. No. 17-01050-CEC, ECF No. 22-4.) Any expenses or fees incurred prior to October 10, 2017 were not caused by the Debtor's failure to comply with his discovery obligations and, therefore, are not compensable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4114125\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/528/562/#p568\">\n    528 B.R. 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569 (Bankr.

From November 6, 2017 to January 27, 2018, the date the parties sought to extend of the deadlines set by the November 6 Order, the invoices submitted by Glassman show multiple entries for fees that would have been incurred irrespective of the Debtor's failure to comply with discovery. Included in these invoices, for example, are legal charges for a \"[r]eview of supplemental document production\" and for preparation \"for deposition of Robert Feldman.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Invoices, Adv. Pro. No. 17-01050-CEC, ECF No. 22-4.) Had the debtor complied with discovery in the first instance, these fees would have nonetheless been incurred by Glassman, and such Glassman's fee request must be reduced accordingly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Selby v.

Using Rule 37 as a guidepost, and because Rule 37(b)(2)(C) provides that the court must order reasonable expenses, \"unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust,\" courts in this district consider the severity of a sanction, such as dismissal, as an \"other circumstance[ ],\" mitigating against an additional sanction of costs and fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thilman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173101\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/548/1/#p8\">\n    548 B.R. at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Under the[ ] circumstances and in light of the severe sanction imposed, the Court finds that an award of expenses [is] unjust.\");\n   <em>\n    Passe v.

Moreover, the parties did not hold a second deposition, and the Sanctions Motion was heard in conjunction with Glassman's motion to dismiss. The Debtor's failure to comply with the Discovery Orders did not cause all of the fees for which Glassman seeks reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Accordingly, the expenses caused by the Debtor's failure to comply with the Discovery Orders are appropriately quantified as the attorney's fees incurred drafting the Oct. 10, 2017 Letter, seeking modification of the November 6 Order, and in prosecuting the Sanctions Motion. Review of the invoices submitted, together with the Sanctions Motion, leads to the conclusion that the fees incurred as a result of the Debtor's failure to comply with the Discovery Orders, including prosecuting the Sanctions Motion, are reasonable. The invoices indicate that approximately thirty-five hours were billed, and $ 100 for Westlaw legal research. (Invoices 5-15, Adv. Pro. No. 17-01050-CEC, ECF No. 22-4.) Five hours and thirty minutes are attributed to paralegal services at a rate of $ 165.00 per hour, and thirty hours and twenty-six minutes to legal services at a rate of $ 495.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That sum equals $ 15,953.20.

Local Bankruptcy Rule 7007-1, which requires that a discovery motion made under Bankruptcy Rules 7026 through 7037 be supported by an affidavit or affirmation certifying that the moving party has made a good faith effort to confer with the opposing party to resolve the issues raised by the motion without judicial intervention. E.D.N.Y. LBR 7007-1. For this reason, the Debtor argues, there is no basis to grant relief. (Aff. in Opp'n \u00b6 19, ECF No. 64). However, LBR 7007-1 addresses a \"discovery motion,\" and the sanctions imposed on the Debtor here result from his failure to comply with the Discovery Orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daval Steel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528359\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/951/1357/#p1363\">\n    951 F.2d at 1363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Provided that there is a clearly articulated order of the court requiring specified discovery, the district court has the authority to impose Rule 37(b) sanctions for noncompliance with that order.\").
