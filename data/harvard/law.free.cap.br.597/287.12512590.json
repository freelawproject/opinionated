At the hearing, Thomas W. Waldrep, Jr. and John R. Van Swearingen appeared on behalf of the Debtor, Ellis B. Drew, III appeared on behalf of Mountain Commerce Bank (\"MCB\"), Kiah T. Ford IV appeared on behalf of Todd O'Gara and Wanu Water, Inc. (\"Wanu\"), Robert E. Price, Jr. appeared on behalf of the Bankruptcy Administrator, and C. Edwin Allman, III, the Chapter 7 trustee, also appeared. Having considered the Motion and all other matters of record, including those incorporated through judicial notice, the evidence presented at the hearing, and the arguments of counsel, the court finds and concludes as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on October 17, 2018 (the \"Petition Date\"), and C. Edwin Allman, III was appointed to serve as Chapter 7 trustee (the \"Trustee\"). On the Petition Date the Debtor, who holds an MBA from Wake Forest University, was earning income as an independent contractor with a three-month contract with Musubu, a local technology company, in the amount of $ 12,500.00 per month. His original Schedule I showed household income of $ 15,500.00, and original schedule J showed expenses of $ 14,759.31, leaving net income in the amount of $ 740.69. The Schedule I indicated that the Debtor did not expect any increase or decrease in income within a year. Shortly after the Petition Date, the Debtor was offered a position as a director\n   at Musubu where his duties now include marketing, sales, operations, and finance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to an Amended Schedule I filed January 4, 2019 the Debtor now has gross wages of $ 12,916.00 a month and household income of $ 15,916.00. He shows no amount on line 5a for taxes, Medicare, and Social Security deductions for himself. According to an amended Schedule J filed January 4, 2019 the Debtor had expenses of $ 14,759.31 and net income $ 1,156.69; his latest amended Schedule J filed the week before the hearing shows expenses of $ 13,214.31, including $ 4,000.00 a month for taxes, leaving monthly net income of $ 2,701.69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Debtor's schedules and statement show that prior to obtaining employment with Musubu, the Debtor had been in severe financial distress for a number of years. His Statement of Financial Affairs (\"SOFA\") lists gross income of $ 9,259.00 for 2018 as of the Petition Date, and $ 14,122.0 for 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor's SOFA shows that in 2018 he took an early IRA withdrawal and a deferred compensation early payout to have a total of over $ 330,000.00 in other income. In 2017, the Debtor's SOFA shows that he liquidated over $ 300,000.00 in assets, and in 2016 the Debtor liquidated over $ 370,000.00 in assets. The Debtor and his spouse own a home with a petition value of $ 695,500.00 encumbered by a first mortgage with a balance of approximately $ 550,000.00 and a second mortgage in favor of his parents. He listed the amount of his parents' claim as $ 90,000.00, but admitted at the February 6 hearing that the claim was closer to $ 39,000.00. He has a half interest in a 2008 Lexus with 290,000 miles on it and a value of $ 4,280.00. The Lexus is encumbered by a lien in the amount of $ 19,235.00. He lists priority debts totaling $ 45,636.86 and general unsecured claims in the amount of $ 738,546.59 in an amended Schedule E/F. The Debtor lists interests in Hunter Family LLC and Kingsley Investment Group, LLC in Schedule A/B with values of $ 0.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Also on his Schedule A/B, the Debtor lists a civil action pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, Case No. 15-CV-1050 styled\n   <em>\n    Gregory Hunter and Hunter Family Capital, LLC v. Mountain Commerce Bank and Bobby A. Brown\n   </em>\n   (the \"Civil Case\") which the Debtor valued at $ 3,000,000.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Civil Case, the Debtor asserts that MCB's employee made a number of false or misleading statements in connection with an SBA loan application for Kingsley Investments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   an entity originally\n   owned 50% by Bob Feathers and 50% by Hunter Family Capital. The Debtor presently owns a 35% interest in Hunter Family Capital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As generally described at the February 6 hearing, the SBA loan application with MCB was part of a business plan by Kingsley Investments to obtain multistore financing for a number of East Coast Wings franchises in Tennessee. The Debtor asserts that he, individually, suffered damages as a result of MCB's false or misleading statements indicating that the SBA loan was being processed when in fact, it was not. Among other contentions, the Debtor alleges that he sold his book of business from his previous employment as an Oppenheimer financial advisor under financial duress. The Civil Case is currently set for trial in April 2019, and a motion for summary judgment is pending. According to the Debtor's schedules, he has essentially no other nonexempt assets of value other than his potential damages in the Civil Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 13, 2018, the Trustee filed a Motion for Approval of Settlement of Disputed Claim against MCB and Bobby A. Brown (Docket No. 21) seeking approval of a proposed settlement of the Debtor's claims in the Civil Case for the sum of $ 150,000.00 along with subordination of MCB's claim in the bankruptcy case. This settlement would not affect the Hunter Family Capital claim against MCB. In response, the Debtor has filed the Motion seeking to convert to Chapter 11. His stated intent is twofold: (1) he wishes to incorporate his postpetition income into his bankruptcy estate\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) he wishes to continue prosecution of the Civil Case because he does not agree with the Trustee's proposed settlement. Todd O'Gara and Wanu\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as MCB\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed objections asking that the court deny the Motion for cause. In addition, the Trustee filed a response describing the Civil Case as an ill-conceived and fanciful lawsuit and requesting the court enter such order as it deems appropriate (Todd O'Gara, Wanu, MCB, and the Trustee are collectively referred to herein as the \"Respondents\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section 706 of the Bankruptcy Code provides in relevant part\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (a) The debtor may convert a case under this chapter to a case under chapter 11, 12, or 13 of this title at any time, if\n   the case has not been converted under section 1112, 1208, or 1307 of this title.

In\n   <em>\n    Marrama,\n   </em>\n   the Court found that there were \"at least two possible reasons\" why a debtor may not qualify to convert from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13, the requirements of \u00a7 109(e) and for \"cause\" under \u00a7 1307(c).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court also found that \u00a7 105(a) authorizes \"an immediate denial of a motion to convert filed under \u00a7 706 in lieu of a conversion order that merely postpones the allowance of equivalent relief and may provide the debtor with an opportunity to take action prejudicial to creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    at 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Later, in\n   <em>\n    Law v.

Finding cause under \u00a7 1112(b)(4)(A), the court concluded that allowing the debtor to propose a liquidating Chapter 11 plan would subject the estate to continuing diminution without a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitating the debtor's finances. The court pointed to the debtor's inconsistent future income prospects\n   and concluded that reducing ongoing household expenses during the Chapter 11 case was \"unlikely to offset the large administrative costs of a Chapter 11 filing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410826\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/580/291/#p296\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410826\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/580/291/#p296\">\n    at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

M.D. Tenn. Sept. 18, 2015). However, the Chapter 7 trustee had liquidated the majority of the debtor's assets and the one remaining non-exempt asset did not have a current appraisal; the debtor would have had to draw from the already liquidated estate property in Chapter 7 in order to meet her ongoing expenses and the mortgage payment on that one asset.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205553506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court referred to her proposal as a \"plan of slow liquidation rather than a plan of reorganization\" and found that the continued diminution of the estate and lack of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation constituted cause under \u00a7 1112(b)(4)(A) to deny the motion to convert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the present case, the Debtor offered extensive testimony in conjunction with a \"liquidation analysis\" that he had prepared comparing his Chapter 7 with a hypothetical Chapter 11. The Debtor calculates that unsecured creditors would recover 18 cents on the dollar in a Chapter 7, but no less than 51 cents on the dollar through a Chapter 11 plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Respondents and Bankruptcy Administrator effectively discredited the Debtor's analysis as deeply flawed. In his analysis, the Debtor shows his Chapter 11 case as generating $ 194,521.68 in postpetition income ($ 2,701.69 for six years) and his claim against MCB, along with Hunter Family Capital's claim, yielding $ 0, $ 300,000.00 or $ 3,000,000.00 (netting $ 180,000.00 to $ 1,800,000.00 after a 40% contingency fee to his attorneys). However, this analysis does not reflect any unsecured claim of MCB or any provision for a claim by Wanu asserted against him in\n   <em>\n    O'Gara et al. v. Hunter,\n   </em>\n   18-CV-00825. In addition, the Debtor includes no amount for Chapter 11 costs of administration in his proposed budget or for litigation expenses other than his attorneys' contingency fee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   the Debtor admitted that he has not yet adopted the budget on his latest Amended Schedule J.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended Schedule J that he filed in January showed net income of only $ 1,156.69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Debtor also presented an overview of the basis for the claims he asserts in his Civil Case, as well as expert witness reports and various exhibits that could be used to support his claims. As for damages, the Debtor asserts that he and Hunter Family Capital could be awarded as much as $ 3,000,000.00. In response, the Respondents pointed out significant weaknesses in the Debtor's claims in the Civil Case. MCB estimates that even in the event the Debtor is successful, the damage award would be less than $ 100,000.00. The Debtor admitted that while he included damages for Hunter Family Capital in his analysis, he was not familiar with Hunter Family Capital's basis for damages as he had not \"looked at it in a while.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While the parties agree on little, the court finds that the following basic facts were established at the hearing,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   - The Debtor established that he currently has monthly gross income of $ 12,916.00. His latest Amended Schedule J shows a proposed budget should his case be converted to Chapter 11. Because he has not yet adopted this budget, the net income as reflected on his latest Amended Schedule J is speculative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   - Debtor's counsel in the Civil Case, Kevin Cartledge and Spilman Thomas &amp; Battle, have agreed to waive their prepetition claims in the amount of $ 187,429.92 against the Debtor if they are allowed to represent him going forward for a 40% contingency fee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   - MCB asserts a claim against the Debtor based on a promissory note in the amount of approximately $ 490,000.00. The Debtor listed this claim (in the amount of $ 500,000.00) as disputed on his schedules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   - Whether the Debtor will be successful in the Civil Case, and whether any damages will be awarded if the Debtor is successful, is speculative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   - If the Debtor converts to Chapter 11, the Debtor will incur administrative expenses. Neither the Debtor's latest Amended Schedule J nor his Chapter 11 liquidation analysis include an amount for Chapter 11 administrative expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Debtor asks to convert to Chapter 11 so that he can regain control of the Civil Case and withdraw from the settlement agreement. Conversion will, in effect, result in the immediate loss of $ 150,000.00 from the estate as well as the loss of MCB's agreement that it will not participate in the dividend available to creditors from these funds. The court finds that the loss of the Trustee's settlement agreement is a substantial post-petition loss to the estate, and that the first prong has been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Turning to the second prong, absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation, it is this issue that goes to the heart of the Debtor's motion to convert. With the Trustee's settlement agreement, the estate will have $ 150,000.00 in funds available for\n   prompt distribution, and MCB's $ 490,000.00 claim will be taken out of the equation. The Debtor seeks to replace that certainty with the hope of a bigger payout. Much like the debtors in\n   <em>\n    Woodruff,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Braunstein\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , the Debtor is not seeking Chapter 11 for the purpose of rehabilitation, but rather he is seeking to convert to gain control of an asset of the estate and liquidate that asset in a riskier way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As set forth above, neither the Debtor's net income nor the value that he places on the Civil Case are based on objective data; these figures are based on speculation and therefore do not support a finding of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation. Looking at his net income, not only is the figure speculative, it is clear that the Debtor has not given proper consideration to the costs of a Chapter 11, such as quarterly fees, attorney's fees, and litigation costs. As the Trustee bluntly points out, if the litigation is resolved unfavorably, there is no way the Chapter 11 can continue-fees will outpace any small net monthly income the Debtor might have. The court must agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Similarly, even according to the Debtor's own analysis, the amount of his claim against MCB is speculative. This court will not delve into the relative merits of the Civil Case other than to conclude that continuation of the litigation subjects the Debtor's creditors to substantial risk. The Debtor asserts that even in a \"worst-case scenario\" in which the claim against MCB resolves with no benefit to the estate, a Chapter 11 would still yield a slightly higher return to unsecured creditors than the Chapter 7. Unfortunately, as pointed out by the Respondents, the Debtor fails to include amounts for either MCB's $ 490,000.00 claim or a claim on behalf of Wanu. As an independent party with a fiduciary duty to liquidate the property of the estate in a manner that is in best interest of the parties in interest, the Trustee is in a better position to objectively weigh the risks and benefits than the Debtor, who has been embroiled in the litigation for years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In summary, the immediate loss that the estate would suffer from withdrawal of the settlement agreement is a loss from which it appears unlikely that the estate could ever recover. To the extent that the Debtor purports to be seeking rehabilitation, the court cannot find that it is reasonably likely he would succeed in that endeavor. The Debtor's contention that he desires to contribute his net monthly income to his creditors through a Chapter 11 plan is discounted by the court due to the relatively insignificant increase in income since the Petition Date, $ 416.00, and his admission that he has not yet attempted to adhere to his proposed budget. The Debtor's core motive for conversion is not rehabilitation, but to regain control of the Civil Case so he can continue to litigate. Given the substantial loss the estate would suffer upon conversion and repudiation of the settlement agreement and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation the court finds cause under \u00a7 1112(b)(4)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    The Absence of Good Faith\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Fourth Circuit has held that filing in good faith is an implicit requirement in seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code, and that the absence of good faith can constitute cause for dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Carolin Corp. v.

Here, Wanu alleges that the Debtor made a number of misrepresentations and omissions on his schedules and statements. Wanu contends that the Debtor undervalued his Wanu shares by listing them on Schedule A/B as worthless. At his \u00a7 341 meeting, the Debtor conceded that they could be worth more, in the range of zero to 25 cents each. Wanu contends that on the Petition Date, one share of its stock had a value between 70 cents and $ 1.10. Wanu has not offered any evidence in support of its claim and the court finds that the Debtor has adequately explained the basis for his valuation. In addition, Wanu asserts that the Debtor has been unwilling to accurately value his wine collection and his firearms. The Debtor counters that he has provided the Trustee with all information requested about his assets, and he also explains that his wine collection was damaged when the climate control system for his wine storage broke down last summer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Debtor admits that he did not disclose on his SOFA a gratuitous transfer of 30% of his membership interest in Hunter Family Capital to his three children within two years of the Petition Date. At the hearing, he explained that he did not know the transfer had been within two years. This explanation is not sufficient. In exchange for a fresh start, the Bankruptcy Code requires debtors to provide accurate, honest, and complete information on their schedules and statements. The Debtor's apparent failure to review his financial records not does excuse him from this requirement. Also, the Debtor did not disclose a conveyance made on May 14, 2018 to his parents in the form of a second deed of trust on his home to secure a debt he owed to them dating from 2017, and he overstated the amount of the debt, listing it as $ 90,000.00 instead of $ 39,000.00. While the Debtor explained that he did not understand that the deed of trust was a transfer, this explanation carries little weight in light of the Debtor's education and professional experience, as well as the fact that the Debtor was represented by sophisticated bankruptcy counsel who assisted him with the preparation and filing of his schedules and SOFA. The Trustee indicates that the Debtor has now provided him with corrected information and has diligently responded to any of his requests for information. While not all of the points brought out by the Respondents are given credence in the absence of specific evidence, it remains of concern to the court that the Debtor's amended schedules and his SOFA have not corrected these particular misstatements and omissions, and that some of these inaccuracies revolve around\n   transfers to insiders, his children and his parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Of further concern is the Debtor's attempt to exercise control over and interfere with property of the estate. Upon the filing of the bankruptcy petition, the Debtor's interest in the Civil Case vested in the bankruptcy estate to be administered by the Trustee.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 704. Accordingly, the Trustee entered into a settlement agreement with MCB, filed a motion to approve settlement in this bankruptcy case, and filed a notice of agreement in principle in the Civil Case. Subsequently, the Debtor through counsel Kevin Cartledge filed a pleading in response to the notice of agreement in principle in the Civil Case (Docket No. 66) requesting that the District Court issue a memorandum opinion on summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee asserts that in doing so, the Debtor violated the automatic stay and, had the District Court ruled unfavorably, risked destroying the value of the Civil Case. Judge Osteen entered a text order identifying that same concern, which reads in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [T]his court does not intend to issue an order on the summary judgment motion until some time following the February 6, 2019 [bankruptcy court] hearing. While counsel for Plaintiffs may be correct that a favorable opinion and order on summary judgment 'could dramatically affect the outcome of the motion to approve any agreement to settle in the bankruptcy matter,' (Doc. 66 at 2), an unfavorable ruling could correspondingly undermine any agreement between the Trustee and Defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In his response in support of his Motion (Docket No. 67), the Debtor counters that he did not file the pleading in the Civil Case individually, that it was filed on behalf of Hunter Family Capital. Moreover, the Debtor asserts that the pleading was informational only. At the hearing, Mr. Cartledge testified that he acted under the direction of Mr. Waldrep. As to these explanations, the court can only note that the pleading in question, Docket No. 66 filed in the Civil Case, clearly begins \"NOW COME Plaintiffs Gregory Hunter and Hunter Family Capital, LLC (collectively, the 'Plaintiffs')....\" and it concludes with a \"request\" that the court enter a memorandum opinion on summary judgment without delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   And so, the Debtor argues that he has provided explanations for any issues with his schedules and statements, as well as his attempt to usurp control of estate property from the Trustee, and that the record does not reflect the type of bad faith conduct that has previously disqualified Chapter 7 debtors from converting their cases in this district. In\n   <em>\n    In re Southern\n   </em>\n   , the bankruptcy court denied a Chapter 7 debtor's motion to convert to Chapter 13 after finding that the debtor had failed to disclose assets and transfers on his schedules and statements, was untruthful at his \u00a7 341 meeting, and intentionally hid an asset in an effort to defraud creditors.\n   <em>\n    In re Southern\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-50713,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201226058\">\n    2011 WL 1226058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Bankr.

The Debtor's business decision several years ago to develop East Coast Wings franchises in Tennessee shows that he took a risk to leave his employment at Oppenheimer to embark on that venture. As a result of taking that risk he has incurred substantial unsecured debts. Now, the Debtor is asking that the court allow him to take another risk-that of converting his case, repudiating the Trustee's proposed settlement with MCB, and going forward with his lawsuit\n   against MCB. A conversion to Chapter 11 by the Debtor would risk the only significant listed non-exempt asset of the estate. The Debtor's request to convert in this particular context constitutes an abuse of the bankruptcy process. In light of the Debtor's improbable and speculative vision of a successful Chapter 11 plan and his improper purpose for seeking Chapter 11, the court finds cause exists due to the absence of good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, the court finds that Respondents have shown by a preponderance of the evidence that cause exists under \u00a7 1112(b). A separate order denying the Motion will be entered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Since the Debtor affirmatively indicated on his Schedule I that he expected his present income to continue, it appears that the Debtor had been offered long-term employment with Musubu prior to the Petition Date.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The employment income as listed on the Debtor's SOFA does not match the Debtor's testimony at the February 6 hearing. The Debtor testified that he had a three-month employment contract at $ 12,500.00/month starting in August 2018. He also testified that he taught a 30-day course in 2017 at the Wake Forest University business school. The Debtor lists only $ 9,259.00 for year-to-date employment income in 2018 as of the October Petition Date. The Debtor lists no employment income for 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Hunter Family LLC should have been listed as Hunter Family Capital, LLC.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    At the February 6 hearing the Debtor clarified that he valued his individual claim against MCB and the Hunter Family Capital claim against MCB together for a total of $ 3,000,000.00. The Debtor did not list the federal court case but a state court case in Forsyth Superior Court, Case No. 15 CVS 6949 with a value of $ 3,000,000.00 in his Schedule A/B.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    This is the same entity listed in Debtor's Schedule A/B as Kingsley Investment Group, LLC.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Debtor originally owned a 50% interest in Hunter Family Capital, but transferred 30% of his interest (15% of Hunter Family Capital) to his children within two years prior to the Petition Date. In addition, it was stipulated at the February 6 hearing that due to missed capital calls in Kingsley Investments, the Hunter Family Capital percentage ownership in Kingsley has decreased, but the amount of such decrease is uncertain.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Although the Debtor claims he wants to convert to include his postpetition income into his bankruptcy estate, he did not file his Amended Schedules I and J until January 4, 2019, showing $ 1,156.69 in net monthly household income, along with the Motion, two months after he started his full-time job with Musubu and three weeks after the Trustee filed the Motion for Approval of Settlement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Todd O'Gara and Wanu Water, Inc. are listed on Debtor's Schedule E/F with the amount of the claim listed as unknown and are plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the Debtor,\n    <em>\n     O'Gara et al. v.
