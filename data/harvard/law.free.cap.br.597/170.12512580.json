Subject to that objection, see the following documents ....\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On July 30, 2018, the deadline for filing adversary proceedings under 11 U.S.C.\u00a7\u00a7 727 and 523, Raymond James filed a Complaint against Debtor alleging objections to discharge and dischargeability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The next day, Raymond James filed the Motion to Compel at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Raymond James maintains that at the Rule 2004 examination, Debtor offered to produce the documents with the requested information: \"- i.e. documents generated from the Vision2020 and Business Analytics platforms,\" after the examination adjourned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Raymond James, Debtor has not produced the documents he agreed to, despite repeated requests after the Rule 2004 examination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor's denial of having made any such agreement prompted Raymond James to file the motion at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In early August the Court scheduled a hearing on the Motion to Compel for the morning of August 29, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The afternoon before that hearing Debtor filed his only other response to the Motion to Compel: An Affidavit in which he swore, making no distinction between Request No. 11 and Request No. 15:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The said Motion to Compel seeks the production of documents as to which Your Affiant may have access from time to time in the ordinary course of ... business, however the documents do not belong to, and are not the property of, [Debtor].... Affiant objects to the production of said documents, either as a consequence of court order or otherwise...\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In that Affidavit, Debtor also declared, for the first time in writing in this case, that the documents requested are not his, but rather are property of his current employer, Royal Alliance Associates, Inc. (\"Royal Alliance\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At the August 29 hearing, Debtor's counsel articulated two bases for Debtor's opposition to the Motion to Compel: first, that under the \"pending proceeding\" rule Raymond James must now request the documents in its adversary proceeding rather than via a Rule 2004 examination; and secondly, that Debtor cannot be compelled to produce the documents in response to Request No. 11 and Request No. 15 because they belong to and are in the possession, custody and control of Royal Alliance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The \"pending proceeding\" rule should not and does not apply to this document production.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"The 'pending proceeding' rule states 'that once an adversary proceeding\n   or contested matter has been commenced, discovery is made pursuant to Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 7026\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , rather than by a [Rule] 2004 examination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying the pending proceeding rule is discretionary and not mandatory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Raymond James began its quest to obtain the documents though its Rule 2004 examination long before it filed its adversary proceeding. \"One of the primary purposes of a Rule 2004 examination is as a pre-litigation device.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   For that reason alone, Raymond James should be permitted to complete this portion of its discovery in this case, rather than having to begin anew in the adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Debtor asserts that the subject of Raymond James' document request is encompassed within its adversary complaint against him. This is only partly true. The other, if not the primary, subject of Raymond James' inquiry is the value of the only non-exempt asset Debtor owned when he filed his Petition: his 100% ownership interest in First Charter Investments, Inc. (\"First Charter\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The value of First Charter is proper for discovery under Rule 2004. Rule 2004(b) states, in pertinent part, that \"[t]he examination of ... the debtor ... may relate only to the acts, conduct, or property or to ... the financial condition of the debtor, or to any matter which may affect the administration of the debtor's estate ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Raymond James claims that in order to determine the value of Debtor's ownership in First Charter it must first ascertain the value of a \"book of business.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Raymond James, during the five (5) years of the arbitration proceeding Debtor consistently maintained that First Charter's clients were\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   clients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Debtor did not list an asset entitled \"book of business\" in his Schedules or Amended Schedules filed in this case, nor did he list any such asset as belonging to First Charter. Whether Debtor continues to own or owned such an asset at the time he filed his Chapter 7 petition, either on his own or as part of First Charter, is a fact requiring proof beyond the documents filed in this case thus far. But the bottom line is that the value of First Charter is a core matter, regardless of whether it may also be at issue in the pending adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Debtor cannot be compelled to produce documents not within his possession, custody, or control.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Raymond James claims that Debtor should be compelled to turn over the disputed documents for two reasons: 1) the requested documents are within Debtor's possession, custody, or control; and 2) regardless of possession, custody or control, at the Rule 2004 examination Debtor agreed to provide the subject documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor denies that he has possession, custody or control of, and that he made any agreement to provide, the disputed documents\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"Control\" is defined as \"not only... possession, but as the legal right to obtain the documents requested upon demand.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   As \"proof\" that Debtor has possession, custody and control of the requested documents, Raymond James attached to its pleadings copies of documents that appear to have originated from the same online platforms over which Debtor claims he has no custody or control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   But these copies, alone, are not proof that Debtor owns or controls the sources of these documents or the information they contain. The cases Debtor cites are persuasive on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Siegmund v. Xuelian\n   </em>\n   , two former officers of a corporation objected to a document request on the basis that the requested documents were not in their possession, custody or control; the court sustained this objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The outcome in\n   <em>\n    Mamani v. De Lozada Sanchez Bustamante\n   </em>\n   , was similar: the court ruled that a former officer of a corporation would not be compelled to produce corporate documents because they were not in his physical possession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Raymond James has not provided sufficient evidence to show that Debtor has possession, custody or control over the subject documents. Similarly, Raymond James has failed to prove that Debtor has custody or control over documents owned by Royal Alliance, his employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Raymond James is correct that Debtor did not raise an objection in writing on the record regarding the documents pertaining to Royal Alliance until he filed his Affidavit the afternoon before the hearing. But, this late-filed Affidavit is not proof that Debtor made no such objection at the Rule 2004 examination, either on his own or through counsel. Further, Debtor included this objection when responding to discovery requests from Raymond James during the Arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor's objection to the\n   Motion on the basis that he does not have possession, custody, or control of documents owned by Royal Alliance is due to be sustained, in part, on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Raymond James next asserts that Debtor agreed at the Rule 2004 examination to provide the subject documents. As \"evidence\" of such an agreement, Raymond James submitted copies of email exchanges between it and the attorney who represented Debtor at the Rule 2004 examination. These emails do not prove that any agreement exists; especially since both Debtor and his attorney deny having made any such agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither party has filed a transcript of any portion of the Rule 2004 examination. Without a transcript, the Court has only Debtor's Affidavit. Beyond that, the Court is left with \"he said, he said,\" and no facts on which to base a ruling that Debtor must produce certain documents because he agreed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Raymond James is entitled to complete this portion of its discovery in this case. Debtor's objections to Request No. 11 and Request No. 15 are sustained, in part, to the extent that Debtor does not have possession, custody or control over the documents requested, and to the extent that the Court has no proof that he agreed to produce the documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the reasons stated, it is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ORDERED:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   1.

Raymond James insists that Debtor has claimed the \"book of business\" as\n    <em>\n     his\n    </em>\n    , while Debtor professes that he does not own any \"book of business.\" Debtor's current testimony on this subject facially appears to contradict statements he made in 2017 during his deposition in the arbitration proceeding, when he testified that \"he owns his book of business\" and repeatedly used the term \"my clients.\" Doc. 84-6, pp. 12-13.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    During the arbitration, Debtor referred to the clients he managed as\n    <em>\n     my clients\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 84-5, p. 8; Doc. 84-6, pp. 4,7-10.

Doc. 84-5.
