App'x 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 13, 2009, Charles Schrader (\"Schrader\") filed a complaint against Narinder Sangha (\"Sangha\") for defamation (slander per se) in San Francisco Superior Court (\"State Court\"), alleging that Sangha had made false statements about Schrader in the course of an employment background investigation. On November 17, 2009, Sangha filed an answer and general denial. The state court granted Schrader leave to file a second amended complaint on February 14, 2011. In the second amended complaint (the \"SAC\"), all fourteen causes of action alleged that Sangha made the defamatory statements with\n   malice; the prayer sought an award of exemplary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 4, 2011, Schrader filed a motion for terminating sanctions against Sangha for engaging in discovery abuses. The state court granted Schrader's sanctions motion and struck Sangha's answer to the second amended complaint, commenting: \"The Court finds that Defendant's failure to respond to the Court's orders compelling a response to interrogatory is willful.\" Sangha then dismissed his attorney Christopher Leuterio and filed a substitution of attorney showing Christopher N. Mandarano was to be his counsel. On April 8, 2011, Sangha terminated Mandarano, and substituted Robert D. Finkle as his attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 18, 2011, the State Court entered a default against Sangha. It conducted a prove-up hearing on Schrader's motion for entry of default judgment on June 2, 2011 and entered a judgment the same day (the \"State Court Judgment\") awarding Schrader $ 1,369,633.40, comprised of $ 1,000,000 for general damages, $ 368,535.40 for \"Special/Punitive Damages,\" and $ 1,098.00 for costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 14, 2011, the State Court denied Sangha's motion to vacate the State Court Judgment. Sangha did not appeal the State Court Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sangha filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on April 18, 2013. In his schedules, he listed a disputed debt owed to Schrader of $ 1,369,634.00 for the State Court Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 23, 2013, Schrader filed an adversary complaint against Sangha seeking an exception to discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(6) for the debt evidenced by the State Court Judgment. Sangha filed an answer on August 21, 2013, generally denying the complaint's allegations and stating three affirmative defenses: that the purported false statements were privileged; that Schrader had engaged in fraud by concealment of material facts from the state court; and that Schrader had unclean hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Schrader filed a motion for summary judgment on April 25, 2014, arguing that there were no disputed material facts and that the State Court Judgment was preclusive as to all the elements required for an exception to discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Responding to the summary judgment motion on June 4, 2014, Sangha asserted that triable issues of fact remained concerning Schrader's unclean hands, fraud, the damage award, and Sangha's intent. Sangha also argued that he was entitled to conduct discovery. Schrader filed a reply on June 12, 2014, which included various documents in opposition to Sangha's allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before the motion hearing on July 8, 2014, the bankruptcy court posted a detailed tentative decision. Among the conclusions in the tentative decision of the bankruptcy court were that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   -There was no genuine dispute that the State Court Judgment included $ 6,000 in punitive damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   -All elements of issue preclusion were satisfied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   -None of Sangha's arguments supported the extrinsic fraud exception to issue preclusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   -The evidence reflected that all damages awarded were attributable to Sangha's malicious conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   -Sangha was seeking discovery to relitigate the State Court Judgment findings. The information he sought would\n   not prevent summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After hearing from the parties at the hearing, the bankruptcy court decided to grant summary judgment, and adopted its tentative decision, which it incorporated in a judgment (the \"Bankruptcy Judgment\") entered on August 7, 2014, that declared the State Court Judgment in the amount of $ 1,369,633.40 was excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. THE APPEALS AND SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sangha filed his appeal of the Bankruptcy Judgment on August 18, 2014. On June 11, 2015, the BAP entered its decision vacating the Bankruptcy Judgment and remanding the matter for further proceedings by this Court. On August 4, 2015, Sangha docketed an acknowledgment from the Ninth Circuit Clerk of Court of his own appeal of the BAP's ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On March 10, 2017, the Ninth Circuit issued its Judgment affirming the BAP and directing this Court to re-evaluate the availability of issue preclusion in light of\n   <em>\n    In re Plyam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4161800\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/530/456/\">\n    530 B.R. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. BAP 2015), which was decided by the BAP subsequent to issuance of the Bankruptcy Judgment. The Ninth Circuit further directed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ... the bankruptcy court must consider whether the state court default judgment and the allegations in Schrader's second amended complaint preclude relitigation of \u00a7 523(a)(6)'s \"willful\" intent requirement. If the bankruptcy court determines that the allegations in the second amended complaint together with the punitive damage award preclude relitigation of \u00a7 523(a)(6)'s \"willful and malicious\" intent requirements, then the California state trial court default judgment in favor of Schrader is not dischargeable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    In re Sangha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270688,12396325\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/678/561/\">\n    678 F. App'x 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562 (9th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The mandate of the Ninth Circuit to this Court issued on March 20, 2017. On April 5, 2017, the Court held a status conference to discuss with the parties the need for briefing to address the Ninth Circuit's determination that application of issue preclusion must be evaluated in light of\n   <em>\n    Plyam\n   </em>\n   . At the status conference, the Court directed the parties to file supplemental briefs. The Court has authorized the filing of the following supplemental briefs to address\n   <em>\n    Plyam\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Schrader filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which the Court construes as Schrader's Supplemental Brief Re: Remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Sangha Brief Re: Remand (Docket No. 211) (re-filed and amended with correct hearing date (Docket No. 215).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Sangha Second Supplemental Memorandum (Docket No. 234).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Schrader Reply to Second Supplemental Memorandum (Docket No. 235) and related Compendium of Exhibits (Docket No. 236).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 Second Supplemental Memorandum of Schrader (Docket No. 252)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 Request for Judicial Notice (Docket No. 254)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 Reply to Second Supplemental Memorandum of Schrader (Docket No. 260).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The key distinction, thus, between \"conscious disregard\" and \"intent\" is whether the actor intends the injury itself, not just the act that leads to the injury. As stated by the\n   <em>\n    Plyam\n   </em>\n   Court,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The critical difference between intentional and reckless misconduct is the necessary state of mind; for conduct to\n   be reckless, the person must intend the reckless act but need not intend to cause the resulting harm. To establish recklessness, it is sufficient that the person realizes (or should realize) the \"strong probability that harm may result, even though he hopes or even expects that his conduct will prove harmless.\" But, a strong probability is not equivalent to substantial certainty. (\"[A] strong probability is a different thing from the substantial certainty without which he cannot be said to intend the harm in which his act results.\") ...Thus, \"[a]s the probability that [injurious] consequences will follow decreases, and becomes less than substantial certainty, the [person's] conduct loses the character of intent, and becomes mere recklessness.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Plyam,\n   </em>\n   at 467 (internal citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next, the Court looks to the record of the case to determine whether any facts in the record before the State Court permit this Court to infer that the award of punitive damages necessarily flowed from a determination that Sangha published falsehoods with a specific intent to injure Schrader.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   First, in rendering default judgment in Schrader's favor, the State Court necessarily found that Sangha published false and unprivileged statements about Schrader because the sole claims asserted by Schrader in the second amended complaint were for Slander Per Se pursuant to California Civil Code \u00a7 46.\n   <em>\n    Gottlieb v.

Second, the material allegations underpinning the State Court Judgment are that Sangha published false statements regarding verbal, physical, and emotional abuse by Schrader.\n   <em>\n    In re Sangha\n   </em>\n   , *1 n.3. Thus, the truth of these material allegations was established when the State Court rendered its default judgment in favor of Schrader and this Court must accept that the State Court necessarily decided that Sangha uttered falsehoods about Schrader that were of an incredibly inflammatory nature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gottlieb v.

The collateral estoppel effect of the State Court Judgment precludes Sangha from challenging any of the material factual issues that were both raised in Schrader's State Court pleadings and which were necessary to uphold the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6470156\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/186/962/#p972\">\n    186 B.R. 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 972 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 1995). In sum, the limits of what was necessarily decided by the State Court are that Sangha uttered falsehoods and that those falsehoods were stated with a degree of malice. However, these established facts are insufficient for this Court to determine that the State Court necessarily decided Sangha's subjective intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Critically, to parse Sangha's degree of intentionality when he uttered the inflammatory falsehoods about Schrader, the record would have to indicate that the State Court considered not just the alleged injury (the withdrawal of Schrader's employment offer), but also Sangha's level of certainty that the statements he was made\n   to the contracted investigator were substantially certain to adversely impact Schrader's hiring prospects. As discussed,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , under California law, knowledge that an action has the strong probability of resulting in a specific consequence is insufficient to find that the actor intended the consequence; there must instead be a\n   <strong>\n    substantial certainty\n   </strong>\n   that the consequence will result from one's actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plyam,\n   </em>\n   at 467. Here, the Court has reviewed the record of the State Court proceedings and finds no conclusive support in the record for a finding that the State Court necessarily awarded punitive damages to Schrader on the basis that Sangha acted with the subjective intent to injure him. To the contrary, at the hearing on the default judgment prove-up, the State Court Judge made no remarks or references to Sangha's state of mind. The questioning was limited to calculation of damages. Although, Mr. Schrader was asked to state the bases for his request for damages, the State Court further made no remarks indicating that the degree of Sangha's subjective intent was being weighed. Moreover, Schrader has pointed to no other support from which this Court could infer Sangha's intent to injure from a finding that he committed malice in fact when supported by other facts in the record (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   the State Court made no comments and issued no rulings prior to the hearing on the default judgment motion in which it addressed or determined Sangha's subjective intent).\n   <em>\n    Sangha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203655113\">\n    2015 WL 3655113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In addition to the foregoing, the State Court made no findings regarding Sangha's specific knowledge of the San Jose Fire Department's hiring practices, and the State Court was not required to make any such finding to award punitive damages because even a reckless utterance of falsehoods was enough to award punitive damages under either a theory of oppression or despicable malice. For example, while this Court can interpret the circumstantial facts surrounding the falsehoods made by Sangha as being made with the subjective intent to injure Schrader, the record before the State Court leaves open an interpretation that Sangha intended only to impact Schrader's reputation in a general sense, perhaps merely to delay an employment offer, without the substantial certainty that Schrader would not get an employment offer, and by extension, without the requisite intent to injure Schrader. Thus, against the backdrop of California's narrow rule restricting the legal effect of default judgments to those matters necessarily decided or expressly adjudicated, and finding that the State Court's punitive damages award is limited to a finding that Sangha uttered falsehoods which caused injury to Schrader with an unspecified degree of malice, the Court finds the State Court Judgment insufficient to permit application of collateral estoppel as to the willfulness prong of \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Having entered judgment in favor of Schrader, the State Court necessarily found that Sangha uttered a false and unprivileged publication (which constitutes a wrongful act), which wrongful act was intentional (Sangha's intentional utterance of the alleged statements is inferred based on the allegations that the facts were false when made, that Sangha knew them to be false, and that they were nevertheless published to a third party by Sangha). Further, the injury to the Plaintiff's reputation would have been presumed by the State Court from the falsity of the statements (the Court notes that the general injury to the Plaintiff's reputation is distinguished from the specific injury at issue in the SAC - namely, the withdrawal of the conditional offer of employment).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allard,\n   </em>\n   at 439,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20797\">\n    129 Cal.Rptr. 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The above analysis indicates that as to the first three elements of the 'maliciousness' prong, Schrader prevails. However, a review of applicable state and federal caselaw indicates that the State Court Judgment is insufficient on its own to satisfy the fourth element of the \"maliciousness\" inquiry -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the wrongful act was undertaken without just cause or excuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Courts to consider the issue have determined that just cause or excuse is in the nature of an affirmative defense,\n   <em>\n    Petralia v.

BAP July 18, 2016), and under California law, a default judgment is conclusive as to the matters necessary to uphold the particular judgment, but it is not conclusive in a subsequent action as to matters not raised in the pleadings or as to defenses that could have been but were not raised.\n   <em>\n    California Affirmative Defenses\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 14:9 Decision on Merits - Default Judgments (2d ed.). As such, the State Court Judgment is by itself insufficient to satisfy the 'without just cause or excuse' element of maliciousness. Nevertheless, the Court's review of the State Court record, as evidenced in Schrader's original Motion for Summary Judgment and supporting documents (Docket Nos. 108, 109, 111, and 112) indicates that prior to the entry of judgment in Schrader's favor, the State Court considered and determined a motion by Schrader for terminating sanctions against Sangha. The State Court's docket and Schrader's declaration indicate that the motion for terminating sanctions was heard and determined with no opposition from Sangha and the result was that his answer was stricken in its entirety on a finding that Sangha's \"failure to respond\n   to the [State Court's] orders compelling a response to interrogatory is willful.\" (Docket No. 112 at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48). California law holds that a decision to order terminating sanctions 'should not be made lightly' but that where a violation is \"willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.\"\n   <em>\n    Van Sickle v.

On this final point, the Court finds that collateral estoppel\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   must apply to bar relitigation of the defenses that were raised or that could have been raised by Sangha in State Court because the State Court's order granting Schrader's motion for terminating sanctions represented actual litigation of the identical issue (the ability of Sangha to raise defenses to Schrader's defamation claims) that was necessarily decided in the State Court proceeding and which decision was final and on the merits as between the same parties - Sangha and Schrader.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Sangha is precluded from litigating the issue of 'just cause and excuse'.
