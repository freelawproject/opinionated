In any event, whether or not this court treats, appellant\u2019s suit as an action for reimbursement brought under paragraph 5 of the Massachusetts decree (as appellant pleaded in its complaint and upon its motion for summary judgment) or as an action on the money judgment provision of paragraph 4 of the Massachusetts decree (as appellant now asserts for the first time), there is no jurisdiction over the person of defendant. <em>(Capello </em>v. <em>Union Carbide &amp; Carbon Corp., </em>276 App. Div. 277; <em>Irving Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Miss L.

In any event, respondent\u2019s affidavit in opposition to appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment created issues of fact which bar granting its motion. <em>(Raymond Car Sales </em>v. <em>Motor </em>Wholesalers, 28 Misc 2d <em>1; Nix </em>v. <em>Low, </em>165 Misc. 484; <em>Metzger </em>v. <em>Flagstone Rest., </em>27 Misc 2d 500.)</p>\n<author id=\"b180-5\">Bergan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arn\">Defendant is a Delaware corporation which, before March 10, 1956, had been authorized to do business in New York. On that date it filed a certificate of surrender of authority to do business, which, as the statute required (former General' Corporation Law, \u00a7 216, now Business Corporation Law, \u00a7 1310), included a consent that process in an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\u201c upon any liability or obligation incurred within the State of New York \u201d before the surrender of authority might be served on the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">On October 21, 1953 while defendant was authorized to do business in New York it executed an instrument in this State guaranteeing to plaintiff certain obligations of a third party under a sublease of business property in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In an action for declaratory judgment instituted February 10, 1956 in Massachusetts by the owner of the property, in which both the plaintiff in this present action, Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., and this defendant, Ann Lewis Shops, Inc., were parties, a judgment was entered March 1, 1957 determining, among other things, liabilities between the present parties based on the instrument of guarantee made by defendant in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">It was during the pendency of this action, on March 15, 1956, that defendant filed the surrender of authority to do business in New York. This is an action on the Massachusetts judgment commenced August 17, 1963 against defendant by service on the Secretary of State. Summary judgment in favor of defendant was granted at Special Term and the Appellate Division affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">In respect of liability between the present parties, the Massachusetts judgment determined in separate paragraphs (a) that Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc. (plaintiff here) should be entitled to \u201c reimbursement \u201d from Ann Lewis Shops, Inc. (defendant here) of 40% of any sums which the plaintiff in that action might recover from this plaintiff, Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc.; and (b) that, \u201c subject to the provisions and conditions of this Decree, there is due\u201d to Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., from Ann Lewis Shops, Inc., $8,400 and interest of $315 for the period September, 1955 through October, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">This part of the judgment provided additionally that, \u201c subject to the provisions and conditions of this Decree, the said * * * Ann Lewis Shops, Inc., pay to the defendant Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., the said sums totaling Bight Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifteen Dollars ($8,715.00) with interest thereon to the date of payment \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">The basis of the difference between that part of the judgment which adjudicates an amount due to Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., based on a percentage reimbursement of what that corporation had to pay the owner of the property, and the specific adjudication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>of dollar liability in the other part of the judgment, is not fully spelled out in the record before us; but it could be due to a purpose of the Massachusetts court to declare the general frame of liabilities of the parties then before it covering a period to the end of the sublease, which was beyond the date of trial and judgment, and at the same time to fix the actually accrued and computed liabilities of the parties at the time of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Whether this was the case or not, the judgment specifically determined that $8,715 is due from this defendant to this plaintiff and on its face it should be treated as a judgment \u201c for a sum of money or directing the payment of a sum of money \u2019 \u2019 within section 44 of the former Civil Practice Act in effect when the present action was commenced (August 17, 1963) or as \u201ca money judgment \u201d, the CPLR provision (211 [b]) in effect since September 1 of that year. As an action on a money judgment the Statute of Limitations would not have run.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The main question in the case, however, is whether, because the contract which the Massachusetts court enforced by its judgment was made by defendant in New York, this action on the Massachusetts judgment is to be deemed an action on a \u201cliability or obligation incurred\u201d by the defendant in Now York.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">This, in turn, depends on whether there has been such a merger of the original cause of action upon the obligation concededly incurred in New York and the Massachusetts judgment that the judgment has not only become a full substitute for the underlying cause which it adjudicated, but also that an action to enforce the Massachusetts judgment is no longer to be deemed an action on a liability or obligation incurred in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The New York statute required, as we have noted, when defendant filed its certificate of surrender of authority to do business in New York in 1956, that it designate the Secretary of State as an agent upon whom process could be served in an action based \u2018 \u2018 upon any liability or obligation incurred \u201d by it \u201c within this state before the filing of the certificate of surrender\u201d and jurisdiction of defendant is claimed on the basis of service made in accordance with this article,.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">But if the Massachusetts judgment is not deemed to be a liability or obligation incurred within New York no jurisdiction would have been obtained of defendant by the -service of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Secretary of State. Objection on this ground has been consistently advanced by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The theory of merger of a judgment and its underlying cause of action, while it has served some other functions, essentially is based on a policy to prevent successive actions on the same cause. Hence it is closely related to the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>In discussing <em>res judicata </em>in <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Newton </em>(50 N. J. L. 571) for example, the New Jersey Supreme Oourt noted (p. 577): \u201cIf the decree is final, then its result is to merge the original cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The basic theory stems back largely from Coke\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Higgens\u2019s Case </em>(6 Co. Rep. 44b; 77 Eng. Repr. 320, 321): \u2018 \u2018 So when a man has a debt on a bond, and by ordinary course of law had judgment thereon, the contract by specialty which is of an inferior nature, is by judgment of law changed into a matter of record, which is of a higher nature * * * If he who recovers may have a new action and a new judgment he may have infinite actions, and infinite judgments \u201d (see Pirsig, Merger by Judgment, 28 Minn. L. Rev. 419, 425).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">But merger by judgment does not destroy all of the identifying characteristics or relationships of the cause of action which the judgment determines; and it seems rather clear that the doctrine was not designed to weaken rights or destroy identities which the prevailing party had in his original cause and which he succeeded in establishing by judgment in his favor. This, then, seems part of the significance of the dictum of Werner, J., in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Muir </em>(194 N. Y. 420, 423) that \u201c a judgment is merely the old debt in a new form \u2019 \u2019, a statement which has been widely quoted (see, e.g., 2 Black, Judgments [2d ed.], p. 1027, \u00a7 678).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">A case which may be analogized in principle to the one before us is <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(1 Cow. 316 [1823]) where judgment on a Massachusetts judgment was granted for the plaintiff against defendant\u2019s plea that he had been discharged by the New York insolvency act of April, 1813. The Massachusetts action was based on notes found to have been executed by defendant before the 1813 act; but the Massachusetts judgment was entered in November, 1814 after passage of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Among other questions it was determined that the court could inquire into the time at which the notes which had been the subject of the Massachusetts judgment had been actually made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>to determine whether they had been discharged, and in this aspect of the case, Sutherland, J., writing one of the two opinions in the Supreme Court noted (p. 321) : \u201c But-1 sec no objection, in principle, to permitting an inquiry into the time of making the agreement, or contract, upon which the first judgment was founded, for (lie purpose of taking the case -out of the operation of the, defendant\u2019s discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">A number of decisions in New York arising from bankruptcy are to the effect that a judgment is not a \"new debt \u201d separate from the debt on which it was based. (See, e.g., <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>50 N. Y. 593, 597; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Rowling, </em>3 N. Y. 216; <em>Dresser </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>3 Barb. 429.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">That the court will as a matter of course examine the basis of a judgment in another State to determine its enforcibility and effect in New York is made clear in <em>Matter of Williams </em>(208 N. Y. 32). There decedent\u2019s former wife had obtained a judgment of divorce against him in South Dakota and a substantial money judgment for alimony. In an action on that judgment in New York a judgment was entered in favor of the wife for the amount due under the South Dakota judgment. The decedent thereafter filed a petition in bankruptcy, listed the New York judgment as a debt, and was discharged. Upon his death the former wife presented a claim based on the New York judgment, which was described as <em>\u201c </em>being in the nature of a judgment for alimony \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The Surrogate disallowed the claim; the Appellate Division reversed and this court affirmed the Appellate Division saying, per Chase, J., that \u2018 \u2018 the recovery of the judgment in this state was not a discharge of the South Dakota judgment and it was not merged in the judgment so recovered in this state \u201d (p. 36).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Thus, the court examined, and its decision turned upon, the nature of the cause which was the basis of the underlying foreign judgment. See, also, as to the lien of an attorney as affected by a later judgment <em>American Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Niebuhr </em>(124 N. J. Eq. 372).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">In the leading case of <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Pelican Ins. Co. </em>(127 U. S. 265), dealing with the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in actions by a State against a private person, the court inquired into the nature of the cause of action which underlay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>judgment which Wisconsin had obtained against a private corporation and on which judgment it sued in an original action in the Supreme Court which examined behind the judgment into the nature of the original cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Justice G-bay, writing for the court, noted (pp. 292-293): \u201c The essential nature and real foundation of a cause of action are not changed b.y recovering judgment upon it; and the technical rules, which regard the original claim as merged in the judgment, and the judgment as implying a promise by the defendant to pay it, do not preclude a court, to which a judgment is presented for affirmative action * * * from ascertaining whether the claim is really one of such a nature that the court is authorized to enforce it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The limitations which these decisions suggest on the operation of the doctrine of merger are of general application. (See 50 C. J. S., Judgments, \u00a7 599, where it is noted on sufficiently representative authority that the doctrine of merger will not be <em>\u201c </em>carried any further than the ends of justice require \u201d and that a judgment does not <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>change the essential nature and real foundation of the cause of action\u201d. See, also, 2 Freeman, Judgments [5th ed.], p. 1172, \u00a7 550, to the same effect that \u201c [T]he essential nature of the cause of action remains the same\u201d; and Black, Judgments, cited <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">This direction of decisional law would seem to require that this action on the Massachusetts judgment be treated as an action \u2018 \u2018 upon \u201d a \u201c liability or obligation \u2019 \u2019 incurred within this State before the surrender of authority, since the Massachusetts judgment was based on such a liability and its characteristics in this respect survive the adjudication which it formalizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Hence the service on the Secretary of State was sufficient to acquire jurisdiction of the defendant under the terms of its surrender of authority and of the statute which governed the surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The complaint in this action asked judgment in the sum of $10,200, which was based on a projection of the 40% computation stated in one part of the Massachusetts judgment, rather than $8,715 found to be due plaintiff in the other part of the judgment. Plaintiff moved at Special Term for summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>on the full $10,200 stated in the complaint and, on defendant\u2019s opposition to this, the court at Special Term granted summary judgment for the defendant dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Defendant would be correct that, as to the full amount demanded in the complaint and by plaintiff on summary judgment, there would be triable issues as to the scope of the Massachusetts judgment and it would be doubtful in any case if, beyond the $8,715, the Massachusetts judgment was a judgment for \u201c a sum of money\u201d entitled to the long Statute of Limitations. But in this court plaintiff limits its argument for relief to the specific amount stated in the Massachusetts judgment and this is sufficiently within the frame of the complaint and the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The order should be reversed and summary judgment granted to plaintiff for $8,715, with costs in all courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fold, Van Voorhis, Burke and Scileppi concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Order reversed, with costs in all courts, and matter remitted to Special Term for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
