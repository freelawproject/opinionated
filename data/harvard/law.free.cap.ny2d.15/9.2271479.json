It has long been settled law that an obligation arising out of an out-of-Slate gambling transaction, lawful where incurred, will be enforced by the courts of New York. <em>(United States Mtge. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Ruggles, </em>258 N.

The conduct of gambling in a professional gambling establishment is repulsive to New York\u2019s concept of morality and contrary to its public policy. <em>(Ruckman </em>v. <em>Pitcher, </em>1 N.

A gambling debt is unenforcible in New York even though incurred in a jurisdiction where gambling is legalized. <em>(Shannon </em>v. <em>Irving Trust Co., </em>275 N. Y. 95; <em>Thatcher </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>11 N. Y. 437; <em>Commonwealth of Kentucky </em>v. <em>Bassford, </em>6 Hill 526; <em>Ormes </em>v. <em>Dauchy, </em>82 N.

The licensing of dice tables in gambling houses of Puerto Bico has no effect on New York\u2019s public policy toward such professional gambling. IV. New York\u2019s consistent public policy of opposition to professional gambling is not weakened by the exceptions as to pari-mutuel betting and bingo. <em>(Strauch </em>v. <em>Town of Oyster Bay, </em>263 App. Div. 833; <em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Co. </em>v. <em>Utica, C. &amp; B.

The operator of a professional gambling house may not sue in New York to recover money lost on credit, even if the gambling was licensed and the debt arose in New York. <em>(Berman </em>v. <em>Riverside Casino Corp., </em>323 F. 2d 977; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Courtney, </em>7 Nev. 419; <em>West Indies, Inc., </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank, </em>67 Nev. 13; <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>1 Cal. 441; <em>Carrier </em>v. <em>Brannan, </em>3 Cal. 328.) VII. The full faith and credit and due process clauses of the United States Constitution do not require a State to give access to its courts in matters which conflict with its public policy, nor does comity require a State to enforce a contract in such a case. <em>(Bond </em>v. <em>Hume, </em>243 U. S. 15; <em>Straus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Canadian Pacific Ry. Co., </em>254 N. Y. 407; <em>Meacham </em>v. <em>Jamestown, F. &amp; C. R. R. Co., </em>211 N.

No additional rights were acquired by plaintiff by delivery of the $3,000 check. <em>(Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Bankers Trust Co., </em>280 N. Y. 135.) IX. Plaintiff\u2019s action must fail, in any event as a suit to recover under a foreign revenue law. <em>(Banco Do Brasil, S.

The substantive rights of the parties are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Bico. <em>(Haag </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>9 N Y 2d 554; <em>Auten </em>v. <em>Auten, </em>308 N. Y. 155; <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>12 N Y 2d 473.) II. The enforcement of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>rights is not repugnant to the <em>\u201c </em>public policy \u201d of this State. <em>(Loucks </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of N. Y., </em>224 N. Y. 99; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>19 Vt. 358; <em>Veytia </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>30 Ariz. 316; <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Irving Trust Co., </em>305 N.

Y. 532; <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>110 Misc. 266.) III. The United States Government policy of favoring the economy of Puerto Rico will be furthered by enforcing the rights of plaintiff-appellant. IV. The courts of this State have almost uniformly enforced obligations related to lawful out-of-State gambling contracts. <em>(Commonwealth of Kentucky </em>v. <em>Bassford, </em>6 Hill 526; <em>Thatcher </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>11 N. Y. 437; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>White, </em>81 N. Y. 532; <em>Ormes </em>v. <em>Dauchy, </em>82 N. Y. 443; <em>Thuna </em>v. <em>Wolf, </em>130 Misc. 306,132 Misc. 56; <em>Richter </em>v. <em>Empire Trust Co., </em>20 F. Supp. 289; <em>Tropicales, S.

A., </em>v. <em>Milora, </em>7 Misc 2d 281; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Abadjian, </em>30 Cal. 2d 49.) V. Multiplicity of suits will be avoided by the enforcement of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s rights. <em>(Fauntleroy </em>v. <em>Lum, </em>210 U. S. 230.) VI. The rights of plaintiff-appellant should be enforced on the basis of comity. <em>(Veytia </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>30 Ariz. 316.) VII. Plaintiff-appellant is entitled to recover on that portion of the obligation which is evidenced by defendant-respondent\u2019s check drawn on a New York bank.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b48-7\">Burke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak\">On this appeal by the plaintiff from a judgment dismissing the complaint, the only issue is whether the courts of this State must deny access to a party seeking to enforce obligations validly entered into in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and enforcible under Puerto Rican law.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Plaintiff, the owner and operator of a government-licensed gambling casino in Puerto Rico, seeks to recover the sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>$12,000 evidenced by defendant\u2019s check and I. 0. IT.s given in payment of gambling debts incurred in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Once again we are faced with the question of when our courts may refuse to enforce a foreign right, though valid where acquired, on the ground that its \u201c enforcement is contrary to [the public] policy of the forum \u201d <em>(Straus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Canadian Pacific Ry. Co., </em>254 N. Y. 407, 414).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Since these gambling debts were validly contracted in Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican law provides a remedy for their enforcement <em>(United Hotels of Puerto Rico </em>v. <em>Willig, </em>Puerto Rico Bar Assn., No. 172 [Oct. 9, 1963]), absent a clear showing that the enforcement of the causes of action here would \u201c offend our sense of justice or menace the public welfare \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Loucks </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>224 N. Y. 99, 110), we may not withhold aid. We do not think that public policy forbids us to enforce these contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Substantially all of the commentators agree that foreign-based rights should be enforced unless the judicial enforcement of such a contract would be the approval of a transaction which is inherently vicious, wicked or immoral, and shocking to the prevailing moral sense. (Beach, Uniform Interstate Enforcement of Vested Rights, 27 Yale L. J. 656, 662; Goodrich, Conflict of Laws [3d ed., 1949], 305; 2 Rabel, Conflict of Laws: A Comparative Study [1947], 555-575; Paulsen and Sovern, \u201cPublic Policy \u201d in the Conflict of Laws, 56 Col. L. Rev. 969; 3 Beale, Conflict of Laws [1935], 1649.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Applying this test we find decisions in this State involving gambling transactions which put this reasoning into practice. Over 100 years ago this court held in <em>Thatcher </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(11 N. Y. 437 [1854]) that a contract involving lottery tickets if legal and valid without the State would be upheld though illegal in New York. In <em>Harris </em>v. <em>White </em>(81 N. Y. 532 [1880]) suit was permitted for wages earned in out-of-State horse races at a time when horse racing was illegal in the State of New York. In <em>Ormes </em>v. <em>Dauchy </em>(82 N. Y. 443 [1880]) suit was upheld for commissions earned by placing extrastate lottery advertisements in out-of-State newspapers. Thus, aware of the common-law rule which barred the enforcement of gambling contracts and conscious that they were illegal and void in almost all the States of this country, the courts of this State took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>position, even in Victorian times, that there was no strong public policy to prevent the enforcement of such contracts according to the law of the place of performance. There is nothing suggested by the respondent which should persuade us that Judge Cardozo was wrong when he said in <em>Loucks </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>(224 N. Y. 99, 111 [1918], <em>supra): </em>\u201cThe courts are not free to refuse to enforce a foreign right at the pleasure of the judges, to suit the individual notion of expediency or fairness. They do not close their doors unless help would violate some * * * prevalent conception of good morals \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">It has, however, been urged that suits on gambling debts contracted validly elsewhere are contrary to two public policies of this State, i.e,, in this jurisdiction gamblers are outlaws, and all gambling contracts made with them are void. Worthy though such considerations be, they apply only to transactions governed by our domestic law. This court gave thought to such arguments recently and rejected them as an insufficient basis for projecting domestic philosophies of law to decision making in actions based on transactions governed by the law of another State (see <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Irving Trust Co., </em>305 N. Y. 288, 304 [1953] [dictum]; <em>Matter of May, </em>305 N. Y. 486 [\u201c incestuous \u201d marriage] ; <em>Zwirn </em>v. <em>Galento, </em>288 N. Y. 428; <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Safe Deposit Bank, </em>255 N. Y. 260, 267; see, also, <em>Palmer Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Van Doren, </em>260 Mich. 310 [1932]; <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>McAdam, </em>142 Wis. 114 [1910]; <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>125 Mass. 374 [1878]; <em>Biewend </em>v. <em>Biewend, </em>17 Cal. 2d 108 [1941]; Restatement, Conflict of Laws, New York Annotations, \u00a7 612, p. 389).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Public policy is not determinable by mere reference to the laws of the forum alone. Strong public policy is found in prevailing social and moral attitudes of the community. In this sophisticated season the enforcement of the rights of the plaintiff in view of the weight of authority would not be considered repugnant to the \u201cpublic policy of this State\u201d. It seems to us that, if we are to apply the strong public policy test to the enforcement of the plaintiff\u2019s rights under the gambling laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, we should measure them by the prevailing social and moral attitudes of the community which is reflected not only in the decisions of our courts in the Victorian era but sharply illustrated in the changing attitudes of the People of the State of New York. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The legalization of pari-mutuel betting and the operation of bingo games, as well as a strong movement for legalized offtrack betting, indicate that the New York public does not consider authorized gambling a violation of <em>\u201c </em>some prevalent conception of good morals, [or] some deep-rooted tradition of the common weal.\u201d <em>(Loucks </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., supra, </em>p. 111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The trend in New York State demonstrates an acceptance of <em>licensed </em>gambling transactions as a morally acceptable activity, not objectionable under the prevailing standards of lawful and approved social conduct in a community. Our newspapers quote the odds on horse races, football games, basketball games and print the names of the winners of the Irish Sweepstakes and the New Hampshire lottery. Informed public sentiment in New York is only against unlicensed gambling, which is unsupervised, unregulated by law and which affords no protection to customers and no assurance of fairness or honesty in the operation of the gambling devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">In the present case there is no indication that the evils of gambling, which New York prohibits and Puerto Rico has licensed, will spill over into our community if these debts are enforced in New York courts. The New York constitutional provisions were adopted with a view toward protecting the family man of meager resources from his own imprudence at the gaming tables. (See Carter and Stone, Proceedings and Debates of the Convention, 567 [Hosford, 1821].)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Puerto Rico has made provision for this kind of imprudence by allowing the court to reduce gambling obligations or even decline to enforce them altogether, if the court in its discretion finds that the losses are \u201c [in an] amount [which] may exceed the customs of a good father of a family. \u2019 \u2019 (Laws of Puerto Rico Ann., tit. 31, \u00a7 4774.) This regulation is consistent with New York policy and would be properly considered in any case before a New York court which may be asked to enforce a Puerto Rican gambling debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">There is nothing Immoral per se in the contract before us, but injustice would result if citizens of this State were allowed to retain the benefits of the winnings in a State where such gambling is legal, but to renege if they were losers.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The cases relied on by the respondent miss the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>In the case of <em>Mertz </em>v. <em>Mertz </em>(271 N. Y. 466 [1936]) Judge Lehman, writing for the court, said that \u201c a disability to sue attached by our law to the person of a wife becomes an anomaly if another State can confer upon a wife, <em>even though residing here, </em>capacity to sue in our courts upon a cause of action arising there\u201d (p. 474; emphasis added). As distinguished from the present case, in <em>Mertz </em>the court was faced with this State\u2019s interest in the marital status situated here. As a practical matter, all the significant contacts of the case were with New York and the language of the opinion indicates that the court was in reality there making a <em>choice of law </em>decision of the kind that this court today follows under the nominal heading of the \u201c contacts \u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">In <em>Flegenheimer </em>v. <em>Brogan </em>(284 N. Y. 268 [1940]) the court nominally invoked the public policy doctrine, but was only concerned with the operation of the liquor control laws in <em>this </em>State. The court did not find the policy of other States so unjust or antisocial as to oblige the courts of our State to deny access to litigants seeking to enforce rights validly created there.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">This court refused to enforce a tax claim asserted here by the plaintiff municipality in <em>City of Philadelphia [Pa.] </em>v. <em>Cohen </em>(11 N Y 2d 401 [1962], cert. den. 371 U. S. 934 [1963]) but in doing so relied heavily upon the specific terms of our statute which calls for the enforcement of such tax claims arising in other States <em>if </em>such other State will reciprocate on a New York tax claim. Pennsylvania, unlike most States, has no such reciprocity provision. <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Malatesta </em>(262 N. Y. 80 [1933]) was concerned with a New York statute and a situation involving betting in <em>this </em>State that was clearly unlawful under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Since a gambling debt is unenforeible when made in Nevada, courts in other States have no public policy issue to pass upon, and refusals elsewhere to enforce these claims are a mere application of Nevada law. <em>(Hamilton </em>v. <em>Abadjian, </em>30 Cal. 2d 49 [1947] and the Nevada cases cited therein.) Nevada courts refuse to enforce gambling debts since the statutes of that State, while specifically authorizing licensed gambling casinos (as an exception to the policy there that gambling generally is illegal), make no provision for their enforcement. <em>(West Indies </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank of Nevada, </em>67 Nev. 13.) In Puerto Eico the situation is different. There is specific statutory provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>for the enforcement of legal gambling debts there (Laws of Puerto Rico Ann., tit. 31, \u00a7 4774) and the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has upheld the enforcement of such claims. <em>(United Hotels of Puerto Rico </em>v. <em>Willig, </em>Puerto Rico Bar Assn., No. 172 [Oct. 9, 1963], <em>supra.) </em>The refusal of courts to enforce Nevada gambling debts has no application to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">We think, therefore, that this ease falls within the consistent practice of enforcing rights validly created by the laws of a sister State which do not tend to disturb our local laws or corrupt the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County, reinstated, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b53-6\">Chief Judge Desmond (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Ab9\">The court is holding that there is no public policy against the use of a New York court as a collection agency by a gambling house proprietor who is guilty of the social wrong of letting his customers gamble on a charge account basis. This comes as a surprise in a State where the professional gambler has always been treated as an outlaw and a gambling house considered as a criminal nuisance <em>(People ex rel. Collins </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>128 App. Div. 599, app. dsmd. 194 N. Y. 556; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stedeker, </em>175 N. Y. 57, 62; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Malatesta, </em>262 N. Y. 80, 82). Such has been the public policy of New York since colonial days and we are not informed as to when or how it was changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Plaintiff, a Delaware corporation and operator of a Comm on - wealth-licensed gambling room or casino in its hotel in Puerto Rico, sued defendant, a New York resident, on a $3,000 check and 13 \u201cI. O. U.s \u201d totaling $9,000. The $12,000 total covered defendant\u2019s gambling losses at plaintiff\u2019s casino where defendant had been allowed to gamble on credit. The trial court sitting without a jury gave judgment for plaintiff but the Appellate Division, reversing, held that such a loan is not collectible in the courts of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The issue: are our courts open to suits by gambling house proprietors who let their customers run up debts; or do such transactions so offend our concept of good morals that our settled public policy prompts us to reject the suit? Closing our doors to such a lawsuit is in principle and under our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>decisions and statutes the only possible course. It is not a matter of choice of law as between the Puerto Rican and domestic brands. We refuse the suit not because Puerto Rico\u2019s law differs from ours but because we cannot in good conscience use our judicial processes to recognize the gamester\u2019s claim by giving him a judgment <em>(Mertz </em>v. <em>Mertz, </em>271 N. Y. 466; <em>Flegenheimer v. Brogan, </em>284 N. Y. 268; <em>Hollis </em>v. <em>Drew Theol. Seminary, </em>95 N. Y. 166; <em>Cross </em>v. <em>United States Trust Co., </em>131 N. Y. 330, 343). <em>\u201cIt </em>is an attribute of our State\u2019s sovereignty that it may determine for itself whether under its concepts of comity a particular foreign law should or should not be enforced \u201d <em>(City of Philadelphia </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>11 N Y 2d 401, 406, cert. den. 371 U. S. 934).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">We are here asked to enforce a gambling contract, unenforcible at common law <em>(Ruckman </em>v. <em>Pitcher, </em>1 N. Y. 392; <em>Meech </em>v. <em>Stoner, </em>19 N. Y. 26; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Williar, </em>110 U. S. 499, 510) and made void and illegal in our State (and almost every other State, see <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Williar, supra) </em>under specific statutes (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 991-996). In truth, not one but two public policies of ours are offended when we give judgment for plaintiff. First, operating a gambling business (as distinguished from casual betting between individuals) was an indictable public nuisance at common law, has always been held criminal conduct in New York State, and professional gamblers are \u201c outlaws \u201d in New York <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stedeker, 175 </em>N. Y. 57, 62, supra; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bright, </em>203 N. Y. 73; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Malatesta, </em>262 N. Y. 80, supra; <em>Bamman </em>v. <em>Erickson, </em>288 N. Y. 133; <em>People </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>295 N. Y. 61; <em>Hofferman </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>290 N. Y. 449). Second, from earliest times in this State all gambling contracts and loans for gambling have been void and denied enforcement by the professional gambler even to the extent that the bettor-customer may sue for the amount he lost (Penal Law, \u00a7 994; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Malatesta, supra). </em>As this court said in the <em>Watts </em>case in 1933 (p. 82): <em>\u201c </em>The reason seems obvious. Curb the professional with his constant offer of temptation coupled with ready opportunity, and you have to a large extent controlled the evil.\u201d It denies both history and logic to hold that despite all these showings of public policy our courts must give this plaintiff judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>The conclusion that settled New York policy bars suit on a claim like this one is not disproved by pointing to our legalization of bingo games and pari-mutuel betting on horse races (N. Y. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9). The people of the State in amending their Constitution and the legislators in adopting and revising the statutes have found and acted on important differences between those two forms of gambling and the operation of gambling houses. That these differences are widely recognized elsewhere is evident from the fact that while pari-mutuel betting is lawful in 24 States and bingo is legalized in 11 States (lottery in one) nevertheless only one State (Nevada) licenses gambling rooms and even in Nevada gambling-house debts are not suable in court <em>(Nevada Tax Comm. </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>73 Nev. 115). California courts will not recognize Nevada gambling contracts <em>(Hamilton </em>v. <em>Abadjian, </em>30 Cal. 2d 49). The only New York State appellate decision cited contra is <em>Thatcher </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(11 N. Y. 437) which discussed an out-of-State lottery conducted not as a business but for educational, religious and benevolent purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Some of our citizens fail to appreciate these differences and believe that all kinds of gambling should be licit or all forms condemned. But the preference of the majority (who make public policy in a government like ours) has been expressed at the voting booths and in the Legislature with the result that now, as during the State\u2019s whole history, the operation of a gambling casino is a criminal offense and loans by the operator to his customer or bets made on credit are uncollectible. This is our historical and settled State policy and it is totally inconsistent with that policy to say that the courts provided by and for our citizens must nonetheless give judgment on any gaming house owner\u2019s claim against his customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Judges Dye, Fuld, Scileppi and Bergan concur with Judge Burke; Chief Judge Desmond dissents in an opinion in which Judge Van Voorhis concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Judgment of Appellate Division reversed and that of the Supreme Court, New York County, reinstated, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
