The direct action statute of Puerto Pico is applicable under New York choice of law rules. <em>(Babcock </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>12 N Y 2d 473; <em>Bosco </em>v. <em>Firemen\u2019s Fund Ins.

The correct choice of law, especially with respect to the form of remedy, is New York\u2019s law. <em>(Babcock </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>12 N Y 2d 473.) II. The Puerto Eican statutes permitting direct actions against liability insurers in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>personal injury actions arc unenforcible as being against the public policy of New York. <em>(Loucks </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of N.

Neither full faith and credit nor the United States Code (tit. 28, \u00a7 1738) requires a local enforcement of the Puerto Rican direct action statutes. <em>(Bradford Elec.

The Puerto Rican statutes here involved are not enforcible locally as they do not contemplate a direct action against an insurance company other than in the courts of Puerto Rico. <em>(Sharrow </em>v. <em>Inland Lines, </em>214 N.

Oltarsh slipped and fell in a building owned by a Puerto Rican corporation solely in consequence, it is alleged, of the latter\u2019s negligence. The defendant Aetna Insurance Company, incorporated in Connecticut and doing business in New York and Puerto Rico, had issued and delivered in Puerto Rico <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>a policy of public liability insurance covering the premises where the accident occurred and, some time after their return to New York City where they both resided, the plaintiffs instituted this action in our Supreme Court against the insurance carrier, based upon a statute of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico sanctioning .such a direct action (Laws of Puerto Rico, tit. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 2001, 2003 ).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action (CPLR 3211, subd. [a], par. 2). The court at Special Term, agreeing with the position taken by the defendant, granted the motion, \u00a1stating that \u201c [the] action is objectionable to the public policy of this State and as such is not enforcible in our courts <em>(Morton </em>v. <em>Maryland Cas. Co., </em>1 A D 2d 116, affd. 4 N Y 2d 488).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Appellate Division affirmed the dismissal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the complaint and granted the plaintiffs leave to appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The Puerto Bican statute before us \u2014 resembling in general purpose legislation in .several other jurisdictions (La. Rev. Stat., tit. 22, \u00a7 655; B. I. Gen. Laws 1956, tit. 27, ch. 7, \u00a7 27-7-1; Wis. Stats. Ann., tit. 25, ch. 260, \u00a7 260.11, subd. [1])\u2014provides (1) that the insurer issuing a liability policy shall become \u201c liable \u201d whenever a covered loss occurs and that payment of such loss under the policy <em>\u201c </em>shall not depend upon payment by the insured of or upon any final judgment against him arising out of .such occurrence \u201d (Laws of Puerto Rico, tit. 26, \u00a7 2001) and, further, (2) that any person .sustaining damages or loss shall have an option to bring \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>a direct action \u2019 \u2019 against the insurer alone or against the insurer and the insured jointly (\u00a7 2003, subd. [1]). This State has no similar legislation, and it is this difference which gives rise to the question presented on this appeal. And, in seeking an answer, we must first decide whether the issue \u2014 the right of the plaintiffs to sue the insurer directly\u2014is (to employ traditional rubrics) \u201c procedural \u201d and, by that token, necessarily governed by the law of the forum or \u201c substantive \u201d and, hence, governed by the law applicable under choice of law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">By making the insurer immediately liable whenever a covered loss occurs and rendering ineffectual \" no action \u2019 \u2019 clauses in insurance contracts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Puerto Bico\u2019s statute did more than simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>redefine the proper parties to suits involving insurance contracts and went beyond merely providing a procedural shortcut for those injured by insured tort-feasors. Bather, the statute created a \u00a1separate and distinct right of action against the insurer where no ,sueh right had previously existed and thus effected a radical change in the rights accorded injured persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">There can be no doubt, then, that such direct action legislation transcends mere procedure and, indeed, in <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Maryland Cas. Co. </em>(4 N Y 2d 488, 493, affg. in this respect 1 A D 2d 116, 120), we implicitly recognized the substantive character of the somewhat similar Louisiana direct action statute for purposes of the conflict of laws. (See, also, <em>Collins </em>v. <em>American Auto. Ins. Co., </em>230 F. 2d 416, 419-422; <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Elbert, </em>348 U. S. 48, 51; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Employers Liab. Corp., </em>348 U. S. 66; <em>West </em>v. <em>Monroe Bakery, </em>217 La. 189; <em>Kertson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>185 Minn. 591, 595 [involving Wisconsin\u2019s direct action statute]; Note, 57 Col. L. Rev. 256, 272.) And, although it is the settled rule that the forum undertakes its own characterization of a foreign statute (see <em>Kilberg </em>v. <em>Northeast Airlines, </em>9 N Y 2d 34, 41; <em>Murray </em>v. <em>New York, O. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>242 App. Div. 374; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>American Auto. Ins. Co., </em>230 F. 2d 416, 422, supra; Restatement, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 584), it is relevant that the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit which includes Puerto Bico has treated that Commonwealth\u2019s direct action statute as substantive for purposes of the <em>Erie </em>doctrine <em>(Erie R. Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>304 U. S. 64), declaring that that statute \u201c relate [s] to the substance of the liability of the insurance company.\u201d <em>(Aponte </em>v. <em>American Sur. Co. of N. Y., </em>276 F. 2d 678, 680; see, also, <em>Bosco </em>v. <em>Firemen\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>171 F. Supp. 432, 434; <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>183 F. Supp. 676.) A principal <em>Erie </em>purpose, like that of the conflict of laws, is to assure, so far as possible, that the result in a particular case is the same regardless of forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">It is clear that the aim of Puerto Bico\u2019s legislation is to substantially add to the rights of \u201c [a]ny individual sustaining damages and losses \u201d covered by the insurance policy under which suit is brought. While the Puerto Bican statute furnishes no concrete clue to legislative intention concerning its reach where a person is injured or insurance is contracted outside of Puerto Bico (cf. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Employers Liab. Corp., </em>348 U. S. 66, <em>supra). </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>its applicability to a case such as the present \u2014 involving an injury in Puerto Rico, occasioned by alleged wrongful conduct there committed, which is within the coverage of an insurance policy delivered in Puerto Rico by an insurer doing business there \u2014 cannot be doubted.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Moreover, the statute is so broadly drawn that, contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, it may not reasonably be read to cover only injuries to Puerto Rico\u2019s own citizens. Puerto Rico has a legitimate interest in, safeguarding the rights of any persons injured within its borders. Enactment of the statute emphasizes the Commonwealth\u2019s understanding that such injured persons might have to be cared for by it (or its inhabitants) and evidences its intention that certain and prompt compensation, from the tort-feasor\u2019s insurer, be available both to those injured and to those who care for them. What the Supreme Court wrote in <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Employers Liab. Corp. </em>(348 U. S. 66, <em>supra), </em>in upholding the constitutionality of Louisiana\u2019s direct action statute, is to the point (p. 72): \u201c Persons injured or killed in Louisiana are most likely to be Louisiana residents, and even if not, Louisiana may have to care for them. Serious injuries may require treatment in Louisiana homes or hospitals by Louisiana doctors. The injured may be destitute. They may be compelled to call upon friends, relatives or the public for help. Louisiana has manifested its natural interest in the injured by providing remedies for the recovery of damages. It has a similar interest in policies of insurance which are designed to assure ultimate payment of such damages.\u201d (See, also, Note, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 357, 379.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">It follows, therefore, that on the issue concerning the defendant\u2019s direct liability to the plaintiffs we should look to the law of Puerto Rico. As we have already seen, that is the place where the wrong and injury occurred, where the insurance policy was issued, where the insured tort-feasor was incorporated and where the insurer did business.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In short, Puerto Rico is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>jurisdiction which has the most significant relationship and contacts with respect to the matter in dispute and, accordingly, its law should be applied (see, e.g., <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>12 N Y 2d 473; <em>Auten </em>v. <em>Auten, </em>308 N. Y. 155; see, also, Restatement, Second, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 383b, Comment <em>c </em>[Tentative Draft No. 9, <em>1964])\u2014unless </em>there is some local public policy which prohibits our courts from assuming jurisdiction of the suit. (Cf. <em>Loucks </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>224 N. Y. 99.) And such is, in effect, the defendant\u2019s contention. It urges that it would be contrary to this State\u2019s public policy to enforce the statute in our courts. The argument is predicated on decisions holding that it is reversible error to disclose to the jury the fact that the alleged tort-feasor carries insurance (see <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Foundation Co., </em>201 N. Y. 479; <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>206 N. Y. 20; cf. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Yannotti, </em>4 N Y 2d 603), and it was on the strength of such cases that the Appellate Division concluded in <em>Morton </em>(1 A D 2d 116, 123-124, <em>supra) </em>that the Louisiana direct action statute violated New York\u2019s public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The argument misapprehends the import of those decisions. Our rule precluding disclosure of insurance has never been absolute. Reference to insurance is condemned only where the fact of its existence is irrelevant to the issues and where such reference is, in all likelihood, made for the purpose of improperly influencing the\" jury. (See <em>Leotta </em>v. <em>Plessinger, </em>8 N Y 2d 449, 461-462; <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>206 N. Y. 20, 23, <em>supra.) </em>Where, however, the fact of insurance or the existence of an insurer is properly or legitimately in the case, there can be no ground for complaint. (See, e.g., <em>Leotta </em>v. <em>Plessinger, </em>8 N Y 2d 449, <em>supra, Wood </em>v. <em>New York State Elec. &amp; Gas Corp., </em>281 N. Y. 797, affg. 257 App. Div. 172; <em>Di Tommaso </em>v. <em>Syracuse Univ., </em>218 N. Y. 640, affg. 172 App. Div. 34; <em>Rashall </em>v. <em>Morra, </em>250 App. Div. 474.) Likewise, where an insurer is sued for damages stemming from its own breach of contract or commission of a tort, the plaintiff is not denied a right to trial by jury simply because his adversary happens to be an insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Moreover, as has been aptly observed, it is the rare individual who today does not know that \u201c defendants in negligence cases are insured and that an insurance company and its lawyer are defending\u201d. <em>(Oltarsh </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>U. S. Dist. Ct., S. D. N. Y., Nov. 8, 1963, Murphy, J.; see, also, Lassiter, Direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Actions Against the Insurer, 1949 Insurance Law Journal 411, 416.) Indeed, such an awareness must have been considerably heightened by the advent of legislation requiring compulsory liability insurance for owners of motor vehicles in this State (Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 312).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Nor does any provision of our Insurance Law militate against enforcement of the Puerto Rican statute. Section 167 of the Insurance Law does, as the defendant asserts, reveal a pattern different from that embodied in Puerto Rico\u2019s direct action legislation but that is not sufficient basis for declining jurisdiction or refusing to apply the foreign provision. \u2018 \u2018 Public policy \u201d, we recently observed, \u201cis not determinable by mere reference to the laws of the forum alone \u201d. <em>(Intercontinental Hotels Corp. </em>v. <em>Golden, </em>15 N Y 2d 9, 14.) As Judge Cardozo expressed it in writing for the court in <em>Loucks </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>(224 N. Y. 99, 110-111, <em>supra), </em>\u201c Our own scheme of legislation may be different. We may even have no legislation on the subject. That is not enough to show that public policy forbids us to enforce the foreign right. * * * We are not so provincial as to say that every solution of a problem is wrong because we deal with it otherwise at home The absence of similar legislation does not prove that the foreign statute offends the local policy, and our courts should be made available for its enforcement unless to do so \u201c would violate some fundamental principle of justice, some prevalent conception of good morals, some deep-rooted tradition of the common weal \u201d. Quite obviously, there is no such violation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">It is only necessary to add \u2014 turning to the defendant\u2019s final point \u2014 that maintenance of the present action may not be defeated on the ground that Puerto Rico intended that its direct action statute be enforced solely by suits instituted in its own courts. Unlike the Louisiana statute with which we were concerned in the <em>Morton </em>case (4 N Y 2d 488, <em>supra), </em>the statute before us contains no built-in venue provision, no clause even remotely resembling the \u201c localizing \u201d provision in the Louisiana statute, or any other language which could possibly be read as a limitation restricting to the courts of Puerto Rico the direct actions it authorizes. The clause relied upon by the defendant \u2014 that no policy delivered in Puerto Rico covering a subject of insurance there located shall contain a recital \u201c [depriving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>courts of Puerto Rico of jurisdiction of action against the insurer \u201d (Laws of Puerto Rico, tit. 26, \u00a7 1119, subd. [1], par. [b])\u2014has for its sole purpose the protection of the insured. It provides an assurance that he will not be compelled, by any policy provision, to go outside of Puerto Bico in order to sue on his policy, and section 1119 may not be .read to require suit under the direct action statute to he brought only in the courts of Puerto Bico.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs in all courts, and the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Van Voorhis, Burke, Scileppi and Bergan concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Order reversed, with costs in all courts, and matter remitted to Special Term fox further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">. Section 2001 provides, in full, that</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u201c The insurer issuing a policy insuring any person against loss or damage through legal liability for the bodily injury, death, or damage to property of a third person, shall become absolutely liable whenever a loss covered by the policy occurs, and payment of such loss by the insurer to the extent of its liability therefor under the policy shall not depend upon payment by the insured of or upon any final judgment against him arising out of such occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">And subdivision (1) of section 2003 goes on to declare that</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">\u201c Any individual sustaining damages and losses shall have, at his option, a direct action against the insurer under the terms and limitations of the policy, which action he may exercise against the insurer only or against the insurer and the insured jointly. The liability of the insurer shall not exceed that provided for in the policy, and the court shall determine, not only the liability of the insurer, but also the amount of-the loss. Any action brought under this section shall be subject to the conditions of the policy or contract and to the defenses that may be pleaded by the insurer to the direct action instituted by the insured.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-10\"><em>. </em>Prior to instituting the present suit, the plaintiffs had brought one, based on an identical complaint, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. That action was dismissed, on the defendant\u2019s motion, since the Federal court, so it stated, was of the opinion that such a disposition was demanded by the Appellate Division\u2019s decision (1 A D 2d 116) in the <em>Morton </em>case: \u201cDespite our personal feelings and (lie forcefully logical argument presented by the plaintiffs \u201d, wrote the District Court Judge, \u201c we are duty bound to follow the New York Appellate Division until the New York Court of Appeals speaks otherwise.\u201d <em>(Oltarsh </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>U. S. Dist. Ct, S. D. N. Y., Nov. 8,1963, Murphy, J.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>2. (contd.) The Appellate Division in <em>Morton </em>(1 A D 2d 116) had dismissed the action on two grounds \u2014 first, that the Louisiana direct action statute there involved contained a venue provision which required that suits under it be brought exclusively in Louisiana, either in the parish where the accident or injury occurred or in the parish where the insured was domiciled (pp. 122-123), and, second, that such a direct action offended New York\u2019s public policy of keeping from the jury the fact of insurance (pp. 123-124). On appeal, this court, without passing on the public policy issue, affirmed the Appellate Division solely on the ground that there was a built-in venue provision and that the action had to be instituted in Louisiana (4 N Y 2d 488, 493).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\">. The usual and typical <em>\u201c </em>no action \u201d clause provides, in substance, that no action shall lie against the insurance company unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the insured shall have fully complied with the terms of the policy, nor until the amount of the insured\u2019s obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured, the claimant and the insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">. The circumstance that the defendant does business in this State, as well as in Puerto Rico, is, in the present context, a matter of relatively minor importance which does not involve a relevant New York interest. The contract under which the defendant is being sued arose out of business transacted in Puerto Rico and any liability to which it might be exposed thereunder is not likely to have a significant bearing on insurance rates which it imposes on residents of this State.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
