The esthetic interest of the structure is irrelevant. The park should not be used simply as a place to put up esthetic buildings. III.

Essentially commercial ventures are improper park uses. <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>217 App. Div. 624.) III. The location proposed for the sidewalk cafe makes it a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>mercial venture. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Hylan, </em>223 App. Div. 48; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>248 N.

The rule is settled <em>(Stahl Soap Corp. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>5 N Y 2d 200; <em>Kashel </em>v. <em>Impellitteri, </em>306 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>N. Y. 73, cert. den. 347 U. S. 934; <em>Kittinger </em>v. <em>Buffalo Traction Co., </em>160 N. Y. 377; <em>Altschul </em>v. <em>Ludwig, </em>216 N. Y. 459).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Judicial interference with local municipal decisions by public officers in a situation of this kind is justified only when \u201c a total lacle of power \u201d is shown, as this court observed in <em>Kaskel (supra, </em>p. 79).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">At the trial plaintiffs did not establish the illegality of the project. The Park Commissioner is vested by law with broad powers for the maintenance and improvement of the city\u2019s parks (New York City Charter, \u00a7 532). Among other things he is given the power to control and manage such property \u2018 \u2018 for the improvement \u2019 \u2019 of the park, or for the \u2018 \u2018 establishment \u2019 \u2019 of \u201cplaygrounds and other recreational properties\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">What plaintiffs did establish on the trial was a difference of opinion among some experts in park management and a divergence of view among others interested in a proper and appropriate utilization of Central Park about how the proposed pavilion would harmonize with the dominant purposes of this noted public recreational facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Some of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses were of opinion the proposed Hartford Pavilion would be quite inappropriate to Central Park, but other witnesses of stature and experience in the field, notably both Mr. Moses and Commissioner Morris, who were called by plaintiffs, expressed the view the installation of the pavilion was quite consistent with proper park management and would be a desirable improvement in the park\u2019s facilities. The court at Special Term on this state of the record granted judgment for the defendants and the Appellate Division affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">If restaurants and cafes were never put in public parks it might reasonably be suggested that a Park Commissioner who approved such a facility was neither improving the park nor servicing a lawful recreational purpose. But the proof is very clear that there are, and for many years have been, restaurant and related facilities in public parks, including Central Park, and they are commonly regarded as appropriate (see, e.g., the discussion in <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>217 App. Div. 624 [1926]).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Thus the case comes down to the choice of location and type of facility. Here what plaintiffs show is a dispute with public authorities about what is desirable for the park. This mere difference of opinion is not a demonstration of illegality. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Without showing the type and location of the restaurant to be unlawful, plaintiffs ought not to succeed in preventing public officers from exercising their best judgment in an area within their proper legal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The proof demonstrates adequate power in the Park Commissioner and the Board of Estimate to accept or reject this restaurant proposal. If that power in the appropriate city officers exists, and we, could entertain no doubt on this record that it does exist, the court\u2019s inquiry upon the complaint of a citizen who differs with the city reaches the end of its course.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Thus it is not necessary to consider the further argument of the city, which indeed seems reasonable enough, that on the basis of the testimony of some of the witnesses called by the plaintiffs the pavilion, which would provide access on both the 59th Street sidewalk level and, directly, on a lower level, from the park itself to a well-designed building with greatly improved landscaping, harmonious with park surroundings and offering an attractive view of a lake, trees and shrubbery, would replace a neglected and misused area of the park, most of which is on a steep slope, barren of grass and containing unsightly ventilators from the subway system.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The order should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Burke and Scileppi concur with Judge Bergan; Judges Fold and Van Voorhts dissent and vote to reverse the order appealed from and to direct judgment for the plaintiffs on the ground that the proposed restaurant \u2014 having in mind its location and purpose \u2014 would neither be \u201cancillary\u201d to Central Park nor serve a proper park purpose and that, accordingly, the defendants lack the power to do the acts complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
