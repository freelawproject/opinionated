The Statute of Frauds is irrelevant to a decision in this case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-7\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ\">On November 1, 1960 Savoy Record Company, a New Jersey corporation engaged in making phonograph records, signed two letters, addressed to <em>\" </em>Armon\u00eda E. Ritmo, Via Rimmassa 68, Genoa, Italy\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In their essential terms, the letters incorporated an understanding by which Savoy was to grant tp Armon\u00eda the exclusive right to manufacture and market its records in Italy for a period of two years and, in return, Armon\u00eda was to pay a royalty of $8,000 a year for the effective period of the agreement. Both of the letters, lengthy and profuse in detail \u2014 one fills 11 pages of the printed record and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the other more than 3\u2014contain a paragraph reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\">\u201c Yon [Armon\u00eda] represent and warrant that Cardinal Export Corp., New York, New York is authorized to sign this agreement on your behalf and Cardinal Export Corp., for One Dollar ($1.00) and other good and valuable consideration agrees by its signature to guarantee the payment of all moneys payable to Savoy Record Co., Inc. by you under this contract. If the foregoing meets with your approval, please so indicate your approval in the space provided below.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">After the \u00a3\u00a3 Very truly yours \u201d came the signature \u00a3\u00a3 Savoy Record Co., Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">By: /s/ Herman Lubinsky, Pres.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">And to the left, a space or two below and at the margin, there appeared:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">\" Accepted and Approved :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">Cardinal Export Corp., As Agent on Behalf of Armon\u00eda E. Ritmo By: /s/ Arthur Lerner \u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">Claiming that over $13,000 in unpaid royalties was owing to it under the agreement, Savoy, in August of 1962, commenced this action against Cardinal, alleging that the latter \u201c agreed to guarantee all payments due to Savoy \u201d under the contract. Cardinal moved, pursuant to subdivision 7 of rule 107 of the Rules of Civil Practice (now CPLR 3211, subd. [a], par. 5), to dismiss the complaint on the ground that \u201c the purported guarantee of payment * * * is unenforceable under the provisions of the statute of frauds \u201d. It was Cardinal\u2019s position that, since the agreement <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>was subscribed by [it] solely as agent and not on its own behalf\u201d, the requirement of the Statute of Frauds (Personal Property Law, \u00a7 31, subd. 2, now General Obligations Law, \u00a7 5-701, subd. 2) that a \"promise to answer for the debt * * * of another person\u201d be \u201csubscribed by the party to be charged \u201d had not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">The courts below rejected Cardinal\u2019s contention and denied its motion to dismiss the complaint. It was apparently their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>conclusion \u2014 to cull from Special Term\u2019s opinion \u2014 that it was \u2018 clear * * * that the agreement, prepared by Savoy, <em>was intended by it\u201d </em>to provide that Cardinal\u2019s signature as agent serve two purposes, namely, to indicate an acceptance and approval of the contract by Armon\u00eda and also to bind Cardinal, in its own corporate capacity, as guarantor of its principal\u2019s obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Any proper consideration of the question of Cardinal\u2019s responsibility under the agreement must proceed from the predicate, settled for this court in <em>Mencher </em>v. <em>Weiss </em>(306 N. Y. 1, 4), that an agent for a disclosed principal \u201c will not be personally bound unless there is clear and explicit evidence of the agent\u2019s intention to substitute or superadd his personal liability for, or to, that of his principal\u201d. (See, also, <em>Salzman Sign Co. </em>v. Beck, 10 N Y 2d 63, 66-67.) If such an intention can be ascribed to Cardinal at all, it must, by virtue of the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, be gathered from the language, set forth above, of Savoy\u2019s letters. The difficulty we encounter at the outset, in seeking \u2018 \u2018 clear and explicit evidence \u2019 \u2019 of the agent\u2019s intention to be personally bound, lies in the anomalous character of the writing upon which Cardinal\u2019s responsibility as a guarantor must depend. If liability is to be imposed, it must have been the intention of all the parties\u2014Armon\u00eda and Cardinal in addition to Savoy\u2014that the signature of Cardinal perform, at once, a threefold function: (a) to bind the principal (Armonia) to the agreement; (b) to support the very agency (of Cardinal) itself, since by a peculiar \u201c bootstrap \u201d device the principal is to \u201c represent and warrant \u201d the authority of the very agent whose signature is to bind it to the agreement; and (c) to bind the agent (Cardinal) as a guarantor of its principal\u2019s obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The writing states that Cardinal is to signify its agreement to be personally bound \u201cby its signature \u201d. It may well have been Savoy\u2019s intention, as Special Term noted, that Cardinal\u2019s act of signing once, solely as agent for Armon\u00eda, would likewise bind it as guarantor. However, in determining whether there has been compliance with the Statute of Frauds in such a. case, Savoy\u2019s intent or belief is beside the point. What is of crucial importance, as our recent decision in <em>Salzman Sign Co. </em>v. <em>Beck </em>(10 N Y 2d 63, <em>supra) </em>demonstrates, is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>intention of the agent, the party to be charged \u2014 in this case, Cardinal \u2014 to be personally bound. In this context, the writing must be viewed, as it relates to Cardinal, only as an <em>offer </em>to the agent to enter into a binding personal commitment as guarantor and the courts cannot, without more, convert a signature by Cardinal \u201c As Agent on Behalf of Armon\u00eda \u201d into a binding <em>acceptance </em>of such an offer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">On its facts, the present case is virtually indistinguishable from <em>Salzman </em>(10 N Y 2d 63, <em>supra), </em>and the rationale underlying that decision applies with equal force to compel a similar conclusion here. In the <em>Salmian </em>case, two corporations entered into an agreement for the sale of an advertising sign. The contract, containing a provision that (10 N Y 2d, at p. 65),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">\u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>Where the Purchaser is a corporation, in consideration of extending credit to it, the officer or officers signing on behalf of such corporation, hereby personally guarantee the payments hereinabove provided for \u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABbp\">was executed on behalf of the corporate purchaser by one of its officers who signed as \u201cIrving Beck pres \u201d. Upon default by the buyer, the corporate seller sought, in reliance upon the above statement, to hold Beck personally liable for the payments due under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The complaint was dismissed upon the defendant\u2019s motion and, in affirming that disposition, we held, in language too clear to be misunderstood, that the contract clause did not, in and of itself, constitute the \u2018 \u2018 clear and explicit evidence \u2019 \u2019 of intention required to subject an agent to personal liability for his principal\u2019s debt. Although the court observed that a \u201c plausible argument \u2019 \u2019 could be made that a corporate officer who signs his name to such a contract is presumed to have read and understood it, \u201c and so should be considered bound by its plain language \u2019 \u2019, we concluded that to allow recovery against the signing agent, simply on the strength of the clause above referred to, \u2018 \u2018 would thwart the purposes of the Statute of Frauds \u201d (10 N Y 2d, at p. 66). The \u201c better rule \u201d, the court declared, is that \u201c the statement in the contract purporting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>bind * * * individually \u2019 \u2019 the party signing in a representative capacity \u2018 \u2018 is not sufficient for Statute of Frauds purposes without some direct and explicit evidence of actual intent \u2019 \u2019 on his part to bo so bound (10 N Y 2d, at p. 67).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">There is in the case before us no such \u201c direct and explicit evidence \u2019 \u2019, surely no more evidence of intention on the part of the agent (Cardinal) to be bound than there was in the <em>Salsman </em>case. The evidence to be gleaned from the writing, if not all the other way, is at best highly equivocal and ambiguous. Not only did Cardinal sign solely \u201c As Agent \u201d but it underscored the limited nature of the signature by adding <em>\u201c </em>on Behalf of Armon\u00eda \u201d. The clause in the letters addressed to Armon\u00eda that its agent,' Cardinal, \u201c agrees by its signature \u201d to guarantee its principal\u2019s payments is not materially different from the language in the agreement in <em>Salsman </em>to the effect that the officer <em>\u201c </em>signing on behalf of such corporation \u201d guarantees the payments there involved. In point of fact, if a difference is to be discerned, it is that the words of the clause here under consideration generate greater uncertainty, as to the implications of the agent\u2019s signing solely on the principal\u2019s behalf, than did the corresponding clause in Salsman\u2014which, in the plainest of terms, sought to bind the officer <em>\u201c </em>signing on behalf of such corporation \u2019 \u2019. In any event, though, such a clause does not furnish the direct and explicit evidence demanded by the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">That the <em>Salzman </em>case (10 N Y 2d 63, <em>supra) </em>was concerned with an individual who signed as agent of a corporation while the present case involves a corporation signing on behalf of another company is, contrary to the contention urged upon us, a distinction without a difference. Our decision in <em>Salsman </em>but reflects the public policy which underlies the Statute of Frauds. Designed to safeguard against false claims of agreement, that statute is based upon the sound consideration of policy that, in a situation such as the present, an agent should be protected against the plausible claim, which might often be falsely asserted, that he engaged to insure his principal\u2019s performance. (See <em>Workman, Inc., </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>220 App. Div. 670, <em>671; </em>see, also, 3 Williston, Contracts [3d ed., 1960], \u00a7 448 <em>et seq.) </em>The obligation of a guarantor is, admittedly, a heavy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>one, and the courts should refrain from foisting such an obligation upon a party, be he individual or corporation, who simply signs as agent, absent the requisite clear and unequivocal evidence, to be gathered from the writing itself, that he intended to assume such a liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">The order appealed from should be reversed and the complaint against Cardinal dismissed, with costs in all courts. Question certified answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-8\">. \u201cArnionia E.

This is the clause from one of the letters; the clause in the other letter is identical in sense, although it omits the last sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b41-8\">. The present ease differs significantly from <em>Mencher </em>v. Weiss (306 N. <em>Y. </em>1, supra); in the latter case, the defendant affixed his signature not only in a representative capacity but individually by use of the term <em>\u201c </em>Member \u201d,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b43-5\">Bergan, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AR\">No public policy stands in the way of the assumption by an agent of a personal responsibility for the obligation of his principal. In deciding to accept the assumption of such an obligation, agents are. entirely free, to act. according to their own interests. The requirement of law is that there must be a clearly stated, and subscribed, written intention to assume the obligation (General Obligations Law, \u00a7 5-701). It is the formality of expression and the formality of subscription that are the subjects of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The test of an intention to assume the obligation is that it be \u201c clear and explicit\u201d. <em>(Mencher </em>v. <em>Weiss, </em>306 N. Y. 1, 4; <em>Salzman Sign Co. </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>10 N Y 2d 63, 67.) This depends on how the intention is made manifest. In <em>Mencher </em>it was held sufficiently expressed to bind personally the president of a corporation who had signed a labor contract \u2018 \u2018 Weiss &amp; Schwartz Fur Corp Member Harry Weiss Pres.\u201d, where it was agreed, as the court stated, that \u201c Weiss signed the agreement in a representative capacity and bound the corporation thereby \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">There was additional material in the body of the agreement to suggest an intention to assume personal as well as corporate liability, including a clause that the agreement \u201c shall apply to and bind the parties thereto, their respective members and, if an employer member is a corporation, the individual members thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">In <em>Salzman, </em>on the other hand, intent to bind personally a defendant who had signed only as a corporate officer was held not sufficiently expressed by \u201c a single sentence in a long contract \u201d (p. 67). One of the controlling criteria of decision in <em>Warren-Connolly Co. </em>v. <em>Saphin </em>(283 App. Div. 391), a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>cited with approval in <em>Salsman, </em>was that the corporate officer sought to be bound was not \u201c stated to be\u201d a party there to (p. 393).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The general test laid down in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Lauderdale </em>(46 N. Y. 70, 74) is that the agent\u2019s individual responsibility will not be imposed unless there be clear evidence of an intention to \u201c superadd \u201d his responsibility to that of his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">When the language of the agreement in hand is read closely, an intention to superadd Cardinal\u2019s responsibility to that of Armon\u00eda is perfectly clear and the words cannot be read in any other sense. It is not a casual or incidental expression, or one hidden in a bulky context, but a deliberately stated separate expression of the assumption of an obligation: \u201c and Cardinal Export Corp. for One Dollar ($1.00) and other good and valuable consideration agrees by its signature to guarantee the payment of all moneys \u201d, The same sentence deals with the authority of Cardinal \u2018 \u2018 to sign this agreement on your behalf \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">There is then in this same sentence an intentionally expressed dual purpose in the signature itself, for which the descriptive words \u201cas agent\u201d serve one expressed purpose, and the act of signing itself serves the other. These special conditions are entirely absent from the cases which go the other way; and there is here surely a subscription by the party to be charged as well as an explicit expression of intent. The words \u201c to sign \u201d and \u201c by its signature \u201d running together in the sentence dealing with two separate obligations should be read as meaning the , same act of signing to serve the two purposes. , This on its face satisfies the Statute of Frauds and it meets sufficiently enough the tests laid down in <em>Mencher, Salzman </em>and <em>Warren-Connolly (supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The order should be affirmed and the question answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Judges Van Voorhis, Burke and Scileppi concur with Judge Fund; Judge Bergan dissents in an opinion in which Chief Judge Desmond and Judge Dye concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
