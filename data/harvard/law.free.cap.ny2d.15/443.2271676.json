The language employed by the Legislature faithfully reflects its intention not to claim jurisdiction over foreign wrongful acts. <em>(Meltzer </em>v. <em>Koenigsberg, </em>302 N. Y. 523; <em>Department of Welfare of City of N. Y. </em>v. <em>Siebel, </em>6 N Y 2d 536; <em>Hess </em>v. <em>Pawloski, </em>274 U. S. 352; <em>Olberding </em>v. <em>Illinois Cent. R. R. Co., </em>346 U. S. 338.) II, Constitutional doubts and other objectionable results can only be avoided by construing the statute in accordance with its plain meaning. III. If the statute is construed in accordance with the legislative intent, only a nondomiciliary who has acted within the State can be held under the proviso here involved. IV. However the statute is construed, jurisdiction cannot constitutionally be asserted over a nondomicilary solely on the basis of consequences within New York.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b486-6\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6W\">In the three cases under review\u2014one sounding in contract and two in tort\u2014we are called upon to decide whether the courts of this State acquired personal jurisdiction, under our \u201c long-arm \u201d statute (CPLR 302), over foreign corporations not \u201c doing business \u201d here in the traditional sense. Since there are several questions of law common to all three cases, we discuss such questions generally, at the outset, before undertaking a more particularized consideration of the cases themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">It is exceedingly clear that common-law principles of jurisdiction were early imported into the jurisprudence of the several states and have since taken on constitutional character by virtue of Supreme Court rulings that the improper exercise of jurisdiction by state courts infringes due process guarantees. (See, e.g., <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>95 U. S. 714; <em>Riverside Mills </em>v. <em>Menefee, </em>237 U. S. 189.) The traditional foundation of judicial jurisdiction is physical power (see <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Mabee, </em>243 U. S, 90, 91), and in the case of foreign corporations, with which we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>here mainly concerned, unless they have voluntarily submitted to jurisdiction, such power is assertable solely on the basis of the activities of the corporations within the forum state.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The standard for assessing the irreducible minimum forum activities constitutionally requisite to subject foreign corporations and nonresident individuals to personal jurisdiction was reformulated in the cases of <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(326 U. S. 310) and <em>McGee </em>v. <em>International Life Ins. Co. </em>(355 U. S. 220). By those decisions, the Supreme Court opened a broad and previously unavailable \u2014 although still largely undefined\u2014area for state exercise of jurisdiction over such parties. In place of the former rigid tests of \u201c residence \u201d and \u201cdoing business \u201d, the Supreme Court, in <em>International Shoe, </em>substituted the flexible requirement that a nonresident defendant, against whom a judgment in personam is sought in the forum state, be shown merely to \u2018 \u2018 have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ' traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice \u2019 \u201d (326 U. S., at p. 316). And, in <em>McGee, </em>the court upheld the power of a state to subject a foreign corporation to suit in its courts on the basis simply of an isolated insurance contract \u201c which had substantial connection with that State \u201d (355 U. S., at p. 223).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">But this does not mean, the Supreme Court made clear in the later case of <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla </em>(357 U. S. 235), that all restrictions on a state court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over foreign corporations have come to an end. Restating its view that \u201cprogress in communications and transportation\u201d has occasioned a relaxation of \u201c the rigid rule in <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff </em>\u201d and an evolution to \u201c the flexible standard of <em>International Shoe </em>\u201d, the court went on to caution that \u201cit is a mistake to assume that this trend heralds the eventual demise of all restrictions on the personal jurisdiction of state courts \u201d (357 U. S., at p. 251). \u201c The unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant \u201d, the court concluded, \u201c cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State. * * * [I]t is essential in each ease that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws\u201d (357 U. S., at p. 253).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Taking advantage of the Supreme Court\u2019s broadening of the bases for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over nondomiciliaries, the Legislature of this State, in 1962, following a study and a recommendation by the New York Advisory Committee on Practice and Procedure,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> enacted CPLR 302. Modeled upon a provision of the Illinois Civil Practice Act (Ill. Stat. Ann., ch. 110, \u00a7 17 [Smith-Hurd, 1956]), section 302 discarded the concept of \u201cdoing business\u201d as the exclusive test of jurisdiction and provided, instead, insofar as here pertinent, that personal jurisdiction may be asserted over any nondomiciliary if, \u201c in person or through an agent\u201d, he \u201c transacts any business-within the state \u201d or \u201c commits a tortious act within the state,\u201d as long as the particular cause of action asserted is one \u201c arising from \u201d any of such acts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Whether, and to what extent, a statute is to be accorded retroactive application is normally a matter of ascertaining the legislative intent, subject to applicable constitutional limitations, and our decisions provide certain basic guidelines to that end. It is thus presumed, absent any contrary indication, that the Legislature intended \u201c [c]hanges in the form of remedies \u201d to be \u2018 \u2018 applicable to proceedings thereafter instituted for the redress of wrongs already done.\u201d <em>(Matter of Berkovitz </em>v. <em>Arbib &amp; Houlberg, </em>230 N. Y. 261, 270; see, also, <em>Simonson </em>v. <em>International Bank, </em>14 N Y 2d 281, 289, supra; <em>Coane </em>v. <em>American Distilling Co., </em>298 N. Y. 197, 204; <em>Preston Co. </em>v. <em>Funkhouser, </em>261 N. Y. 140, 145.) On the other hand, where the effect of the statute \u201cis to create a right of action \u2019 \u2019 which did not previously exist, it is presumed that the statute was intended to have only prospective application. (See <em>Jacobus </em>v. <em>Colgate, </em>217 N. Y. 235, 240-242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Section 302 is clearly of a procedural and remedial nature, and that, indeed, was the characterization applied by the Supreme Court to the somewhat similar provisions of the California statute before it in the <em>McGee </em>case (355 U. S. 220, <em>supra). </em>In upholding the retroactive application of that statute, the Supreme Court observed that such legislation is \u201c remedial, in the purest sense of that term, and neither enlarge[s] nor impair [s] * * * substantive rights or obligations \u201d, its effect being merely to provide the plaintiff with a new \u201c forum to enforce whatever substantive rights \u201d he might have against the defendant (355 U. S., at p. 224). And the Illinois Supreme Court reached a like conclusion with respect to the statute from which section 302 was derived, also sustaining its retroactive application to a suit instituted subsequent to its enactment but based on a cause of action which had previously accrued. (See <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>11 Ill. 2d 378, 382-383.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The statute involved in <em>Jacobus </em>v. <em>Colgate </em>(217 N. Y. 235, <em>supra), </em>upon which the appellants before us rely, was of a materially different character. That statute was held, in effect, to have created a new right of action\u2014to have supplied \u201c a remedy by which a right for the first time [became] enforceable \u201d (217 N. Y., at p. 242)\u2014by converting what was previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>ously an exclusively \u201clocal\u201d cause o\u00a3 action (for injuries to real property lying without the state) into one which was \u2022\u201c transitory \u201d (p. 241). As already noted, section 302, far from creating new rights, merely facilitates the enforcement locally of pre-existing rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the Legislature expressly declared that the CPLR <em>\u201c </em>shall apply to <em>all </em>actions hereafter commenced\u201d (CPLR 10003; emphasis supplied), thereby giving affirmative indication of its design to apply the statute to <em>all </em>suits instituted after its effective date, whether based on previously or subsequently accrued causes of action. (See 1 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, N. Y. Civ. Prac., par. 302.04, at p. 3-35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The retroactive application of provisions resembling section 302 has, as noted, been upheld as constitutionally valid (see, e.g., <em>McGee </em>v. <em>International Life Ins. Co., </em>355 U. S. 220, 224, <em>supra; Nelson </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>11 Ill. 2d 378, 382-383, supra; <em>Bluff Cr. Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>257 F. 2d 83, 85-86), and it is of significance that the Supreme Court, in a very recent decision <em>(United States </em>v. <em>First Nat. City Bank, </em>379 U. S. 378), apparently perceived no constitutional impediment to our construction giving retroactive effect to section 302, as indicated in <em>Simonson, </em>to the extent of applying it to a \u201c suit * * * instituted <em>after </em>the effective date of the statute \u2019 \u2019 upon the basis of \u2018 \u2018 transactions occurring <em>before </em>the effective date\u201d (379 U. S., at p. 382; italics in original). While we left open in <em>Simonson </em>the possibility that retroactive application of the statute \u201c in particular situations\u201d might give rise to constitutional questions (14 N Y 2d, at p. 288), no such exceptional situation is presented in any of the cases before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">We turn, then, to those specific cases. It is the position of each of the appellants that section 302 may not be interpreted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>apply to the particular facts involved and that, if it were to be so construed, the statute Avould violate due process limitations. One of the cases, <em>Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co. </em>v. <em>Barnes &amp; </em>Reinecke, is a suit for breach of contract and turns on paragraph 1 of subdivision (a) of section 302\u2014relating to a defendant\u2019s <em>\u201c </em>transact [ion of] any business Avithin the state\u201d. The other <em>two\u2014Feathers </em>v. <em>McLucas </em>and <em>Singer </em>v. Walker\u2014are founded on claims of negligence, as well as of breach of warranty, and were decided below on the basis of paragraph 2 of subdivision (a) of section 302 \u2014 involving a defendant\u2019s commission of \u201c a tortious act within the state \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The appellants in all three cases- before us, noting that the acts on which the causes of action asserted against them are grounded occurred prior to the effective date of the statute, September 1, 1963, advance the threshold contention that section 302 may not be applied retroactively to subject them to .the personal jurisdiction of the New York courts. We have already expressed a contrary view. In <em>Simonson </em>v. <em>International Bank </em>(14 N Y 2d 281, 290), we declared that \u201c CPLR 302 has retroactive effect to the extent of embracing suits instituted after its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>effective date but based on previously accrued causes of action \u201d, and no reason has been shown to cause us to alter our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>Longines-Wittnauer </em>v. <em>Barnes &amp; Reinecke</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The plaintiff Longines-Wittnauer, a New York corporation, seeks damages of some $476,000 for breach of warranty in the manufacture and sale of machines specially designed for it by the appellant Barnes &amp; Beinecke, a Delaware corporation having its place of business in Chicago, Illinois. The parties had carried on negotiations in 1962, the appellant in April and May of that year mailing its contract proposals for the machines to the plaintiff in New York and shortly thereafter sending key officers to this State to discuss the terms of the agreement. After further meetings in Chicago, a written contract in the form of a printed purchase order was executed in June 1962 by the appellant in Chicago, the purchase order itself reciting, however, that it was \u201c a contract made in the State of New York and governed by the laws thereof \u201d. Thereafter, officers and employees of the appellant, including its president, treasurer and engineers, twice came to the plaintiff\u2019s plant in Lynbrook on Long Island to discuss certain problems in connection with the performance of the contract. There were meetings in Chicago as well, and in March 1963 a supplemental agreement was executed by the plaintiff in New York after it had been signed by the appellant in Chicago. This agreement increased the price of the machines from $109,000 to $118,000 and provided, among other things, that their delivery did not constitute acceptance, it being specified that such acceptance would occur only after the machines had met certain tests following installation in New York. In. April 1963, a month after the supplemental agreement was executed, the appellant shipped the machines, f. o.b. Chicago, directed to the plaintiff\u2019s plant in Lynbrook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>and thereafter participated in the installation and testing of the machines; in fact, two of its engineers spent substantially all of their working days at the plaintiff\u2019s plant from April through June 1963 getting the machines ready for acceptance testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The plaintiff, following its acceptance of the machines, discovered certain alleged defects, on the strength of which this action was commenced in October 1963, pursuant to CPLR 302 and 313, by service of the summons and complaint on the appellant in Illinois. The latter challenged the court\u2019s jurisdiction over its person by a <em>motion to </em>dismiss the complaint (CPLR 3211, subd. [a], par. 8). The court at Special Term denied the motion, the Appellate Division, First Department, unanimously affirmed the resulting order and the appeal is before us by leave of the Appellate Division on a certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The appellant does not dispute that a single transaction in New York, out of which the cause of action has arisen, may satisfy the requirement of the transaction of business provision (CPLR 302, subd. [a], par. 1). The nub of its argument seems to be that, if the contract was not actually made in New York, its activities in this State preliminary and subsequent to the execution of the contract cannot be regarded as amounting to the transaction of \u201c business \u201d under the statute. We find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In enacting section 302, the Legislature chose not to fix precise guidelines, as other states have done, so as to draw within the jurisdictional reach of the New York courts <em>only </em>contracts \u201cmade within this State \u201d (Md. Ann. Code, art. 23, \u00a7 92, subd. [d]) or contracts \u201cmade in this State or to be performed in this State\u201d (N. C. Gen. Stat., \u00a7 55-145, subd. [a], par. [1]) or contracts \u201cto be performed in whole or in part by either party in [this State] \u201d (Minn. Stat. Ann., \u00a7 303.13, subd. 1, par. [3]; Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. [Vernon], art. 2031b, \u00a7 4; Vt. Stat. Ann., tit. 12, \u00a7 855). The Advisory Committee which drafted the section took cognizance of such statutes in its report (N. Y. Advisory Comm. Rep. [N. Y. Legis. Doc., 1958, No. 13], pp. 39-40) and decided, instead, to follow the broad, inclusive language of the Illinois provision, adopting as the criterion the \u201c transact [ion of] <em>any </em>business within the state \u201d. The design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>of the legislation, as expressed by the committee, was to take advantage of the \u201cnew [jurisdictional] enclave \u201d <em>(Bomze </em>v. <em>Nardis Sportswear, </em>165 F. 2d 33, 36, per L. Hand, J.) opened up by <em>International Shoe </em>where the nonresident defendant has engaged in some purposeful activity in this State in connection with the matter in suit. (See N. Y. Advisory Comm. Rep. [N. Y. Legis. Doc., 1958, No. 13], pp. 39-40; see, also, 1 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, N. Y. Civ. Prac., par. 302.06.) Therefore, even though the last act marking the formal execution of the contract may not have occurred within New York, the statutory test may be satisfied by a showing of other purposeful acts performed by the appellant in this State in relation to the contract, albeit preliminary or subsequent to its execution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The activities in which the appellant engaged in this State were assuredly adequate to meet the liberal statutory criterion. They comprised substantial preliminary negotiations through high-level personnel during a period of some two months; the actual execution of a supplementary contract; the shipment for use here, subject to acceptance following delivery, of two specially designed machines, priced at the not inconsiderable sum of $118,000; and the rendition of services over a period of some three months by two of the appellant\u2019s top engineers in supervising the installation and testing of the complex machines.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>We need not determine whether any one of the foregoing activities would, in and of itself, suffice to meet the statutory standard; in combination they more than meet that standard. And merely to list the activities in which the appellant engaged-in this State answers any constitutional objection which might be raised against requiring the appellant to make its defense in bur courts. Not only did the contract upon which the suit is based have \u201c substantial connection \u201d with New York <em>(McGee </em>v. <em>International Ins. Co., </em>355 U. S. 220, 223, <em>supra) </em>but the appellant\u2019s <em>\" </em>contacts \u201d with this State were such <em>\u201c </em>that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018 traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\u2019\u201d. <em>(International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U. S. 310, 316, <em>supra.) Nor </em>may it be said that the limits indicated by <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla </em>(357 U. S. 235, <em>supra) </em>have been exceeded, for it is clear, to cull from the court\u2019s opinion in that case (p. 253), that the appellant \u201c purposefully avail [ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within * * * [this] State \u201d and thereby <em>\u201c </em>involved] the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">It follows that the courts below were fully justified in sustaining jurisdiction over the appellant Barnes &amp; Reineclce.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\"><em>Feathers </em>v. <em>McLucas</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Mr. and Mrs. Feathers, the plaintiffs in this case, brought suit to recover for serious personal injuries and property damage sustained in July 1962 as a result of an explosion on a public highway near <em>their home </em>in Berlin, New York, of a tractor-drawn steel tank, en route from Pennsylvania to Vermont, which contained highly flammable liquefied propane gas. The tank had been manufactured in Kansas in 1957 by the appellant, The Darby Products of Steel Plate Corporation (sued as The Darby Corporation), a Kansas company, under a contract with the Butler Manufacturing Co., a Missouri corporation, presumably with knowledge that the latter would mount the tank on a wheelbase and then sell it to E. Brooke Matlack, a Pennsylvania corporation, which operated as a licensed interstate carrier in Pennsylvania and several other states, including New York. All three companies were named among the defendants sued, the complaint charging Darby with negligence and breach of warranty in the manufacture of the tank.</p>\n<p id=\"AkRN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Served with a suinmojis and complaint in Kansas, pursuant to CPLR 302 and 313, the appellant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction of its person (CPLR 3211, subd. [a], par. 8), pointing out that all its business was carried on from its plant and offices in Kansas City, Kansas, and that it never had any agents, representatives, offices or other facilities in this State and never transacted or solicited any business here. The motion was granted at Special Term but its order was reversed by the Appellate Division, Third Department, which granted leave to appeal to this court on a certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">There being no showing\u2014indeed, not even a claim\u2014that the appellant transacted any business in this State, within the purview of paragraph 1 of subdivision (a) of CPLR 302, the case necessarily turns on the construction to be accorded paragraph 2. More particularly, we must ascertain whether the facts of the case satisfy the standard of paragraph 2 that the defendant be shown to have \u201c commit [ted] a tortious act within the state \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The tortious act charged against the appellant \u2014 that it improperly designed and assembled the tank\u2014indisputably occurred in the out-of-state manufacturing process in Kansas. Nevertheless, the Appellate Division sustained jurisdiction on the strength of the resulting injury in this State, theorizing that \u2018 \u2018 the Legislature did not intend to separate foreign wrongful acts from resulting forum consequences \u201d, and it went on to say\u2014directing its attention to the requirements of Federal due process \u2014 that section 302 \u201cmerely codified the minimum contacts test \u201d laid down by the Supreme Court decisions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">However, the question presented is not \u2014 as the Appellate Division intimated it was by its reference to \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>minimum contacts\u201d'\u2014whether the Legislature <em>could </em>constitutionally have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>enacted legislation expanding the jurisdiction of our courts to the extent determined by the Appellate Division or whether, indeed, the Legislature <em>should </em>have done so in light of the pertinent policy considerations affecting the contending interests of local plaintiffs and foreign manufacturers but whether the Legislature <em>did, </em>in fact, do so. In short, in both this case and <em>Singer </em>v. <em>Walker (infra, </em>p. 464 <em>et seq.), </em>our task is simply to determine the import and scope of the jurisdictional provision which the Legislature actually enacted. As bearing on this, it cannot be made too clear that we are concerned solely with the problem of the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the person of a nonresident defendant and not with the question of his ultimate liability to a particular plaintiff; that issue is to be considered only after it is decided, on the basis of section 302, that the defendant is subject to the in personam jurisdiction of our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The language of paragraph 2 \u2014 conferring personal jurisdiction over a nondomiciliary \u201c if, in person or through an agent, he * * * commits a tortious act <em>within </em>the state\u201d \u2014 is too plain and precise to permit it to be read, as has the Appellate Division, as if it were synonymous with \u2018 \u2018 commits a tortious act <em>tvithout </em>the state which causes injury within the state.\u201d The mere occurrence of the injury in this State certainly cannot serve to transmute an out-of-state tortious act into one committed here within the sense of the statutory wording. (See <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., </em>258 Minn. 571, 579-580; <em>Rufo </em>v. <em>Bastian-Blessing Co., </em>405 Pa. 12, 20; <em>Hellriegel </em>v. <em>Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>157 F. Supp. 718, 720-721.) Any possible doubt on this score is dispelled by the fact that the draftsmen of section 302 pointedly announced that their purpose was to confer on the court <em>\u201c </em>personal jurisdiction over a non-domiciliary <em>whose act in the state </em>gives rise to a cause of action \u201d or, stated somewhat differently, \u2018 to subject non-residents to personal jurisdiction <em>when they commit acts within the state\u201d. </em>(See N. Y. Advisory Comm. Rep. [N. Y. Legis. Doc., 1958, No. 13], pp. 37, 39; emphasis supplied.) Having in mind the plain language of the statute and the expressed design of those who drafted it, we deem unreasonable the interpretation urged upon us by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>It is not inappropriate to note that for some years prior to the enactment of CPLR 302 much attention had been given to the subject of state exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident manufacturer charged with tortious activities in the manufacture of a product in another state which caused injury in the forum where the product was eventually marketed and sold<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that legislation expressly conferring jurisdiction on that basis had been enacted in a number of states.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If, in fact, the Legislature of this State had intended to confer jurisdiction on the strength of injurious forum consequences alone, without regard to the locus of the commission of the tortious act itself, it would presumably have used language appropriate to reflect such a design. Thus, it could have made explicit provision for such situations as some states have done,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or as proposed by the New York Law Revision Commission <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or by the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>sioncrs on Uniform State Laws in their model'act,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or it might have followed the lead of other states Avhi'ch require only that the \u201c tort \u201d be shown to have been committed within the state \u201cin whole or in part\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In sharp contrast, the Legislature chose to adopt language which, in so many words, demands that the \u201ctortious act\u201d be one committed by the defendant, \u201cin person or through an agent,\u201d <em>within </em>this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Our attention is directed to the broad interpretation accorded in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>American Radiator &amp; Sanitary Corp. </em>(22 Ill. 2d 432) to the similarly worded provision of the Illinois statute \u2014 relating to the commission of a tortious act within the state \u2014 on which paragraph 2 of subdivision (a) of section 302 was modeled. Although our analysis of New York\u2019s statute and its legislative history demonstrates that reliance on the <em>Gray </em>case is misplaced, we deem it desirable to examine its underlying rationale in view of the emphasis given the decision by the appellants in this case and in <em>Singer </em>v. <em>Walker (infra, </em>p. 464 <em>et seq.). </em>In <em>Gray, </em>an Illinois resident, injured in that state as a result of an explosion of a water heater which had, in the court\u2019s words, found its way into Illinois \u201c in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>commerce \u201d (22 Ill. 2d, at p. 438), brought suit against an Ohio corporation which had (it was alleged) negligently manufactured in Ohio a safety valve later incorporated into the heater. The heater itself had been assembled in Pennsylvania by a Pennsylvania corporation which had purchased the valve from the Ohio manufacturer. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention that it had not committed \u201c a tortious act \u201d in Illinois, the court invoked the traditional choice uMaw rule that \u201cthe place of a wrong is where the last event takes place which is necessary to render the actor liable \u201d (p. 435) and concluded that, since the \u201c last event \u201d, that is, the injury, had occurred in Illinois, \u201c the 'tort was committed in Illinois \u201d for purposes of the jurisdictional statute (p. 436).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">We find this argument unconvincing.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It certainly does not follow that, if the \u201cplace of wrong\u201d for purposes of conflict of laws is a particular state, the \u201c place of the commission of a tortious act \u201d is also that same state for purposes of interpreting a statute conferring jurisdiction, on that basis, over nonresidents. (See, e.g., <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>357 U. S. 235, 253-254, <em>supra; O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Comstock Foods, </em>123 Vt. 461, 465.) Not oiily are these separate and distinct problems but the rules formulated to govern their resolution embody different concepts expressed in different language. Moreover, the place of the \u201c tort \u201d is not necessarily the same as the place of the defendant\u2019s commission of the \u201ctortious act\u201d. In our view, then, the interpretation accorded the statute by the Illinois court disregards its plain language and exceeds the bounds of sound statutory construction. (See <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Boeing Airplane Co., </em>199 F. Supp. 908, 909; <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., </em>258 Minn. 571, 579-580, <em>supra; Rufo </em>v. <em>Bastian-Blessing Co., </em>405 Pa. 12, 20, <em>supra; </em>see, also, Reese &amp; Galston, Doing an Act or Causing Consequences as Bases of Judicial Jurisdiction, 44 Iowa L. Rev. 249, 266-267; Stimson, Omnibus Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Designed to Secure Jurisdiction Over Out-of-State Defendants, 48 Amer. Bar Assn. J. 725, 727; Thornton, First Judicial Interpretations of the New York Single Act Statute, 30 Brooklyn L. Rev. 285, 291-292; Note, 50 Georgetown L. J. 310.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Beading the New York statute, as we do, to require \u00e1 showing that the nondomiciliary committed a tortious act in this State, we need not pass upon the constitutional question raised by the appellant or consider whether the due process requirement of \u201c minimum contacts \u201d with the forum state would be satisfied \"by evidence that the injury occurred here and that the appellant presumably knew that its product (the tank) might ultimately reach New York in the course of its use by an interstate carrier or trucker. (See, e.g., <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, 357 </em>U. S. 235, 253, <em>supra; Dooly </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>326 F. 2d 941; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Comstock Foods, </em>123 Vt. 461, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In sum, then, it is our conclusion, based not only on the plain language of the statute but on its legislative history, that paragraph 2 of subdivision (a) of section 302 covers only a tortious act committed (by a nondomiciliary) in this State. Any plea for further expansion of its scope, however desirable such expansion may seem, is a matter for the Legislature rather than the courts. It follows, therefore, that, since the tortious act charged-against the appellant Darby was committed, if at all, in Kansas and since, concededly, that company transacted no business whatsoever in New York, no basis exists in the present case for subjecting it to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\"><em>Singer </em>v. <em>Walker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The complaint alleges that in April of 1960 Michael Singer, then 10 years old and a resident of this State, was seriously injured when a geologist\u2019s hammer which he was using in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Connecticut broke and a chip penetrated his right eye. The hammer, it is further recited, was manufactured by the appellant Estwing Manufacturing Co., an Illinois corporation not doing business in this State. Bearing a label, <em>\u201c </em>Unbreakable Tools Estwing Mtg. Co.\u201d, the hammer was shipped by the appellant, f. o. b. Illinois, to the defendant Walker, a dealer in geological supplies in New York City. Michael\u2019s aunt purchased the hammer from Walker and gave it to the child a month or two before the accident, which, as stated, occurred in Connecticut when the hammer fragmented while the youngster, on a field trip with his father, was using it to break and split rock.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Service of process on the appellant in an action brought in this State prior to the enactment of section 302 was set aside on the ground that it was not <em>\u201c </em>doing business \u201d in New York under the jurisdictional standards then applied by our courts. (Cf. <em>Simonson </em>v. <em>International Bank, </em>14 N Y 2d 281, <em>supra.) </em>The present action was brought, after the effective date of section 302, by service of the summons and complaint on Estwing in Illinois (CPLR 313). Its motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court had not acquired personal jurisdiction (CPLR 3211, subd. [a], par. 8) was granted at Special Term \u201c [s]ince the tortious act complained of did not take place in this state or arise * * * [from] any transaction of business by defendant in this state \u201d. The Appellate Division, First Department, taking a different view, reversed <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>on the law \u2019 \u2019 and denied the motion, holding that the cause of action was one arising from the commission of a tortious act in the State under paragraph 2 of subdivision (a) of section 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Our detailed analysis of that provision in <em>Feathers </em>v. <em>McLucas (supra, </em>pp. 458-464) and of paragraph 1 in <em>Longines-Wittnauer </em>v. <em>Barnes &amp; Reinecke (supra, </em>pp. 455-458) permits us to be brief in treating this third case. And we note again that we deal with the case in the light of the statutory provision as it actually reads and not as it could, perhaps, have been written.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Manifestly, the tortious acts attributed to the appellant in the manufacture and labeling of the hammer occurred at the place of manufacture in Illinois and, as in <em>Feathers, </em>are wholly insufficient to satisfy the requirement of paragraph 2 that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u201c tortious act \u201d be one committed \u201c within \u201d this State.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Appellate Division, nevertheless, sustained jurisdiction on the theory that Estwing\u2019s \u201ccirculation \u201d in New York of a hammer mislabeled as unbreakable \u2014 thereby creating, as that court put it, a continuing condition of hazard wherever the article was sold \u2014 itself constituted the commission of a tortious act here. We cannot accept this reasoning. The mere fact that a product defectively manufactured and misleadingly labeled in one state is marketed and sold in another cannot serve to change the place where the original tortious acts were committed or to create a new tortious act: The tortious conduct charged to the appellant consists solely of its acts in manufacturing an assertedly defective hammer and in attaching to it a false label, both of which unquestionably took place in Illinois. Accordingly, as the tidal judge correctly concluded, jurisdiction cannot be sustained under paragraph 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">However, the question remains whether jurisdiction may be upheld under paragraph 1 on the ground that the appellant \u201c transact[ed] * * * business within the state \u201d and that the pleaded cause of action is one <em>\" </em>arising \u2019 \u2019 therefrom. It is clear that paragraph 1 is not limited to actions in contract; it applies as well to actions in tort when supported by a sufficient showing of facts. (See N. Y. Advisory Comm. Rep. [N. Y. Legis.

The Appellate Division, in view of its conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>predicatod on paragraph <em>2, </em>apparently found it unnecessary to consider the applicability of paragraph 1. But in its opinion the court did call attention to facts which demonstrated that the appellant transacted business here and which, in its view, provided the requisite nexus with this State demanded by due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">We hold that the appellant\u2019s activities in this State are sufficient to satisfy the statutory criterion of transaction of business as well as the constitutional requirement of \u201c minimum contacts \u201d. (See <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U. S. 310, 319-320, <em>supra; McGee </em>v. <em>International Ins. Co., </em>355 U. S. 220, 223, <em>supra.) </em>For the reasons we gave in rejecting a similar contention in the <em>Longines-Wittnauer </em>case <em>(supra, </em>pp. 456, 458), we do not deem it determinative, as urged by the appellant, that the formal execution of its sales contracts may have occurred in Illinois rather than New York. Nor is it a controlling consideration that the actual injury happened to take place in Connecticut, since the cause of action asserted is clearly one \u201carising from\u201d the purposeful activities engaged In by the appellant in this State in connection with the sale of its products in the New York market.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In sum, then, the Appellate Division was in error in holding paragraph 2 applicable; nevertheless, on the strength of paragraph 1, we affirm its order sustaining jurisdiction over the appellant. <em>/ </em>.......</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">1.

It has been held that such a statute\u2014based on the commission within the state of the <em>\u201ctort </em>in whole or in part\u201d\u2014is distinguishable from a statute, such as paragraph 2 of subdivision (a) of section 302, which requires the commission of the <em>\u201ctortious act\u201d </em>within the state, and, unlike the latter legislation, is sufficiently broad to confer jurisdiction in a case involving an out-of-state tortious act which results in injurious consequences within the forum state.

(See <em>Hellriegel </em>v. <em>Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>157 F. Supp. 718, 720-721, <em>supra; Trippe Mfg.

If, as was thus assumed, there were substantial sales of the defendant\u2019s product within the State of Illinois, that factor might have served to support a finding that jurisdiction existed on the basis of the \u201c transaction of business\u201d provision <em>(infra, </em>pp. 466-467) but it has no relevance on whether the defendant committed a tortious act within the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\">.

As we have already made clear in our discussion of the <em>Feathers </em>case <em>(supra, </em>pp. 459-460), we are concerned on these appeals only with, the question of the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the defendant and not at all with the issue of its liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b503-9\">Van Voorhis, J. (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"AXfD\">I concur in Judge Fuld\u2019s opinion in <em>Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co. </em>v. <em>Barnes &amp; Reinecke </em>and in the result in the other two cases. In <em>Feathers </em>v. <em>McLucas, </em>I agree that CPLR 302 is not broad enough to confer jurisdiction under the facts of that case, but I also consider it to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>probable that, in adopting that section, the <em>New </em>York State Legislature expanded our jurisdiction over nonresidents near to the limit permitted by the due process clause. In <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla </em>(357 U. S. 235) the Supreme Court indicated that all United States constitutional restrictions on the personal jurisdiction of state courts have not been removed. Each state is likely to go as far as the Constitution permits in assuming jurisdiction over nonresidents, and it is appropriate that they should be restrained in doing so by some modern Federal rule of constitutional interpretation analogous to but in substitution for that of <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff </em>(95 U. S. 714). That time-honored decision held the balance between the states for a long time. It has now been superseded by <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(326 U. S. 310) and <em>McGee </em>v. <em>International Life Ins. Co. </em>(355 U. S. 220.) but, as pointed out in Judge Fuld\u2019s opinion, those cases still have left largely undefined the constitutional area for state exercise of jurisdiction over nonresidents. It is desirable that , this constitutional area become defined, as it probablyXwill be by individual cases in course of time. I am fortified iiji my view that the court is correct in its interpretation of CPLR 302 in <em>Feathers </em>v. <em>McLucas </em>by the circumstance that a broader interpretation would be likely to conflict with the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">In <em>Singer v. Walker, </em>the liability of the defendant, if any, is - likely to depend upon the extent to which the courts of our State adopt the principles of the new legal doctrine known as products liability. Liability under that doctrine depends upon whether the manufacturer\\of this geologist\u2019s hammer can be subjected to damages for introducing this appliance with or without fault into the stream of commerce, with the reasonable anticipation that it would be resold in New York State <em>(MacPherson </em>v. <em>Buick Motor Co., </em>217 N. Y. 382; see, also, Gillam, Products Liability in a Nutshell, 37 Ore. L. Rev. 119, 153; Prosser, The Assault Upon the Citadel [Strict Liability to the Consumer], 69 Yale L.

L. Q. 354; Reed, Products Liability and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the Privity Rule, Circa 1964, 7 So. Tex. L. J. 118, 119; <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kollsman Instrument Corp., </em>12 N Y 2d 432; <em>Randy Knitwear </em>v. <em>American Cyanamid Co., </em>11 N Y 2d 5, per Fuld, J.). Such proposed extensions of <em>MacPherson </em>v. <em>Buick Motor Co. </em>(217 N. Y. 382, <em>supra) </em>and of the food implied warranty cases (cf. <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Mohican Co., </em>225 N. Y. 70; <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Progressive Grocery Stores, </em>255 N. Y. 388; <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Lorenz, </em>9 N Y 2d 195) pertain to one of the modern battlefields of the law. Neither courts nor textwriters are certain whether these theories of liability sound chiefly in contract or in tort. The extent of such liability, if it goes beyond negligence <em>(MacPherson </em>v. <em>Buick Motor Co., supra) </em>or express warranty (see concurring opinion per Froessel, J., in <em>Randy Knitwear </em>v. <em>American Cyanamid Co., </em>11 N Y 2d 5, 16, <em>supra) </em>remains to be determined by the facts of particular cases yet to arise, under the familiar process of inclusion and exclusion. The present case <em>(Singer </em>v. <em>Walker) </em>may become one of such decisions, but the court cannot determine the question of liability\u2014and does not purport to do so at this stage of the litigation \u2014 unless jurisdiction be obtained. I subscribe to the view that in order to ascertain whether the New York courts have jurisdiction it is not necessary to determine the existence or theory of liability under these circumstances in advance of trial. Unless jurisdiction is upheld, the question of liability cannot be decided. I think that, without prejudice to the determination of questions of liability at the trial, enough has been shown to indicate the existence of a substantial controversy which, if resolved in plaintiff\u2019s favor on the facts and the law, would warrant the assumption of jurisdiction under CPLR 302 (subd. [a], par. 1). The analogy is pertinent that in cases where jurisdiction is obtained by attachment, the affidavits to procure which must show \u201c that there is a cause of action \u201d (CPLR 6212, subd. [a]), the power \u201cto grant an attachment does not depend upon predetermination of the merits of the action or plaintiff\u2019s prospects of success therein \u201d (10 Carmody-Wait, New York Practice, p. 116). Although evidentiary facts must be shown, it has been said by this court that \u2018\u2018 The jurisdiction to grant an attachment does not, we think, involve a preliminary determination by the officer to whom application for the writ is made, whether in law the case presented by the complaint will entitle the plaintiff to the relief ho asks \u201d <em>(Van Camp </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>Searle, </em>147 N. Y. 150, 161). \u201c It is enough that as to a major portion of their claim wo cannot say as matter of law on this record that the plaintiffs must ultimately be defeated (see <em>American Reserve Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>China Ins. Co., </em>297 N. Y. 322, 325).\u201d <em>(Plesch </em>v. <em>Banque Nationale de le Republic d\u2019Haiti, </em>298 N. Y. 573, 575.) Since products or some related form of liability (if established) would mean that the infant plaintiff\u2019s injuries arose out of the particular business transaction engaged in by the nonresident manufacturer in the purposeful circulation of this hammer in the stream of commerce in New York State, enough has been shown prima facie to warrant upholding jurisdiction to try this issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b506-5\">Chief Judge Desmond (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"AHY\">In <em>Singer </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>I concur for affirmance but I emphatically disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that these papers do not charge the commission by defendant of a tortious act within this State. To my eye the record plainly establishes not one but both bases of jurisdiction described in CPLR 302, that is, that defendant transacted business within this State within the meaning of paragraph 1 of subdivision (a), and also that he committed a tortious act within this State under paragraph 2 of subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The damage being done by this decision is not to the plaintiff and his cause but to the second part of section 302 (subd. [a], par. 2: <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>commits a tortious act within the state\u201d) which is being given a restrictive meaning not required or justified, contrary to the plain language of the statute itself and its evident purpose and to the relevant decisions in this court and in courts of other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The statutory language (302, subd. [a], par. 2), <em>\u201c </em>commits a tortious act within the state \u2019 \u2019, is taken verbatim from Illinois law (Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 110, \u00a7 17). It has the same meaning as the phrases <em>\u201c </em>tortious conduct \u201d in the Connecticut and North Carolina statutes (Conn. Gen. Stat. Rev., \u00a7 33-411, subd, [c] [1959]; N. C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-145, subd. [a], par. [4] [1955]) and <em>\u201c </em>part of a tort \u201d in the Minnesota, Texas, Vermont and West Virginia laws (Minn. Stat. Ann., \u00a7 303.13, subd. 1, par. [3] [1964 Supp.]; Tex. Civ. Stat., art. 2031b, \u00a7 4 [1959]; Vt. Stat. Ann., tit. 12, \u00a7 855; W. Va. Code Ann. [1961], \u00a7 3083). All reflect the idea that various separate acts or omissions may. together make out a tort. For instance, the totality of an actionable tort such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>is charged here (involving manufacturer\u2019s products liability) consists of three elements: defective manufacture, distribution to purchaser, and a resulting injury. Each of these is a <em>\u201c </em>tortious act \u201d or, in other words, a \u201c part of a tort \u201d. This complaint charges both negligence and breach of warranty. How it can be, factually or conceptually, that Estwing committed no \u2018 \u2018 tortious act \u2019 \u2019 in this State when, directly and without intervening vendors or distributors, it sent the mislabeled and defective hammer into New York for sale is beyond my understanding. True, the whole tort was not committed here since the manufacture and the origin of the shipment were in Illinois and the resulting physical injury was in Connecticut, hut a tortious act in New York is nevertheless spelled out plainly in these papers. Such is the holding in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>American Radiator &amp; Sanitary Corp. </em>(22 Ill. 2d 432 [1961]) construing the Illinois statute whose language was copied directly into our section 302 (subd. [a], par. 2). Singer\u2019s is a much stronger case than <em>Gray </em>for the application of such a long-arm statute since the defendant manufacturer in <em>Gray </em>did not directly send its product into Illinois at all. The <em>Gray </em>rationale is simply this: when a manufacturer purposefully sends its product into the forum state or when his conduct of his business is such that he contemplates the delivery of his product in a forum state he is guilty of a tortious act in the forum state if the product is defective in such manner that the manufacturer is liable in tort. Such an interpretation of the statute is entirely fair and reasonable, well suited to today\u2019s ways.-of doing business and surely not outside the constitutional permissions explained in <em>McGee </em>v. <em>International Life Ins. Co. </em>(355 U. S. 220) and <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla </em>(357 U. S. 235). When our Legislature adopted the language of the Illinois Legislature it presumably adopted with it the construction given the statutory language by the Illinois courts in <em>Gray (Shapiro </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 335 U. S. 1, 16-20; <em>Hoffer Bros. </em>v. Smith, 148 Va. 220, 227).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">For background and illumination of the phrase \u201c commits a tortious act within the state \u201d let us look at New York decisions before section 302 was adopted. The idea that sending into the market, by a manufacturer, a dangerous product or one carelessly labeled is a tortious act and part of an actionable tort goes way back in this State\u2019s decisions to <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Winchester </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>(6 N. Y. 397) and has gradually been broadened to cover articles which are not inherently dangerous but because of their defects are dangerous when put to an intended use <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Peerless Glass Co., </em>259 N. Y. 292; <em>Genesee County Patrons Fire Relief Assn. </em>v. <em>Sonneborn Sons, </em>263 N. Y. 463; <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Westinghouse X-Ray Co., </em>288 N. Y. 486; <em>Noone </em>v. <em>Perlberg, Inc., </em>294 N. Y. 680; <em>Markel </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>5 N Y 2d 958; and see the nonprivity warranty cases such as <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Lorenz, </em>9 N Y 2d 195). This appeal, therefore, presents the simple and single question: Was that tortious act <em>\u201c </em>committed \u201d in New York State! Sending the hammer here into our State was, if the complaint\u2019s allegations be trae, tortious. That the act was committed here is a physical fact, and the words of our statute refer to actualities, not \u2018 \u2018 some esoteric concept derived from subtle and theoretic analysis \u201d (to borrow some phraseology from <em>Old Colony R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>284 U. S. 552, 561).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The cases from other states with- statutes similar to ours apply the meaning and application we are suggesting to the \u201c tortious act \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>tort in whole or in part \u201d language <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>American Radiator &amp; Sanitary Corp., </em>22 Ill. 2d 432, supra; <em>Deveny </em>v. <em>Rheem Mfg. Co., </em>319 F. 2d 124; <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Twin State Improvement Corp., </em>116 Vt. 569; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Comstock Foods, </em>123 Vt. 461; <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., </em>258 Minn. 571; <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Triangle Pubs., </em>245 N. C. 432). <em>Rufo </em>v. <em>Bastian-Blessing Co. </em>(405 Pa. 12) might seem to be more restrictive but on analysis the case turns out to be one like <em>Feathers </em>v. <em>McLucas </em>in which our court is today holding that the statute does not reach far enough to include it. I find nothing to the contrary in any of the decisions cited by appellant here, nor anything in any of our legislative material including the reports-of the Advisory Committee, to suggest that it was not the New York Legislature\u2019s intent to apply section 302 (subd. [a], par. 2) to a situation like the one disclosed here. The order should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">For about the same reasons, I vote to affirm in <em>Feathers </em>v. <em>McLucas. </em>I see no necessity or warrant for restricting the statutory language \u2018 \u2018 tortious act within the state \u2019 \u2019 so narrowly as to defeat the apparent legislative purpose and deprive our citizens of the intended benefits of the statutory plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>In Longines-Wittnauer: Order affirmed, with costs.
