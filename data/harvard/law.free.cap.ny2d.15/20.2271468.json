In August of 1957, she visited Dr. Schachat, an ophthalmologist, who examined her eyes and, in discussing such a transplant, allegedly stated that, even if the transplant was a complete failure, the plaintiff\u2019s left eye would be \u201c [e]xactly the way it is now \u201d and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>thus, she \u2018 \u2018 had everything to gain and positively nothing to lose \u201d by undergoing such an operation. Dr. Sehaehat, however, informed the plaintiff that he did not specialize in corneal transplants and he referred her to Dr. Pat\u00f3n, the physician in charge of the corneal clinic at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital and, admittedly, one of the leading ophthalmologists in the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The plaintiff was examined by Dr. Pat\u00f3n on October 3, 1957, and, according to her testimony, he apparently told her that, without an operation, she was \u201cgoing to lose [her] sight\u201d. Dr. Pat\u00f3n, called as a witness by the plaintiff, testified that he diagnosed the condition of the plaintiff\u2019s eyes as \u201c Fuch\u2019s dystrophy\u201d \u2014 a rare ailment marked by progressive clouding of the cornea\u2014that the disease \u201c extended pretty well to the periphery\u201d of the cornea in each eye and that the plaintiff\u2019s vision without glasses was 5/200 in each eye, her best corrected vision being 20/200. He recommended a \u201c curettement of the endothelium \u201d\u2014which is a scraping of the back layer of the cornea\u2014to be followed by a corneal transplant, both operations to be performed, in the first instance, on the plaintiff\u2019s left, and worse, eye. About three weeks later, on October 22, the plaintiff entered Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat for the express purpose of undergoing the recommended operations and, at such time, signed the standard admittance forms, which contained an authorization to operate. At the hospital, the plaintiff was visited, for the first time, by Dr. Kleinhandler who, declared the plaintiff, stated \u201c Positively, you cannot lose your sight in this operation \u201d and assured her, so she further testified, that, \u201c If the operation wasn\u2019t a success, I would be just the way I was with my eye and vision and go about my business \u201d. On the following day, October 23, Dr. Kleinhandler performed the first stage of the operation, the curettement of the endothelium, with Dr. Pat\u00f3n in attendance and supervising. Thereafter, the second step, the actual corneal transplant in the left eye, was carried out by Kleinhandler, this time with Dr. Doctor supervising. And, finally, a third operation, to alleviate a secondary glaucoma, was performed by Dr. Pat\u00f3n himself. There is no dispute but that the operations were unsuccessful and the plaintiff rendered virtually blind in her left eye. At the same time, Dr. Pat\u00f3n\u2019s testimony indicated that, contrary to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>dire predictions, the plaintiff\u2019s right eye, upon which no surgery was performed, showed a natural, marked improvement in visual acuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The plaintiff thereupon brought this action against the several doctors and the hospital, basing her case of malpractice upon two theories: first, that the defendants Schachat and Kleinhandler had knowingly made misrepresentations as to the possible outcome of the operation which induced her to submit to the surgery to her injury and, second, that the defendants Phton, Doctor and Kleinhandler had recommended and performed the surgery when, in light of the condition of her left eye, such surgery was contraindicated by accepted medical practice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court dismissed the complaint against all the defendants at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case. On appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed that dismissal as to two doctors, Dr. Schachat and Dr. Doctor, and modified as to the other two, Drs. Pat\u00f3n and Kleinhandler, as well as the defendant hospital which employed Kleinhandler as a resident doctor, by providing that the dismissal as to them should be \u201c without prejudice \u201d (16 A D 2d 374, 380).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">As to the first of the plaintiff\u2019s two theories, we agree with the Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion and content ourselves with its statement that \u201c on this record it appears the plaintiff did not rely \u201d on the alleged misrepresentations of Dr. Schachat or Dr. Kleinhandler in deciding to undergo the corneal transplant (16 A D 2d, at pp. 376-377). Accordingly, we here limit our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>attention to the plaintiff\u2019s action against Dr. Pat\u00f3n, Dr. Klein-handler and the hospital, based on her second theory of malpractice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">It is not Miss McDermott\u2019s plaint that the operations were in any respect negligently performed but, rather, that the two-step surgical procedure \u2014 the scraping and the actual transplant\u2014 should never have been recommended or undertaken. It is her theory that standard medical practice establishes that a corneal transplant is never indicated where, as the defendants knew to be the case here, the disease of Puch\u2019s dystrophy extends to the periphery of the cornea and the patient\u2019s uncorrected eyesight is less than 20/200. In such a case, the plaintiff asserts, the disease in the corneal periphery will invade the graft and \u201c doom \u201d the operation to failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Since the issue whether the defendants Paton and Klein-handler properly recommended and undertook to perform a corneal transplant is, quite obviously, not one within the realm of competence of a lay jury, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to come forward with expert medical testimony to support her allegations of malpractice. (See, e.g., <em>Meiselman </em>v. <em>Crown Hgts. Hosp., </em>285 N. Y. 389, 396; <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>232 N. Y. 52, 56; <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Nathan, </em>189 App. Div. 827, 830; see, also, 7 Wigmore, Evidence [3d ed.], \u00a7 2090; Ann. 81 ALR 2d 597.) At the trial, the plaintiff testified on her own behalf and called but two other witnesses, the defendants Dr. Pat\u00f3n and Dr. Klein-handler. She did not call an expert witness of her own nor did she introduce any other medical proof to establish her claim of malpractice. Instead, the plaintiff, after eliciting responses from Dr. Pat\u00f3n as to his examination, diagnosis and treatment in her case and after establishing that he had written a book on the subject of corneal transplants (\u201c Keratoplasty \u201d), sought to further question him \u2014 and, later, Dr. Kleinhandler\u2014as to (1) the general background and risks of such operations; (2) the favorable conditions which, typically, must be present in a patient\u2019s diseased eyes before transplanting is deemed suitable; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>and (3) the usual significance of a diagnosis of Fuch\u2019s dystrophy extending to the periphery of the cornea and uncorrected vision of less than 20/200 on a patient\u2019s chances for a successful transplant. In short, the plaintiff attempted to prove her malpractice ease by questioning the defendants, Pat\u00f3n and Kleinhandler, as to the established medical practice in the field of keratoplasty and their knowledge of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The trial court, by sustaining objections to all such questions and, later, rejecting her offer of proof, prevented the plaintiff from eliciting such expert opinion evidence from the two defendants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, the plaintiff\u2019s case was barren of expert testimony tending to establish a deviation by the defendants from proper and approved medical practice and the trial court had no choice, at that point, but to dismiss her complaint. The Appellate Division agreed that the plaintiff had placed \u201c mistaken reliance upon the expertise \u201d of the defendants and, as previously noted, modified the judgment of the trial court solely in light of <em>\u201c </em>the possibility that the plaintiff may be able to supply the necessary expert medical evidence \u201d in a new action (16 A D 2d, at pp. 379-380).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The only question of substance upon this appeal, then, is whether the plaintiff should have been given the opportunity of establishing her claim of malpractice by showing, through the testimony of the defendant doctors, that proper medical practice contraindicated the performance of a corneal transplant on a patient such as the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">It has long been recognized in this State that a party in a civil suit may be called as a witness by his adversary and, as a general proposition, questioned as to matters relevant to the issues in dispute. (CPLR 4501, 4512; see, also, 8 Wigmore, Evidence [McNaughton\u2019s rev., 1961], \u00a7 2218; Richardson, Evidence [9th ed.], \u00a7 523.) Statutes in virtually every other jurisdiction reflect such a rule insofar as they provide, for example, that a party may call his adversary for interrogation \u201cas if under cross-examination\u201d (e.g., Cal. Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 2055; Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 110, \u00a7 60; Md. Ann. Code, art. 35, \u00a7 9; Fed. Rules Civ. Pro., rule 43, subd. [b]) or that such adverse party may be compelled to testify \u2018 \u2018 in the same manner and subject to the same rules as other witnesses \u201d (e.g., Kan. Gen. Stat., 1949, 60-2803; N. J. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 2:97-12). Modern rules of evidence have thus removed the common-law disability of parties to testify as witnesses (see 8 Wigmore, Evidence [McNaughton\u2019s rev., 1961], \u00a7 2218, p. 170) on the ground, no doubt, that \u201c\u2018plain sense and reason * * * obviously suggest that any living witness who could throw light upon a fact in issue should be heard to state what he knows, subject always to such observations as may arise as to his means of knowledge or his disposition to the truth. \u2019 \u201d (Morgan, McGuire and Weinstein, Evidence [4th ed.], p. 174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">While recognizing the right of a plaintiff in a malpractice action to call as a witness the defendant doctor, the courts of several States have sought to limit the type of questions which the plaintiff may put to him. Specifically, it has been held that a defendant physician may be required to testify to \u201cfacts within his knowledge \u201d\u2014that is, \u201c what [he] actually saw and did\u201d\u2014but not as to whether his actions deviated from the accepted standard of medical practice in the community, a matter deemed to call for \u201c expert opinion \u201d. <em>(Hull </em>v. <em>Plume, </em>131 N. J. L. 511, 516-517; see, also, <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>24 Idaho 158, 168; <em>Hunder </em>v. <em>Rindlaub, </em>61 N. D. 389, 406-410; <em>Forthofer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>v. <em>Arnold, </em>60 Ohio App. 436, 441-442; cf. <em>Ericksen </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>266 Minn. 401.) Other courts, however, permit the plaintiff to examine his doctor-opponent as freely and fully as he could any other qualified witness. (See <em>Lawless </em>v. <em>Calaway, </em>24 Cal. 2d 81, 90-91; <em>State, Use of Miles </em>v. <em>Brainin, </em>224 Md. 156; cf. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Pantaleo, </em>143 Conn. 290.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The latter decisions strike us as the more enlightened. That the defendant is an \u201c expert \u201d and that the particular questions asked of him are those which only an expert can answer, seem beside the point. It is at least arguable that the doctor\u2019s knowledge of the proper medical practice and his possible awareness of his deviation from that standard in the particular case are, in a real sense, as much matters of \u201c fact \u201d as are the diagnosis and examination he made or the treatment upon which he settled. More importantly, however, by allowing the plaintiff to examine the defendant doctor with regard to the standard of skill and care ordinarily exercised by physicians in the community under like circumstances and with regard to whether his conduct conformed thereto, even though such questions call for the expression of an expert opinion, the courts do no more than conform to the obvious purpose underlying the adverse-party-witness rule. That purpose, of course, \u201cis to permit the production in each case of all pertinent and relevant evidence that is available from the parties to the action \u2019 \u2019. <em>(State, Use of Miles </em>v. <em>Brainin, </em>224 Md. 156, 161, <em>supra; </em>see, also, <em>Lawless </em>v. <em>Calaway, </em>24 Cal. 2d 81, 90, <em>supra.) </em>The issue whether the defendant doctor deviated from the proper and approved practice customarily adopted by physicians practicing in the community is assuredly \u201c pertinent and relevant \u201d to a malpractice action. Indeed, absent such proof, the plaintiff\u2019s case would have to be dismissed. Moreover, evidence on this issue is, in most instances, \u201c available \u201d from the defendant doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The importance of enabling the plaintiff to take the testimony of the defendant doctor as to both \u201c fact \u201d and \u201c opinion\u201d is accentuated by recognition of the difficulty inherent in securing \u201cindependent\u201d expert witnesses. It is not always a simple matter to have one expert, a doctor in this case, condemn in open court the practice of another, particularly if the latter is a leader in his field. In consequence, the plaintiff\u2019s only recourse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>in many cases may be to question the defendant doctor as an expert in the hope that he will thereby be able to establish his malpractice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">There is nothing unfair about such a practice. Unlike his counterpart in a criminal prosecution, the defendant in a civil suit has no inherent right to remain silent or, once on the stand, to answer only those inquiries which will have no adverse effect on his case. Bather, he must, if called as a witness, respond to virtually all questions aimed at eliciting information he may possess relevant to the issues, even though his testimony on such matters might further the plaintiff\u2019s case. We cannot agree with the suggestion that it is somehow neither sporting nor consistent with the adversary system to allow a party to prove his case through his opponent\u2019s own testimony (see, e.g., <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>24 Idaho 158, 168, <em>supra; </em>see, also, Comment, 5 So. Cal. L. Rev. 448, 449-450) but, whatever the merits of this view, we prefer to believe that, in a situation such as the present, <em>\u201c </em>[t]he ultimate requirement that judicial decisions be based on the * * * facts overcomes any detriment which might be suffered by the adversary system\u201d. (Friedenthal, Discovery and Use of an Adverse Party\u2019s Expert Information, 14 Stan. L. Rev. 455, 487; see, also, King, The Adverse Witness Statute and Expert Opinion, 4 Wayne L. Rev. 228, 229.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In this case, the plaintiff insists that she hoped to prove by the testimony of Dr. Pat\u00f3n himself that he was guilty of malpractice\u2014by questioning him as to the propriety of a corneal transplant in view of the condition of her eyes and, then, if necessary, by attempting to induce him to give testimony favorable to her case by use of his authoritative text on the subject <em>(supra, </em>p. 25, n. 4). We perceive nothing wrong in such a technique or tactic, nor any reason for denying the plaintiff the opportunity so to proceed. Courts are intent upon arriving at just decisions and upon employing properly expedient means to attain such an end. If a defendant in a malpractice action may truthfully testify that his conduct conformed to the standard required, his case is, of course, substantially strengthened and, if he cannot so testify, the plaintiff\u2019s chances of recovery are unquestionably increased. In either case, the objective of the court in doing justice is achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>It is true that, in <em>People ex rel. Kraushaar Bros. &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Thorpe </em>(296 N. Y. 223), upon which the courts below and the defendants rely, this court explicitly held that a person may not be compelled to testify and give his opinion as an expert against his will. Our holding in <em>Kraushaar, </em>however, is not dispositive of the issue now before us. In that case, the witness (a real estate appraiser) called to testify as an expert was not a party to the action. Such an independent, disinterested witness, we held, could not be required to testify as an expert. That our decision in <em>Kraushaar </em>was not concerned with the situation where the expert and the defendant are one and the same person is implicit from the very tone of the opinion itself and, more importantly, from the reasoning underlying the decision. That reasoning, although not expressly articulated in the opinion, was relied upon in <em>Buchman </em>v. <em>State </em>(59 Ind. 1), a case cited with approval in <em>Kraushaar </em>(296 N. Y., at p. 225). As the Indiana court noted (59 Ind. 1, 6), \u201c \u2018 to compel a person to attend [a trial] merely because he is accomplished in a particular science, art, or profession, would subject the same individual to be called upon, in every cause in which any question in his department of knowledge is to be solved. Thus, the most eminent physician might be compelled * * * to attend from the remotest part of the district, and give his opinion in every trial in which a medical question should arise \u2019 \u2019 <em>\u2019.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">It is quite clear that no such burden or unfairness is occasioned by the practice of compelling a doctor, who is actually a defendant in the malpractice action, to testify as an expert. It is, therefore, not inconsistent to permit the plaintiff to question the defendant as an expert even though we would not accord him the same right with respect to an unwilling witness who is in no way connected with the action. The very inability of a plaintiff in a malpractice action to <em>co'inpel </em>the attendance and testimony of a \u201c disinterested \u201d medical witness underscores the need and importance of allowing such a plaintiff the opportunity of questioning his adversary as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In short, then, a plaintiff in a malpractice action is entitled to call the defendant doctor to the stand and question him both as to Ms factual knowledge of the case (that is, as to Ms examination, diagnosis, treatment and the* like) and, if he be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>so qualified, as an expert for the purpose of establishing the generally accepted medical practice in the community.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> **8 While it may be the height of optimism to expect that such a plaintiff will gain anything by being able to call and question (as an expert) the very doctor he is suing, the decision whether or not to do so is one which rests with the plaintiff alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">One other point deserves mention. Upon the trial herein, the plaintiff sought, without success, to call as a witness one Dr. Lissman, an independent ophthalmologist who had examined her, prior to trial, at the instance of a defendant. It was her intention, we are advised, to interrogate the doctor solely about the condition of her eyes and such other facts which he might have ascertained on his examination. Since the judge who will be presiding at the new trial we are directing will undoubtedly be confronted with the same problem, we do no more than note that the plaintiff is certainly privileged to question Dr. Lissman to the extent she has indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The judgment appealed from should be modified to the extent of granting a new trial as to defendants Patou, Kleinhandler and the hospital in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs to plaintiff against such defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Van Voorhis, Burke, Scileppi and Bergan concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Judgment accordingly,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-6\">. Another doctor, Michael Weidman, whose name appears in the caption, was never served as a defendant in this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\">. This is a true modification, justifying an appeal as of right (see Cohen and Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals, p. 221, n. 53), and, contrary to the defendants\u2019 contention, the judgment of the Appellate Division \u201cfinally determines the action\u201d within the sense of CPLR 5601 (a). (See, e.g., Cohen and Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals, p. 60, n. 69.) The type of case relied upon by the defendants \u2014 one in which the Appellate Division judgment dismisses the complaint with leave to the plaintiff to plead over (see <em>Rattray </em>v. Raynor, 10 N Y 2d 494, 499; see, also, Cohen and Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals, p. 323) \u2014 differs materially from the present ease. In such a case, the amended complaint to be served is in the same action and there is, accordingly, no final determination of that action. Here, however, the Appellate Division judgment does determine, that is, put an end to, the action brought by the plaintiff and requires her to institute a \u201c new \u201d action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\">. The Appellate Division, as indicated, affirmed, without modification, the dismissal of the action against Dr. Doctor since, as it noted, he <em>\u201c </em>did not participate in the decision to undertake the operative procedures and there is no claim that he made any representation to plaintiff \u201d (16 A D 2d, at p. 377). On this appeal, the plaintiff has voluntarily discontinued the action against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b61-5\">. The plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof, which pertained to the questioning of Dr. Pat\u00f3n, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">\u201cI offer to prove that * * * after the proper questions, Dr. Pat\u00f3n would have testified that Fuch\u2019s endothelial dystrophy, .the diagnosis that the lady had in the case, posed a substantial danger * * * to the operation of keratoplasty for the reason that the dystrophy invaded the graft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\"><em>\u201c </em>He would have further testified that such an operation of keratoplasty can be done in a patient with a condition of Fuch\u2019s endothelial dystrophy only under specific conditions, which are (1) that the periphery of the cornea must be free of the disease * * *; (2) that the eyesight without glasses, of course, should be 20 over 200 or better; (3) that keratoplasty should not be performed on patients with Fuch\u2019s endothelial dystrophy where the vision is between 20 over 1,000 and 20 over 200.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">\u201cAnd I further offer to prove that he would have stated that this exact information is contained in his book, \u2018 Keratoplasty,\u2019 written by him in 1955.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-11\">\u201cI further offer to prove that in answer to my questions he would have testified that of the 13 operations of keratoplasty that he had performed with Fueh\u2019s endothelial dystrophy, only four showed some measure of \u2022success, and all the others were failures, each resulting in some variance [sic] degree of adverse effect upon the patient in further impairment of vision and other complications.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\">. It is, of course, assumed that a plaintiff, in naming a doctor as a defendant, has done so in good faith, on the basis of his relationship with the case and not as a device or Subterfuge in order to afford the plaintiff an opportunity to call him as an expert witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
