She asserts in a conclusional manner that the district court committed plain error by imposing a 16-level increase in her offense level for a prior drug-trafficking felony and by counting that felony against both her offense level and her criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-19\">The district court properly relied on written judicial confessions to conclude that Gonzalez committed at least one drug-trafficking felony as required to support the 16-level increase under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) (2009). <em>See United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 481 (5th Cir.2008). Gonzalez\u2019s double-counting argument is foreclosed because double counting is barred only where it is prohibited by a specific Guideline. <em>United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001) (relying on confession to clarify \u201cany ambiguity presented by the indictment and judgment\u201d). The Guidelines expressly allow consideration of a prior conviction in both the offense level and the criminal history score. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Gonzalez also asserts that \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors is unconstitutional. This issue \u201cis fully foreclosed from further debate\u201d and provides no legitimate basis for an appeal. <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b105-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
