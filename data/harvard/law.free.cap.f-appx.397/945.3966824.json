Reed argues that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion was an abuse of discretion because he has a positive prison record, he is no longer a threat to the community, and by relying on factors, such as the seriousness of his offense and his criminal history, that were already accounted for in the original sentencing calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary reduction of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In such cases, the district court may reduce the sentence after considering the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the applicable guidelines policy statements. <em>Id. A </em>district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). If the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-18\">The district court considered Reed\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his attachments, and the Government\u2019s response. It also stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and concluded that it would not reduce Reed\u2019s sentence in light of the serious nature of his offense and his criminal history. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A)-(C). Because the record reflects consideration of Reed\u2019s motion and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion. <em>See Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-19\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
