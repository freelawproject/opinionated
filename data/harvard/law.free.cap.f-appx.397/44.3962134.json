He argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that he should have been sentenced below the guidelines range. Velasquez argues that his benign motives for reentry support a sentence below the guidelines range. He also argues that the illegal reentry guideline\u2019s emphasis on criminal history and lack of empirical grounding led to an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-18\">In reviewing a sentence, we normally \u201cconsider[ ] the \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Because Velasquez did not object to his sentence as unreasonable after it was pronounced by the district court, our review is limited to review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>559 F.3d 348, 358 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2814, 174 L.Ed.2d 308 (2009). A plain error is a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Guzman, </em>597 F.3d 695, 696 (5th Cir.2010). When those elements are shown, this court has the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AF\">We are not persuaded that the illegal reentry guideline\u2019s emphasis on a defendant\u2019s criminal history and lack of empirical grounding necessarily renders a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>sentence computed under that guideline unreasonable. See <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Velasquez\u2019s personal history and characteristics, including his motives for reentering the United States, are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66. Velasquez has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s imposition of a 57-month sentence, a sentence at the top of the properly calculated guidelines range, was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b70-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
