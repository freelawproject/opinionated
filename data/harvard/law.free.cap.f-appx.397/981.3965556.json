He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine, and he was sentenced to 151 months of imprisonment. By moving to proceed IFP, Geiger is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">The district court\u2019s denial of Geiger\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based upon the determination that his base offense level of 38 remained the same under the amended guideline because he had been held responsible for six kilograms of crack cocaine. This drug quantity appeared in the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report prepared for his original sentencing hearing. Geiger maintains that drug quantity was never mentioned at sentencing and that the district court did not state its reasons for the sentence it imposed upon him. A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion may not be used to challenge a district court\u2019s calculation of an original sentence or to contest the appropriateness of the sentence. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-18\">Geiger has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1008-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
