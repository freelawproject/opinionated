Cockerham contends: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>her appeal waiver does <em>not </em>bar her appeal; and, her Sixth Amendment right to a public trial was violated because the courtroom was closed during her guilty-plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">The Government does <em>not </em>invoke the appeal-waiver provision of Cockerham\u2019s plea agreement because that agreement bars only the appeal of her sentence. Therefore, this appeal is <em>not </em>barred. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 231 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">\u201cWe review constitutional challenges <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Joseph, </em>333 F.3d 587, 589 (5th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Osborne, </em>68 F.3d 94, 98 (5th Cir.1995). Arguably, because the closed-courtroom issue was not raised in district court, review would be only for plain error. Under either standard, the claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees a public trial to all criminal defendants. <em>Osborne, </em>68 F.3d at 98. A defendant may waive that right, however, by failing to object to the closing of the courtroom. <em>Peretz v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 923, 936, 111 S.Ct. 2661, 115 L.Ed.2d 808 (1991) (citing <em>Levine v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 610, 619, 80 S.Ct. 1038, 4 L.Ed.2d 989 (1960)); <em>United States v. Hitt, </em>473 F.3d 146, 155 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">For the reasons that follow, Cockerham waived her right to public trial. At the guilty-plea hearing, her husband pleaded guilty first. After his plea, but before Cockerham\u2019s, the court announced the courtroom had been closed for the husband\u2019s and Cockerham\u2019s pleas. Cocker-ham and her counsel were present in the courtroom at that time; there is <em>no </em>indication in the record either Cockerham or her counsel objected to the closure of the courtroom before or during the plea hearing, at any subsequent proceeding, or by way of a written motion. \u201cWhere a defendant, with knowledge of the closure of the courtroom, fails to object, that defendant waives [her] right to a public trial.\u201d <em>Hitt, </em>473 F.3d at 155 (citing <em>Levine, </em>362 U.S. at 618-19, 80 S.Ct. 1038 (1960)). Moreover, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s waiver of the right to a public trial is effective on the defendant\u201d. <em>Hitt, </em>473 F.3d at 155 (citing <em>United States v. Sorrentino, </em>175 F.2d 721, 723 (3d Cir.1949)).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b970-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
