After careful review, we deny the petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Where the BIA issues a decision, we review that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the IJ\u2019s decision to the extent the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning. <em>Id. </em>Here, because the BIA affirmed the IJ and relied on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination with regard to the identity of the group that persecuted Salazar-Hincapie and the number of threatening calls she received, we will review both the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s opinions as to that issue. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). This test provides that an IJ\u2019s decision will be reversed \u201conly if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We review the record in the light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s decision, and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. <em>See Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">To be eligible for asylum, the applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). The applicant must, with: \u201cspecific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily-protected ground.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)). While an applicant\u2019s testimony alone can be sufficient to establish these factors, an IJ\u2019s denial of asylum relief can be supported solely by an adverse credibility determination, especially if the alien fails to produce corroborating evidence. <em>See id.; Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287-88. \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). If an IJ explicitly determines that an alien lacks credibility, the IJ must offer specific and cogent reasons for the finding. <em>Id. </em>Even if an IJ finds an applicant not credible, he or she must examine all evidence in the record before denying an asylum application. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">While an adverse credibility determination \u201calone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application,\u201d it is not sufficient for the IJ to solely rely on the determination if \u201cthe applicant produces other evidence of persecution.\u201d Id. Generally, \u201c[t]he weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d Yang v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). Nevertheless, once an adverse credibility determination is made, \u201cthe burden is on the applicant alien to show that the ... credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cIJ\u2019s must make \u2018clean determinations of credibility.\u2019\u201d <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. Ultimately, the fact finder has the duty to determine credibility, and we may not substitute our judgment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>that of the IJ regarding to credibility findings. Id.<footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must show that if returned to her country, her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The burden of proof for withholding of removal is \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d and, thus, is more stringent than the standard for asylum relief. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257. If a petitioner is unable to meet the standard of proof for asylum, therefore, she is generally precluded from qualifying for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Likewise, to qualify for CAT relief, an applicant again must meet standards more stringent than those for asylum eligibility. <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007). To qualify for CAT relief, an alien must \u201cdemonstrate a likelihood that he will be tortured at the acquiescence of the government, meaning that the government was aware of the torture, yet breached its responsibility to intervene.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">On the record here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding, adopted by the BIA, that Salazar-Hincapie was not credible based on two inconsistencies: the identity of the group that was threatening her, and the number of threatening phone calls she received. Furthermore, apart from her non-eredible testimony, the other evidence submitted is not sufficient to establish Salazar-Hincapie\u2019s entitlement to asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief. For example, Salazar-Hincapie\u2019s affidavits regarding her harassment by the FARC stated generally she had been harassed by the FARC, without explaining how such a conclusion was reached or including any specific supporting facts. Salazar-Hincapie also submitted a letter and identification form showing that she worked for the Colombian Company of Tabaco S.A., but nothing in that document indicated that she suffered harassment as a result. Likewise, she included a letter showing that her husband briefly worked for the El Colombiano newspaper, but otherwise offered nothing indicating that this led to any persecution. In addition, nothing in her cousins\u2019 death certificates indicates that they were murdered by a guerrilla group on the basis of a protected ground, nor does Salazar-Hincapie offer any documentary evidence to relate those acts to her own situation. Moreover, Salazar-Hincapie\u2019s husband, who was presumably available to testify and corroborate her testimony at the removal hearing, never testified, and she offered no explanation for not calling him to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Therefore, the record does not compel a finding that the IJ and BIA erred in finding Salazar-Hincapie to not be credible, and Salazar-Hincapie has failed to establish through credible evidence her eligibility for asylum. By extension, she also has failed to satisfy the more stringent burdens for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4 (noting that a failure to establish eligibility for asylum on the merits necessarily entails ineligibility for withholding of removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>and CAT relief). We deny Salazar-Hinca-pie\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-10\">. In addition to Marta Dora Salazar-Hinca-pie, her husband, Oscar Antonio Yusty, and her children, Sara Yusty and Jose Ignacio Yusty, are also involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-11\">. As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to consider several issues raised by Salazar-Hin-capie. As the BIA limited its ruling to the adverse credibility determination, her argument regarding internal relocation within Colombia is not properly before us. <em>See Shkambi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>584 F.3d 1041, 1049 n. 5 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that we will not review portions of an IJ\u2019s ruling that are not adopted by the BIA). Furthermore, we must decide the petition on the basis only of the administrative record on which the order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>removal was based. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A). Thus, the new evidence Salazar-Hincapie presents regarding the FARC and the EPL being part of a single umbrella group is beyond our review. <em>Id. </em>Likewise, because Salazar-Hincapie\u2019s arguments about the IJ being biased were not raised before the BIA, they are not exhausted, and we do not have jurisdiction to consider them. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). Finally, Salazar-Hincapie\u2019s passing reference to sexual orientation appears to have been included erroneously, as that issue was never raised in the case, nor was it commented on by the IJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\">. The REAL ID Act explicitly provides that an adverse credibility determination may be based on any inconsistencies, regardless of whether the inconsistency goes to the heart of the claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii) (as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, \u00a7 101(a)(3), Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005)). The provisions of the REAL ID Act pertaining to credibility determinations apply only to asylum applications filed after May 11, 2005. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. As Salazar-Hincapie\u2019s initial asylum application was filed in 2002, the provisions of the REAL ID Act do not apply to this case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
