The district court determined at his original sentencing that Cornett was accountable for 350 kilograms of powder cocaine and 234.6 grams of crack cocaine, resulting in a base offense level of 38. Cornett was sentenced to life imprisonment on several counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">This court is now presented with Cornett\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Cornett contends that the district court had the authority to reduce his sentence pursuant to the retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines concerning crack cocaine. He argues that the district court denied relief based on the mistaken belief that the guidelines were mandatory. Cornett also asserts that his case presents extraordinary circumstances given the district court\u2019s statement at the original sentencing that it would not have chosen a life sentence were it not bound by the guidelines. The Government has moved for summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">Because the combined offense level for the two drug types (powder cocaine and crack cocaine) is less than the offense level for the powder cocaine alone, Cornett was not entitled to a two-level reduction in his offense level under the retroactive guideline amendments. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 715. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Cornett\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-18\">To the extent that Cornett contends that he was eligible for a reduction in his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the guidelines are no longer mandatory, his argument is unavailing. The Supreme Court has determined that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and that the district court may not impose a sentence below the amended guideline range unless the sentencing court originally imposed a term of imprisonment below the guidelines range. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Likewise, the <em>Booker </em>reasonableness standard does not apply in proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>In view of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and the Government\u2019s motion for summary af-firmance is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b978-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
