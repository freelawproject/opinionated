Tuft\u2019s amended complaint against over a dozen defendants raised nine claims relating to the conditions of his confinement, the failure to evacuate for a hurricane, the denial of access to the courts, the infringement of his religious freedom, and retaliation by prison officials. The district court ordered Tuft to file a second amended complaint that contained only claims related to a single set of facts in accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 18 and 20. When he failed to do so, district court dismissed Tuft\u2019s lawsuit without prejudice under Rule 41(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">We review such a dismissal \u201cfor abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Larson v. Scott, </em>157 F.3d 1030, 1032 (5th Cir.1998). However, because at least some of Tuft\u2019s claims would not be time barred, the scope of the discretion is narrowed. <em>See Berry v. CIGNA/RSI-CIGNA, </em>975 F.2d 1188, 1190-91 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Under Rule 20(a)(2), parties may be joined as defendants if the plaintiff asserts a claim against them \u201cjointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences\u201d and \u201cany question of law or fact common to all defendants will arise in the action.\u201d A district court has discretion under Rule 20(a) to control the scope of a lawsuit by limiting the number of defendants a plaintiff may hail into court in a particular case. <em>Arrington v. City of Fairfield, </em>414 F.2d 687, 693 (5th Cir.1969). In addition, \u201cthe creative joinder of actions\u201d by prisoner plaintiffs to avoid the strictures of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), Pub.L. 104-134, \u00a7\u00a7 804-05, 110 Stat. 1321, 1321-73 to -75 (2006) (codified in relevant part at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915, 1915A), should be discouraged. <em>Patton v. Jefferson Corr. Ctr., </em>136 F.3d 458, 464 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">In- this case, the district court properly found that Tuft\u2019s amended complaint transgressed the limitations in Rule 20(a). However, where an action is time barred following a dismissal without prejudice, the standard of review is the same as if the action had been dismissed with prejudice. <em>Berry, </em>975 F.2d at 1191. In this case, there is not a \u201cclear record of delay or contumacious conduct,\u201d and the district court has not \u201cexpressly determined that lesser sanctions would not prompt diligent prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the record does not show \u201cthat the district court employed lesser sanctions that proved to be futile.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">In fact, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21, \u201c[m]isjoinder of parties is not a ground for dismissing an action.\u201d Instead, a district court, \u201con motion or on its own, ... may at any time, on just terms, add or drop a party\u201d and \u201cmay also sever any claim against a party.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 21. In other words, a court faced with misjoin-der \u201c\u2018has two remedial options: (1) mis-joined parties may be dropped on such terms as are just; or (2) any claims against misjoined parties may be severed and proceeded with separately.\u2019\u201d <em>Acevedo v. Allsup\u2019s Convenience Stores, Inc., </em>600 F.3d 516, 520 (5th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>DirecTV, Inc. v. Leto, </em>467 F.3d 842, 845 (3d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Because the record does not show that Tuft delayed the proceedings in this case, acted contumaciously, or deliberately disobeyed court orders, the district court abused its discretion \u201cwhen it dismissed this entire action, rather than simply dismissing\u201d misjoined claims, dropping parties, or both. <em>Id. </em>at 522; <em>see also Berry, </em>975 F.2d at 1191-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding of misjoinder, reverse the dismissal of Tuft\u2019s entire lawsuit, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We disclaim any limitation on the district court\u2019s authority on remand to dismiss any of Tuft\u2019s claims on any other basis, such as any PLRA provisions that may be applicable. <em>See, e.g., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915; \u00a7 1915A; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b86-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
