Kirschner appeals his 120-month sentence, imposed upon his pleading guilty to mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 2. On appeal, Kir-schner argues that the district court erred by departing upward without proper notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h), by imposing an upward departure for extreme conduct pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.8 (Nov.2008), and by imposing a procedurally and substantively unreasonable sentence. Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we conclude that the sentence imposed by the district court does not satisfy the standard for procedural reasonableness set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). As a result, we vacate Kirschner\u2019s sentence and remand the case to the district court for further review and resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">The government filed an information charging Kirschner with one count of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 2 in connection with a ponzi scheme he operated between November 2006 and May 2009. The victims of the scheme were primarily friends of Kirschner. Kirschner entered into a written plea agreement with the government, in which both Kirschner and the government agreed to recommend a guideline sentence and not to seek either an upward or a downward departure. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) provided a guideline sentencing range of 63 to 78 months imprisonment. The statutory maximum for the offense is 20 years imprisonment. Kirschner had a prior federal conviction for mail fraud, arising from unrelated conduct in the 1990s.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-17\">At the beginning of the sentencing proceeding, the district court considered Kir-schner\u2019s two unresolved objections to the PSR, both of which related to the guideline calculation. The district court overruled both objections, but did not calculate or discuss the guideline range during the sentencing hearing. After the court overruled Kirschner\u2019s objections to the PSR, the government requested a sentence at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>high end of the guideline range. The court asked the government what additional factors or circumstances would be required in order to warrant the maximum sentence of 20 years. The government responded that it had agreed in the plea agreement to recommend a within guidelines sentence. The court observed that many of Kirschner\u2019s victims lost \u201call they had\u201d as a result of the fraud, and noted that it had not received any letters in support of Kirschner. Rather, every letter the court received, including one from Kir-schner\u2019s sister, asked the court to sentence Kirschner to the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Kirschner argued for a lesser sentence, pointing out that he went voluntarily to the FBI to accept responsibility, and that he avoided the expenditure of judicial resources by agreeing to an information and by pleading guilty. He also asked the court to consider that he was 63 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In delivering the sentence, the court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">I think this whole situation is shocking. I mean, I don\u2019t get shocked very easily because I see a lot [of] crime, but this is just beyond belief. This is incredible that somebody would use his friends, his relatives and just take their money with no intention that they would ever get anything back, and these were not people who could afford to lose this kind of money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">And to have all the things going for him that he did, an education, college education, law degree, I\u2019m just amazed by this. Now I asked The Government what could make it worse for congress to say some of this conduct is worth twenty years, and I guess more victims and more money, and perhaps that would have happened if he didn\u2019t get caught sooner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">But I am going to depart upward. I\u2019m not going to go all of the way but I\u2019ll go halfway and that will mean ten years, so that will be the sentence. The Court has considered the statements of all parties, the pre-sentence report which contains the advisory guidelines, the statutory factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Aside from this last statement, the court made no other mention of the statutory factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The day after the sentencing hearing, the district court completed a written Statement of Reasons explaining the sentence imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this Statement, the court noted that it had adopted the PSR and that the guideline range, before departures, was 63 to 78 months. The court also indicated that it had imposed a departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.8 for extreme conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">\u201cWe review sentencing decisions only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1239 (11th Cir.2009). As explained by the Supreme Court in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-14\">must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, fading to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If we conclude \u201cthat the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound,\u201d we then proceed to the second step of the process and \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Kirschner\u2019s first two arguments that the sentencing was procedurally unreasonable turn on whether the district court departed from, instead of varying from, the advisory guideline range. First, Kirschner argues that the district court erred in imposing an upward departure from the guideline range without having provided notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party\u2019s pre-hearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure. The notice must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA7\">Second, Kirschner argues that, the lack of notice aside, the district court erred by imposing an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.8, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">If the defendant\u2019s conduct was unusually heinous, cruel, brutal, or degrading to the victim, the court may increase the sentence above the guideline range to reflect the nature of the conduct. Examples of extreme conduct include torture of a victim, gratuitous infliction of injury, or prolonging of pain or humiliation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">In response, the government argues that notice was not required because the district court applied a variance instead of a departure, and alternatively that any error was harmless because the district court had sufficient reason to depart upwards based on extreme conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">In <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that the notice requirement of Rule 32(h) applied only to departures, and not to variances. 553 U.S. 708, 715-18, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2203-04, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-13\">In determining whether the district court applied an upward departure under the Guidelines or a variance under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a) factors, we consider whether the district court cited to a specific guideline departure provision and if the court\u2019s rationale was based on its determination that the Guidelines were inadequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-14\"><em>United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1316 (11th Cir.2009). In this case, the district court expressly stated that it was \u201cgoing to depart upward,\u201d but identified no specific guideline departure provision during the sentencing hearing. Nor did the district court make clear that the deviation was based on a determination-that the guidelines were inadequate. Further complicating matters, the district court later indicated on the written Statement of Reasons that it was departing pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.8 for extreme conduct. <em>But see United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 975, 977 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cWhere there is a discrepancy between the orally imposed sentence and the written order of judgment and committal, the oral sentence controls.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">The government contends that the sentence imposed a variance because the district court grounded the decision in findings relevant to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The district court\u2019s discussion of Kir-schner\u2019s educational and criminal background, his relationship with the victims, and the impact on those victims certainly touches on the first of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d But district courts are required, under <em>Gall, </em>to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in every sentence, including those within the advisory guidelines. 552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. at 596-97. Here, as explained below, the district court\u2019s discussion of those facts bearing on the first of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not provide a sufficient basis for this Court to conclude that the district court adequately considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">In short, the record permits a great deal of confusion, and the sentence could plausibly be construed as applying either a departure or a variance. However, we need not conclusively determine whether the district court\u2019s deviation from the sentencing guideline range was a departure or a variance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">Where a Guidelines departure provision has been erroneously applied, the resulting sentence may still be procedurally reasonable if the district court has adequately explained it by reference to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In such a case, the sentence would be unreasonable as a departure but reasonable as a variance from the advisory Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-13\"><em>United States v. O\u2019Georgia, </em>569 F.3d 281, 296 (6th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1092 (11th Cir.2008) (reasoning that where the district court would have imposed the same sentence upon remand for procedural error in applying a departure, the sentence should be considered alternatively as resulting from a variance). In this case, however, we conclude that Kirschner\u2019s sentencing was procedurally unreasonable, regardless of whether the district court applied a departure or a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">Since the Supreme Court rendered the sentencing guidelines advisory in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts must use a two-step process at sentencing: \u201cFirst, the district court must consult the Guidelines and correctly calculate the range provided by the Guidelines. Second, the district court must consider [the \u00a7 3553(a)] factors to determine a reasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted); <em>see also Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. at 596-97. In this case, the district court failed to satisfy either step of this two-step process.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>First, the district court erred by not calculating the guideline range. While the guidelines are advisory, the Supreme Court has repeatedly explained that \u201ca district court should begin <em>all </em>sentencing proceedings by calculating the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49, 128 S.Ct. at 596 (emphasis added); <em>see also Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 108, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 388, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cAs a matter of administration and to secure nationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49, 128 S.Ct. at 596. Additionally, \u201cnot only must the district courts \u2018consult th[e] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing,\u2019 they must properly calculate the Guidelines range <em>and </em>\u2018includ[e] an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. at 767; <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The requirement that the sentencing proceeding begin with the guideline calculation applies regardless of whether the district court ultimately imposes a sentence based on the guideline calculation. <em>See United States v. Barner, </em>572 F.3d 1239, 1248 (11th Cir.2009). Where the district court states that it would impose the same sentence regardless of the guideline range, a calculation error may be considered harmless. <em>Id. </em>Where the district court fails to calculate or consider the guideline range at all, however, the error cannot be rendered harmless. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4) (requiring district courts to consider the applicable guideline range). Further, proper calculation of the guideline range reflects an important way that district courts comply with the requirement that they consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Second, the district court erred by not adequately explaining the deviation from the guideline range in reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>\u201cGall </em>makes clear that the district court is obliged to \u2018consider <em>all </em>of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.\u2019\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. at 596). Further, in addition to considering each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the sentencing judge \u201cmust adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. We do nothing here to change the precept that the district court is not required \u201cto state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Here, however, the district court made no mention of any particular statutory factor, and did not implicitly address the factors, other than through its discussion of Kirschner\u2019s background, his relationship to the victims, and the impact on the victims, which undoubtedly touches on \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">District courts retain considerable discretion in sentencing, because the \u201csentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) in the individual case.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the district court must provide an adequate explanation of the sentence, including an explanation of any deviation from the guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>range, to allow this Court to conduct meaningful appellate review. <em>See, e.g., Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1093-94 (holding that the district court committed reversible procedural error by failing to explain its deviation from the guideline range where the district court listed several \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but \u201cgave no reasoning or indication of what facts justified such a significant variance from the advisory Guidelines range under its alternative sentence\u201d). In this case, the district court has not provided an adequate explanation of its significant deviation from the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Accordingly, we VACATE Kirschner\u2019s sentence and REMAND the case to the district court for resentencing in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-8\">. This Statement of Reasons is not part of the record on appeal. Rather, it is included as an attachment to Kirschner's brief. However, the government has acknowledged its authenticity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">The court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.
