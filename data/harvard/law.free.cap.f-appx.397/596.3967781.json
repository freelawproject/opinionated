After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part Raymundo\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-23\">In a withholding of removal claim, an alien shall not be removed to a country if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Absent past persecution, the alien must show it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d he will be \u201cpersecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). The alien may make this showing by demonstrating there is a \u201cpattern or practice of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant\u201d on account of a statutorily protected ground, and the alien\u2019s inclusion in that group will make it more-likely-than-not that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened upon return to that country.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">While the INA does not define persecution, we have held persecution is an \u201cextreme\u201d concept, mere harassment is not persecution, and persecution requires \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. We have previously concluded an alien failed to show a future threat to his life or freedom when his family members remained unharmed in his country of origin. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006). Furthermore, evidence of general conditions of violence and criminal activity, without more, is insufficient to compel a contrary conclusion from that reached by the BIA. <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1238 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Raymundo failed to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. First, his general complaints of being discriminated against do not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1238. Second, his asserted fear that, as a Mayan, his life or freedom would be threatened upon his return to Guatemala is undermined by the fact that his family members, who are also Mayan, remain in Guatemala unharmed. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1259. Moreover, Raymundo personally returned to Guatemala for several months in 2000 without incident. Finally, Raymundo\u2019s fear that he may be the victim of general crime is insufficient to compel reversal of the administrative findings. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-16\">. The IJ denied Raymundo\u2019s application as untimely filed. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Raymundo failed to argue to the BIA that his untimely filing was excusable due to \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Because Raymundo failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of his application for asylum. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-25\">. Where, as here, the BIA issues its own decision without expressly adopting the IJ's findings, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Arboleda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>434 F.3d 1220, 1222 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>(11th Cir.2006). We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test and will affirm if the decision is supported by \"reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004). Under the substantial evidence test, we will reverse a finding of fact by the BIA \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
