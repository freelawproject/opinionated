We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-24\">Dawson, an inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey, complains that he was unjustly terminated from his position in the prison\u2019s UNICOR<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> program, leading to financial hardship and fear of future reprisal. He alleges that this dismissal was accomplished by means of a forged \u201cInmate Request to Staff\u2019 (\u201cCop-Out\u201d) submitted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>defendant Frias, which had the net effect of causing him to lose his job. Dawson charges the other named defendants with \u201ccovering up\u201d the forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The District Court dismissed the complaint in its entirety, finding the accusation of forgery undergirding Dawson\u2019s allegations to be a \u201cdistinction without difference,\u201d as prisoners have neither a property nor a liberty interest in prison employment and thus lack a due-process interest in same. <em>Dawson v. Frias, </em>Civ. No. 09-6050, 2010 WL 1379894, at <em>*2 </em>n. 6, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30513, at *7 n. 6 (D.N.J. Mar. 30, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Our review of the District Court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim is plenary. <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). We must \u201caccept as true the factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom,\u201d <em>Nami v. Fauver, 82 </em>F.3d 63, 65 (3d Cir.1996), but we require more than mere assertions devoid of \u201cfurther factual enhancement.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citations omitted). As Dawson proceeds <em>pro se, </em>we liberally construe his pleadings and apply applicable law even if he has failed to mention it by name. <em>Dluhos v. Strasberg, </em>321 F.3d 365, 369 (3d Cir.2003). We may summarily affirm if no substantial question is presented by the appeal. <em>See </em>LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6; <em>Cradle v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">We agree with the District Court that Dawson\u2019s complaint does not state a claim. Chief among his obstacles is the well-established principle that prisoners have neither a liberty or property interest in prison employment. <em>See James v. Quinlan, </em>866 F.2d 627, 630 (3d Cir.1989). Since stating a cognizable claim under due process requires a liberty or property interest, <em>id. </em>at 629, Dawson would not be able to maintain his action even if he were terminated for <em>no </em>cause. Therefore, regardless of the circumstances surrounding his departure from UNICOR, Dawson is unable to successfully demonstrate a constitutional violation based solely on this set of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">Similarly, while Dawson asserts throughout his complaint that his was a \u201cretaliatory\u201d job firing, he has failed to present facts supporting a claim of retaliation. Dawson must show that the conduct that led to the retaliation was constitutionally protected, that he suffered from \u201c \u2018adverse action\u2019 at the hands of the prison officials,\u201d and that the retaliation and adverse action were causally related to the initial conduct. <em>Rauser v. Horn, </em>241 F.3d 330, 333-34 (3d Cir.2001). He has identified an adverse action but has done little else to suggest retaliation beyond using the word itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Finally, we agree with the District Court that to the extent Dawson\u2019s complaint seeks restoration of good-time credits, such a claim must be brought in a habeas corpus proceeding. <em>Queen v. Miner, </em>530 F.3d 253, 255 n. 2 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">Ordinarily, a District Court should not <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss a complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim without providing the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint. <em>Dawson, </em>2010 WL 1379894, at *3, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30513, at *11. For the reasons given by the District Court, we agree that amendment would be futile in this case and, thus, conclude that the District Court did not err in declining to afford Dawson leave to amend. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 111 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Because Dawson\u2019s appeal does not present a substantial issue, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-15\">.
