Smith, federal prisoner # 59847-079, filed a motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. The district court found that Amendment 706 would not affect Smith\u2019s sentence because he had been sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b). It also denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, certifying that Smith\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving this court for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Smith is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Smith also has moved for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-17\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). A defendant is eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only if the amendment has the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.lA). Because the record demonstrates that Smith was sentenced as an armed career criminal under \u00a7 4B1.4, the district court correctly concluded that Amendment 706 would not lower the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-20\">Smith also argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u00a7 1B1.10 is no longer mandatory. This argument is without merit. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238; <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Smith\u2019s remaining arguments are not considered as they are a challenge to his sentence as it was originally imposed. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>Therefore, Smith has not shown that his appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. Accordingly, his request for IFP is DENIED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. His request for appointment of counsel also is DENIED. Because his appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1009-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
