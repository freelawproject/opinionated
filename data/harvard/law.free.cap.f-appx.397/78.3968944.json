California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Pritchett has not filed a response. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The record does reveal a clerical error in the judgment. The judgment should be corrected to reflect that for Counts Four, Five, and Six, Pritchett was convicted and sentenced for conspiracy to commit bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 2113(a), rather than bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a); and for Count Seven, Pritchett was convicted and sentenced for attempted bank robbery, rather than bank robbery. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This matter is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Abr\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
