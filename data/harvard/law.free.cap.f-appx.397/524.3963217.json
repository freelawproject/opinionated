On appeal, Cerpas argues that in imposing his sentence, the district court: (1) clearly erred in finding that he was responsible for at least 50 but less than 150 kilograms of cocaine; (2) plainly erred and violated his due process rights in relying on the surprise testimony at sentencing of an unreliable witness; (3) clearly erred in denying him an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a); (4) clearly erred in applying a three-level managerial-role enhancement, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b); (5) clearly erred in denying him safety-valve relief, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); and (6) plainly erred in relying on improper evidence to determine his sentence. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-16\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. McGuinness, </em>451 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2006). We review alleged discovery violations in a criminal proceeding for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hastamorir, </em>881 F.2d 1551, 1559 (11th Cir.1989). We review the district court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility under the clear error standard, under which \u201cthe sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>408 F.3d 745, 756-57 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Similarly, we review the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>determination that the defendant was entitled to a role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 <em>for dear </em>error. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1355 (11th Cir.2005). We also review \u201ca district court\u2019s factual determinations and subsequent denial of \u2018safety valve\u2019 relief for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>261 F.3d 1071, 1073 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Where no objection to an issue was raised in the district court, however, we review for plain error only. <em>United States v. Neely, </em>979 F.2d 1522, 1523 (11th Cir.1992). We may not correct error on plain error review, \u201cunless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights and then only if (4) the <em>error </em>seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation, ellipsis, and alteration omitted). For an error to be plain, it must be \u201cobvious or clear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">As background, the government\u2019s case against Cerpas relied heavily on transcripts of wiretapped conversations, during which a customer, identified as \u201cCesar,\u201d allegedly made arrangements to purchase drugs and remit drug proceeds with the assistance of other individuals at two different stash houses. In anticipation of trial, the government filed a motion for an order compelling Cerpas to provide a voice exemplar, which the district court granted. Cerpas, however, declined to provide a voice exemplar, and during the second of four sentencing hearings, the government called a cooperating co-conspirator witness, who had met Cerpas in jail and identified Cerpas\u2019 voice as the \u201cCesar\u201d in the wiretapped conversations. The government also offered into evidence ledgers seized from other stash houses, which included various entries for \u201cCesar de Latin,\u201d and the government called the case agent, who was qualified as an expert, to interpret both the intercepted conversations and the ledgers.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">First, we are unpersuaded by Cerpas\u2019 arguments that the district court erred in applying the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard at sentencing to resolve disputed facts, and that the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the drug quantity attributed to him. \u201cIt is by now abundantly clear that once a defendant objects to a fact contained in the PSI, the government bears the burden of proving that disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2009). However, \u201cthe preponderance standard is not toothless,\u201d and the district court must ensure that the government satisfies its burden with \u201creliable and specific evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">Once the Government has presented proper evidence, the district court must either: (1) make an explicit factual finding as to the allegation; or (2) determine that no such finding is necessary because the matter controverted will not be taken into account in sentencing the defendant. If the court declines to resolve a factual challenge because it is not relying on the disputed matter in determining the sentence, it must expressly set out in writing any disputed facts left unresolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-9\"><em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559, 1567-68 (11th Cir.1995) (citation omitted). The sentencing court\u2019s failure to make specific findings of fact, however, does not preclude meaningful appellate review where evidence clearly supports the court\u2019s determination. <em>United States v. Villarino, </em>930 F.2d 1527, 1528-29 (11th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>F.3d 938, 944 (11th Cir.1996) (declining to remand, although the district court failed to make individualized findings concerning an obstruction-of-justice enhancement, because the record clearly reflected the basis for the enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s factual findings for purposes of sentencing may be based on, among other things, evidence heard during trial, undisputed statements in the PSI, or evidence presented during the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Polar, </em>369 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir.2004). A sentencing court may consider any information with sufficient reliability. <em>United States v. Riley, </em>142 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir.1998); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a). To this end, a witness\u2019s voice identification is competent evidence when the witness has some basis for comparing the defendant\u2019s voice with the voice identified as the defendant\u2019s and there is evidence corroborating the identification. <em>Fabacher v. United States, </em>84 F.2d 602, 604 (5th Cir.1936).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In addition, the district court can consider \u201creliable hearsay ..., so long as the defendant has the opportunity to rebut the evidence or generally to cast doubt upon its reliability.\u201d <em>United States v. Query, </em>928 F.2d 383, 385 (11th Cir.1991) (quotation omitted). We afford \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to the district court \u201cin reaching credibility determinations with respect to witness testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1243-44 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted). Witness testimony is incredible as a matter of law if it is \u201cunbelievable on its face.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>775 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir.1985) (quotations omitted). Testimony is unbelievable on its face when the witness testifies to facts that he \u201cphysically could not have possibly observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">We have not explicitly addressed what, if any, inferences may be drawn at sentencing from an individual\u2019s refusal to provide a court-ordered voice exemplar. We have held, however, that it was not improper for a prosecutor in his closing arguments to a jury at trial to comment upon the accused\u2019s refusal to provide a handwriting exemplar as directed by the court. <em>United States v. Nix, </em>465 F.2d 90, 93-94 (5th Cir.1972). We further held that it was not improper for the court to charge the jury that if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had failed to provide a court-ordered exemplar, it might infer that a comparison of such sample with a questioned signature would have been unfavorable to the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">For starters, the district court did not err in resolving the factual disputes at sentencing under the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard because we have repeatedly affirmed application of that standard at sentencing. Cerpas has also failed to show that the district court clearly erred in making its findings as to drug quantity. As the record shows, the testimony identifying Cerpas as a customer in intercepted conversations was not incredible and was supported by corroborating evidence, and the transcripts of wiretapped conversations could be interpreted plausibly to identify the speaker. Moreover, the evidence sufficed to show that intercepted conversations and ledgers concerned drug transactions, that drug ledger entries corresponded to the drug quantities and dates of delivery discussed in intercepted conversations, and that Cerpas operated stash houses. Therefore, the district court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>not clearly err in attributing Cerpas with responsibility for the 50 to 150 kilograms of cocaine associated with the \u201cCesar de Latin\u201d cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Next, we find no merit in Cerpas\u2019 claim \u2014 argued for the first time on appeal \u2014 that the district court erred in relying on surprise opinion testimony because the government\u2019s failure to identify the witness before the sentencing hearing was a violation of Cerpas\u2019 due process rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The scope of discovery in criminal prosecutions is narrower than it is in civil cases. <em>United States v. Hancock, </em>441 F.2d 1285, 1287 (5th Cir.1971). While we have not addressed the government\u2019s disclosure obligations at sentencing, \u201c[a] criminal defendant has no absolute right to a list of the government\u2019s witnesses in advance of the trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>713 F.2d 654, 659 (11th Cir.1983). Notably, the denial of a motion for a list of government witnesses \u201cean be challenged only for abuse.\u201d <em>Hancock, </em>441 F.2d at 1286. And the violation of a standing discovery order will result in the reversal of a conviction only if the violation prejudiced the defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Silien, </em>825 F.2d 320, 323 (11th Cir.1987) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in relying on an unanticipated witness\u2019s testimony at the second sentencing hearing. Indeed, Cerpas has not shown that he had any right to a witness list before sentencing, never moved the court for production of a witness list, and has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the testimony. Further, since Cerpas raised noncompliance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(G) for the first time in his reply brief, he has abandoned that argument. <em>United States v. Magluta, </em>418 F.3d 1166, 1185-86 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">We likewise reject Cerpas\u2019 argument that the district court erred in denying him a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a). The Guidelines provide for a two-level decrease in a defendant\u2019s base offense level if \u201cthe defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a); <em>see Williams, </em>408 F.3d at 756 (\u201cA defendant bears the burden of showing entitlement to a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction.\u201d). Although a guilty plea constitutes \u201csignificant evidence of acceptance of responsibility[.] ... this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.3). Consequently, \u201ca defendant who falsely denies ... relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.1(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">In this case, the district court did not clearly err in denying Cerpas a two-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, per \u00a7 3E1.1(a). Although Cerpas pled guilty, that fact alone did not automatically entitle him to the reduction. <em>See Williams, </em>408 F.3d at 756-57. During the fourth sentencing hearing, the district court found that Cerpas had not been truthful as to his role in the offense and had not truly accepted responsibility. The district court further found that Cerpas\u2019 role was not limited to delivering drug proceeds, as he had admitted, but also included directing the activities of at least two other co-conspirators, coordinating the receipt of 20 kilograms of cocaine, overseeing the stash houses, and laundering drug proceeds. And, notably, Cerpas admitted that he was not eligible for an aceeptance-of-responsi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>bility reduction if the government had met its burden with respect to his role in the offense. Because we have concluded that the district court\u2019s findings as to Cerpas\u2019 role in the offense were not clearly erroneous, and these findings are relevant to the acceptance-of-responsibility inquiry, the district court did not clearly err in denying the acceptance-of-responsibility reduction on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Cerpas\u2019 next claim \u2014 that the district court erred in applying a three-level managerial-role enhancement to his offense level, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 \u2014 is also without merit. Under \u00a7 3B 1.1, a district court may increase a defendant\u2019s role in the offense by three levels if \u201cthe defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1(b). To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the manager or supervisor of one or more participants. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2). In <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>168 F.3d 1234, 1250 (11th Cir.1999), we held that a defendant who \u201cfronted or directly sold cocaine to numerous \u2018runners\u2019 who would then sell the drug to buyers\u201d and give the defendant the resulting profit justified a \u00a7 3B1.1(b) managerial-role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in applying a three-level enhancement, per \u00a7 3B1.1(b), for Cerpas\u2019 managerial role in the offense. As the preponderance of the evidence showed, Cerpas was the manager or supervisor of at least one other participant in the conspiracy, and Cerpas does not dispute that the conspiracy involved at least five participants or was otherwise extensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Nor are we convinced by Cerpas\u2019 argument that the district court erred in denying him safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). The safety-valve provision permits the court to impose a sentence below a statutory-minimum sentence if a defendant meets the five criteria set forth in the statutory subsection. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2; <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2000). The \u201cdefendant has the burden of proving his eligibility for relief under \u00a7 5C1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Relevant to this appeal, to satisfy the safety-valve requirements, the defendant must show that he (1) did not have more than one criminal-history point, (2) was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense, and (3) truthfully provided the government with all the information and evidence he had \u201cconcerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1), (4)-(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(1), (4)-(5). With respect to the third factor identified above, \u201c[t]he burden is on the defendant to come forward and to supply truthfully to the government all the information that he possesses about his involvement in the offense, including information relating to the involvement of others and to the chain of the narcotics distribution.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557. A district court cannot apply the safety valve if it determines that the defendant \u201cwithheld or misrepresented information.\u201d <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>199 F.3d 1281, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">On this record, the district court did not clearly err in denying Cerpas safety-valve relief, per \u00a7 5C1.2 and \u00a7 3553(f). As discussed above, the district comb did not clearly err in finding that (1) Cerpas\u2019 role in the offense was considerably broader than he had admitted and (2) Cerpas was the manager or supervisor at least one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>other co-conspirator. Because Cerpas failed to satisfy at least two of the five criteria for safety-valve relief, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(4)-(5), he was not eligible for this relief. His remaining arguments concerning his satisfaction of the safety-valve disclosure requirements by written submission and his receipt of two additional criminal-history points, per \u00a7 4A1.1(d), are therefore irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Finally, we remain unpersuaded by Cer-pas\u2019 claim \u2014 made for the first time on appeal \u2014 that the district court erred in failing to specify the evidence that it relied on to support its general factual findings. We recognize that sentencing courts should make explicit findings of fact to facilitate judicial review. <em>United States v. Wise, </em>881 F.2d 970, 972-73 (11th Cir.1989). As we have noted, however, the sentencing court\u2019s failure to make specific findings of fact, however, does not preclude meaningful appellate review where evidence clearly supports the court\u2019s determination. <em>Villarino, </em>930 F.2d at 1528-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Here, the district court did not plainly err in failing to specify the evidence that it relied on to support its general factual findings and remand is unwarranted because, as discussed above, there is more than adequate evidence to support the district court\u2019s findings. <em>Id.; Taylor, </em>88 F.3d at 944. Furthermore, Cerpas\u2019 argument that the district court erred in considering unspecified or undisclosed evidence fails because Cerpas has not provided any factual support for the allegation. And, contrary to Cerpas\u2019 argument, we can in fact presume that the district court credited the government witness\u2019s testimony. <em>see Pham, </em>463 F.3d at 1243-44 (reviewing whether the government carried its burden as to the issue of drug weight and concluding that it had based on proffered witness testimony, which the district court \u201cobviously\u201d found credible, although it did not explicitly say so). Lastly, we cannot agree that the district court simply adopted the government\u2019s theory of the case because Cerpas raises this argument for the first time in his reply brief, <em>see Magluta, </em>418 F.3d at 1185-86, and moreover, the argument is not supported by the record, which shows that the district court presided over four sentencing hearings and articulated numerous findings that supported its sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\">.
