He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the Bureau of Prisons\u2019s (BOP) method of calculating his good conduct time (GCT) credit under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-24\">In <em>Sample v. Morrison, </em>406 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2005), we held that, where the prisoner was not claiming he was immediately eligible for release, we lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal of his \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the BOP\u2019s calculation of GCT credit under \u00a7 3624(b). We concluded that the petition was not ripe because the prisoner had not established that he would sustain immediate injury that could be redressed by the relief requested. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-25\">Montague requests the same relief as the petitioner in <em>Sample. </em>However, whether Montague\u2019s projected release date is computed on the basis of the BOP\u2019s interpretation or his own, he is not yet entitled to release. Thus, like the petitioner in <em>Sample, </em>Montague\u2019s petition is not ripe for review, and the instant appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Sample, </em>406 F.3d at 312. Moreover, even if Montague\u2019s request for relief were not premature, his argument is foreclosed. <em>See Barber v. Thomas, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2499, 2504, 177 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010); <em>Moreland v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>431 F.3d 180, 186 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b71-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
