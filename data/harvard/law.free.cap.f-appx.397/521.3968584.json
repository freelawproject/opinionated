Perry appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to terminate his supervised release, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1). On appeal, Perry argues that: (1) the district court abused its discretion by considering his employment history and financial status in denying his motion for early termination of supervised release; and (2) due to the retroactivity of Amendment 706 to the crack cocaine guidelines, he was entitled to a two-point reduction and early termination of supervised release. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We review cases involving modification of supervised release under \u00a7 3583(e) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir.2003) (confirming that sentences of supervised release are reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>see also United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994) (reviewing revocation of supervised release for abuse <em>of </em>discretion). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and its interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">First, we are unpersuaded by Perry\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion by considering his employment history and financial status in deciding whether to grant or deny his motion for early termination of supervised release. Under \u00a7 3583(e)(1), after considering the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), a court may terminate a term of supervised release in which the defendant has already served at least one year. Before terminating supervised release, however, the court must be \u201csatisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the defendant released and the interest of justice.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Supervised release was designed to \u201cimprove the odds of a successful transition from the prison to liberty.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 708-09, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). The goal is, in part, to facilitate training and rehabilitation. <em>Id. </em>at 709, 120 S.Ct. 1795. The statute\u2019s requirement that courts examine \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), and (a)(4)-(7), before terminating supervised release, however, indicates that these were not Congress\u2019s only goals; the nature and circumstances of the offense, deterrence, public protection, correctional treatment, the guideline range established for the offense, pertinent government policies, and uniformity of sentences among defendants committing the same types of crimes, are all also considerations related to supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Here, the record shows that Perry had not satisfied all of the standard conditions of his supervision, particularly those requiring that he be regularly employed and support his dependents. Considering the variety of goals of supervised release, including the need to deter and to protect the public, the district court did not abuse its broad discretion by relying on Perry\u2019s unemployed status and his financial difficulties in denying his motion to terminate his supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Nor do we find any merit to Perry\u2019s argument that the district court failed to consider that his supervised release status constitutes a form of custody, and therefore, due to the retroactivity of Amendment 706 to the crack cocaine guidelines, he was entitled to a two-point reduction and early termination of supervised release. In addressing the distinction between incarceration and supervised release, we have explained that the purposes of supervised release and incarceration are different, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">[t]he primary goal of supervised release is to ease the defendant\u2019s transition into the community after the service of a long prison term for a particularly serious offense, or to provide rehabilitation to a defendant who has spent a fairly short period of time in prison for punishment or other purposes but still needs supervision and training programs after release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\"><em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1199 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting S.Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182) (internal quotation and brackets omitted). Congress has prohibited incarcerating an offender for rehabilitation purposes, but in contrast, an offender\u2019s need for rehabilitation may be considered in prescribing supervised release conditions. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>276 F.3d 1284, 1290 n. 6 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 97, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993)); <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>880 F.2d 1204, 1208 (11th Cir.1989). The Supreme Court has clarified that, \u201c[t]he objectives of supervised release would be unfulfilled if excess prison time were to offset and reduce terms of supervised release. Congress intended supervised release to assist individuals in their transition to community life. Supervised release fulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served by incarceration.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>529 U.S. 53, 59, 120 S.Ct. 1114, 146 L.Ed.2d 39 (2000) (citing S.Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">A district court \u201cmay reduce the term of <em>imprisonment </em>\u201d in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d and the Sentencing Commission has limited retroactive application of Sentencing Guidelines amendments to those listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a). The plain language of \u00a7 1B1.10 provides that, \u201c[i]n a case in which a defendant is <em>serving </em>a term of <em>imprisonment, </em>and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) ..., the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) (emphases added). Amendment 706, listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c), retroactively reduced by two the base offense levels in crack cocaine sentences calculated pursuant to the drug quantity table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">In sum, the district court correctly concluded that supervised release is not a form of custody, and Amendment 706 does not apply after a defendant has been released from custody. Therefore, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>properly determined that Perry, who was released from prison prior to the enactment of Amendment 706, was not entitled to early termination of supervised release based on that amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\">. Moreover, Perry\u2019s contention that \u00a7 3553(a) and \u00a7 3583(e)(1) do not allow for consideration of his work history and finances is without merit. Perry\u2019s supervised release, in part, was expressly conditioned on his ability to maintain full-time employment and support his dependents. Further, Perry\u2019s work history and finances both are related to \u00a7 3553(a)(2)'s goals of deterring future illegal activity and protecting the public because, if Perry could financially support himself and his dependents through lawful employment, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>logically follows that he would be less likely to engage in illegal activity for profit. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
