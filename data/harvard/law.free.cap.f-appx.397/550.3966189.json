Cormier appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his <em>pro se </em>complaint, which alleged various constitutional and statutory violations in connection with his state court divorce proceedings and requirement to pay alimony, for failure to state a claim. The underlying dispute arose after the Georgia Superior Court, per Judge Horkan, entered a final decree dissolving the marriage and awarding Cor-mier\u2019s ex-wife alimony in 2005. <em>Cormier v. Cormier, </em>280 Ga. 698, 698, 631 S.E.2d 663, 664 (Ga.2006) <em>(Cormier </em>I). In June 2009, Cormier filed the present action in federal court against seven defendants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging violations of the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1982, 1983, 1985, 1994, the federal and Georgia RICO statutes, and the common-law torts of intentional infliction of emotional distress and tortious interference with business relations. Cormier\u2019s complaint sought to invalidate the state-court alimony order, among other relief. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, holding that Governor Perdue and Judge Horkan were immune from suit under the doctrines of sovereign and judicial immunity and that Cormier\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted as to all counts. Accordingly, the court dismissed Cormier\u2019s requests for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-15\">Although the district court did not address the defendants\u2019 argument in their motions to dismiss that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Cormier\u2019s complaint, we are compelled to review the district court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. See Zakrzewski v. McDonough, </em>490 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cA federal court must always dismiss a case upon determining that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, regardless of the stage of the proceedings, and facts outside of the pleadings may be considered as part of that determination.\u201d <em>Goodman ex rel. Goodman v. Sipos, </em>259 F.3d 1327, 1332 n. 6 (11th Cir.2001). After thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court lacked ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>risdiction over Cormier\u2019s complaint, which was barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 476-82, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 1311-15, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">\u201cThe <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine places limits on the subject-matter jurisdiction of federal district courts and courts of appeal over certain matters related to previous state court litigation.\u201d <em>Goodman, </em>259 F.3d at 1332. Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, federal district courts cannot review final state court judgments because \u201cthat task is reserved for state appellate courts or, as a last resort, the United States Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009). The Supreme Court has only applied the doctrine on two occasions, and has recently reiterated that the scope of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is exceedingly narrow, \u201cconfined to eases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005); <em>see also Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1268 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Prior to <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>our circuit had traditionally applied a four-factor test to guide the application of the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine, finding that it bars federal jurisdiction where: \u201c(1) the party in federal court is the same as the party in state court; (2) the prior state court ruling was a final or conclusive judgment on the merits, (3) the party seeking relief in federal court had a reasonable opportunity to raise its federal claims in the state court proceeding, and (4) the issue before the federal court was either adjudicated by the state court or was inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Amos v. Glynn County Bd. of Tax Assessors, </em>347 F.3d 1249, 1266 n. 11 (11th Cir.2003) (citations omitted). However, due to the Supreme Court\u2019s cautionary statement in <em>Exxon Mobil </em>that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine \u201chas sometimes been construed to extend far beyond the contours of the <em>Rooker </em>and <em>Feldman </em>cases,\u201d 544 U.S. at 283, 125 S.Ct. at 1521, we have since declined to adhere to the <em>Amos </em>test. <em>See Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1274 (electing to apply <em>Exxon-Mobil\u2019s </em>strict language confining the doctrine to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments\u201d as opposed to the <em>Amos </em>test).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Thus, for the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to apply under the strictures of <em>Exxon-Mobil, </em>we must first determine whether the state court \u201crendered judgment before the district court proceedings commenced.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Cormier filed his federal complaint in this lawsuit on June 2, 2009, almost three years after the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s final decree in his state court divorce action. <em>See Cormier I, </em>280 Ga. at 696, 631 S.E.2d at 665. Because Cormier exhausted his state court remedies well before he filed this federal suit, the state proceedings had ended for purposes of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>Cf. Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1278 (\u201c[B]ecause the Appellants filed the instant federal action while the state court action continued in the appeals process in state court, the state proceedings had not ended.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Secondly, we must determine whether a plaintiff is a state-court loser who is com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>plaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments. <em>See Exxon-Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. at 1521-22. In doing so, our circuit has continued to apply the fourth factor of the <em>Amos </em>test, evaluating whether the plaintiffs claims are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment. <em>See Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1260 (quoting <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 482 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. at 1315 n. 16). \u201cA claim is inextricably intertwined if it would effectively nullify the state court judgment or it succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). Evaluating Cormier\u2019s complaint under this standard, we conclude that it falls directly within the scope of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine\u2019s jurisdictional bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In his complaint, Cormier generally seeks to invalidate the state court\u2019s alimony ruling through various constitutional, statutory, and common law challenges. The essence of his complaint is that various private and state actors conspired to use the Georgia Alimony Statutes, O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 19-6-1 et seq., to place him into a condition of involuntary servitude through an unconstitutional alimony-peonage contract. Although Cormier seeks damages in the amount of $1 million for his alleged injuries, he also expressly prays for an injunction setting aside the current alimony order, any future orders seeking to enforce the court\u2019s divorce decree, and the final judgment of the Georgia Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>we held that the federal courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a similar complaint, which sought to invalidate a state-rendered contempt order in connection with a divorce proceeding. 558 F.3d at 1261. Like Cormier, the plaintiff in <em>Casale </em>attempted to use the federal courts to enjoin his ex-wife from enforcing an aspect of the state-court judgment, arguing that the contempt orders, which held him in contempt for discontinuing retirement payments to his ex-wife, violated the Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act (\u201cFSPA\u201d), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408, by effectively compelling him to retire from military service. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that such a claim, although a federal preemption challenge, was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment and that Casale was \u201cjust the sort of \u2018state-court loser\u2019 the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine was designed to turn aside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration omitted). We concluded that \u201c[i]f Casale believed the state court\u2019s result was based on a legal error, the proper response was the same one open to all litigants who are unhappy with the judgment of a trial court: direct appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Cormier\u2019s complaint is equally barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine because his constitutional and statutory challenges are essentially an effort to block enforcement of the state court\u2019s alimony order. Success on his federal claims would \u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the state court judgment; thus, his claims are inextricably intertwined with the divorce action, and Cormier should have pursued all of his claims on direct appeal. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, his complaint falls within the confines of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>jurisdictional bar, and it is unnecessary for us to address Cormier\u2019s claims raised on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In conclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>we vacate the district court judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss Cor-mier\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">VACATED and REMANDED; DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-11\">. The defendants included the Governor of Georgia (\"Sonny\" Perdue), Judge Horkan, the Chairman of Colquitt County Commissioners, Colquitt County, Cormier\u2019s ex-wife, her attorney, and Cormier's mother-in-law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\">. We note that Cormier abandoned many claims by not raising them in his briefs on appeal. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that, although <em>pro se </em>briefs are liberally construed, \"issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned\u201d). As to the issues Cor-mier did raise, we find them all meritless. Even if the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine was not dispositive of Cormier\u2019s lawsuit, we would still affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Cormier\u2019s complaint for the reasons set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>in its opinion, which warrants no further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b580-32\">.
