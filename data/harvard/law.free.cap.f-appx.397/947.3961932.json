He argues that his adjudication as a career offender did not preclude him from obtaining relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) on account of the retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines concerning crack eo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>caine. Blount maintains that the district court had authority under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to resentence him to a lesser term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Because Blount was sentenced to a statutory minimum life sentence on account of his prior felony drug convictions, the crack cocaine amendments did not lower his guidelines sentence range, and he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1994); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). The Supreme Court has determined that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and that the district court may not impose a sentence below the amended guideline range unless the sentencing court originally imposed a term of imprisonment below the guidelines range. <em>Dillon v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Likewise, the <em>Booker </em>reasonableness standard does not apply in proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). In view of the foregoing, Blount has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">Blount also contends that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without conducting an evidentiary hearing. He argues that his motion raised issues concerning the application of <em>Booker </em>and that all parties should have been present when these issues were resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a defendant need not be present at a \u00a7 3582(c) proceeding. Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4). Generally, a district court must hold a hearing only if it is necessary because the facts are in dispute. <em>See Dickens v. Lewis, </em>750 F.2d 1251, 1255 (5th Cir.1984). Because Blount was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Blount\u2019s motion for a reduction in sentence absent an evidentiary hearing. <em>See id.; </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b973-18\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
