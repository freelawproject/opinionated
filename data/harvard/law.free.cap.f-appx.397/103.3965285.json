California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Reed has not filed a response. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. At his revocation hearing, Reed admitted the fact of his Texas conviction. This admission was a sufficient basis for the district court to revoke his supervised release. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Spraglin, </em>418 F.3d 479, 480 (5th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The revocation proceedings also complied with the requirements of due process. <em>See generally United States v. Holland, </em>850 F.2d 1048, 1050-51 (5th Cir.1988) (per curiam). And the district court\u2019s decision to impose the statutory maximum sentence on revocation was not plainly erroneous. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 265 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b130-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
