On appeal, Lawson argues that the court erred in finding that it lacked authority to grant his motion to reduce his sentence because he was sentenced as a career offender, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Relying on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), Lawson argues that the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses is unwarranted, and that it reflects racial bias against African Americans. Lawson also asserts that his 262-month sentence violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s protection from cruel and unusual punishment, because it over-represents the seriousness of his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In his reply brief, Lawson contends that the district court erred by sentencing him as a career offender at his initial sentencing, because his previous conviction for attempted possession of cocaine was not a qualifying predicate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">In December 2008, a jury convicted Lawson of distributing crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">According to the pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Lawson was responsible for 3.5 grams of crack cocaine. Lawson\u2019s criminal history showed that he had sustained four previous drug-trafficking convictions, including a 2006 conviction for attempt to possess cocaine. In calculating Lawson\u2019s guideline range, the probation officer found that, pursuant to the drug quantity table set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), Lawson\u2019s base offense level would be 20, because he was responsible for 3.5 grams of crack cocaine. The officer also found, however, that Lawson\u2019s previous drug-trafficking convictions qualified him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Accordingly, the officer determined that, because Lawson was a career offender, and the statutory-maximum penalty for his offense was 30 years\u2019 imprisonment, his base offense level was 34. Based on a total offense level of 34, and a criminal history category of VI, the probation officer found that Lawson\u2019s guideline range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">Although the record does not include a transcript of Lawson\u2019s sentencing hearing, the parties agree that the court sentenced Lawson as a career offender. The court sentenced Lawson to a term of 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">Lawson filed the present motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. Amendment 706, which retroactively reduced the offense levels applicable to crack-cocaine offenses by two levels. In his motion, Lawson generally argued that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 provided the court with the authority to retroactively reduce his guideline range. Relying on <em>Kimbrough, </em>Lawson also argued that his 262-month sentence resulted from an unwarranted, and racially discriminatory, disparity between the sentences imposed for powder and crack cocaine offenses. Lawson further asserted that, in light of the disparity between his 262-month sentence and the relatively small amount of crack cocaine that he had possessed, his sentence violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ed the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The court entered an order denying Lawson\u2019s motion. The court found that Lawson\u2019s guideline range had been calculated based on his status as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, and not based <em>on </em>the drug quantity table set forth in \u00a7 2D1.1(c). Relying on our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689, <em>and cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), the court determined that, because Lawson was sentenced based on his status as a career offender, a sentence reduction would not be consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements, as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, the court concluded that a sentence reduction was not appropriate in Lawson\u2019s case, and denied his motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">In the context of a proceeding under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant whose \u201csentencing range ... has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u201d may move the district court to reduce his sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence reduction is not consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy statements where an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Amendment 706, which was made retroactive by the Sentencing Commission, lowered the base offense levels applicable to crack-cocaine offenses, as set forth in the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2D1.1(c). <em>See U.S.S.G., </em>App. C, Amend. 706; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">In <em>Moore, </em>we held that, where a defendant\u2019s offense level is calculated based on the career-offender provision in \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2D1.1(c), Amendment 706 does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. 541 F.3d at 1330. As a result, such a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the district court lacks the authority to grant a reduction. <em>Id. </em>In addition, where a defendant is not otherwise eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a U.S. Supreme Court decision, standing alone, does not provide the court with the authority to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2005). A proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not contemplate a <em>de novo </em>resentenc-ing of the defendant, and \u201call original sentencing determinations [must] remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2693-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (holding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) permits a district court only to substitute an amended guideline for the guideline used at the original sentencing, and that a court lacks the authority to correct mistakes in a defendant\u2019s original sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-16\">Here, the district court correctly found that it lacked the authority to grant Lawson\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706. Amendment 706 did not have the effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>lowering Lawson\u2019s guideline range, because his guideline range was based on his status as a career offender. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough, </em>standing alone, did not provide the court with authority to reduce Lawson\u2019s sentence. <em>See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220-21. Although Lawson argues that the court incorrectly found that he qualified as a career offender, and that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment, both of these issues lay outside the limited scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, and the court lacked authority to address these arguments. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781-82.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-16\">. Moreover, we note that Lawson did not raise the issue of whether he was incorrectly sentenced as a career offender until he filed his reply brief. Accordingly, even if this argument were meritorious, we would not address it. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that we do not address an argument raised for the first time in a litigant's reply brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
