He alleged that his \u201cincoming mail has and continues to be unduly delayed in violation of [Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) ] policy\u201d and that his \u201coutgoing mail has and continues to be broken into and surreptitiously inspected and read in violation of BOP regulations.\u201d He specifically noted that \u201cI am not attacking my conviction here,\u201d and asked for unspecified declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">The District Court denied the petition, agreeing with the Magistrate Judge that Crooker was subject to the \u201cthree-strike\u201d rule of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that he pursued relief under \u00a7 2241 to avoid the filing fee applicable to suits alleging interference with access to mail. <em>See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971) (recognizing a private cause of action to recover damages against a federal agent for violations of constitutional rights). Crooker appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because we have granted Crooker IFP status pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, we must dismiss the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it lacks an arguable basis in fact or law. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). We may summarily affirm if the appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">Crooker\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition does not challenge the basic fact or duration of his imprisonment, which is the \u201cessence of habeas.\u201d <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 484, 498-99, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Instead, Crooker complains that prison officials interfered with his incoming and outgoing mail. These claims have no bearing on the validity of his conviction and a favorable resolution would not result in an earlier release from prison. The claims, therefore, do not reach the \u201ccore of habeas,\u201d and are not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Learner v. Fauver, </em>288 F.3d 532, 542-44 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\">. That rule provides that a prisoner may not be granted <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\"IFP\u201d) status if, on three or more occasions, he brought an action that was dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
