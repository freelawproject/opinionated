The district court sentenced him to serve 324 months of imprisonment and a ten-year term of supervised release. He now moves for leave to appeal in forma pauper-is (IFP) from the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on recent amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-26\">By moving to proceed IFP, Hodges is challenging the district court\u2019s decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 201-02 (5th Cir.1997). Hodges fails to brief, and has thus waived, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>any challenge he may have had to the district court\u2019s determination that the recent, retroactively applicable amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for offenses involving crack cocaine had no effect on Hodges\u2019 sentencing range. <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>590 F.3d 325, 346 (5th Cir.2009). Rather, Hodges argues that the principles announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), apply to Section 3582(c) motions. This argument lacks merit. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671-72 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">Hodges has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Additionally, because this appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b979-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
