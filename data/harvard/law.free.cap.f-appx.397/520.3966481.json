We issued a certificate of appealability on one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP9H\">Whether the district court erred in declining to address the additional [sixth] ground of relief, first mentioned in a reply brief, without <em>sua sponte </em>affording [petitioner] an opportunity to properly present the constitutional claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-21\">We consider petitioner\u2019s reference to his sixth ground of relief in his reply brief not as an attempt to raise it in the brief, but as an indication that petitioner believed that he had raised it in his \u00a7 2254 petition on page 11B. The district court apparently did not consider the reference as such. If the court had construed the reference as petitioner\u2019s request for leave to amend the petition, we are satisfied that the court would have granted leave. A \u201ccourt should freely give leave\u201d to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d and leave should not be denied absent a substantial reason. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a); <em>Espey v. Wainwright, </em>734 F.2d 748, 750 (11th Cir.1984). There was no reason \u2014 such as undue delay or bad faith on petitioner\u2019s part \u2014 to deny leave here.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-22\">To the end that we may avoid having to consider this case more than once on appeal, <em>see generally Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc), we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>remand the case with the instruction that the district court entertain the sixth ground for relief referred to in petitioner\u2019s reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">VACATED and REMANDED, with instruction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
