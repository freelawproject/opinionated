The true posture is not readily evident because the proceedings below were snarled. They were snarled because both the trial judge and counsel for the parties apparently did not recognize, and certainly did not follow, an applicable rule of the Maryland Rules of Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">The Maryland Rules provide ways by which a civil action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>may be disposed of at trial by the court without being submitted to the trier of fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is one rule in this context for jury trials and another rule for non-jury trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Rule 552 concerns an action tried by a jury. Section a provides that in such an action a party may move, at the close of the evidence offered by an opponent or at the close of all the evidence, for a directed verdict in his favor on any or all of the issues. Section b permits a party, whose motion for a directed verdict at the close of evidence offered by an opponent was not granted, to offer evidence, but by so doing he withdraws the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Rule 535 concerns a civil action tried without a jury. It provides that a party may, at the close of evidence offered by an opponent, move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and law the opponent has shown no right to relief. If such a dismissal is granted, it operates as an adjudication upon the merits, unless the court otherwise specifies. In the event the motion is not granted, the party making it does not waive his right to offer evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">It is manifest that a motion for a directed verdict, applicable in a jury trial, may be made at the close of evidence offered by an opponent or at the close of all the evidence, but that a motion to dismiss, applicable in a non-jury case, is, as we pointed out in <em>Quinn Freight Lines v. Woods, </em>13 Md. App. 346, 350, \u201cin order only at the conclusion of the opponent\u2019s case and not at the conclusion of the entire case.\u201d Our observation followed the teachings of the Court of Appeals. In <em>Smith v. State Roads Commission, </em>240 Md. 525, it discussed the motion to dismiss and the motion for a directed verdict. Stating that it was not proper for a party to move to dismiss at the close of all the evidence but was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>proper only at the close of his opponent\u2019s evidence, it said, at 539-540:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">\u201cThe main purpose of the rule [Rule 535] is to allow a party to test the legal sufficiency of his opponent\u2019s evidence before submitting evidence of his own. Should he prevail at this point he avoids the necessity of going further and as well the risk that his own evidence may supplement his opponent\u2019s evidence enough to provide the missing legal sufficiency. If he waits until the close of all of the evidence then the motion becomes a nugacity because all of the evidence is then before the trier of facts and the determination of its legal sufficiency becomes an inseparable and necessary part of his decision. In jury cases, where a different climate prevails, a motion for a directed verdict offered at the close of all of the evidence gives the trial judge an opportunity to make <em>r. </em>quantitative evaluation of the evidence, not to inform any decision to be made by him, but only to assess the propriety of allowing the jury to make findings of fact. The jury does the deciding; the judge simply sees to it that they have enough material to work with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">This was iterated by the Court in <em>Lewis v. Germantown Insurance Company, </em>251 Md. 535, 540-541. Although Rule 535 says nothing about a waiver of the motion to dismiss, if upon its denial evidence is offered by the party making the motion, it necessarily follows that it is waived upon the offering of evidence. This is so because there is then a different quantum of evidence before the court, the legal sufficiency of all of which becomes, as the Court said in <em>Smith, supra, </em>\u201can inseparable and necessary part\u201d of the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">There has been an unfortunate tendency on the part of both bench and bar to ignore the distinctions between Rule 535 and Rule 552. This was forcefully pointed out by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Court of Appeals in <em>Isen v. Phoenix Assurance Co., </em>259 Md. 564, 569-570:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u201cIn <em>Smith v. State Roads Commission, </em>240 Md. 525, 539 (1965), we pointed out that in actions tried by the court without a jury a \u2018motion for a directed verdict\u2019 is not a proper motion. We explained carefully and at length that Rule 535 \u2018was designed especially for non-jury situations.\u2019 We noted in <em>Duck v. Quality Custom Homes, Inc., </em>242 Md. 609, 611 (1966), an appeal from the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, that Rule 535 had not been complied with. In <em>Southwestern Mines Inc. v. P. &amp; J. Coal Company, Inc., </em>244 Md. 180, 184 (1966), we said \u2018this [a motion for a directed verdict] is not a proper motion.\u2019 <em>In Lewis v. Germantown Insurance Company, </em>251 Md. 535, 536-537 (1968), another appeal from the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, we chided the bar for its disregard of the Maryland Rules, especially Rule 535. We cited nine cases in each of which some mention had been made of the bar\u2019s dereliction in this regard. In <em>Antietam-Sharpsburg Museum, Inc. v. William H. Marsh, Inc., </em>252 Md. 265, 267 (1969), we said, \u2018Once again we remind both <em>bench </em>and bar that the motion for a directed verdict, in these circumstances, is improper. Maryland Rule 535.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) Perhaps we should expect that there will always be some members of the bar who will be unaware of the Rules and our decisions concerning them but one would suppose that by now, trial judges, being fully informed, would either reject or refuse to act upon such improper motions. That we have chosen once more to twit both bench and bar in this regard should not provoke speculation that we have done so for any reason other than to focus attention upon the Rules and to remind all hands that they are not guides to the practice of law but precise rubrics \u2018established to promote the orderly and efficient administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>of justice and [that they] are to be read and followed.\u2019 <em>Brown v. Fraley, </em>222 Md. 480,483 (I960).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">That there are some who have not yet received the message is apparent from the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">On 7 October 1969 Lester Moon <em>et uxor </em>and Lester Moon as next friend and natural guardian of Kathryn Marie Moon (Moon) instituted an action in tort in the Circuit Court for Garrett County against Richard Ira Weeks (Weeks). The action was tried without a jury on 18 June 1974. At the close of evidence offered by Moon, Weeks moved for a directed verdict. The motion was denied. A motion for a directed verdict was made again at the close of all the evidence. It was then granted. Moon noted an appeal on 5 July 1974. We dismissed the appeal <em>nostra sponte </em>as premature because no final judgment had been entered. On 22 August \u201cfinal and absolute judgment\u201d in favor of Weeks was entered by order of the court below, with further order that Moon pay the costs. We consider this as a final judgment in favor of Weeks for costs. On 20 September Moon appealed from the judgment. It is this appeal which is now before us.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">In <em>Isen </em>the Court declared, at 570, that although at times in the past it had not dismissed an appeal because of disregard of Rule 535, \u201c[i]t must not be supposed\u201d, quoting <em>Lewis, </em>at 543, \u201cthat the same degree of forbearance will be displayed, in the future, in respect of a similar disregard of the Maryland Rules.\u201d We observe that under Rule 886, applicable to the Court of Appeals, and under Rule 1086, applicable to this Court, a non-jury case will be reviewed upon the law and the evidence. Such review by the appellate court is in nowise dependent upon a motion made under Rule 535. Therefore, we do not even consider dismissing the appeal. To dismiss the appeal for disregard of Rule 535 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>these circumstances, would, in any event, accrue to the benefit of the party who failed to heed the Rule, and this would result in a palpable injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\n<em>ISSUE FOR DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The propriety of the grant of the motion (which we treat as a motion to dismiss) on which the judgment was entered is not before us. As we have seen, it was a nugacity because made at the close of all the evidence. Thus, we deem that the action was decided on the merits. What is before us, therefore, is whether the trial judge was right or wrong in rendering a judgment in favor of Weeks and against Moon. There are two aspects in the consideration of this. The first concerns the law and the second concerns the evidence. The first aspect is whether the court below was erroneous in its application of the law. The second aspect is whether it was clearly erroneous in its judgment on the evidence. Rule 1086. <em>Knowles v. Binford, </em>268 Md. 2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\n<em>THE FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Tallahassee Street, running east and west, and Shenandoah Avenue running north and south, intersect in a residential area in the town of Loch Lynn, Garrett County, Maryland. Tallahassee Street has a descending grade from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>east of its intersection with Shenandoah Avenue through its intersection with Roanoke Street, parallel to and a block west of Shenandoah Avenue. On 2 December 1966 there were no traffic control signs or devices at the intersection of Tallahassee Street and Shenandoah Avenue. There was a street light on the northeast corner of the intersection. There was snow on the streets and they were slick and icy. It was about 10 degrees above zero. Kathryn Marie Moon, 7 years of age, and her brother, David, were sledding in the late afternoon of that day. The usual course was down Tallahassee Street through the intersection of Shenandoah Avenue to Roanoke Street. About 6:20 that afternoon the weather was cloudy and the moon was shining. David heard their mother call them for supper and went to fetch Kathryn, who at the moment, was talking to the janitor at a school located at the southwest corner of Tallahassee Street and Shenandoah Avenue. She persuaded David to let her take one more ride down the slope. She went first and David followed on his sled, both on the north side of Tallahassee Street, because that side of the street was clear, although cinders had been spread on the south side. About this time Weeks, driving his automobile north on Shenandoah Avenue, on the way to church to work on the sanctuary, was approaching its intersection with Tallahassee Street. David saw the headlights of Weeks\u2019s automobile and called to Kathryn. She did not see the automobile or its headlights, but heeding her brother\u2019s warning she turned her sled north into Shenandoah Avenue toward a driveway, at right angles to and leading into the east side of Shenandoah Avenue, under the street light. Cinders prevented her from actually entering the driveway. As she was getting off her sled she was struck by the right front fender of Weeks\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Weeks, called by Moon as an adverse witness, testified that he lived in the neighborhood and knew Kathryn, David and their parents. He had driven about three blocks when the accident occurred. The car headlights were on, \u201cit was dark\u201d. He had no mechanical trouble with his car during the three block drive, was not suffering from fatigue or illness, had not consumed any alcoholic beverage within the preceding eight hours \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t drink\u201d \u2014 and had no need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>to wear spectacles. As he was proceeding across the intersection of Tallahassee Street and Shenandoah Avenue at a speed of 8 to 10 miles per hour, after looking to the right and left and seeing nothing, he heard \u201ca thump hit my right front wheel, and I looked up the hill and saw David, and then I applied my brakes and slid over the bank\u201d into a ditch. David testified that the automobile went half a block before it stopped, but according to a Maryland State Police Officer, called to the scene, it stopped \u201cjust beyond the intersection.\u201d Weeks said he stopped 8 to 10 feet past the intersection. Weeks got out of his car, went back to the intersection and saw Kathryn lying unconscious on the right hand side of the street almost directly under the corner light. He went to a nearby house, called for an ambulance and the police and attempted to notify Kathryn\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>THE LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The \u201cMotion for Directed Verdict\u201d was made in writing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One of the grounds stated therein was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\u201cThat Section 1-149 of Article 66V2 of the Annotated Code of Maryland defines a motor vehicle to be \u2018motor vehicle means a vehicle which is self-propelled or propelled by electric power obtained from overhead trolley wires, but not operated upon rails\u2019 and a sled is not within the meaning of a motor vehicle. Since a sled is not within the meaning of a motor vehicle, a sled would not have any right of way over a motor vehicle upon the highway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">In the argument on the motion at the close of the evidence offered by Moon, Weeks\u2019s attorney referred to the above statute and asserted that a sled does not come within that classification. The judge said: \u201cI would have to concur with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>that.\u201d The attorney continued: \u201cSo therefore \u2014 that the sled actually does not have a right-of-way upon the road, because if you go back to the section dealing with the right-of-way, it only deals with motor vehicles.\u201d The court replied: \u201cYes\u201d. When Moon\u2019s attorney was arguing the motion he agreed that a sled is not a motor vehicle and urged that it was a pedestrian. The court interjected: \u201cIt\u2019s not a pedestrian, it\u2019s a child on a sled.\u201d The transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">\u201cBY MR. GRANT [Moon\u2019s Attorney]: Well, yes, sir, but it\u2019s \u2014 if the sled is not a vehicle, then it\u2019s obviously a pedestrian. I mean you have to \u2014 you either have to be dealing with a vehicle case or a pedestrian case. In either case, you\u2019ve got the same situation. If you want to consider it some kind of a vehicle, which the defendant argues it\u2019s not, you\u2019ve got someone approaching from the right. If you want to consider it a pedestrian, then you\u2019ve got an intersection then, and a pedestrian has a right-of-way at an intersection. Now, as for the matter of the \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">BY THE COURT: Mr. Grant, can you show me one case that says that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">BY MR. GRANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">BY THE COURT: I\u2019d like to see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">BY MR. GRANT: I \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">BY THE COURT: Can you show me one case where a child on a sled has the right-of-way on the public highway?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">BY MR. GRANT: Yes, sir, I \u2014 I\u2019ll \u2014 I intend to cite the cases to your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-12\">BY THE COURT: I\u2019d be interested in seeing them.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>In deciding the case at the close of all the evidence, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201cWell, it is a most unfortunate, tragic situation because this child has been very, very seriously injured, but in order to recover damages, the law provides you must prove three things: You must prove that the defendant was negligent and was the sole cause of the injury. You must prove that the defendant was not guilty of any contributory negligence. Thirdly, you must prove your damages. There is no question but that you proved your damages, just no question at all, but I haven\u2019t found one iota of testimony to hold this defendant guilty of any negligence. The motion will be granted, and I would add to that, without even passing on the question of contributory negligence, because of the youth of these children, their tender years, but even so, to permit or to do it, sledding on this street, certainly is an indication that \u2014 well, they shouldn\u2019t have been doing it, I\u2019ll put it that way, and I am compelled to grant the motion. I say, it was a most tragic thing and this little girl has suffered untold pain and injury, but I cannot put the blame on the defendant in this case. The motion is granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The court had previously observed in denying the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">\u201cI searched my notes and I have one little check mark about the testimony, there is no evidence whatsoever of speed, there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever of the violation of any rules of the road, there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that he wasn\u2019t on his own side of the road or that he didn\u2019t have a right to properly proceed. But the little check mark that I have here, one of the witnesses, the brother, I think, testified that the car \u2014 I don\u2019t know how accurate this testimony is, but his testimony was that the car went a half block beyond the intersection where the impact occurred, now that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the only testimony in the whole case that is even an iota of negligence.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">What the court and counsel below did not consider is that the vehicle laws of this State distinguish between \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d and \u201cvehicles\u201d. Code, Art. 66V2, \u00a7 2 (a) (27) (1967 Repl. Vol.) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">\u201cMotor Vehicle. Every vehicle which is self-propelled except vehicles operated exclusively upon rails or propelled by electric power obtained from overhead wires, but not operated upon rails or tracks.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Section 2 (a) (67) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">\u201cVehicles. Every device in, upon, or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a highway, excepting devices used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks or propelled by electric power obtained from overhead trolley wires, but not operated upon rails or tracks.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">We agree that a sled is not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d. But we think it obvious that it falls squarely within the definition of \u201cvehicle\u201d when a person is transported upon it upon a highway.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Weissberg Corp. v. N. Y. Underwriters Insurance Co., </em>260 Md. 417, 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>By express terms, certain provisions of the Vehicle Laws speak in terms of \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d and others in terms of \u201cvehicles\u201d. In the light of the definitions, we believe that this was deliberate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude that Code, Art. 66V2, \u00a7 231 (a) (1967 Repl. Vol.) applied to \u201cvehicles\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2 (a) (67). It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u201cExcept as hereinafter provided, all <em>vehicles </em>or trackless trolleys shall have the right-of-way over other <em>vehicles </em>or trackless trolleys approaching at intersecting public roads from the left, and shall give right-of-way to those approaching from the right.\u201d (emphasis supplied)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Therefore, on our finding that the sled in this case was a \u201cvehicle\u201d, \u00a7 231 (a) is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">We find support for our view in <em>Hempfling v. Patterson, </em>229 F. Supp. 391 (D.C. Md. 1964).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In that case a child on a sled went through a stop sign and collided with an automobile. Sections 233 and 244 of the traffic laws, dealing with the duty to stop at a stop sign and at the entrance to a through highway, spoke in terms of \u201cvehicles\u201d. The court quoted \u00a7 2 (a) (27) and (67) and said, at 395:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">\u201cThe court has been referred to no Maryland case bearing upon the question of whether or not a sled is a \u2018vehicle<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> within the laws relating to traffic. If, as would appear to be the case, the use of the broader word \u2018vehicle<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (rather than motor vehicle) is advertent in sections 233 and 242, a strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>argument can be made that one riding in a wagon, or upon a sled or other gravity operated mechanism, is in or upon a device by which person or property may be transported, and is the driver of a \u2018vehicle\u2019 required to come to a full stop at the entrance to a through highway or at a stop sign, and yield the right of way. Indeed, apart from the physical problem of how a stop is to be effected, the need for the complete stop by a brakeless vehicle is, if anything, greater than in the case of the ordinary \u2018motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The court observed in a footnote, n. 9, at 395-396: \u201cSee the broad language in Fletcher v. Dixon, 107 Md. 420, 427, 68 A. 875, 878, and R. &amp; L. Transfer Company v. State, 1931, 160 Md. 222, 153 A. 87, involving a coasting wagon in which the court quoted with approval from a Pennsylvania case (Eastburn v. United States Express Co., 225 Pa. 33, 73 A. 977) stating the law applicable to sleds.\u2019\u2019 The court said that, if necessary, it was prepared to hold that because the sled was a vehicle, the automobile, in the circumstances, had the right of way. The holding was unnecessary, however, because the court found there was absence of negligence on the part of the driver of the automobile.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">It is manifest that the judge below based his decision in substantial part on his finding that there was \u201cno evidence whatsoever of the violation of any rules of the road\u201d. He erred in his application of the law. He reached his conclusion because he did not consider that the sled was a vehicle. As a vehicle, however, it had the benefit of the right-of-way statute. It is firmly established that rights of way, created by the Art. 66V2 in 1943, have an important bearing upon the question of negligence and somewhat relax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the strict rule of contributory negligence. <em>Crawford v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>190 Md. 381; <em>Caryl v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>190 Md. 162; <em>Brown v. Bendix, </em>187 Md. 613. But, as a vehicle, it was also subject to the provisions of Art. 66V2, \u00a7 271 (a) (1967 Repl. Vol.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">\u201cEvery vehicle upon a highway within this State at any time when there is not sufficient daylight to render persons, vehicles, animals and substantial objects on the highway clearly discernible at a distance of 300 feet ahead, shall display lighted lamps and illuminating devices as hereinafter respectively required for different classes of vehicles subject to exceptions with respect to parked vehicles as hereinafter stated.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Code, Art. 66V2, \u00a7 278 (1967 Repl.

In <em>State, Use of Taylor v. Barlly, </em>216 Md. 94, 101-102, the Court of Appeals discussed at what age a child may be guilty of contributory negligence. It held, at 102, that a child, 5 years of age or over, may be guilty of contributory negligence, declining to enlarge the ruling in <em>Miller v. Graff, </em>196 Md. 609, that a child four years of age cannot be guilty of contributory negligence. It affirmed the <em>Miller </em>holding in <em>Farley v. Yerman, </em>231 Md. 444, 450. But the Court added in <em>Taylor, </em>at 102, \u201c* * * a child of tender years is bound only to use that degree of care which ordinarily prudent children of the same age, experience and intelligence are accustomed to use under the same circumstances, and they assume the risk only of dangers, the existence of which they know, or which, in the exercise of this degree of care, they should have known.\u201d We noted in <em>Oddis v. Green, </em>11 Md. App. 153, 158:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">\u201cHowever, in <em>Billings v. Shaw, </em>247 Md. 335, the Court made clear that the \u2018tender years rule\u2019 did not apply to a boy of ten, the age of Billings. It said flatly: \u2018Billings was old enough to be bound by the rules of the road and to be guilty of contributory negligence, which would bar his recovery as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">See <em>Leonard v. Bratcher, </em>258 Md. 186; <em>Kane v. Williams, </em>229 Md. 59. <em>Compare Henkelmann v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>180 Md. 591; <em>Bozman v. State, Use of Cronhardt, </em>177 Md. 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">As we have indicated, at the close of the evidence in a civil action tried without a jury, all the evidence is before the trier of fact. The determination of the legal sufficiency of that evidence becomes an inseparable and necessary part of the Court\u2019s decision, which then involves both applicable law and facts adduced. We think that Moon is entitled to a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>trial, tried pursuant to the appropriate Maryland Rules and under applicable laws applied to facts duly found upon material, relevant and competent evidence presented.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for a new trial; costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\">. This may also. be. accomplished in a criminal cause by a motion for judgment of acquittal, Rule 755 a. That motion may be made at the close of evidence offered by the State, or at the close of all the evidence. If the motion is not granted at the close of evidence offered by the State, the accused may offer evidence without having reserved the right to do so, but by so doing, he withdraws his motion, \u00a7 b. When trial is by a jury, appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence may be had only upon a denial of the motion made at the close of all the evidence. <em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\">. On 7 October 1974, Weeks, belatedly recognizing that the proper motion to be made in a non-jury case was a motion to dismiss, moved this Court to return the record to the trial court so that the judgment entered \u201cmay be on a motion to dismiss\u201d. We denied the motion. To prevent further and undue delay, we preferred to treat the motion for a directed verdict, patently improper, as a motion to dismiss, and because it was made at the close of all the evidence, it was, as we have indicated, a nugacity in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\">. Rule 1086, applicable to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, is the same as Rule 886, applicable to the Court of Appeals of Maryland. The Rules read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">\u201cWhen an action has been tried by the lower court without a jup-, this Court will review the case upon both the law and the evidence, but the judgment of the lower court will not be set aside on the evidence unless clearly erroneous and due regard will be given to the opportunity of the lower court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">In reviewing the action of the court below, when the question is one of the evidence, we must consider evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party; and if substantial evidence was presented in support of the trial court\u2019s determination, then it is not clearly erroneous. <em>Delmarva Drill Co. v. Tuckahoe, </em>268 Md. 417, 424, citing <em>A. S. Abell Co. v. Skeen, </em>265 Md. 53, 55; <em>Crosse v. Callis, </em>263 Md. 65, 70-71; <em>Frisoen v. Trapp, </em>258 Md. 629, 633. When the question is one of the law, the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d provisions do not apply. <em>Sica v. Retail Credit Co., </em>245 Md. 606, 611; <em>Pappas v. Modern Mfg. Co., </em>14 Md. App. 529, 538.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b350-9\">. There is noted thereon in handwriting under the date 6-18-74 and over the initials of the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">\u201cDenied at the end of Pltf ,\u2019s case. Granted at end of Def .\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b351-13\">. The record does not disclose the citation of such cases. In denying the motion at the close of the evidence offered by Moon, after argument by counsel, the court said: \u201cAll right, Mr. Grant, let me do it this way, and I think we can save everybody a lot of time. Mr. Stover [Weeks\u2019s Attorney], I am strongly inclined to grant your motion, but I think for the sake of the record I will deny the motion at this time. All right, that will resolve the matter for the time being.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b353-11\">. As we have indicated, evidence offered through the Maryland State Police Officer, was in conflict with the testimony of David that Weeks\u2019s automobile went a half a block before it stopped. According to the Officer it was \u201cjust beyond the intersection\u201d. By ultimately finding not \u201cone iota of testimony to hold [Weeks] guilty of any negligence\u201d, it is apparent that the court assessed the Officer\u2019s credibility, weighed his testimony, and accepted it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b353-12\">. Now Art. 66V2, \u00a7 1-149.

We also agree that a child upon a sled on a street is not a pedestrian. The meaning of pedestrian was not set out in the motor vehicle laws until 1970.

Burrus, </em>13 Md. App. 513. It seems that this was in substance the meaning of pedestrian accepted in appellate opinions prior to the enactment of the statute. See <em>Harris v.

The evidence showed that the motorist was proceeding along an icy through street at 15 to 20 miles an hour when he saw a 9V2 year old child coasting on a sled in an intersecting street.
