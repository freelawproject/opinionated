Simpson, </em>with whom was <em>Gary Howard Simpson </em>on the brief, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b726-13\"><em>William M.

The appeal has not been properly taken pursuant to Rule 1011 (How Appeal to be Taken).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-18\">Maryland Rule 1011 a, in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-19\">\u201cAn appeal to this Court shall be taken by filing an order for appeal with the clerk of the lower court; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>provided, however, that an application for leave to prosecute an appeal in a post conviction case may be filed either with the Clerk of this Court or with the clerk of the lower court to be transmitted forthwith by him, with the record of the post conviction proceeding, to this Court. <em>A copy of the order for appeal shall be served upon all other parties in the manner prescribed by section c of Rule 306 (Service of Pleadings and Other Papers) and proof of such service shall be made in the manner prescribed by section d of Rule 306 (Service of Pleadings and Other Papers).\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The appellant in this case, Edith H. Wallick, candidly acknowledges that she failed to serve upon the appellee, Robert D. Wallick, any notice of this appeal. The appellee has moved, under Maryland Rule 1035 b 2, to have us dismiss the appeal because of the appellant\u2019s failure to comply with Maryland Rule 1011 a. We have no choice but to do so. Judge Gilbert, writing for this Court in <em>Callahan v. Dean, </em>17 Md. App. 67, 71, 299 A. 2d 479, 481, dealt with a similar situation concerning a record on appeal, saying in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">\u201cIn any number of cases, * * * [citations omitted], the Court of Appeals and this Court have stated that the rules of practice are not guides or merely helpful hints to the practice of law. They are precise rubrics established to promote the orderly and efficient administration of justice, <em>and they are to be read and followed. </em>\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">We again made our position very clear in <em>McAlily v. Bailey, </em>18 Md. App. 413, 416, 307 A. 2d 500, 502:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">\u201cAs we have tried to make clear in several of our recent reported decisions, the rules which govern the procedures which must be observed in appealing to this Court \u2018are to be read and followed.\u2019 <em>Callahan v. Dean, </em>17 Md. App. 67, 71, 299 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>A. 2d 479 (1973); <em>Laukenmann v. Laukenmann, </em>17 Md. App. 107, 299 A. 2d 466 (1973). In a number of unreported decisions of this Court other putative appellants have also been made aware of our firm insistence that <em>the rules of appellate procedure must be observed. </em>\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">This is not a case where Notice of Appeal was sent but somehow failed to reach appellee\u2019s counsel. In this case, no such notice was even sent. We dismiss the appeal. We note that even had the merits of the question been reached, the appellant would not have prevailed. This case, coming to us initially from a decision of Judge James H. Pugh in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, was sent back by us in an unreported decision (Nos. 335 and 496, September Term, 1972) with the following direction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201cThe court\u2019s rulings are sufficiently unclear that there is some basis for either interpretation . . . Accordingly, we remand the case to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for the passage of a clear order establishing the obligations of the parties. The court may entertain such additional evidence as it feels is necessary or desirable for the passage of such an order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The order ultimately forthcoming from Judge Ralph G. Shure in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County was \u201ca clear order establishing the obligations of the parties\u201d within the contemplation of our earlier decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
