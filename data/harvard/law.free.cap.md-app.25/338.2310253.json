Zimmerman, </em>261 Md. 11, where the record reflected only defense counsel\u2019s verbalization of the election of a bench trial, the Court of Appeals decided that a post-conviction proceeding was the most appropriate forum for deciding in the first instance whether the defendant had knowingly foregone his right to jury trial. The Court concluded that a \u201cpreferable practice\u201d in accepting an election of trial by the court was for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u201c. . . the trial judge to determine on the record whether this is a knowing election on the part of the accused of a court trial in lieu of a jury trial . . . .\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>261 Md. at 25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Appellant seizes upon that closing paragraph, and asks us to go two steps beyond. He would have us not only elevate the foregoing \u201cpreferred practice\u201d to a compulsory ritual \u2014 an alternative this court expressly rejected in <em>Miller v. Warden, </em>16 Md. App. 614, 624 \u2014 but also require that the procedure apply in the opposite situation, <em>viz., </em>where the accused elected a jury trial in lieu of a court trial. He would have the court educate the defendant upon the advantages of trial by judge alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">We note at the outset that, unlike the facts before the <em>Zimmerman </em>Court, this appellant personally chose to be tried by a jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Trial by Judge Perrott or a jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">MR. WILLIAMSON: By a jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">As in <em>Zimmerman, </em>however, appellant has never indicated that he wanted anything other than the mode of trial he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>selected and made no objection on that basis at the trial. We therefore decline to decide the ultimate question of appellant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable election. The evidentiary basis for his argument, if there is one, has not as yet been established and thus must await post-conviction proceedings. Md. Rule 1085; <em>Zimmerman, supra, </em>261 Md. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We will, however, decide the penultimate question of the trial court\u2019s responsibility when the accused elects a jury trial. Appellant directs our attention to Maryland Rule 741 which provides that he \u201cmay elect to be tried by jury or by the Court.\u201d Pointing out the historical (and somewhat unusual) importance of the court trial in Maryland law, he then warms over dishes we have served to others and serves them back to us morsel by morsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">\u201c[J]udges are men of discernment . . . .\u201d <em>State v. Babb, </em>258 Md. 547, 550.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">A judge presides impartially because of his \u201cprofessional expertise, experience and judicial temperament . . . .\u201d <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>260 Md. 227, 233.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-12\">The court trial \u201cis a boon.\u201d <em>Rose v. State, </em>177 Md. 577, 581.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-14\">Judges have \u201cwisdom and experience.\u201d <em>Gunther v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 181, 184.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">Using our pride, like that of Brutus, as the fatal flaw with which he would ensnare us, appellant reasons that, at the very least, he should have been advised of the multitude of admirable qualities he was foregoing by electing trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">Hoist as we are upon our own petard we dare not grimace lest we show signs of hurt. We are amused, if not bemused, by appellant\u2019s argument, but find ourselves none the less unpersuaded. Having decided that the trial judge need not affirmatively inquire into an accused\u2019s decision to forego a jury trial, <em>Miller v. Warden, </em>16 Md. App. at 624, we are certainly not going to impose that obligation when the defendant chooses to exercise his jury trial right. Trial by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>jury is the manner of trial guaranteed a defendant by both the Maryland Declaration of Rights, Articles 5 and 21; and the Federal constitution, 6th and 14th Amendments, <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U. S. 145. The court trial in Maryland has been provided as an alternative to defendant as a matter of governmental largesse; and our self-laudatory remarks, when read in context, were meant simply to point out that the court trial alternative is not necessarily a deprivation, and indeed has some advantages including \u201cexpertise\u201d and \u201cexperience.\u201d In any event, the trial judge need only ask which mode of trial is preferred, and if counsel responds, satisfy himself that the decision was the defendant\u2019s. <em>Miller, </em>16 Md. App. at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">While hardly so aristocratic as the Montagues and Capulets, nor quite as bloody as the Hatfields and McCoys, an interfamily feud became a bitter reality for appellant, James Louis Williamson, the woman with whom he lived and her children among whom were Denise (Nessie) Short and Calvin (Lee) Matthews. On August 8, 1973, sometime during the day, Lee got into a \u201cfuss\u201d with a Mrs. Kane. Nessie accompanied Lee to Mrs. Kane\u2019s house to talk with her. The discussion degenerated rapidly into an exchange of threats. Lee \u201creasoned\u201d with a stick and Mrs. Kane with an iron pipe. From the combat that ensued one of the gladiators, Mrs. Kane, emerged with a bloody nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Later that day, Mrs. Kane\u2019s daughter, Jacqueline, related these events to her brother-in-law, Charles Kessler. He went to Lee\u2019s house, purportedly armed with a shotgun, and threatened Lee. In addition to blaming Lee for bloodying Mrs. Kane\u2019s nose, Mr. Kessler accused him of hitting his four year old son.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Upon hearing shots outside, Nessie, who was by then home, called the police. When they arrived, Nessie could no longer see Mr. Kessler from her house and was afraid to leave. After the police departed, appellant Williamson arrived home. Nessie and Lee told him what had happened. Thereafter it is unclear whether Mr. Kessler reappeared and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>resumed his threats or whether Mr. Williamson and Lee sought Mr. Kessler. It <em>is </em>clear that the argument over their families\u2019 squabblings resulted in Mr. Kessler\u2019s death. The day ended when Mr. Williamson shot and killed Mr. Kessler \u2014 in self-defense according to Mr. Williamson. The jury did not agree. He was convicted of second degree murder and the use of a handgun in commission of a crime of violence, following trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, presided over by the Honorable James A. Perrott.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Reputation Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Appellant claims that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence of the deceased\u2019s reputation which he sought to establish both generally and by testimony of specific acts. Appellant\u2019s counsel below somewhat inartfully articulated the purpose or purposes the evidence was to serve. The trial court apparently treated the evidence as offered to prove the appellant\u2019s reasonable apprehension of danger and consequent need to defend himself at the time of the killing, and ruled accordingly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">\u201c. . . you have to sufficiently establish a knowledge of the defendant of the propensity of the victim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The trial judge was correct with respect to reputation evidence offered to prove the defendant\u2019s state of mind. Contrary to the general reputation rule which prohibits evidence of specific acts, a defendant asserting self-defense may offer evidence of specific acts <em>of which he was aware </em>at the time of the killing. Such evidence bears on the reasonableness of his actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">\u201cIt is, of course, generally true that the reputation of the deceased cannot be shown by evidence of specific acts. However, where there is testimony tending to support the theory of self-defense, the presence of such testimony entitles the defendant to the benefit of certain rules of evidence which would not otherwise be available. It is competent for him to prove his knowledge of facts which would have a reasonable tendency to justify his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>asserted belief as to the existence of a deadly purpose in the overt acts of the deceased . ... <em>On the issue whether or not the accused had reasonable . grounds to believe himself in imminent danger, he may show his knowledge of specific instances of violence on the part of the deceased. Previous acts of violence by the deceased, especially if committed recently, known to the defendant, </em>might have an even stronger influence on his mind than would be produced by knowledge of the reputation of the deceased for violence.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>182 Md. 653, 659; <em>accord, Gunther v. State, </em>228 Md. 404, 410; <em>Barger v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 565, 568-569, <em>cert. denied, </em>249 Md. 731. [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Although counsel had proffered that he could prove specific violent acts of which his client was aware before the killing, after arguments and the trial court\u2019s ruling permitting him to do so, he was unable to produce the proffered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Trial counsel did, however, continue to doggedly assert the admissibility of evidence of deceased\u2019s reputation irrespective of appellant\u2019s prior knowledge. Throughout a substantial portion of the transcript, there is a recurring colloquy between trial court and counsel on its admissibility. In response to the trial judge\u2019s previously mentioned ruling, appellant\u2019s counsel at various times protested:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">\u201cI am not attacking it from that viewpoint. I am only bringing it in as a matter of the man\u2019s reputation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">\u201cYour Honor, I am entitled to bring in as many witnesses as I wish to show a reputation in the neighborhood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Then, after the court quoted dictum from <em>Jones v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 677, 684, suggesting the admissibility of evidence of the deceased\u2019s reputation for violence the appellant\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">\u201cI have contended that all along.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Although we must strain to do so, we will give appellant the benefit of any doubt and interpret his counsel\u2019s remarks as arguing the admissibility of the proffered evidence on an alternative, and conceptually distinct basis, <em>i.e., </em>to bolster or corroborate his version of the circumstances of the encounter with the deceased. After reciting the prior knowledge of specific acts rule 1 Wharton, <em>Criminal Evidence, </em>\u00a7 236 goes on to explain that alternative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">. . after the defendant has laid a proper foundation by adducing some evidence tending to show that he acted in self-defense, he may introduce evidence of the turbulent and dangerous nature of the victim. Where the purpose of the evidence is to show that the defendant had reason to apprehend harm, it must appear that at the time of the encounter he had knowledge of the victim\u2019s reputation, because otherwise his conduct could not have been influenced thereby. <em>But where the purpose of the evidence is to corroborate testimony for the defendant as to the circumstances of the encounter, such corroborative evidence is admissible whether the defendant had knowledge of the victim\u2019s reputation or not.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The issue thus resolves itself into one of relevancy. Does evidence of the victim\u2019s reputation, whether or not known to the defendant, make the testimony regarding appellant\u2019s encounter with the deceased \u201cmore probable than it would be without the evidence?\u201d C. McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>(2d ed.), \u00a7 185 at 437, <em>Gray v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 478, 487, <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Md. 725. In the case at bar the appellant had introduced evidence tending to show that he shot the victim in self-defense. The State had produced only one witness, the victim\u2019s sister-in-law, who testified that although she knew the victim well, she had never seen him carry a gun. Since appellant testified that he shot Mr. Kessler because he was armed with a shotgun and threatened him and children in the house, evidence of the victim\u2019s propensity for violence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and shotguns was crucially important, if for no other purpose than to counter the inference of pacifism conferred by the sister-in-law\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Although this Court has dealt many times with the admissibility of reputation as bearing on the accused\u2019s state of mind when self-defense is raised, we have never dealt directly with reputation evidence as tending to corroborate appellant\u2019s account of the circumstances of the killing. In <em>Jones v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 677, 685, n. 1, Judge Thompson expressly declined, as unnecessary, to rule upon that issue, notwithstanding the fact that he had included significant dictum on the point in his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">\u201cAt the conclusion of the testimony the appellant proffered as a witness, the deceased\u2019s mother stating that she would testify to the violent reputation of the deceased. The court declined to permit the witness to testify, ruling that since she had been present in the courtroom during the entire trial, and not sequestered as were all other witnesses, pursuant to Md. Rule 753, she could not testify. Appellant also proffered the daughter and sister of the deceased for the same purpose but the court also declined to permit their testimony on the same basis. Even though the admission of the testimony of witnesses who violate a sequestration order is in the sound discretion of the trial judge, <em>Hill v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 65, 262 A. 2d 573, we think the trial judge probably should have admitted the testimony of the mother, daughter and sister of the deceased as to his reputation for violence. We do not need to rule upon the point since we find reversible error elsewhere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>p. 684.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">We now declare what Judge Thompson implied. Assuming the requisite of relevancy, evidence of the victim\u2019s violent reputation is admissible as corroborative of appellant\u2019s self-defense account of the crime. Unlike the state-of-mind exception allowing evidence of specific acts, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>customary rule allowing only evidence of general reputation applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Here, despite the trial judge\u2019s expressions to the contrary, as each defense witness was called he permitted appellant to elicit that the victim\u2019s reputation was bad and that he had a penchant for shotguns. Objections to questions regarding specific acts were consistently and properly sustained. Regardless of the condition of prior knowledge erroneously expressed as a prerequisite in the court\u2019s ruling, the trial judge properly admitted the evidence appellant sought to introduce. Whatever the judge\u2019s reasons, the admissible evidence of the victim\u2019s general reputation that appellant wanted in, came in. The evidence of specific acts of violence was properly precluded for reasons above stated. The appellant has no ground to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The Bloody Nose</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Appellant\u2019s objection to introduction of a photograph of Mrs. Kane\u2019s bloodied nose may be summarily dealt with. We have examined the photograph and in the light of the criteria set out in <em>Carroll v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 412, <em>cert. denied, </em>262 Md. 745 we cannot say the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Although the photograph showed an injury inflicted by someone other than the appellant, the event depicted was the <em>causa belli </em>precipitating the day\u2019s events and thus obviously relevant. <em>Peterson v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 478, 501-502, <em>cert. denied, </em>266 Md. 735, 738, 741. As we see it, dramatization of the fight between Mrs. Kane and Lee aided rather than detracted from appellant\u2019s argument of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Reconsideration of New Trial Grant</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">After guilty verdicts were rendered against appellant, sentencing was postponed pending presentence investigation. At the disposition hearing three months later, appellant\u2019s counsel moved and argued for a new trial on the basis that the motions for judgment of acquittal should have been granted. The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney who had tried the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>case had since departed from the office and another Assistant was sent in his stead. Claiming no notice of the new trial motion and confessing no knowledge of the facts of the case, the Assistant asked that the matter be continued to allow him to prepare. Judge Perrott, obviously perturbed at what he termed the lack of \u201ccontinuity\u201d in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, told appellant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">\u201cI will grant your motion for new trial, Mr. Kaplan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The State strongly protested and asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">\u201cI am sure there is an argument to be presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The court agreed, saying \u201cI know there is,\u201d and acquiesced in the State\u2019s request for a two-day continuance, but with the following caveat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">\u201c. . . let the message go out that there is to be continuity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">At the subsequent hearing the original prosecutor argued as amicus curiae and the motion was denied. When appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the reversal of the apparent grant of the motion, the court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-13\">\u201cI didn\u2019t grant it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">Appellant acknowledges that the majority of jurisdictions permit reconsideration of the grant of a motion for new trial, 24 C.J.S., <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 1510, 58 Am.Jur.2d, <em>New Trial, </em>\u00a7 217, but argues that the Maryland rule should be that once the motion is granted, reconsideration is prohibited. Although there may be situations where reconsideration of the grant or denial of a new trial is arguably inappropriate,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the present case is clearly not such a situation. Sentencing had not taken place, thus judgment had not been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">We further note the use of the word \u201cwill\u201d in the trial court\u2019s language, \u201cI will grant your motion.\u201d We are told by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>that use of that verb as an \u201cauxiliary followed by a simple infinitive [grant] . . . can indicate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">1. Simple futurity . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">2. Likelihood or certainty . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">3. Willingness . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">4. Requirement or command . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">5. Customary or habitual action . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">6. Capacity or ability . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">7. . . . Probability or expectation . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">The fact that the judge did not treat the matter as ended by his statement \u2014 which if interpreted as appellant urges would have concluded the case \u2014 but rather granted the continuance urged upon him by the State to permit argument to be presented thereafter, clearly indicates his intention in using the term to express either a \u201cprobability or expectation\u201d or a \u201csimple futurity.\u201d In context it cannot be seriously argued that it indicated \u201ccertainty.\u201d We interpret the language in accordance with the court\u2019s actions and expressions as meaning a future intention to grant, rather than a present order. Furthermore, appellant\u2019s argument of insufficiency of evidence was the same he had unsuccessfully made twice before on motions for judgment of acquittal. At no time did the trial court indicate concurrence with the merits of appellant\u2019s argument; on the contrary, Judge Perrott acknowledged the significance of the State\u2019s argument, criticizing only \u201cthe system.\u201d While perhaps over-reacting, the trial judge was merely dramatizing his displeasure with the State\u2019s unpreparedness. Even if the motion had been granted, the reversal of that decision was within the trial judge\u2019s discretion under the circumstances indicated.
