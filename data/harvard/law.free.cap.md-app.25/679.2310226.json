Few, if any, elected officials have survived a long political life without some impugning of their motives. This, the public figure must be content to bear,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or alternatively, his defense can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>to open himself to the \"rigid scrutiny-of those who hold him suspect. Indeed the temper nf the times compels one to endure 'even the proddings -of .the curious.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For a public official to do less would, justify the\u2018suspicions of his critics.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The \u201cera of openness\u201d seems a recent manifestation of the public will. It =is not surprising that prosecution for obstruction of justice \u2014 the coverup crime \u2014 has become prevalent, if not fashionable, in these serious seventies. It is a crime that breeds on fear, and as such finds fertile fields among those dependent upon the public weal. It is central among the crimes with which Samuel A. Green, Jr., State's Attorney for Baltimore County, was charged in a sixteen count indictment and convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The indictment arose peripherally from an investigation of \u201callegations of corruption of public officials in connection with the'arrest, prosecution and escape of one John Edward [Liddie] Jones.\u201d The Attorney General\u2019s office conducted the investigation by authority of a;gub.ernatorial directive dated November 13, 1972 issued in accordance with Article V, \u00a7 3, of the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The incident which appellant was attempting to obscure arose from the dismissal of gambling charges erroneously placed against the owner of an ..automobile service station, one Kneass Harrington. Properly indignant that his wrongful arrest would remain a matter of public record-open to anyone\u2019s perusal (see Md. Code, Art. 76A, <em>supra), </em>Mr. Harrington sought some means of expungement. The Court of Appeals had not yet held that such authority lay in .the trial courts, <em>John Doe v. Commdr., Wheaton Pol. Dept., </em>273 Md. 262, and Mr. Harrington\u2019s-pleas to at least two attorneys fell upon deaf ears. They knew of no procedure to procure expungement even of an arrest record. Mr. Harrington was, however, later put in contact with an investigator for, ;and confidant of, Mr. Green, namely Louis W. Irvin, whom Mir.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Harrington had known previously. At Mr. Irvin\u2019s suggestion, Mr. Harrington wrote Mr. Green requesting the expungement of his arrest record. When Mr. Irvin again contacted Mr. Harrington, it was to collect the $750 for \u201clegal\u201d services involving the expungement. The evidence revealed that at Mr. Green\u2019s suggestion the petition to expunge was, prepared and effectuated by Deputy State\u2019s Attorney Stuart Hirsch, who after preparation obtained' an accommodation signature from Stephen Miles, a friend and attorney outside the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Some apprehension seems to. have arisen, in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office when Mr. Harrington became aware and indignant that the FBI still maintained a record of his arrest; however, the real anxiety came with the Governor\u2019s order for an investigation of the Liddie Jones case, in the vortex of which was Deputy State\u2019s Attorney Hirsch. Although the initial Jones' investigation was not focused on Mr. Green, the Governor\u2019s directive to the Attorney General contained the unsettling, closing paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201cIn the event your investigation of the above discloses acts or conduct in other areas which warrant further investigation,, grand jury action or prosecution,, you are hereby directed to. pursue the same, and you and' the members' of your staff designated by you shall have all of the same powers with respect thereto that have been conferred by me as to the above..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">That mandate, and the. discontented rumblings of Mr. Harrington, supplemented perhaps by questionable authority to expunge at all (prior to <em>John Doe, supra), </em>awakened Mr. Green to the precariousness of his own position, inevitably to be subjected to the harsh light of investigation. Through Mr. Hirsch, he first attempted to have Stephen Miles create a Harrington file, nunc pro tunc. Failing; this he had his deputy solicit his. (Hirsch\u2019s) father, also a lawyer, to&lt; provide: an alternative cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">What Mr. Green did not know, but came to suspect, was that Mr. Hirsch was cooperating completely with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>investigators. He had become disenchanted with Mr. Green, at one time his idol, and admitted having developed a deep-seated resentment toward him. Beyond that, although offered no immunity, his cooperation would not go unnoticed in regard to his own investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">As rumors increased, so too did Mr. Green\u2019s trepidation. The $750.00 cash payment by Mr. Harrington to Mr. Irvin was returned in like kind with an admission by Mr. Irvin that Mr. Harrington owed Mr. Green an expression of gratitude for his generosity. Unknown to the participants, this act was performed under police surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">When Mr. Hirsch\u2019s investigatory involvement became more apparent, his denials of police participation to Messrs. Green and Irvin were met with threats of bodily harm and even death upon the confirmation of those suspicions. The threats were not made good either when Louis Irvin was indicted, tried and convicted, see <em>Irvin v. State, </em>23 Md. App. 457, or when Mr. Green was indicted and tried in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. He was convicted by a jury of misconduct in office, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and attempted subornation of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The crux of Mr. Green\u2019s crime was his effort to hide his office\u2019s involvement in the Harrington arrest record expungement at a time when investigatory bodies were scrutinizing the activities of that office under a broad gubernatorial mandate. It was not necessary to prove that Mr. Green had profited by the expungement, nor even that an attempt to obtain expungement was or would have been a crime (see <em>John Doe, supra). </em>By his wrongful attempts to mutate information sought by and for the grand jury, the crimes were complete:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">\u201cThe nature of the proceedings in which the witness [in this case, Mr. Hirsch] is to testify is immaterial on the question of the criminal character of acts designed to influence the testimony of a witness. . . .\u201d F. Wharton, <em>Criminal Law and Procedure </em>(Anderson ed.) \u00a7 1281 at 629.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Had the information sought been the Sermon on the Mount, its deliberate mutation would nonetheless have been a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Appellant raises ten questions alleging error. The answers for the most part are of a factual rather than legal nature which became obvious after a review of the four thousand page transcript. Explaining the answers in context accounts for the length to which we must go in responding. For that reason related questions are treated together in an effort to curb our own verbosity.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">I.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">\u201cDid the Court err in denying Appellant\u2019s Motion to Compel Election as to Counts of the Indictment and permitting the jury to hear both the conspiracy concept charges and evidence of alleged substantive offenses simultaneously?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">After reciting Md. Rule 735 to show that the court below <em>could </em>have ordered \u201can election or separate trials of counts,\u201d appellant then quotes <em>Wanzer v. State, </em>202 Md. 601 to indicate that the court <em>should </em>have, subject only to the \u201climitation . . . that Courts will guard against injustice.\u201d Recognizing the improbability of success in appellate efforts to prove abuse of judicial discretion, appellant takes the more rigid view that he has a <em>right </em>to a trial of the substantive crimes, separate from a charge of conspiracy to commit those crimes. His argument seems to rely almost entirely upon a single sentence quoted from <em>Wilson, Valentine and Nutter v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 653, 666, <em>cert. denied, </em>258 Md. 731:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">\u201cIf the State chooses to prosecute an individual conspirator for a substantive crime, he is entitled to a separate trial on that substantive crime on demand, even though the substantive crime constitutes an overt act tending to establish the conspiracy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Appellant is not the first to utilize that language to assert such right, <em>Mason, Taylor &amp; Taylor v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 130, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 763, 767; 416 U. S. 907. There we said, as here we repeat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201cUnfortunately for the appellant [s\u2019] position, however, the quotation is lifted out of context.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In <em>Valentine </em>the Court was facing joinder of defendants, as well as joinder of multiple counts and indictments. Some were related, some were not, although all of the defendants had been charged with a single conspiracy. In context, it is clear that the Court intended that the separate trial to which a conspirator had a right for substantive crimes, was restricted to those substantive crimes which the defendant had <em>not </em>conspired to commit. It would be foolhardy and purposeless to require as of right two trials \u2014 one for a crime committed and one for a conspiracy to commit the same crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The prejudice appellant infers from joinder is based upon his belief that, had a severance been granted, he could have precluded the admission of a statement made to police officers by Louis Irvin since that statement, he contends, would not have been admissible except as \u201cacts occurring during a continuing conspiracy.\u201d <em>Greenwald v. State, </em>221 Md. 245, 250. We note, however, that <em>Greenwald </em>at 254 itself refutes the very foundation of his prejudice argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">\u201cIt has been held that even though the indictment charges a substantive crime on a specified date but the proof shows that there was, in fact, a conspiracy to commit the substantive crime, the acts and declarations of one conspirator are admissible against the other, and the rules of evidence are the same as where conspiracy is expressly charged. 22 C. J. S. <em>Criminal Law, </em>Sec. 756b. The court so held in <em>People v. Novotny </em>(Ill.), 20 N.E.2d 34, 35. There the indictment charged Novotny with maliciously damaging a building on September 8, 1937. The court said: \u2018When, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the crime charged has been committed in pursuance of a conspiracy, even though the indictment does not charge conspiracy, it is competent to show that the erime committed was the result of a conspiracy and every act of the conspirators is admissible, even though the commission of other crimes is disclosed.\u2019 See also <em>Commonwealth v. Hancock </em>(Super. Ct. Pa.), 112 A. 2d 407, 410, where the charge was of a substantive crime and the court held that since the defendants had been shown to have had a common intent, plan and design, the declarations of Miller, one conspirator, were admissible against the appellee Hancock. The opinion relied on <em>Commonwealth v. Sheaffer </em>(Super. Ct. Pa.), 23 A. 2d 215, 217, in which various authorities to the same effect are set forth at some length. See also <em>Coplin v. United States, </em>(9th Cir.), 88 F. 2d 652, <em>cert. den., </em>301 U. S. 703, 81 L. Ed. 1357; <em>State v. Tennyson </em>(Minn.), 2 N.W.2d 833, 837.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">This Court has indicated agreement with the other Courts to which we have referred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">II.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">\u201cDid the Court err in admitting a typewritten copy of an alleged \u2018corrected\u2019 statement of Louis Irvin, an alleged co-conspirator, and did not require instead the playing of a tape recorded version of said statement, which was the \u2018best evidence\u2019 in the case?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">The typewritten statement of the co-conspirator, Louis Irvin, which was originally taken on a tape recording by the State Police, was introduced over appellant\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number><em>McGuire v. State, </em>200 Md. 601, 606, the Court of Appeals assumed that a recording tape would have been the best evidence of certain conversations; thus, reasons appellant, he was entitled to the best. Beyond that, he points to prejudice in the jury\u2019s inability to weigh voice inflection and intonation in determining the meaning of the statement. It is not contended upon this appeal that the transcripts are inaccurate or that the conversations which were recorded did not take place. See also <em>Raimondi v. State, </em>265 Md. 229, 230, <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U. S. 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In <em>Forrester v. State, </em>224 Md. 337, tapes were acknowledged as the best evidence of a conversation and as such were permitted introduction over appellant\u2019s objection. The Court succinctly construed the rule to be applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\u201cThe best evidence of which the case is capable must be produced, and secondary, or inferior evidence is only admissible after a proper foundation has been laid, showing good and sufficient reasons for the failure to produce the primary evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Such foundation was laid and sufficient reasoning was produced for the substitution of the original tape. The State showed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">1. The transcription had been carefully prepared, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>reviewed and corrected by a State Police Lieutenant and proffered the transcript as \u201ca more understandable form than the tape would be. The tape is kind of fast in parts and slow at parts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">2. The original tape was evidence in the <em>Irvin </em>case, <em>supra, </em>then on appeal to this Court and even now pending on certiorari before the Court of Appeals. Although it could be removed by court order little purpose would be served by so doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">3. A copy of that tape had been made and given to appellant. Recording equipment was available even at trial for his use and he was free to use it for checking accuracy, cross-examination, introduction on his own behalf or any other purpose which was the basis of his original objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">We think this meets the test of <em>Forrester </em>although the practice followed in <em>Raimondi </em>of introducing both tape and transcripts for clarity and comparison is certainly preferable. The dilemma here, however, was whether to have the original tape remain with the Irvin case on appeal or introduce it at Mr. Green\u2019s trial. Even a copy of the original tape would have been subject to a \u201cbest evidence\u201d objection. Finally, although prejudice was speculatively alleged regarding voice intonations, there was no evidence thereof produced. If it were within appellant\u2019s awareness he has not brought it within ours. Had it been so at trial he was free to overcome it with the duplicate tape given him by the State. No reason has been shown why Mr. Irvin\u2019s appeal should have been jeopardized by removing evidence more crucial in its original state there than here.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">We see no prejudice, we find no error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-11\">III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-12\">\u201cDid the Court err in permitting the State to exploit the subject of Appellant\u2019s alleged \u2018sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>misconduct\u2019 despite a pretrial limiting order requested by the State that such testimony would not be admissible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">IV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">Did the: Gowt err in denying Appellant\u2019\u00bb Motion that the State be precluded from cross examining him (M \u2018marital infidelity\u2019 and \u2018sexual misconduct\u2019 in the event Appellant chose to take the stand in his own defense and testify fully concerning the allegations set forth in the Indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">V.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">Was the Appellant afforded a full and complete opportunity to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights in making an intelligent election as to whether to testify in his own defense in light of the Court\u2019s ruling that he could be cross examined on collateral, highly prejudicial matters of alleged \u2018sexual misconduct\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">VI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">Did the Trial Judge err in denying Appellant\u2019s Motion for Mistrial after all evidence was in and State announced its intention to argue \u2018sexual misconduct\u2019 as a possible motive for the commission of the crime, after the State had assured the Court for weeks that its only theory of admissibility of said testimony was the bolstering of the credibility of their main witness, Stuart Hirsch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">VII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-12\">Did the Trial Judge err in ruling that the State could produce rebuttal testimony on the subject of alleged \u2018sexual misconduct\u2019 even though the Appellant produced no testimony which would have permitted such rebuttal?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>That the emphasis given appellant\u2019s sexual conduct was given by appellant himself is not only apparent from his brief, half of which is concerned therewith, but also from our careful reading of the twenty-two volumes of testimony. With but little exception, its relevance seems highly questionable in an obstruction of justice case. However, because appellant became inordinately preoccupied with the subject, a chain of relevancy for subsequent testimony was knitted link by slender link. All of the sexual conduct evidence was expressly and continually eschewed by the trial judge, but finally permitted at appellant\u2019s instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Anticipating the emergence of that subject matter by reason of pretrial publicity, Judge Ross carefully advised counsel even before the jury was empanelled, to instruct their witnesses not to volunteer any information covering marital infidelity except in response to a direct and specific question. He admonished counsel themselves that \u201cyou may not mention marital infidelity in your opening statement or ask any questions concerning marital infidelity until you have persuaded me that there is some basis in fact for use of that to show or to impeach the witness at the trial other than on the ground that such misconduct is discrediting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">On the morning of the fifth day of the month long trial, Stuart Hirsch, the State\u2019s key witness, was testifying to a visit in company with appellant to the office of a State Senator. Appellant had accused Mr. Hirsch of cooperating with the investigators and wanted to confront his denials with appellant\u2019s source of information. The Senator had presumably heard accusations made by Hirsch to the State Police. Hirsch testified that appellant drove him to Annapolis to face his accuser:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">\u201cMr. Green drove. It was his car. I asked him if we were going to see Senator Pine. I said, \u2018What is in the statement that I was supposed to have given?\u2019 He answered that I paid two thousand dollars for my deputy job, plus agreed to allow Mr. Green to use my apartment for sexual purposes. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">No objection was made to this testimony by appellant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>After a brief dialogue between the witness and State\u2019s Attorney, the State then pursued the question to ascertain whether the accusation attributed to Hirsch was true, to which appellant entered his first objection and, upon reflection, withdrew even that.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">\u201cQ. Was the statement attributed to you by Senator Pine, in fact, true, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">MR. WHITE: Your Honor, I object. Well that\u2019s all right, I withdraw the objection. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">A. That was not completely accurate, no, sir. . . . I paid Mr. Green one thousand dollars and agreed to let him use my apartment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">If it was not then apparent that appellant made a tactical decision to seize upon the answer as opening a whole new vista to him, it became obvious as the trial progressed. Not only did appellant decline any corrective action in the nature of a motion to strike or an offered clarifying instruction when he later broached the subject out of the jury\u2019s hearing, but he pressed for and finally received the right to cross-examine Hirsch extensively upon all aspects of his out-of-court accusations of Mr. Green\u2019s sexual predelictions, peccadilloes, peculiarities and even \u201cperversions.\u201d Like the King of Epirus, however, appellant had gained a victory at too great a loss.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">The principle of admissibility argued was that Mr. Hirsch\u2019s credibility was crucial and subject to attack. Appellant attempted to discredit Mr. Hirsch by exposing what he viewed as inherently unbelievable out-of-court statements publicly and privately made regarding this phase of Mr. Green\u2019s life. The questions he asked were exhaustively detailed and explored every episode. He hoped to reveal the viciousness of Mr. Hirsch\u2019s attacks by demonstrating the absurdity of the extremes to which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>would go. His technique was a form of impeachment by showing bias or, as Professor Wigmore phrases it, by \u201cindicating [the witness\u2019s] disposition or habit or <em>general scheme to make false charges or claim,s.\u201d </em>3 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 963 at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The cross-examination regarded accusations by Hirsch which ran the sexual gamut from long affairs to short affairs, local and interstate. It included Hirsch\u2019s accusations of appellant\u2019s predelictions toward peculiar sexual activities which deviated not only from the conventional, but also from the peculiar, entailing the use of condiments and dessert toppings, if Hirsch was to be believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Suffice to say the attack on Hirsch\u2019s credibility was not necessarily for naught. Ridicule can be devastating and the more so when the ridiculous is admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The State thereupon faced substantial diminution of the credibility of its sole witness, with whom its case would stand or fall. The jury could well have seen Mr. Hirsch as an emotionally unstable man (he had admitted himself to a mental hospital) heaping expressions of vituperation on an employer he now resented, and concluded that his sexual accusations of appellant, a family man, were preposterous. The State had but one course to follow if it hoped to prevail and that was to bolster the faltering witness. It elected to do so by proving the probability of those seemingly preposterous sexual exploits.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Mr. Hirsch had testified on cross-examination that he had accused Mr. Green of giving a paramour a color T.V., only to repossess and sell it to another deputy at a profit, after a parting of the ways. He admitted to repeating an obscenely rhymed verse setting forth what was expected of secretarial applicants, which verse and office standards he attributed to Mr. Green. In addition to the use of his own apartment by Mr. Green for sexual cavorting, he admitted that he spoke of other clandestine rendezvous such as rooms at vacation resorts during conventions, retained by others but used by Mr. Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">In the long journey toward rehabilitation the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>traveled three paths. First, on redirect examination the State asked Mr. Hirsch to name names, times and places for the events described. The State then established the sources upon which Mr. Hirsch relied for the out-of-court stories he admitted having told. These sources included braggadocio by Mr. Green, personal observations of criminatory circumstances, and conversations with Mr. Green\u2019s participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The second step toward instituting respectability for Mr. Hirsch was the production of corroborative witnesses during rebuttal. The State called the man whom Hirsch had named as retaining a room at Ocean City used by appellant and a female friend. Then the State produced the female friend. Subsequently, it produced the color T.V. merchandiser and an office secretary and recipient of the color T.V., to substantiate the story of appellant\u2019s aborted affaire de coeur.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The third recuperative effort was the State\u2019s reply to appellant\u2019s motion in limine, which asked that the State be precluded from cross-examining appellant regarding sexual misconduct, in the event he chose to take the stand. The short answer to appellant\u2019s assertion that the court\u2019s denial was error (Question IV) lay in the denial itself and its accompanying explanation. Although the court lamented the insertion of sex from the beginning, it decided that since appellant had used it to attack Mr. Hirsch\u2019s credibility \u201cit has become an issue in the case through the history we have discussed, and it is now relevant in respect to Hirsch\u2019s credibility, ... to the extent that it has been opened in that area. . . .\u201d He continued by explaining \u201cthat the only area [the State] could go into on that, on the sex basis ... is where it relates to Hirsch\u2019s testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In declining to grant the motion in limine absolutely, the court stated that it would have to rule on the propriety of each question asked. That ruling clearly was not error. Because appellant belatedly weighed the potential consequences when he declined to testify, he can hardly cry foul, having himself charted the course he was later compelled to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>During this unlikely transformation of the subject of sexual activities from one of questionable relevance <footnotemark>5A</footnotemark> to an issue of Hirsch\u2019s credibility, a single, controlling observation emerges. Having fashioned that subject into a defensive sword of indignation, appellant may not seek sanctuary when the State converts it into an offensive weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Nor, having once so insistently demanded that the subject be explored, can appellant now object to the State\u2019s suggestion in closing argument that an additional motive underlying appellant\u2019s attempt to obstruct the investigation was a desire to hide that which he had himself now so vividly exposed. Anticipating that theory by the State in closing argument, appellant moved for a mistrial, presumably because the State acknowledged its intention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>so comment. At the time of the motion, however, there was nothing before the judge upon which he could rule. With his usual abundance of caution Judge Ross expressly permitted appellant to reopen his case if he so desired. He declined the opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We note further that this use of sexual misconduct as a motivation for cover-up was not the surprise at the end of the case appellant claimed it to be. Even before the jury was empanelled, the court admonished the litigants \u2014 and especially appellant \u2014 to steer clear of sexual misconduct during the trial. He used motivation as an example saying</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">\u201cNow, I have picked motivation because that seemed to be the most likely use of it. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Appellant\u2019s position is as anomalous on the \u201csurprise\u201d issue as it is on the preceding arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">We have thus responded to appellant adversely in all his claims of error regarding the use of sexual misconduct during trial. It would serve no purpose to restate the questions and respond seriatim when our determination is so clear. We move on then to Question VIII.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">VIII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">\u201cDid the Court err in denying Appellant\u2019s Motion for Judgment of Acquittal and permitting the jury to deliberate on all sixteen counts of the Indictment despite the State\u2019s admission that the charges were factually the same and were basically set forth under different theories?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">We are somewhat nonplussed by the issue which seems to fuse a question of sufficiency of the evidence with an assertion that the State was compelled to elect. We will touch upon both to assure ourselves we have not misunderstood appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">Regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, suffice to say we have carefully read all of the transcribed testimony, perused the evidence, the record and the voluminous investigatory matter submitted <em>in camera </em>as possibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>containing exculpatory material under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U. S. 83 and <em>Giles v. Maryland, </em>386 U. S. 66. The admissible evidence we reviewed was ample in law to sustain a conviction of misconduct in office, obstruction of justice, attempted subornation of perjury and conspiracy. The State proved that appellant conspired with the prosecuting witness and another to mislead investigators, obscure facts and change testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">If not sufficiency, appellant apparently argues his motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted because the State was required to elect counts, relying on Md. Rule 735, which provides that the court \u201c . . . may order an election or separate trials of counts ... or provide such other relief justice requires.\u201d We have treated the question of separate trials of counts in appellant\u2019s first question. We now respond to the court\u2019s authority to order an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In <em>Baumgartner v. State, </em>21 Md. App. 251, 253 the appellant contended that it is never proper to permit the joinder of offenses under Md. Rule 716 a \u201cunless all of the offenses involve substantially the same facts, form part of the same transaction, and occur during a brief space of time.\u201d Appellant here approaches the joinder question inversely, arguing that because the offenses joined in the indictment involved the same facts, formed a part of the same transaction and occurred within the same time span, the State should have been compelled to elect those upon which it chose to rely. The indictment contained sixteen counts, some charging the same crime in different ways, <em>e.g., </em>statutory and common law, all based upon the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Appellant contends that the court may require the State to elect and it \u201cshould be done at the instance of the accused and that the trial judge has the duty to see that the charges are actually distinct,\u201d citing <em>Toomer v. State, </em>112 Md. 285. We do not read <em>Toomer </em>thus. Indeed we read it precisely oppositely.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">After recognizing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">\u201cIt is the common and approved practice in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>State to insert in the indictment several counts, charging the offense in different ways, and to charge -in one indictment, in separate counts, two or more felonies growing out of the same transaction,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">\u201c[W]h,ere there are several counts in the indictment, charging <em>separate and distinct offenses, </em>the Court may, in its discretion, require the prosecution to elect upon which count he will proceed, or quash the indictment. That should not be done, however, at the instance of the accused, unless the Court ean see that \u2018the charges are actually distinct and may confound the prisoner, or distract the attention of the jury.\u2019 But the indictment will not be quashed, where it is obvious on its face, \u2018that the several counts related to the same transaction, and that the variation of the form in which the offense is charged in the different counts is done with a view to meet the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 289-290. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The case relied upon by appellant is thus dispositive of his own issue. His further reliance upon <em>Simmons v. State, </em>165 Md. 155 is totally misplaced unless he is asserting misjoinder or duplicity as was alleged in the <em>Simmons </em>indictment. Judge Ross succinctly responded to that contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">\u201cWith respect to the duplicity or duplicitousness which has been mentioned on several occasions, we fall into the area where the word is used grammatically correctly, but the legal significance of duplicity is not twice stating the crime into counts, but in stating two crimes in one count. I think that is one thing that this indictment clearly avoids, so that there is no duplicity in the legal sense, nor is there any duplicitous count in that legal sense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>If on the other hand appellant cites <em>Simmons </em>solely for the general propositions he quotes therefrom, we say only that Judge Ross did not abuse his discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201cThe matter of a misjoinder is generally left to the discretion of a trial court and the courts will guard against injustice and abuse wherever apparent and not permit such a joinder of counts as will embarrass the traverser in his defense by, in the Court\u2019s sound discretion, quashing the indictment, permitting a nol prosse as to a count or counts or compelling the prosecution to elect upon which count or counts to proceed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">IX.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">\u201cDid the Trial Judge err in declining to require the State to furnish various data and transcripts to Appellant under the holdings of \u2018Brady\u2019 and \u2018Giles\u2019 and also when such documents and reports were utilized by the State\u2019s witnesses in direct testimony?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">In preliminary motions appellant requested \u201cany exculpatory information\u201d which would come within the ambit of <em>Brady, supra, </em>373 U. S. 83, or <em>Giles, supra, </em>386 U. S. 66. Appellant was asserting a right grounded in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, succinctly outlined in <em>Brady, </em>373 U. S. at 87:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">\u201cWe now hold that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or the bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-11\"><em>Moore v. Illinois, </em>408 U. S. 786, set forth three factors which must coalesce to effect the <em>Brady </em>sanction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-12\">\u201c(a) suppression by the prosecution after a request by the defense,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>(b) the evidence\u2019s favorable character for the defense, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">(c) the materiality of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>Giles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Giles, which followed <em>Brady, </em>added far less to clarifying <em>Brady </em>than that with which it is generally credited. Under the circumstances here, <em>Giles </em>is totally inapposite. Mr. Justice Brennan, writing for the majority in <em>Giles </em>found it \u201cunnecessary and therefore inappropriate, to examine . . . the broad questions whether the prosecutor\u2019s constitutional duty to disclose extends to all evidence admissible and useful to the defense, and the degree of prejudice which must be shown to make necessary a new trial.\u201d The Court decided that because \u201cWe now have evidence before us, which neither Judge Moorman nor the Court of Appeals considered, which in our view justifies a remand . . .\u201d, the case would be returned to the Maryland Courts to decide whether the concept of <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U. S. 264 had been abused. <em>Napue, </em>and thus <em>Giles, </em>was restricted to the prosecutor who, \u201calthough not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.\u201d <em>Giles, </em>386 U. S. at 74 quoting <em>Napue, </em>360 U. S. at 269. It would be difficult to conceive of a <em>Giles-Napue </em>issue arising on direct appeal as opposed to post-conviction relief, Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 645A, unless raised on a Motion for New Trial for Newly Discovered Evidence. In the case sub judice there is no contention of exculpatory evidence coming to a prosecutor who \u201callows it to go uncorrected when it appears.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">\n<em>Brady</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">In the court below reams of investigatory material, statements of witnesses, etc. were brought into the court by the State at appellant\u2019s request. The information emanated from an allegedly on-going investigation into corruption in Baltimore County. The court adopted a practice encouraged by the State and prevalent in the federal courts of reviewing the evidence for possible exculpatory material. The State presumably preferred to relieve itself of the consequences of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>its own misjudgment, which might on the one hand jeopardize this case by inadequate disclosure, or on the other jeopardize its continuing investigation by too much disclosure. Worse yet, the information could have been damaging to innocent persons mentioned in the investigatory records. The court below reviewed the material \u2014 as have we \u2014 but as an exceptional practice rather than as a general policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Nor should <em>Brady </em>or <em>Giles </em>be interpreted as a mandating <em>in camera </em>review. These cases do nothing more than provide the consequences for suppression of exculpatory evidence. They do not provide a constitutional device permitting appellant to cast his net upon the evidentiary waters, nor do they extend our rules of discovery to such broad, net-like fisning expeditions. Since appellant recites instances, however, we will examine each against <em>Brady </em>standards and respond thereto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">1. \u201cAppellant\u2019s counsel asked for . . . three or four pretrial statements of Mr. Harrington to determine if there was any exculpatory information by way of impeachment contained by comparing the various statements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Appellant has not established that the suppressed material was favorable, and the very phrasing of the issue evidences that he desired only to rummage for something helpful on cross-examination. Beyond that, we have held in <em>Younie v. State, </em>19 Md. App. 439, 460, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 272 Md. 233, that \u201cwhen the allegedly suppressed evidence is not evidence which goes directly to the question of guilt but simply to the impeachment of a State\u2019s witness, the broad consensus of legal thinking is that far more will be required to establish materiality.\u201d See also <em>Link v. United States, </em>352 F. 2d 207, <em>cert. den., </em>383 U. S. 915 (8th Cir.).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">2. Appellant contends that the court \u201cerred in the same manner ... as to the so-called \u2018Liddy Jones Report.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">That report was a compilation or summary, prepared by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>prosecutor during a former prosecutorial job, of conversations with a bail bondsman named Fred Frank who had allegedly been solicited for a bribe by the prosecuting witness. Frank had twice testified on the issue in another case. That testimony and Frank himself were equally available to appellant. We note that this report was part of the evidence reviewed by Judge Ross and independently appraised by this Court. We agree in retrospect with Judge Ross\u2019s prospective finding that this is not <em>Brady </em>material.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The appellant next assigns error in not having received:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">3. \u201canything in the State\u2019s file, either in the form of a police report or a memo to the file from the Attorney General\u2019s Office or a member of the staff thereof, relating to [a 5 day stay in a mental hospital by witness Stuart Hirsch] or any of the particulars which had been made known to agents of the State some eight or nine months prior to the trial of the case.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Upon his examination as a witness, Hirsch asserted his psychiatric communication privilege under Courts Art., \u00a7 9-109, with respect to details of his hospitalization. We note that appellant did not suggest the possibility of conflict between his due <em>process-Brady </em>right and the witness\u2019s statutory privilege. <em>Vuitch v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 389, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>397-398, <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Md. 729, 404 U. S. 868. The details Mr. Hirsch refused to divulge regarding this hospitalization were clearly privileged. All information in the possession of the State was given to appellant prior to trial when asked therefor on discovery. What appellant now seems to ask is whether he received all information possessed by the State which would have been exculpatory. The information not given appellant was also reviewed <em>in cam,era </em>by Judge Ross and resealed for this Court\u2019s scrutiny. There was no exculpatory material revealed that was not privileged.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">4. \u201cAnother breach of discoverable information not provided to Appellant centered around his [appellant\u2019s] Grand Jury testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The absurdity of considering this as <em>Brady </em>material is self evident. The appellant even refers to it as discoverable rather than exculpatory. He has not alluded to any evidence in his Grand Jury testimony that was 1) material, 2) demonstrably favorable, and 3) that was not already known to him \u2014 three essential prerequisites to the successful invocation of the <em>Brady </em>doctrine. <em>Moore, supra,, </em>408 U. S. 786; <em>Younie, supra, </em>19 Md. App. 439. Even under discovery rules it would fall within the discretionary category, see <em>Kardy v. Shook, </em>237 Md. 524, 540, citing <em>Whittle v. Munshower, </em>221 Md. 258, 261. In either case there was no error in not providing it to appellant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">5. The final complaint was over the alleged denial of a statement of a defense witness, however, we are at a loss to follow the contention since appellant concedes in his brief that the statement was produced for appellant\u2019s use at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-10\">X.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-11\">\u201cDid the Attorney General have the authority to bring about the Indictment in the instant case under the limited terms of the Governor\u2019s directives?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Again we have serious reservations in responding because the portion of the record purportedly containing the preservation of the question is not before this Court. Since that responsibility lay with the appellant, <em>White v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 51, <em>cert. denied, </em>257 Md. 737, it would seem we would not be remiss in declining to respond to this question. <em>Rosenberg v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 20, <em>cert. denied, </em>263 Md. 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The simplicity of response urges us otherwise. The Governor\u2019s letter of authority to the Attorney General contains the Constitutional authority in paragraph one and the broader warrant in paragraph two. It answers appellant\u2019s inquiry, was in evidence and reads as follows in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">\u201cUnder the provisions of Article 5, Section 3, of the Maryland Constitution, I hereby direct you to investigate the allegations of corruption of public officials in connection with the arrest, pending prosecution and escape of one, John Edward Jones, from the Baltimore County jail, and to pursue any evidence of criminal violations or administrative irregularities resulting from your investigation. You are authorized to utilize whatever services of the Maryland State Police or other agencies of the State Government you may consider advisable. Furthermore, you and such members of your staff as you may designate may present to any Grand Jury of the State information so developed, and prosecute in any courts of the State such violations of the law as shall be disclosed by the aforesaid investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-9\">In the event your investigation of the above discloses acts or conduct in other areas which warrant further investigation, grand jury action or prosecution, you are hereby directed to pursue the same, and you and the members of your staff designated by you shall have all of the same powers with respect thereto that have been conferred by me as to the above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Epilogue</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We have oft repeated that a defendant is entitled to a fair trial not a perfect one. <em>E.g., Boblits v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 391, 400, <em>cert. denied, </em>256 Md. 743. Many of the imperfections here were of appellant\u2019s own making having been tactical decisions made in the field under stress of battle. In light of the alternative options open at the time, even in retrospect we cannot say they were wrong, only that they did not succeed. But the trial itself was fairly conducted, eminently so. Judge Ross\u2019s decisions throughout were not only proper, they were just.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Whether appellant would have been tried and convicted had he been less prominent is a question upon which he asks us to speculate, \u201cBut verdicts cannot be upset by speculation or inquiry into such matters.\u201d <em>Dunn v. United States, </em>284 U. S. 390. It would be ostrich-like for us to say that possibility does not exist however, when the Supreme Court has acknowledged it in the field of defamation. The language used has special significance in light of appellant\u2019s question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">\u201cAn individual who decides to seek government office must accept certain necessary consequences of that involvement in public affairs. He runs the risk of closer public scrutiny than might otherwise be the case. And society\u2019s interest in the officers of government is not strictly limited to the formal discharge of official duties. As the Court pointed out in <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U. S. 64, 77, the public\u2019s interest extends to \u2018anything that might touch on an official\u2019s fitness for office . . . Few personal attributes are more germane to fitness than dishonesty, malfeasance, or improper motivation, even though those characteristics may also affect the official\u2019s private character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cf. Gertz v. Welch, </em>418 U. S. 323, 41 L.Ed.2d 789, 808.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-17\">. \u201c ... even from those who should be his friends; . . . . \u201d from an eneomium delivered by Senator William Pitt Fessenden of Maine, in 1866.

Appellant inaccurately employs the term \u201cbest evidence\u201d which, in its classic application, treats only documentary evidence. Andresen v. State, 24 Md.

Although appellant\u2019s brief argues only the admissibility of the typed statement as in derogation of the best evidence rule it is questionable at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>best whether or not he preserved that ground of objection at trial. The court called upon him to state the ground, Md. Rule 522 d, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, are you suggesting that this typewritten transcript is inadmissible because it is not the best evidence or are you merely saying that if other things being equal, if this is what Sergeant Travers says the tape says, that\u2019s fine, but we have the tape and it says something else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">MR. WHITE: I think I am taking the latter course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">THE COURT: So that we are not down to the fine legal issue of whether or not this transcript gets in as Sergeant Travers\u2019 testimony as to what the tape says, you are just reserving the right, in effect, to dispute that this is an accurate transcript \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-13\">MR. WHITE: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-14\">THE COURT: \u2014of the tape?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-15\">MR. WHITE: Yes, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">We have, however, elected to meet the best evidence argument presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b712-11\">. Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, after the battle of Asculum in Apulia in 279 B.C., is purported to have exclaimed \u201cOne more such victory and we are lost,\u201d hence the term, Pyrrhic Victory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5a\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\">A. The relevance of the State\u2019s rehabilitative effort had been created by appellant\u2019s extended attempt to demonstrate Mr. Hirsch\u2019s vindictiveness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">\u201c \u2018When cross-examining counsel see fit to call out from the witness collateral facts which tend to create distrust of his integrity, fidelity, or truth, it is entirely competent for the adverse party to ask of the witness an explanation which may show that the facts thus elicited were in truth wholly consistent with his integrity, fidelity, and truth, although they thereby prove circumstances foreign to the principal issue, and which, but for such previous cross-examination, they would not be permitted to prove.\u2019 \u201d <em>U. S. v. 18 Barrels, </em>8 Blatchf. 478 (1871) cited in 3 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>(3d ed.) \u00a7 952 at oil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">In addition to the attack on Mr. Hirsch\u2019s credibility during cross-examination, appellant called a virtual parade of witnesses whose testimony was relevant solely for impeachment purposes. In those circumstances, the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the State to introduce extrinsic evidence in rebuttal to rehabilitate the witness was clearly not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">\u201cImpeachment is not a dispassionate study of the capacities and character of the witness, but is regarded in our tradition as an <em>attack </em>upon his credibility. Under our adversary system of trials the opponent must be given an opportunity to meet this attack by evidence sustaining or rehabilitating the witness. One general principle is that in the absence of an attack upon credibility no sustaining evidence is allowed. A second truism is that when there has been evidence of impeaching facts the proponent may bring contradictory evidence asserting the untruth of the alleged impeaching facts. Such a denial is always relevant and allowable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">. . . The rehabilitating facts must meet a particular method of impeachment with relative directness. The wall, attacked at one point, may not be fortified at another and distinct point.\u201d C. McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>(2d ed.) \u00a7 49 at 102-103.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\">. Based on this request, the State furnished the defense, before trial, the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">\u201cWith respect to the matter of psychiatric conditions, last Thursday or Friday I learned in a telephone conversation with Mr. Hirsch, for the first time, that in the spring of 1973 he consulted with a Dr. Quattlebaum in Kensington, Maryland, and that thereafter, he admitted himself for, I believe, a five-day period to the Psychiatric Ward of the George Washington University Hospital in D. C. He told me that he was admitted because he was terribly depressed, because his boss, Mr. Green, had been threatening him, and because he was acting as a double agent in the on-going Maryland State Police investigation. He, also; told me that Mr. Green was aware of the fact that he was hospitalized, and that they had telephone conversations while he was at the hospital when Mr. Green called him and he called Mr. Green, but, nonetheless, I do say that I first learned of that last Thursday, and I have no other information other than that. I have not received any documentary evidence of any kind.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
