S. Constr. Co. v. City of Baltimore, </em>269 Md. 704, 309 A. 2d 629 (1973). In that case R. S. Construction Company had sued the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The company sought to have the Upton Urban Renewal Ordinance, No. 794, of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, declared unconstitutional on the ground that it violated the equal protection clause of the \u201cfederal and state constitutions.\u201d The trial judge (Ross, J.) ruled that R. S. Construction Company had fallen short of producing the degree of proof necessary to overcome the presumption of the constitutionality of the Ordinance. The Court of Appeals of Maryland held that bare evidence of the existence of a difference in the treatment of two allegedly similar situations, devoid of details of surrounding circumstances, fails to meet the heavy onus cast upon those claiming a denial of equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Approximately one month prior to the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>R. S. Constr. Co., supra, </em>the appellant, owner of 704 West Lafayette Avenue, was served with a Baltimore City Departments of Fire, Health and Housing and Community Development \u201cViolation Notice\u201d. The notice listed eighty-one separate alleged violations. Apparently, after the opinion of the Court of Appeals had been handed down, the appellant determined to succeed where R. S. Construction Company had failed. Appellant purposely charted a collision course with the City in order that appellant could challenge the constitutionality of Ordinance No. 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">The Ordinance condemned \u201cfor urban renewal purposes\u201d numerous properties located within the geographical confines of what it defined as the Upton area, and it set certain standards to be \u201capplied to all residential uses within the project area other than those structures\u201d the City had determined to acquire through condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The specific provision of the ordinance that appellant attacks is designated as \u00a7 7 (a) (3). It requires that within the Upton area:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">\u201cAll lead base paint shall be removed from interior surfaces of dwellings before repainting. Good repair shall include keeping properly painted all interior surfaces which are painted in normal practice.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u201cA person who contends that there has been a denial of the equal protection of the laws has the burden of showing that his situation is the same as another situation, and that the State, or its instrumentalities, has treated the two situations differently in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Appellant, under penalty of \u201ca fine not exceeding One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) and ... each day\u2019s violation shall constitute a separate offense, was directed to (1) \u201cRemove all loose or deteriorated paint and repaint,\u201d and (2) to remove all \u201cloose or defective paper on walls or ceilings and . . . refinish.\u201d When appellant declined to correct the defects noted in the \u201cviolation notice\u201d, a summons was issued out of the Housing Part of the District Court for District 1, and the matter was set for trial before Judge Hudnet. The judge disagreed with the appellant\u2019s contention that it was denied the equal protection of the laws, and he adjudged appellant guilty. Obviously cognizant that appellant was seeking to challenge a law rather than flout it, the court suspended the imposed fine. Appellant entered an appeal to the Criminal Court of Baltimore where issue was joined before Judge Shirley B. Jones, without the intervention of a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The evidence presented to Judge Jones established that the appellant\u2019s property at 704 West Lafayette Avenue is within the Upton area. All of the open charges <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against appellant, with one exception,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> not applicable to this opinion, would not have been placed had the property not been located within the Upton urban renewal project. The subject property is similar in exterior appearance to other properties not situate within Upton\u2019s boundaries. The appellant\u2019s expert witness, the president of R. S. Construction Company, testified that, absent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>requirement of \u00a7 7 (a) (3) of Ordinance 794, there were, in his opinion, no factors necessitating repainting and repapering, and that in other areas of the City one was required only to remove defective paint or paper. Once having done so, it was not mandated that repainting and repapering be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The testimony produced on behalf of the State was elicited from Mr. Michael Calvert, Chief Planner for the Department of Housing and Community Development. Mr. Calvert, after testifying to the basic \u201ctheory behind the [Upton] community renewal plan\u201d, said that the properties in the Upton area were \u201cconsiderably worse, measurably worse\u201d than those areas against which he had been asked to compare Upton.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Judge Jones held that Ordinance No. 794 is constitutional as it applies to 704 West Lafayette Avenue, that appellant had not been denied equal protection of the laws, and that appellant was guilty of violating the housing code. The judge imposed the same sanction as that meted to appellant in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Because we considered the resolution of the case to be in the public interest and of great importance, not only to the appellant, but to the State and the City of Baltimore as well, we granted <em>certiorari.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Appellant seeks to have us reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court by holding that the Upton Ordinance invidiously discriminates against the appellant, thus denying it equal protection of the laws. We not only decline to do so, but we expressly hold that the Upton Ordinance is a constitutional application of the police power of the City of Baltimore.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">In <em>Queen Anne\u2019s County v. Miles, </em>246 Md. 355, 228 A. 2d 450 (1967) the Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>See also R. S. Constr. Co. v. City of Baltimore, supra. </em>While the appellant, in the trial court, presented evidence in order to establish that it was treated differently than persons owning property without the boundaries of the Upton area, it did not demonstrate that such difference in treatment was unreasonable or arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The Upton Ordinance, as is the case with any urban renewal ordinance, was enacted for the purpose of removing slums and blight from the City. A poignant description of the effect of slums and blight may be found in an article by Greaney, Praetz and Modzelewski, entitled <em>\u201cHampden County Housing Court: A Product of Citizen Initiative, </em>\u201d in 58 Judicature 277 (1975) wherein it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">\u201cSlum neighborhoods erode the mental and physical health of the urban poor who inhabit them. Dilapidation and overcrowding cause stress and tension that in turn lead to crime and violence. Defective plumbing and heating, inadequate ventilation, broken plaster, chipping paint, faulty electrical systems threaten occupants\u2019 health and safety. Neighborhoods with failing buildings and inadequate city service go hand in hand with the related social ills of ineffective schools, alcoholism, traffic in drugs, unwanted pregnancies and high juvenile delinquency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">From the foregoing description it can be readily seen that the City has a vital interest and public purpose in the prevention of slums and blight. <em>See also Master Royalties Corp. v. Mayor &amp; City Council, </em>235 Md. 74, 200 A. 2d 652 (1964); <em>Herzinger v. City of Baltimore, </em>203 Md. 49, 98 A. 2d 87 (1953). It follows that \u201cprevention of slums\u201d necessitates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the establishment of a level of minimum, acceptable housing standards; otherwise \u201cprevention\u201d would be an empty, meaningless concept. Absent some sort of minimum standards, slums would flourish, the health of the City\u2019s citizens become adversely affected and, rather than remove blight, it would be nurtured.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Mr. Calvert testified that an area is selected to be an urban renewal project because it has \u201cthe greatest extent of blight, [and] the greatest need for a . . . renewal treatment.\u201d The basic thrust of appellant\u2019s attack upon the \u201cUpton Ordinance\u201d is that it required appellant to maintain a standard not required by the City Housing Code to be so maintained in other areas of the City. A similar contention was made in <em>People v. City of Chicago, </em>3 Ill. 2d 539, 121 N.E.2d 791 (1954). There a property owner in what was styled \u201ca conservation area\u201d, was required to comply with the \u201cconservation plan\u201d. The City of Chicago could, through eminent domain, take a non-conforming property, or it could apply to the courts for the right to make the necessary repairs in order to bring the property up to the required standard, and then a lien could be imposed upon the property. A property owner challenged the constitutionality of the conservation area concept on the ground that \u201cno reasonable basis exists for imposing . . . [conservation] requirements upon owners of property in conservation areas and not upon those who live beyond such areas.\u201d The property owner asserted that if a dwelling house in a conservation area tended to create a slum condition because it did not meet the conservation plan\u2019s minimum standards, a similar residence not situate within the designated conservation area would likewise have a tendency to create a slum condition. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">\u201cAn act is not local or special because it operates in but one place, or upon a particular class of persons or things, provided there is a reasonable basis for the legislative classification. . . . The issue, then, is whether . . . there is a legitimate basis for a classification which distinguishes between property within conservation areas and other property. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>prevention of slum and blighted areas is a public use and a public purpose. The legislature has found the conditions which it seeks to remedy exist upon an area basis rather than upon the basis of individual structures.. .. Legislative action taken to meet the evil in the form in which it most clearly exists cannot be said to be either clearly unreasonable or palpably arbitrary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">We think the City of Baltimore\u2019s approach to the elimination of slums and blight on a designated area basis, rather than a wholesale simultaneous attack on such conditions in all areas of the City, to be reasonable. This is particularly true when we consider that the City does not have the unlimited wealth or manpower necessary in order to undertake, inspect and enforce a city-wide urban renewal project. It must, of necessity, approach the concept of urban renewal on an area basis. That the property owners within the Upton area are required to uphold a standard of maintenance higher than a property owner who is not in the designated area does not violate equal protection of the laws. \u201cExact equality is no prerequisite of equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Norvell v. Illinois, </em>373 U. S. 420, 83 S. Ct. 1366, 10 L.Ed.2d 456 (1963). <em>See also Bush v. Director, </em>22 Md. App. 353, 324 A. 2d 162 (1973), <em>cert. denied </em>by Court of Appeals, October 24, 1974, 272 Md. (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">In <em>Bush, supra, </em>we quoted the late Chief Justice Warren who penned in <em>Baxstrom v. Herold, </em>383 U. S. 107, 86 S. Ct. 760, 15 L.Ed.2d 620 (1966) at 111:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">\u201cEqual protection does not require that all persons be dealt with identically, but it does require that a distinction made have relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">We went on to state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">\u201cWe reject the notion that mathematically precise equality of procedures, or absolute symmetry, is the command of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>We think there is a rational basis for the City\u2019s designation of the Upton area as an urban renewal project, and the resulting application of minimum housing standards thereto, notwithstanding that the City has not applied those same standards city-wide. The distinction between the Upton area and other parts of the City has a relevance to the purpose for which the difference in treatment is made.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\">\u201c... [T]he law does all that is needed when it does all that it can, indicates a policy, applies it to all within the lines, and seeks to bring within the lines all similarly situated so far and so fast as its means allow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><em>Buck v. Bell, </em>274 U. S. 200, 208, 47 S. Ct. 584, 71 L. Ed. 1000 (1927), (Holmes, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In our view the appellant has failed to demonstrate that there is no rational basis for the distinction in treatment between the Upton area and the balance of the properties within the City, nor has it shown that the difference in the treatment afforded appellant, <em>vis a vis </em>others not within Upton, is arbitrary and capricious. In fact, the evidence is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-8\">.
