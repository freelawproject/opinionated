D.\u2019s) against appellants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Chiropractors) the chancellor issued a decretal order on 25 July 1974 that Chiropractors \u201care hereby permanently restrained and enjoined from the use of the term \u2018physician\u2019 by itself or in combination with other words, in any printed or written form.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Chiropractors, aggrieved by the order, noted a timely appeal therefrom, and would have us reverse it. M. D.\u2019s, satisfied with the determination of the action, urge that it be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\n<em>THE FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">In paragraph 1 of an \u201cAmended Bill of Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunction\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, M. D.\u2019s alleged that they constituted the entire Executive Committee of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of the State of Maryland, that each was licensed to practice medicine and surgery in Maryland, and that each was presently engaged in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>practice. Chiropractors\u2019 Answer, stating that they were without knowledge as to these allegations, operated as a denial. Maryland Rule 372 a 2. Chiropractors admitted the allegations of paragraph 2 that each of them was licensed to practice chiropractic in Maryland. Paragraph 3 alleged that each of Chiropractors \u201cuses in printed or written form the term \u2018physician\u2019, by itself or in combination with other words and in conjunction with their names, on business-head stationery, upon office signs, or upon advertisements, or a combination thereof.\u201d Chiropractors denied that any of them used \u201cphysician\u201d by itself, but admitted that \u201cmany\u201d of them \u201chave used\u201d and \u201cdo use\u201d the word \u201cphysician\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Evidence was adduced only by way of stipulation. Although neither a written stipulation nor a transcript of an oral stipulation appears in the record before us, from the opinion of the court below and from the briefs filed, it appears that it was stipulated that the allegations in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Bill were correct, and that each of Chiropractors has used the phrase \u201cChiropractic Physician\u201d in connection with his practice, but that none of them used the word \u201cPhysician\u201d alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\n<em>THE LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Whether a chiropractor may use the designation \u201cChiropractic Physician\u201d has been worrisome for many years, but has not been definitively decided by an appellate court in this jurisdiction. The issue has not only bothered chiropractors and the Board of Chiropractic Examiners but also medical doctors, the Board of Medical Examiners, and the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In 1923 a chiropractor was holding himself out to be a \u201cchiropractic physician\u201d. The Board of Chiropractic Examiners felt that the use of the word \u201cphysician\u201d was \u201can attempt to practice chiropractic under a false name with the idea of creating the impression in the minds of the public that he is actually a physician.\u201d It asked the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>General of Maryland if it would be justified in revoking his license. General Alexander Armstrong found that the Board had no statutory power to do so \u201calthough the practitioner in question may have no legal right whatever to describe himself as a chiropractic physician.\u201d The Attorney General suggested that the Board call to the attention of the licensee \u201cthe fact that in the judgment of the Board he is using an improper term and request that he refrain hereafter from doing so.\u201d 8 Opinions of the Attorney General 418 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In 1930 the Board of Chiropractic Examiners twice sought the opinion of the Attorney General. On 29 January it asked who was the proper person to sign a death certificate in case of death of a patient with a chiropractor in attendance. The Attorney General referred to what was then Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 21, providing that death certificates \u201cshall be filled out and signed by the physician last in attendance upon the deceased person within 24 hours after death, excepting in such cases where the body is viewed by the coroner and an inquest is held upon the same, in which case the certificate of death shall be filled out and signed by the coroner.\u201d There were further provisions in case of death without \u201cmedical attendance\u201d or violent death in which the coroner did not deem it necessary to hold an inquest. It was the flat opinion of the Attorney General that chiropractors, not being physicians, were not authorized to execute death certificates. 15 Opinions of the Attorney General 62 (1930). On 28 November the Board asked whether a chiropractor could prescribe diets. The Attorney General opined that it was unlawful for chiropractors in Maryland to prescribe diets. The rationale of the opinion, like the rationale of the prior opinion, was that a chiropractor was not authorized to practice medicine. Because the prescribing of diets as remedies was the practice of medicine, chiropractors could not lawfully prescribe them. 15 Opinions of the Attorney General 63 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">On 27 October 1931 the Board of Chiropractic Examiners requested an opinion of the Attorney General whether a licensed chiropractor was a \u201cphysician\u201d in Maryland. The Attorney General replied that the term \u201cphysician\u201d as used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>in the statutes meant \u201cone who is authorized to practice medicine or surgery.\u201d He quoted what was then Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 384, providing that licensed chiropractors \u201cshall not prescribe for or administer to any person any medicine or drugs now or hereafter included in materia medica, practice major or minor surgery, obstetrics, nor any other branch of medicine, nor practice osteopathy.\u201d He concluded that \u201ca chiropractor is not a \u2018physician\u2019 in the State of Maryland.\u201d 16 Opinions of the Attorney General 73 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The latter part of 1939 the question of the use of the term \u201cchiropractic physician\u201d by a licensed chiropractor was again presented to the Attorney General by the Board of Chiropractic Examiners. Deputy Attorney General William L. Henderson, later Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, and Assistant Attorney General Robert E. Clapp, Jr., later Associate Judge of the Sixth Judicial Circuit, replied. 24 Opinions of the Attorney General 172 (1939). They noted that there were no statutory provisions prohibiting the use of designated titles by licensed chiropractors and referred to the opinion in 8 Opinions of the Attorney General 418. They pointed out that Art. 13, \u00a7 386 had been amended to give the Board the additional power of revoking the license of a chiropractor for \u201cthe attempt to do other than is permitted under this license in an effort to deceive the public.\u201d Citing 16 Opinions of the Attorney General 73 to the effect that a chiropractor is not a physician, they thought lhat by the use of the term \u201cchiropractic physician\u201d, a chiropractor may create the impression in the minds of the public that he is a physician. This assumption, they said, as to the misleading character of the term \u201cphysician\u201d was based on the fact that under the statutes \u201cphysician\u201d is used as indicating one who is licensed to practice medicine and is borne out by the definition found in Webster\u2019s Dictionary that a physician is one who practices medicine. The opinion continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201cWe realize that it has always been customary for a person licensed to practice chiropractic to describe himself as a \u2018Doctor of Chiropractic,\u2019 but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>there is a distinction in this phrase in that the title \u2018Doctor\u2019 has no definite relation to the practice of medicine, since it may mean, one licensed to practice dentistry, one who has been given an honorary degree, such as Doctor of Philosophy, or one who is a Doctor of Divinity. In other words, the title \u2018Doctor\u2019 requires some further description in order to indicate the profession of the holder, whereas, as shown above, the term \u2018physician\u2019 as used in our statutes, exclusively describes a practitioner of medicine and requires no further description to indicate the profession of the holder.\u201d At 173-174.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The conclusion was that if the Board found that the chiropractor was using the term \u201cchiropractic physician\u201d in an effort to deceive the public, it could, by appropriate proceedings, revoke the license. It was suggested that the Board call the attention of the chiropractor to the \u201cmisleading character\u201d of the term \u201cchiropractic physician\u201d and suggest that its use be abandoned because of deception of the public. \u201cIf the use is then continued, your Board could quite justifiably find that the deception is intentional and may, from that, find grounds for the revocation of the license.\u201d At 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The opinion of the various Attorneys General that the practice of chiropractic was not the practice of medicine first received the imprimatur of the Court of Appeals of Maryland in 1949 in <em>Crider v. Cullen, </em>191 Md. 723. \u201c[L]ong before practice of osteopathy or chiropractic was licensed, practice of those callings was excluded from unlawful practice of medicine, not by declaring it to be lawful practice of medicine without a license, but by declaring it not to be regarded as practice of medicine at all. This still is . .. the statutory distinction between practice of medicine and practice of chiropractic in Maryland.\u201d At 730. The Court declared and iterated that under statutory definitions and other statutory provisions \u201cchiropractic treatment is not medical care.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Then in <em>Osborne v. Talbot, </em>197 Md. 105, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>111, decided in 1951, the Court of Appeals, citing <em>Crider, </em>declared: \u201cA chiropractor is not a physician; his profession or calling is not the practice of medicine.\u201d And a year later, it again affirmed <em>Crider </em>and followed <em>Osborne </em>by stating in <em>Maurer v. Snyder, </em>199 Md. 551, 561: \u201cIn the professional aspect a chiropractor is not a physician . ...\u201d ***<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In 1958 the Attorney General was asked by a clerk of a circuit court if a licensed chiropractor could certify to a girl\u2019s pregnancy with respect to the issuance of a marriage license. In holding that a chiropractor could not, the Attorney General affirmed the previous view that a chiropractor was not a physician and may not use the term \u201cchiropractic physician.\u201d 43 Opinions of the Attorney General 235 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"ABl\">In 1961 the Attorney General was again asked if it was lawful for a licensed chiropractor to use the term \u201cchiropractic physician.\u201d The inquiry this time was from the Board of Medical Examiners and was prompted by a letter to it from the Board of Chiropractic Examiners. The Board of Chiropractic Examiners had concluded, erroneously in the opinion of the Attorney General, that \u201cthere is nothing in either the chiropractic or medical practice laws which would authorize a prohibition of the use of the term \u2018chiropractic physician\u2019.\u201d Upon reviewing prior Attorney General opinions, the statutory definition of chiropractic and the provisions of the Medical Practice Act, the Attorney General concluded \u201cthat use by a chiropractor of the terms \u2018chiropractic physician\u2019 is in violation of the medical practice act, if such chiropractor is not, in fact, a \u2018physician\u2019 and authorized to practice medicine and surgery in the State of Maryland.\u201d 46 Opinions of the Attorney General 36 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">We find no change in the statutory law and no appellate decision in this State which would justify a departure from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the view of the Court of Appeals that the practice of chiropractic is not the practice of medicine and that a chiropractor is not a physician. Appellants do not contend that the practice of chiropractic is the practice of medicine, agreeing that the practice of chiropractic is not encompassed within the practice of medicine as defined in \u00a7 119 of Art. 43 and, in fact, is expressly excluded by subsection (g) (6) which provides that the practice of medicine does not include \u201cPracticing any profession otherwise registered, certified or licensed and defined by law.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cChiropractic\u201d is defined by Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 504 (c) to be \u201ca drugless health system, the basic principle of which teaches that disease may be caused by interference with the transmission of nerve impulses\u201d. Expressly not included within the definition of \u201cpractice of chiropractic\u201d, however, are \u201cthe use of drugs, surgery, obstetrics or osteopathy, nor any branch of medicine. ...\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the \u201cPractitioners of Medicine\u201d subtitle of Art. 43, \u201cphysician\u201d is defined in \u00a7 119 (e) to mean \u201cany person, including doctors of osteopathy, licensed to practice medicine in the State of Maryland in compliance with the provisions of this subtitle.\u201d Although defined in affirmative terms, and \u201cas used in this subtitle\u201d, it is clear that the legislative intent was that \u201cphysician\u201d apply <em>only </em>to persons so licensed to practice medicine. We find this manifest in the use of \u201cphysician\u201d in various other subtitles of Article 43.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Chiropractors suggest that the legislature intended to restrict the meaning of \u201cphysician\u201d as defined in the subtitle, \u201cPractitioners of Medicine\u201d, to that subtitle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We believe it clear that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In view of the specific meaning of \u201cphysician\u201d as used in Art. 43&gt;. limiting it to- a. practitioner of medicine as distinguished from all the other professions registered, certified or licensed and defined by law, we think that the use- of \u201cphysician\u201d in connection with the name of a person implies- that he is engaged in the practice of medicine. Therefore,, if a. person- so using the word is- not in fact licensed to practice medicine, such use of the- word shows an intent, to- imply that he is engaged in the practice of medicine and by the- mere- use of the word in such circumstance he is unlawfully engaged in the practice of medicine as defined by Art. 43; \u00a7 119 (h).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It necessarily follows that the use of the phrase \u201cchiropractic physician\u201d by a chiropractor who is not licensed to practice medicine is prohibited. We so hold. As the record here is devoid of any evidence that any of the appellants are licensed to practice medicine in Maryland, the order of 25 July 1974 enjoining them from the use of the word physician is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Chiropractors point to one statute in which the term \u201cchiropractic physician\u201d is used. Acts 1967, ch. 160, codified as Art. 48A, Title, \u201cInsurance\u201d, \u00a7 489, reads: \u201cFor the purposes of health and accident, sickness and other insurance policies, a chiropractic physician, duly licensed to practice in the State of Maryland, shall be entitled to compensation for those services which he is licensed to perform under the provisions of Article 43 and which he has rendered to any insured.\u201d We do not construe this one use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the term as establishing a legislative intent in the face of what we have discussed that chiropractors may properly so describe themselves. We observe that Art. 43 contains no provision for the licensing of a \u201cchiropractic physician.\u201d In any event, Acts 1970, ch. 736, repealing \u00a7\u00a7 119 through 149D and enacting new \u00a7\u00a7 119 through 136A in lieu thereof and renumbering certain other sections, provided in \u00a7 3 \u201cThat all laws or parts of laws, public general or public local, inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\n<em>Order of 25 July 19 7f affirmed; appellants to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-12\">.

D.\u2019 or any other title in connection with a person\u2019s name, with the intent thereby to imply that he or she is engaged in the practice of medicine or any of its branches.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">The use of the word \u201cDoctor\u201d or its abbreviation does not necessarily imply the practice of medicine as does the use of the word \u201cphysician.\u201d As the Attorney General pointed out in 24 Opinions of the Attorney General 172 (1939), the title \u201cDoctor\u201d has no definite relation to the practice of medicine but requires some further description to indicate the profession of the holder.
