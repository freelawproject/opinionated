The County Zoning Regulations, \u00a7 230.13 authorized the Board to grant a \u201cspecial exception\u201d so as to permit the operation of a \u201cGarage, service\u201d within a B.

Seidel, et ux. and Rev. Claude M. Kinlein against Arthur F. Gnau for \u201cstoring antique vehicles\u201d on the Gnau property at 6801 Loch Raven Boulevard in violation of the county zoning regulations. The record is not clear as to how it came about, but by the time a hearing was held before the Zoning Commissioner of Baltimore County the alleged violations mushroomed to \u201cselling antiques without benefit of an antique shop, contractor\u2019s storage yard, truck terminal and miscellaneous junk.\u201d The Zoning Commissioner determined that Mr. Gnau was \u201cguilty of violating [the] regulations\u201d and ordered that \u201csuch use of the . .. property . . . cease\u201d within a prescribed time. Gnau appealed to the County Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">The Board did not hear the matter until May 16, 1973.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time Gnau appeared and requested a postponement on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the ground that he was without counsel. It appears that his attorneys had withdrawn from the case in January, 1973. Gnau advised the Board that he had consulted another attorney who \u201chas all the papers and everything else.\u201d Counsel for the County and the attorney for the protestants requested that the hearing proceed. The Board observed that Gnau \u201chad plenty of notice to get help\u201d, and it decided to hold the hearing as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The testimony produced on behalf of the County and the protestants quickly reduced the number of alleged violations to the sole question of whether Gnau was operating a truck terminal within a B. L. (Business, Local) zone.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board, in its opinion of February 1, 1974, held that Gnau was operating a truck terminal within the B. L. zone and ordered that such operation cease within 45 days from the date of the Order of the Board. Gnau then appealed to the Circuit Court. Judge MacDaniel affirmed the ruling of the Board, and Gnau has appealed to this Court where he poses four questions, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">1. Did the hearing judge err in refusing to reverse the Board on the ground that Gnau was denied his constitutional right to counsel before the Board?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">2. Did the Circuit Court err in denying Gnau\u2019s motion for default judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">3. Was the evidence before the Board sufficient to sustain a finding that Gnau was operating a \u201ctruck terminal?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-12\">4. Were the \u201cprotestants . . . proper parties of the hearing.. . before the Board?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-15\">The main thrust of the appellant\u2019s argument in this Court is concerned with what he perceives to be a denial to him of due process of law. This denial, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>appellant\u2019s view, was occasioned by the Board\u2019s refusal to postpone the hearing of May 16, 1973, because appellant was without counsel. Gnau cites a number of cases that have been decided by the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals of Maryland and this Court, all to the total effect that \u201cdue process\u201d requires a fair opportunity to obtain counsel, and an opportunity to be heard. No one can seriously quarrel with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Morgan v. United, States, </em>304 U. S. 1, 58 S. Ct. 773, 82 L. Ed. 1129 (1938), when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">\u201cThe vast expansion of this field of administrative regulation in response to the pressure of social needs is made possible under our system by adherence to the basic principles that the legislature shall appropriately determine the standards of administrative action and that in administrative proceedings of a quasi-judicial character the liberty and property of the citizen shall be protected by the rudimentary requirements of fair play. These demand \u2018a fair and open hearing\u2019 \u2014 essential alike to the legal validity of the administrative regulation and to the maintenance of public confidence in the value and soundness of this important governmental process. Such a hearing has been described as an inexorable safeguard.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">If for the purposes of this case we define \u201cdue process\u201d, which has been characterized as a \u201cphrase of convenient vagueness\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to mean adequate notice, the opportunity to be heard, the opportunity to be confronted by accusers, the right to a fair and impartial public hearing, the opportunity to employ counsel of one\u2019s own choosing, the opportunity to call witnesses in one\u2019s own behalf, the right to testify personally or refrain from so testifying, and the right to seek redress in the courts, we have no hesitancy in holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>that the appellant has not, on the basis of the record before us, been denied his constitutional right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The record simply does not support appellant\u2019s bald allegation, in his brief, \u201cthat he was only notified [of his prior counsel\u2019s withdrawal] a few days prior to the hearing.\u201d Furthermore, the members of the Board were not even assured that if they had granted a postponement, appellant could obtain counsel. A letter bearing the date of May 16, 1973 and delivered to the Board on the afternoon of the hearing underscores that uncertainty. The letter signed by a member of the bar states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">\u201cPlease be advised that it is our intention to confer at length with Mr. Gnau about representation of him in the above matter. This conference will take place in the very near future and once terms of employment are agreed upon we will then enter our appearance. We have not had the opportunity to confer previously in view of the fact that I have been ill. However, we will confer promptly and <em>if and when terms of employment are agreed upon will enter our appearance.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied). \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Possible future employment of counsel was obviously too slender a reed to justify, in the Board\u2019s view, the postponement of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">In <em>Bernstein v. Bd. of Education, </em>245 Md. 464, 226 A. 2d 243 (1967) the Court of Appeals considered a case wherein the Board of Education gave notice of a hearing to be held six days thereafter. The notice was given to parents of children who would be affected by a proposed transfer from one elementary school to another. At the hearing some parents requested a continuance in order that they might obtain counsel. The Board denied the requested continuance. Judge Oppenheimer, writing for the Court, said at 474-75:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">\u201cThe granting of a continuance is within the sound discretion of an administrative agency, as it is in the comparable discretion of a trial court. <em>State Roads Comm\u2019n. v. Wyvill, </em>244 Md. 163, 168, 223 A. 2d 146 (1966). There was sufficient time for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>appellants to employ counsel to appear at the hearing, if they had wished to do so. We find no abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The refusal by the Board to continue the instant case, in order to allow appellant further time to retain counsel, was a justifiable exercise of their discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Gnau\u2019s petition of appeal to the Circuit Court was noted on March 6, 1974. Md. Rule B9 prescribes that an answer to an appeal from an administrative agency shall be filed by a \u201c[p]arty to the proceeding before the agency\u201d within 30 days \u201cafter the filing of the petition of appeal.\u201d The Board submitted to the Circuit Court what is designated as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">\u201cANSWER TO ORDER OF APPEAL TO CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AND CERTIFIED COPIES OF PROCEEDING BEFORE THE ZONING COMMISSION AND BOARD OF APPEALS OF BALTIMORE COUNTY.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">The attachments to the \u201cAnswer\u201d consisted of certified copies or original papers from the office of the Zoning Department, zoning docket entries, the opinion of the Board and a transcript of the hearing of May 16,1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">Because Baltimore County, acting through its solicitor, did not file an \u201canswer\u201d to the petition, Gnau moved for a judgment by default against the County. The appellees, George J. Seidel and Claude M. Kinlein, had in the interim filed the answer required by the Rule. We do not have the benefit of knowing upon what basis the judge denied Gnau\u2019s motion, inasmuch as the docket entries disclose the bare fact that the motion was \u201cDenied\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">In this Court the County argues somewhat ingenuously we think, that the Board\u2019s transmittal of the record to the Circuit Court, operated as an \u201canswer\u201d within the meaning of Rule B9. We do not see it that way. The Board\u2019s mere forwarding of the record to the Court is not tantamount to an \u201canswer\u201d by the County Solicitor within the clear meaning of Rule B9.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Recognizing that its argument may be untenable, the County alternatively suggests that in any event the appellant has not been prejudiced by the non-compliance with Rule B9 by the County, citing <em>Pahl v. County Bd. of Appeals, </em>237 Md. 294, 206 A. 2d 245 (1965). <em>In Pahl </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">\u201cFinally, the appellants claim that the trial court erred in permitting oral argument by counsel for the applicants where no answer to the petition for appeal or no petition to intervene had been filed on behalf of the applicants prior to the argument in the court below pursuant to Maryland Rule B9. While we do not condone the practice followed in the trial court and the overruling of the appellants\u2019 objection to hearing oral argument without compliance with this procedural rule, since the appellants concede that no prejudice resulted we see no need to further pursue the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Gnau, however, is not as magnanimous as Pahl. He has not conceded the lack of prejudice to his cause by the hearing judge\u2019s denial of the motion for judgment by default. Gnau asserts, and we agree, that the County should have been required to comply with Rule B9. The Court of Appeals and this Court have on a number of occasions stated that the Maryland Rules of Procedure are not mere guides or helpful hints to the practice of law, but are precise rubrics that are to be read and followed. <em>Isen v. Phoenix Insurance Co., </em>259 Md. 564, 270 A. 2d 476 (1970); <em>Brown v. Fraley, </em>222 Md. 480, 161 A. 2d 128 (1960); <em>Callahan v. Dean, </em>17 Md. App. 67, 299 A. 2d 479 (1973); <em>Pearson v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 462, 291 A. 2d 167 (1972); <em>Ritter v. Danbury, </em>15 Md. App. 309, 290 A. 2d 173 (1972); <em>In re Arnold, </em>12 Md. App. 384, 278 A. 2d 658 (1971). Nevertheless, Gnau\u2019s being right with respect to the County\u2019s participation in this case, avails him of little because Seidel and Kinlein, the appellees, did properly answer Gnau\u2019s petition of appeal and hence the matter was before the Circuit Court. In any event, we see no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Section 101 of the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations defines a truck terminal as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">\u201c.. . Any building, or other structure, and/or land devoted primarily to the transfer of merchandise from one truck or truck trailer to another <em>or </em>devoted to the lay-over parking of trucks or trailers . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">It is manifest that the above-quoted definition necessitates one of two events occurring before a particular business operation falls within the meaning of a truck terminal: (1) A use \u201cdevoted primarily to the transfer of merchandise from one truck to another\u201d <em>or </em>(2) a use devoted to \u201clay-over parking of trucks or truck trailers.\u201d Gnau would have us read the above quoted definition so as to substitute <em>\u201cand\u201d </em>for \u201cor\u201d, thus making the two separate disjunctive clauses conjunctive. We refuse to do so. Courts are not free to rewrite statutes or ordinances. Their function is to interpret, and interpretation \u201cdoes not include the power of amendment under the guise of interpretation.\u201d <em>West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, </em>300 U. S. 379, 57 S. Ct. 578, 81 L. Ed. 703, 108 A.L.R. 1330 (1937) (dissenting opinion). \u201cRules of statutory construction are to be resorted to when there is a doubt, ambiguity, or uncertainty, and they are never used to create doubt, but only to remove it.\u201d <em>Helvering v. Northwestern Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>89 F. 2d 553 (8th Cir. 1957). The ordinance in the case now before us is clear and unambiguous, and it requires no judicial interpretation. It is written in language that ordinary persons can readily understand, and the construction placed upon it by the appellant defies common sense. A complete answer to appellant\u2019s argument is found in a <em>Letter to William Johnson </em>by Thomas Jefferson, June 12, 1823 wherein the late President penned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">\u201cLaws are made for men of ordinary understanding and should therefore be construed by the ordinary rules of common sense. Their meaning is not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>sought for in metaphysical subtleties, which may make anything mean everything or nothing at pleasure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The undisputed evidence in this case demonstrated that the appellant kept seven or eight of his trucks on the subject property overnight, each night. That testimony perspicuously established that Gnau was, in fact, operating a truck terminal as that term is defined in the County Zoning Regulations, \u00a7 101. Inasmuch as the conducting of truck terminal business in a B. L. zone is, in the absence of a special exception, proscribed by the Zoning Regulations, the Board was correct in finding that Gnau was in violation of the Zoning Regulations. It follows that the Circuit Court was correct in affirming the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Lastly, appellant contends that the appellees, Seidel and Kinlein, are not \u201caggrieved\u201d parties and consequently, have no standing in this case. The theme of Gnau\u2019s argument is that neither Seidel nor Kinlein fall within the ambit -of \u201caggrieved parties\u201d as that term has been defined by the Court of Appeals and this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The testimony shows that Seidel resides \u201c700 feet south\u201d of the appellant\u2019s property and that the trucks of Gnau are visible from the road. Kinlein resides with his mother at 6707 Loch Raven Boulevard. He testified that on his \u201cday off or on Sunday\u201d he \u201cwould see them [the trucks] in the back or sometimes just the top part of the trucks.\u201d He said he could see \u201cfrom 4 to 6\u201d trucks. The property in which Kinlein resides is immediately south of and contiguous to that of Seidel.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Judge Barnes, in <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., </em>247 Md. 137, 230 A. 2d 289 (1967), after noting that \u201c \u2018aggrieved\u2019 has not been legislatively defined\u201d went on to state at 144:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">\u201cGenerally speaking, the decisions indicate that a person aggrieved by the decision of a board of zoning appeals is one whose personal or property rights are adversely affected by the decision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>board. The decision must not only affect a matter in which the protestant has a specific interest or property right but his interest therein must be such that he is personally and specifically affected in a way different from that suffered by the public generally. <em>DuBay v. Crane, </em>240 Md. 180, 185, 213 A. 2d 487 (1965). The circumstances under which this occurs have been determined by the courts on a ease by case basis and the decision in each case rests upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case under review. Certain principles, however, have evolved. They are as follows:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">2. In cases involving appeals under the provisions of a zoning ordinance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">(a) It is sufficient if the facts constituting aggrievement appear in the petition for appeal either by express allegation or by necessary implication. <em>Town of Somerset v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>245 Md. 52, 225 A. 2d 294 (1966).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">(b) An adjoining, .\u00a1confronting or nearby property owner is deemed <em>prima facie, </em>to be specially damaged and, therefore, a person aggrieved. The person challenging the fact of aggrievement has the burden of coming forward with evidence to establish that the petitioner is not in fact aggrieved .. .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-9\"><em>See also Wier v. Witney Land Co., </em>257 Md. 600, 263 A. 2d 833 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">When we apply the test of <em>Bryniarski </em>to the case now before us it is obvious that Seidel and Kinlein fall within the ambit of the \u201cadjoining, confronting or nearby property owner\u201d and thus are deemed to be <em>\u201cprima fade ... </em>specially damaged.\u201d We are unable to find within the record any evidence whatsoever of a challenge to \u201cthe fact of aggrievement\u201d. Consequently, appellant has not met his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>burden of coming forward with evidence in order to overcome the <em>prima fade </em>presumption of aggrievement that s\u00fcrrounds the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">At the hearing before the Board one of the board members styled the c\u00e1se as \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d. Gnau seizes upon that expression, assumes its truth and then proceeds to assert that appellees\u2019 interest then would diminish to that of the general public since criminal cases are matters between the State and the accused. We regard appellant\u2019s argument as too specious to require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid 2/z by appellant and l/z by Baltimore County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\">.
