He was committed to the Maryland Training School for Boys for an indefinite period. He appealed. Courts Art. \u00a7 12-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\n<em>ISSUE FOR DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Despite the limited nature of the question presented by appellant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we think that what is called for on this appeal is a review of the requirements with respect to the conduct of an adjudicatory hearing in a juvenile cause. The real issue for decision is whether those requirements were observed, and if not, whether the failure to do so was so prejudicial to appellant as to require reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">\n<em>THE LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">A child, Courts Art. \u00a7 3-801 (e), is brought before a juvenile court by the filing of a petition. Rule 902. See Courts Art. \u00a7\u00a7 3-810 to 3-813, inclusive. The petition shall include the statutory classification of the act or condition causing the child to come under the jurisdiction of the court and a statement in simple nontechnical language of such facts on which the action is based as are sufficient to establish the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Rule 903, \u00a7 b 3 and 4. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>party <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> may file a pleading denying or admitting all or a part of the facts alleged or a motion raising preliminary objection. K no pleading is filed, the parties are deemed to have denied the allegations. Rule 904. After a petition has been filed and unless jurisdiction has been waived, the court shall hold an adjudicatory hearing. Courts Art. \u00a7 3-829 (a). \u201c \u2018Adjudicatory hearing\u2019 means a hearing to determine the truth of the allegations in the petition.\u201d Courts Art. \u00a7 3-801 (b). See Rule 908. The adjudicatory hearing is not a criminal proceeding. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 167; <em>Matter of Davis, </em>17 Md. App. 98; <em>Matter of Wooten, </em>13 Md. App. 521.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But when the allegation is that a child is delinquent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the adjudicatory hearing attains many of the incidents of a criminal proceeding, although it shall be conducted by the court without a jury. Rule 903 a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The State\u2019s attorney shall prepare and present the testimony in behalf of the petitioner unless excused by the court. Rule 912 b. \u201cThe rules of evidence applicable to criminal cases shall apply to delinquency hearings.\u201d Rule 912 c. The allegation in the petition must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Courts Art. \u00a7 3-830 (a). \u201cA child may remain silent as of right during an adjudicatory hearing on an allegation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>delinquency and shall be so advised.\u201d Rule 917. In an adjudicatory delinquency hearing, unlike other juvenile hearings, the presence of the child may not be excluded by the court, even temporarily. Rule 908 b. <em>\u201cA </em>party is entitled to representation by legal counsel at every stage of any proceeding under [the juvenile causes] subtitle.\u201d Courts Art. \u00a7 3-830 (d). Rule 918 b, implementing this statute with respect to a child, provides: \u201cUnless knowingly and intelligently waived, an indigent child shall be entitled to have counsel appointed by the court to represent7him in a waiver, adjudicatory or disposition hearing ... if his parents are also indigent or unwilling to employ counsel.\u201d See Code, Art. 27A, title \u201cPublic Defender\u201d, \u00a7 \u00a7 1 and 4. And we point out that in one aspect the burden on the petitioner in a delinquency adjudicatory hearing is even greater than the burden on the State in a criminal prosecution. \u201cAn uncorroborated confession made by a child out of court is not sufficient proof of delinquency.\u201d Courts Art. \u00a7 3-830 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We summed up the law contemplated as to an adjudicatory hearing to determine delinquency in <em>Matter of Brown, </em>13 Md. App. 625, 632:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">\u201cWe think it within the clear contemplation of the Maryland law that the \u2018adjudicatory hearing\u2019 is that phase of the total proceeding whereto witnesses are summonsed; whereat they are sworn, confronted with the alleged delinquent, examined and cross-examined; whereat their demeanor is observed, their credibility assessed and their testimony weighed; whereat the testimony is subject to the rules of evidence and is transcribed by a court reporter; whereat the alleged delinquent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>is represented by counsel and where he enjoys the right to remain silent under Maryland Rule 917; whereat the State\u2019s Attorney marshals and presents the evidence for the petitioner; and whereat the presiding judge or master makes and announces his finding including \u2018a brief statement of the grounds upon which . . . [he] bases. . . [his] determination.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In <em>McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, </em>403 U. S. 528, 533, the Supreme Court of the United States said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">\u201cSome of the constitutional requirements attendant upon the state criminal trial have equal application to that part of the state juvenile proceeding that is adjudicative in nature. Among these are the rights to appropriate notice, to counsel, to confrontation and to cross-examination, and the privilege against self-incrimination. Included, also, is the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\n<em>THE FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">\n<em>The Pleadings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">On 19 June 1974 two petitions were filed in the Circuit Court for Cecil County sitting as a Juvenile Court showing that appellant was a delinquent child. Petition No. 3370 gave as reason that \u201con or about September 12, and September 14, 1973\u201d appellant broke into a certain dwelling house with intent to steal personal property and that he \u201cunlawfully did, or did attempt to, steal, take and carry away\u201d designated personal goods of the value of less than $100. Petition No. 3371 gave as reason that \u201con April 30 and May 3, 1974\u201d appellant broke into the same dwelling house with the same intent and \u201cunlawfully did, or did attempt to, steal, take and carry away\u201d certain designated personal goods of the value of less than $100.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The petitioner was Robert G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Ellis, whose \u201crelationship or concern\u201d was given as \u201cInvestigating Officer\u201d of the Maryland State Police. The petitions were authorized by R. Darrell King, whose title was given as \u201cJuvenile Probation Officer,\u201d Department of Social Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">On 24 June 1974 identical answers were filed to the petitions. Each \u201cAnswer\u201d consists of a printed form, designated as \u201cForm 38\u201d, on which it is stated \u201cTo be prepared by: Agency authorizing filing of petition.\u201d Apparently, therefore, each was prepared by the Department of Juvenile Services. It is addressed to the Judges of the Juvenile Court, and the first part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">\u201cIn answer to the petition filed in the above entitled case, we, the undersigned, hereby state that the following facts are true:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">1. We have received a copy of the petition, have read the petition, have had the allegations explained to us and are satisfied that we understand the statements contained in the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">2. We have been advised that should the Court make a finding of delinquency [\u201cchild in need of supervision\u201d crossed out] the Court could take jurisdiction and make such disposition as the Court feels is most suitable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">3. We have been advised that we have a constitutional right to be represented by an attorney in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">4. We have been advised that we have the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>to be represented by a Public Defender if we are unable to afford an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">5. We have been advised that we have a right to a full hearing on the petition, and that in the event of a finding of delinquency [\u201cchild in need of supervision\u201d crossed out] we have a right of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">6. In filing this Answer we have not been offered any promise of favor or reward, and we have not been threatened or made afraid by any person representing or employed by any government agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">This statement follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">\u201cWHEREFORE, being satisfied that we have received fair notice of the allegations in the petition and that we understand the allegations and our rights as set forth above, we, the undersigned, voluntarily and of our own free will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">1. (x) waive the right to be represented by an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">2. (x) waive the right to a hearing on the allegations in the petition; admit that the statements in the petition are true and correct; and, consent to have the Court make a finding of delinquency [\u2018child in need of supervision\u2019 crossed out] and make an appropriate disposition in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">The \u201cx\u201d indicating that 1 and 2 applies is typed in. Each Answer is signed by appellant and his mother and witnessed by King over the title, \u201cJuvenile Counselor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">\n<em>The Adjudicatory Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">The petitions came on for hearing on 27 June 1974 in the Circuit Court for Cecil County sitting as a Juvenile Court. An assistant State\u2019s attorney appeared in behalf of the petitioner. Appellant was not represented. The judge was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>informed that the petitions had been answered, identified appellant and his parents, and said he was \u201cgoing through this because I see you are here without a lawyer and I want to protect your Constitutional rights.\u201d He explained the allegations thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201c[Appellant] is charged with breaking into the dwelling house of Michael Fabiucci of Charlestown on the 12th and 14th of September last year and stealing alcoholic beverages plus some other things valued at less than $100.00. He\u2019s also charged with \u2014 that first was Juvenile 3370.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">The second is Juvenile 3371, which he\u2019s charged doing just about the same thing, breaking into the dwelling house of the same person and the same things. This occurred on the 30th of April and again on the 3rd of May, 1974.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">He made inquiry about the Answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">\u201cDo you recall signing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">[Mother]: (Nods in assent.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">THE COURT: You know in that case that [appellant] admits doing both these things? You understand that, . . . . ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">[Appellant]: (Nods in assent.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-12\">THE COURT: And also you are willing to proceed here this morning without a lawyer. You have a Constitutional right to a lawyer if you want one. Is that understood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-14\">[Appellant]: (Nods in assent.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-15\">Thereupon, the judge entered \u201ca finding of delinquency\u201d, and stated: \u201c[W]e will have a few facts from the Department of Juvenile Services and we will find a delinquency in law, after which we will go ahead and decide what ought to be done.\u201d King testified. Examined by the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney he said that he had done \u201cintake counseling work\u201d with appellant in connection with the petitions and was familiar with the \u201cfactual background\u201d of them. He said he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>was prepared, based on his counseling, to tell whether appellant was in need of care, treatment and rehabilitation. The judge interjected: \u201cIn order to be legal about it, let\u2019s split your presentation to telling us why he needs care and I\u2019ll make the adjudication . . . .\u201d King gave three reasons why appellant was in need of guidance, treatment and rehabilitation. He had been found to be delinquent in November of 1973 and placed on probation which was still open. The offense then was the same type as now charged \u2014 breaking into a residence or store and stealing alcoholic beverages. There were \u201csome problems at home with [him], specifically in the area of drinking, the use of alcoholic beverages, coming in late at night, and then lying to his parent about his activities.\u201d The last factor \u201cis that there is a somewhat disturbing development and medical history, which may indicate some problems for [him].\u201d No more specificity with respect to any of the reasons was offered or requested. The judge said: \u201cEnter a finding of delinquency, Mr. Clerk.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\n<em>The Disposition Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\"><em>A </em>disposition hearing followed immediately. Courts Art. \u00a7 3-829 (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge made further inquiry of King, received information from him and made disposition: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>And, further, that he be committed to the Maryland Training School for Boys for an indefinite period and, as part of that program, that he be processed in the Maryland Children\u2019s Center for whatever evaluation and help he can gain by such processing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u201cThe disposition in this case shall be that [appellant], first of all, shall make restitution in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the amount of $38.50 in Juvenile 3370, and that he shall make restitution in the amount of $247.31 in Juvenile 3371, that amount in the last case be reduced by whatever [three others involved in the offenses] might happen to wind up paying. And that his parents, . . ., being present in this Court today, are likewise charged with making these payments and I would urge contempt citations if these payments are not made in accordance with Juvenile Services \u2014 with his parents and Juvenile Services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">And he is committed to the custody of the Sheriff or Juvenile Services, or however you want to handle it for transportation to the Maryland Training School for Boys.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">King asked if appellant was to go to the Maryland Training School for Boys. The judge replied: \u201cWhatever\u2019s the most convenient except I don\u2019t want him in the community. I want him institutionalized. He\u2019s committed to the Maryland Training School for Boys, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\n<em>Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">By legislative enactment, a party in a juvenile case \u201cis entitled to representation by legal counsel at every stage of any proceeding under this subtitle [8, <em>Juvenile Causes].\u201d </em>Courts Art. \u00a7 3-830 (d), \u201cRight to Counsel.\u201d Rule 918, \u00a7 a provides: \u201cThe parties may be represented by counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>retained by them in all proceedings.\u201d Section b reads: \u201cUnless knowingly and intelligently waived, an indigent child shall be entitled to have counsel appointed by the court to represent him in a waiver, adjudicatory or disposition hearing or a hearing under Rule 915 [\u201cModification, Vacation or Renewal of Orders\u201d] if his parents are also indigent or unwilling to employ counsel. In all cases not involving delinquency, the right to have counsel appointed shall apply only to those proceedings which are contested.\u201d By ch. 209, Acts 1971, which created the position of Public Defender in Maryland, the legislature declared that it was the policy of the State and the legislative intent \u201cto provide for the realization of the constitutional guarantees of counsel in the representation of indigents, including related necessary services and facilities, in criminal and <em>juvenile </em>proceedings within the State, and to assure effective assistance and continuity of counsel to indigent accused taken into custody and indigent defendants in criminal and <em>juvenile </em>proceedings before the courts of the State of Maryland, and to authorize the Office of Public Defender to administer and assure enforcement of the provisions of this article in accordance with its terms.\u201d (emphasis added). Code, Art. 27A, \u00a7 1. The Act imposed the duty on the Public Defender to provide legal representation for indigent defendants, in certain proceedings, Code, Art. 27A, \u00a7 4, including, \u201cIn any criminal or juvenile proceeding constitutionally requiring the presence of counsel prior to presentment before a commissioner or judge,\u201d subsection (b) (1); \u201cCriminal or juvenile proceedings, where the defendant is charged with a serious crime,<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark> before the District Court of Maryland, the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City, the various circuit courts within the State of Maryland, the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, and the Court of Appeals of Maryland,\u201d subsection (b) (2); and \u201cAny other proceeding where possible incarceration pursuant to a judicial commitment of individuals in institutions of a public or private nature may result,\u201d subsection (b) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>It is clear that appellant was entitled to representation by legal counsel with regard to the petitions filed against him. This includes legal assistance not only at the adjudicatory hearing but also with regard to the signing of the Answers. The effect of the Answers, if valid, would be to determine the matter of appellant\u2019s delinquency with little more ado. By them, he not only waived representation of counsel, but relinquished his entitlement to a hearing, surrendered his right to have the allegations proved beyond a reasonable doubt, dispensed with the need to be confronted by the witnesses against him, gave up the guarantee against self-incrimination, confessed that he committed the offenses charged, consented to be found delinquent and agreed to have the court make \u201can appropriate disposition,\u201d all without the benefit of counsel. See <em>Freeman v. Wilcox, </em>119 Ga. App. 325, 167 S.E.2d 163 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">If appellant was indigent, and if his parents were either indigent or unwilling to employ counsel for him, it was the duty of the Public Defender to represent him. It cannot be ascertained from the record whether he was entitled to the services of the Public Defender because we find no inquiry concerning the matter. Apparently reliance was had on the bald statement of waiver in the Answers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, whether appellant and his parents were indigent or not, or whether his parents, financially able to employ counsel, were unwilling to do so or not, is not material at this point. The initial question is whether there was an effective waiver of the right to the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The Court of Appeals has carefully delineated the procedure to be followed with respect to waiver of counsel in a criminal proceeding. Its Rule 719, \u00a7 c, entitled \u201cWaiver Inquiry\u201d, prescribes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201cIf, at any stage of the proceeding, an accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>indicates a desire or inclination to waive representation, the court shall not permit such a waiver unless it determines, after appropriate questioning in open court, that the accused fully comprehends: (i) the nature of the charges and any lesser-included offenses, the range of allowable punishments, and that counsel may be of assistance to him in determining whether there may be defenses to the charges or circumstances in mitigation thereof; (ii) that the right to counsel includes the right to the prompt assignment of an attorney, without charge to the accused if he is financially unable to obtain private counsel; (iii) that even if the accused intends to plead guilty, counsel may be of substantial value in developing and presenting material which could affect the sentence; and (iv) that among the accused\u2019s rights at trial are the right to call witnesses in his behalf, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, the right to obtain witnesses by compulsory process, and the right to require proof of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Section f requires the docket entries or transcript affirmatively to show compliance with the Rule. The Rule implements the constitutional mandates enunciated in <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U. S. 335; <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, and <em>Carnley v. Cochran, </em>369 U. S. 506. It has been consistently held that the requirements of the Rule are mandatory, and that compliance with them is required irrespective of the type of plea entered, or the lack of an affirmative showing of prejudice to the accused. <em>Manning v. State, </em>237 Md. 349; <em>Taylor v. State, </em>20 Md. App. 404; <em>State v. Diggs, </em>24 Md. App. 681. Although Rule 719 is applicable only to criminal cases, Rule 1 a 2, and a juvenile adjudicatory hearing is not technically a criminal case, although endowed with many of the incidents of a criminal trial, see <em>supra, </em>we believe no less is required for a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel in a delinquency proceeding involving children than is required in a criminal proceeding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ordinarily involving adults. To have a less strict standard for an effective waiver of counsel by a child than by an adult would be completely incongruous. The Supreme Court of the United States observed in <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U. S. 25, 37, that \u201c. . . the Constitution is concerned with the practical consequences, not the formal categorizations, of state law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">With the provisions of Rule 719 as the criterion, we find, on the record before us, that the court should not have permitted the waiver of representation. We hold that, due to the lack of counsel, the waivers and admissions in the Answers were invalid and ineffective and the adjudicatory hearing was void. The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\n<em>The Conduct of the Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Aside from the fatal defect of lack of assistance of counsel, we have other serious questions about the conduct of the adjudicatory hearing. Patently the adjudicatory hearing did not measure up to what we said in <em>Matter of Brown, supra, </em>was contemplated by the law of this State, and, certainly it did not afford appellant the due processes of the law. We discuss our concerns for the guidance of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">\n<em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">To prove that appellant was a delinquent child, the State\u2019s Attorney had to adduce evidence which proved beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that an act had been committed which would be a crime if committed by a person who is not a child, that is the <em>corpus delicti; </em>(2) that appellant committed it, that is his criminal agency; and (3) that appellant required supervision, treatment or rehabilitation. The judge below made two findings of delinquency. The first of \u201cdelinquency in fact\u201d and the second of \u201cdelinquency in law.\u201d The authority for this procedure is not evident to us. As best we understand, the first finding was with respect to the <em>corpus delicti </em>and criminal agency of the offense constituting a delinquent act; the second was with respect to the need for supervision, treatment or rehabilitation. The first finding was arrived at in this way. The judge, noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>that appellant and his mother had signed the Answers, asked, \u201cDo you recall signing that?\u201d The record shows that the mother nodded in assent, whereupon the judge said, \u201cYou know in that case that [appellant] admits doing both these things? You understand that The record reflects that appellant nodded in assent. \u201cThese things\u201d referred to by the judge, were what he had just before said were the charges against appellant, the breaking into a dwelling house on 12 and 14 September 1978 and stealing personal goods valued under $100 and \u201cdoing just about the same thing, breaking into the dwelling house of the same person and the same things\u201d on 80 April and 3 May 1974.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It Is difficult to say exactly what crimes appellant admitted committing. The allegations in the petitions, as we have indicated, amounted to a number of offenses, some inconsistent with the others, as the commission of an offense and the attempt to commit It, <em>Boone v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 80. But more significant, it is woefully apparent that there was no proof whatsoever of the <em>corpus delicti </em>of any crime, not by way of testimony, stipulation, agreed statement of facts, or otherwise. Nor is there evidence sufficient in law to show appellant\u2019s criminal agency in any crime. The judge relied entirely on the admission by appellant in the Answers that \u201cthe statements in the petition are true and correct.\u201d Even if this admission were effective, and by our ruling it was not, It would not be enough. Courts Art. \u00a7 3-880 (a) states without equivocation: \u201cAn uncorroborated confession made by a child out of court is not sufficient proof of delinquency.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There was no corroboration here. The judgment of the court that appellant had committed a delinquent act was clearly erroneous. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">There was further error. Rule 917 declares: \u201cA child may remain silent as of right during an adjudicatory hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>an allegation of delinquency and shall be so advised.\u201d Appellant was not so advised and was called upon to answer questions put to him by the court. The court\u2019s use of the Answers to find the commission of a delinquent act was based upon appellant\u2019s indication that he had made the admissions therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\n<em>Pleading in an Adjudicatory Delinquency Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">As we have indicated, both appellant and the State on appeal interpret what went on at the adjudicatory hearing as a plea of guilty by appellant which was accepted by the court. Appellant goes on to argue that the acceptance of the plea was ineffective because it did not meet constitutional requirements. The State claims that the \u201chearing conducted by the trial judge in accepting the juvenile\u2019s guilty plea measured up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.\u201d Although we have determined the appeal on another point, again we believe that some comment should be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The Rules pertaining to juvenile causes make no provision for pleas such as may be made in criminal causes. Rules 720-724. The only reference to a response to the petition is in Rule 904, which, as we have indicated, provides: \u201cA party may file a pleading denying or admitting all a part of the facts alleged or a motion raising preliminary objection.\u201d The Rule continues: \u201cIf no pleading is filed, the parties are deemed to have denied the allegations.\u201d The Rule makes no distinction between delinquency cases and other juvenile cases, even though, as we have pointed out, a delinquency proceeding has many of the incidents of a criminal proceeding, and ordinarily requires proof of the commission of a crime by the juvenile. But even if there is no authorization for a plea of guilty in a delinquency proceeding, if admissions by the juvenile by answer or in open court have, in fact, the effect of a guilty plea, we believe the affirmative acceptance by the court should be required under the constitutional guidelines applicable to a plea of guilty in a criminal case. In other words, such admissions may be effectively accepted and considered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the court only under the standard applicable to waiver of constitutional rights as explicated by us in <em>Williams v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 570.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for a new adjudicar tory hearing; a new disposition hearing to abide the result.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-11\">. Appellant presents the question: \u201cDid the trial court commit reversible error by accepting a Juvenile\u2019s guilty plea without administering the standard applicable to waiver of Constitutional rights?\u201d He argues that the trial court committed reversible error. The State urges that \u201cthe manner in which the trial judge accepted the juvenile\u2019s guilty plea [measured] up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">Although, under Rule 1085, we do not ordinarily decide any question which does not plainly appear by the record to have been tried and decided by the lower court, we may decide such question where it is necessary or desirable for the guidance of the lower court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b49-5\">. \u201c \u2018Party means the child against whom a complaint has been made, and his parent, guardian or custodian.\u201d Rule 901 \u00a7 a 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b49-6\">.
