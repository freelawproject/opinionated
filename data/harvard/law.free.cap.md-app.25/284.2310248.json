Powell with intent to steal \u2014 10 years concurrent with sentence under 1st count;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-14\">7th count: grand larceny of goods of the Powells \u2014 10 years concurrent with sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>under 1st count, and \u201cthat he be directed, at the end of any sentence and parole period to continue under indefinite probation with the Department of Parole and Probation until restitution is made in the sum of $39 plus whatever damage was done to the T.V. set\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">12th count: petit larceny of goods of Michael Satterfield \u2014 18 months concurrent with sentence under 1st count and restitution \u201cfor whatever damage was done to the guitars\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">13th count: petit larceny of goods of Robert Powell \u2014 18 months concurrent with the sentence under 1st count and restitution \u201cfor whatever damage was done to the guitar in that case\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">14th count: petit larceny of goods of Teddy Kline \u2014 18 months concurrent with sentence under 1st count and restitution \u201cfor whatever damage was done to the guitar in that case\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Herd appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\n<em>ISSUES FOR DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">I. Was Herd improperly denied the right to alternate challenges of jurors?</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">II. Was the evidence sufficient to sustain the verdicts under the 1st and 6th counts?</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">III. Did the court err \u201cin refusing to advise a witness that he could not be compelled to give self-incriminating testimony?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">IV. May his probation continue beyond the sentence actually imposed?</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">When the indictment came on for trial and before the jury were sworn on their voir dire, the State moved for the entry of a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to the 4th and 5th counts. The motion was granted. Maryland Rule 711. The jury were examined on the voir dire. Defense counsel said: \u201cThere seems to be some question about the number of strikes. I was under the impression that larceny is a common law felony which means he can go to the penitentiary, so wouldn\u2019t that entitle me to 20 strikes?\u201d The court replied: \u201cThat is why we took the nightime burglary out. You have 4 strikes.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Proceedings were had to select the jury. The transcript shows what happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: You can make your strikes, Gentlemen, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-12\">MR. COLE [State\u2019s Attorney]: Your Honor, it will have to be reduced to 20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-13\">THE CLERK: Take the first 20 names and take 4 strikes out of those, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>THE COURT: Why do you want them called separately to the box?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\">MR. RUBENSTEIN [Defense Attorney]: Your Honor, if the State and Defense strike the same individual, in essence what I am doing is losing a strike by that method.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">THE COURT: Well, you are to sit there and strike off the names, now. If you want 12 jurors called to the box so you can look at them, we will do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">MR. RUBENSTEIN: That would be my reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">THE COURT: Well, call 12 jurors to the box, Mr. Clerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">(Twelve prospective jurors were called to the jury box at this time.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">THE COURT: Mr. Rubenstein, if I understand it, the State is not obliged to tell you who they might strike. You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">MR. COLE: Your Honor, if he wants to look at 12 jurors I think that we could put the rest of them up here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">THE COURT: Do you want these chairs filled up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">MR. RUBENSTEIN: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-13\">MR. COLE: That would be the best spot, over there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-14\">THE COURT: Whatever Mr. Rubenstein wants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-15\">MR. RUBENSTEIN: No. I\u2019ll take my strikes in this fashion. I am prepared to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-16\">THE COURT: Strike 4 names off that list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-17\">MR. RUBENSTEIN: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-18\">(The Jury was impaneled and sworn at this time.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">The judge was wrong. Rule 746 b, provides: \u201cAt the request of a defendant peremptory challenges shall be made alternately, beginning with the State.\u201d Herd was entitled to have the jury selected pursuant to the Rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>belief of the trial judge, the State was \u201cobliged to tell who they might strike\u201d, as they would be the first to strike under alternate challenges. And Herd was correct in his view that under the procedure insisted on by the court, he might well lose a challenge by both parties striking the same juror. The State now suggests that \u201ca review of the record does not necessarily show that [Herd] requested that the challenges be made alternately.\u201d It recognizes, however, that Defense counsel \u201cappeared to be concerned about the possibility of both the State and [Herd] striking the same juror,\u201d but in its view \u201cthere does not appear to have been any specific request that the peremptory challenges be made alternately.\u201d It concludes that the point is not properly before us for review under Rule 1085. We do not see it that way. Rule 522 b, makes clear that \u201c[f]or purposes of reconsideration by the trial court or review on appeal, it is sufficient that a party at the time of ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objection to the action of the court, and unless requested by the court it shall not be necessary to state the grounds therefor.\u201d In the light of Rule 746 b, we think that Herd adequately made known to the court that he desired to have the peremptory challenges made alternately. When defense counsel indicated that he would \u201ctake my strikes in this fashion\u201d it was in the frame of reference of whether he was to \u201clook at 12 jurors\u201d or to have \u201cthe chairs filled up\u201d with the rest of the jurors. We find no effective waiver of Rule 746 b, in the circumstances. See <em>Pearson v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 462, 468. <em>Cf. Bremer v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"Av3\">Having found that Herd sufficiently requested that peremptory challenges be made alternately as required by the Rule, and did not waive its operation, the question is the effect of the denial of the procedures provided by the Rule. It is our opinion that the Rule is mandatory. Upon request of a defendant, peremptory challenges <em>shall be </em>made alternately, beginning with the State. No discretion thereon is in the trial court. <em>See Bremer v. State, supra. </em>\u201c[T]he right to exercise the peremptory strike is unfettered. . . .\u201d <em>Brice v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>State, </em>264 Md. 352, 366. It represents an important right \u201cvital to the conduct of a criminal cause in this State.\u201d <em>Johnson v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 143, 149, as quoted in <em>Cook v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 395, 400. See <em>Green v. State, </em>19 Md. App. 683. In <em>Pearson v. State, supra, </em>at 465, we noted that the Court of Appeals in <em>Turpin v. State, </em>55 Md. 462, quoted <em>Proffat on Jury Trials, </em>\u00a7 155 with approval: \u201cThe right of peremptory challenge is deemed a most essential one to a prisoner, and is highly esteemed and protected in the law.\u201d In <em>Pearson </em>we held that the failure of the trial court to allow the peremptory challenges to which the accused was entitled was clearly reversible error and could not be deemed harmless error. In <em>Spencer v. State, </em>20 Md. App. 201, we held on due process grounds that interference with the orderly procedure of the peremptory challenge of jurors alternately required reversal of the judgments without a showing of prejudice, quoting at 208-209, <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 218-219. Although the case before us is in a different factual posture than <em>Spencer, </em>the effect of the trial court\u2019s ruling is the same in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Once again we are obliged to point out that the Maryland Rules of Practice and Procedure are precise rubrics \u201cestablished to promote the orderly and efficient administration of justice and [that they] are to be read and followed.\u201d <em>Brown v. Fraley, </em>222 Md. 480, 483. See <em>Isen v. Phoenix Assurance Co., </em>259 Md. 564, 570; <em>In re Arnold, </em>12 Md. App. 384. We hold that the arbitrary action of the court impaired the right of Herd to the use of his peremptory challenges. It requires that the judgments be reversed and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">II _ HI _ IV</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Because of our holding we need not decide the other issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">As to the second issue, however, see <em>St. Clair v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 605, 621-622, and <em>Reagan v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 590, 595. We note that the State suggests that when the State\u2019s witness Wayne John Cothin said, \u201cIt was dark\u201d, he was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>referring to the time the dwelling was broken but describing the stolen stereo set.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">With respect to the third issue, the privilege against self-incrimination is one personal to the witness which only he may assert. <em>Royal v. State, </em>236 Md. 443; <em>Boone v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 11. <em>See McDonald v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">As to the fourth issue, concerning the placing of Herd on \u201con indefinite probation\u201d, we call the trial court\u2019s attention to that part of Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 641A which provides: \u201cThe court may impose a sentence for a specified period and provide that a lesser period be served in confinement, suspend the remainder of the sentence and grant probation for a period longer than the sentence but not in excess of five years.\u201d And <em>see Watson v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\n<em>Judgments reversed; case re-ma,nded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-17\">. The date of 14 September 1973 in the indictment was amended in open court to read \u201con or about\u201d 16 September 1973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-10\">. Motion for judgment of acquittal as to the 11th count (grand larceny of goods of Michael Satterfield) was granted at the close of evidence offered by the State. Motions for judgment of acquittal as to the other counts were denied both at the close of evidence offered by the State and at the close of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">It appears from the transcript of the trial that the court gave counsel and the jury \u201ca copy of possible verdicts\u201d but that document is not included in the record before us. The Clerk inquired of the jury with respect to their verdicts only as to counts 1, 2, 6, 7, 12,43 and 14, and the verdict as to each was guilty. The Clerk also harkened a verdict of guilty as to the 9th count, but no such verdict was rendered by the jury. The docket entries state that the 3rd count (receiving stolen goods of Green of a value of less than $100) merged with the second count; that the 4th count (burlary of the Green dwelling) and the 5th count (burglary of the Powell dwelling) were nolle prossed; and that each of the 8th count (receiving stolen goods of the Powells of a value of $100 and upwards), the 9th count (petit larceny of goods of the Powells), and the 10th count (receiving stolen goods of the Powells of a value of less than $100) merged with the 7th count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b307-14\">. Rule 746 implements Courts Art. \u00a7 8-301. Section a 1 of the Rule provides that each defendant shall be permitted 20 peremptory challenges in a trial in which he is subject to a sentence of death, life imprisonment or 20 years or more of imprisonment. By subsection 2 of \u00a7 a, in all other cases each party shall be permitted 4 peremptory challenges, several defendants ordinarily being considered a single party. A person convicted of burglary may be imprisoned for not more than 20 years. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 29. See Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 30 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b308-20\">. Courts Art. \u00a7 8-301 (c) requires the clerk of the court to \u201cprovide a sufficient number of prospective jurors to allow the parties to exercise the peremptory challenges permitted by this section or Rule 746.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
