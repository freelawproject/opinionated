D. 1850, for erecting a lime kiln for the purpose of burning lime, and for quarrying and carrying away rock and converting the same to his own use, upon the close of the plaintiff; to which the defendant pleaded not guilty, and thereupon issue was joined to the country.

Jackson ex dem. Geates et al. v. Hathaway, 15 Johns. 447. Platt, J. delivering the opinion of the court in this case, says, \u201c Highways are regarded in our law as easements. The public acquires no more than the right of way, with the powers and privileges incident to that right, such as digging the soil and using the timber and other materials found within the space of the road, in a reasonable manner for the purpose of making and repairing the road and its bridges. When the sovereign imposes a public right of way upon the land of an individual, the title of the former owner is not extinguished, but is so qualified that it can only be enjoyed subject to that easement. The former proprietor still retains his exclusive right in all mines, quarries, springs of water, timber and earth, for every purpose not incompatible with the public right of way. The person in whom the fee of the road is, may maintain trespass, ejectment, or waste,\u201d &amp;c. See also Oakley v. Stanley, 5 Wend. 523; In the matter of Lewis Street, 2 Wend. 472; Noyes v. Chapin, 6 Wend. 464; Holiday v. Marsh, 3 Wend. 142; In the matter of Seventeenth Street, 1 Wend. 262; Livingston v. Mayor of New York, 8 Wend. 85.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-8\" pgmap=\"61\">The fee of the soil remains in the original owner, where a public road is made upon it, but the use of the road is in the public. The owner parts with the use only; for if the road should be vacated by the public, he resumes the exclusive possession of the ground, and while it is used as a highway, he is entitled to the timber and grass which may grow upon the surface, and to all minerals which may be found beneath it.

Howell\u2019s Lessees, 6 Peters, 498.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-9\" pgmap=\"61\">The owner of the soil of a highway has the same remedies, by action of trespass or ejectment, to prevent encroachments and to defend his rights against the adverse occupancy of another as the owners of land not subject to any easement. Reed v. Leads, 19 Conn. R. 182, cited in 1 U. S Law Magazine and Examiner, 100.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-12\" pgmap=\"61\">There is no evidence of the acceptance of the dedication of the locus in quo, either by the use thereof as such street and alley, or by the purchase of lots in said addition, and until the acceptance the plaintiff\u2019s title and right of use remain as though no dedication had been proposed or marked on the plat.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-4\" pgmap=\"62\">\u201c The mere laying out a town upon a man\u2019s own land and by his own private act, and the making and recording a plan of the town, may not, and as we suppose, do not, of themselves, conclude him to any extent. The land, notwithstanding these acts, is still his own, and neither any other individual, nor the public, have any right to interfere with such use of it as any man may lawfully make of his own,\u201d &amp;c.

J.</author> <p id=\"A9JG\" pgmap=\"62(299) 63(82)\">We adhere to the opinion, expressed in the case of the Canal Trustees v. Havens, (11 Ill. 554,) that the acknowledgment and recording of a town-plat vests the legal title to the ground embraced by the streets and alleys in the corporation of the town. The statute in substance declares, that these acts of the proprietor shall operate to vest the fee in the corporation, in trust for the uses and purposes of the public. By making and recording the plat, he voluntarily parts with the title to the streets and alleys, and transfers it to the corporation. The legal effect is precisely the same as if he had made a conveyance directly to the corporation. . The latter holds the legal estate for the benefit of the public. The title may, perhaps, revert to the former owners on the destruction of the corporation, or on the abandonment of the ground for the purposes of streets or alleys. But, until the estate is thus defeated, the fee is as completely out of him as if he had made an absolute and unconditional conveyance. While the fee continues in the corporation, he has no greater interest in the streets and alleys than any other person \u2014 the right of passage over them. Having neither the legal title nor the exclusive right of possession, he cannot bring trespass for any injury to the soil or freehold. He has no title to be assailed, no possession to be invaded. A party who conveys away a tract of land in trust, cannot maintain trespass or ejectment for any injury thereto until the purposes of the trust are accomplished and the title has reverted. And this case is not different in principle. The evidence clearly showed that the plaintiff had no cause of action. The acts complained of affected the corporation only, and for which it alone could seek redress. This is not like the case of a highway, in which the public acquire but a right of way or passage. The title still remains in the former proprietor, or his grantor, burdened only with the public easement, and he can maintain an action for any injury to the soil not resulting from the legitimate use of the highway.</p> <p id=\"b63-5\" pgmap=\"63\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b63-6\" pgmap=\"63\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
