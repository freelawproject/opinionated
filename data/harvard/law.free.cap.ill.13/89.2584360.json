Mr. J. O\u2019Neile can retain insurance on but $1,400 of his stock after his removal to the store adjoining Mr. Perkins, as this company cannot insure more than $5,000 in any one exposure. He can send in his policy and have the balance of it cancelled, and his note will be reduced in proportion if he chooses. He can also obtain insurance in another office, by giving due notice to this company, provided, always, that he keep an amount at his own risk equal to that insured in this office, as this company never insure more than one half the value of personal property.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-10\" pgmap=\"98\">Yours truly, M.

The house cost $3,000, and the stock will average the $10,000. Mr. A., I understand, wrote you fully the location of the house. The wall that divides A. Perkins and myself is 13 inches, running up 14 inches above the roof; on the other side of me is a dry-goods store, with same thickness of wall. The front end of my second story is occupied as a tailor\u2019s shop, the third story occupied once a week as a temperance hall, and once a week by freemasons. Whenever a flue passes through a partition, brick is built around it for eighteen inches. You will please make the alterations, and return policy at your earliest convenience.

After the policy before us was effected, the assured took out another policy, from another company, on his stock of goods, without advising the appellants of that fact, and without their sanction. ' This, they insist, avoids their policy, and rely upon the 18th section of their charter, which is as follows : \u201c If insurance on anv house or building shall be and subsist in said company and in any other office, or by or from any other person or persons at the same time, the insurance made in and by said company shall be deemed and become void, unless such double insurance subsist by and with the consent of the directors, signified by indorsement on the back of the policy, signed by the president and secretary.\u201d Here, the insurance was on a stock of merchandise; and, although it was strenuously insisted upon by counsel, I cannot think that it is necessary to enter into an argument to prove that the property insured was not a \u201c house or building,\u201d and that consequently that section does not apply in this case, but shall content myself with stating, that it is the opinion of this court that this stock of goods was not such an edifice.</p> <p id=\"b101-4\" pgmap=\"101\">The usage of the company in relation to additional insurance upon personal property, which was offered to be proved by Mr. Atwood, was properly excluded. No usage of the company, nor even the express agreement of the parties, whether made previous to, or at the time of, the execution of the policy, can be admitted to explain, modify, or control the written contract.
