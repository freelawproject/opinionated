Watkins failed to recover on the trial before the justice, and took an appeal to the Circuit Court. At the April term, 1851, of the Logan Circuit Court, the cause was tried before Davis, Justice, and a jury, and resulted in a verdict and judgment for Watkins, and McKinley brought the cause to this court by writ of error.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-25\" pgmap=\"148(41) 149(39)\">Watkins and McKinley had traded horses in 1845; after-wards they had some dispute about the trade, and Watkins threatened to sue unless McKinley would give him a horse, or the worth of the horse which McKinley had got from Watkins, the horse which Watldns had received in exchange having died. McKinley promised that, if Watldns would not sue, he would give him fifty dollars, or a horse worth that sum. Upon this promise Watldns brought his action against McKinley.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-5\" pgmap=\"149\">W. H.

McKinley never objected that the claim was unjust. He promised to pay if Watkins would not sue him for damages. This suit was upon the promise. The consideration of the promise was \u201cforbearance to sue.\u201d This is a good consideration. Rippon v. Norton, Cro. Eliz. 881; Matun v. West, Cro. Eliz, 665; Lemaster v.

If the defendant relied on his never being or having been liable on the original trade, he should have distinctly proved it. The reasons for this are many; as the death of witnesses to the original trade or contract, or their removal. Lapse of time might bar. The authorities on this point are clear. Slack v. Moss, 1 Dud.

There was no evidence of any false representations, or warranty on the part of the defendant in making the trade. After the death of the horse the plaintiff informed the defendant of the fact, and alleged that he was diseased at the time of the trade, whereupon the defendant promised to pay the plaintiff fifty dollars, or let him have a fifty-dollar horse, if he would not sue.</p> <p id=\"b151-5\" pgmap=\"151\">This action was brought to recover the fifty dollars. On the trial, the Circuit Court instructed the jury as follows:</p> <p id=\"b151-6\" pgmap=\"151\">\u201c If the jury believe from the evidence that there was a horse-trade between Watkins and McKinley, out of which a difficulty had .grown, and that Watkins was threatening to sue McKinley, and not deceiving him by any misrepresentations, and that McKinley, rather than be sued, promised Watkins .that he would pay him fifty dollars, then said promise is binding; and this regardless of the question as to whether McKinley would or would not have been liable in the suit which Watkins was threatening to bring against him.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b151-7\" pgmap=\"151\">The only question in the case is as to the propriety of this instruction, and in one point of view it is clearly erroneous. It assumes that the defendant would be bound by his promise, whether assentra to by the plaintiff or not. Unless the plaintiff were bound on his part not to do the act which formed the consideration of the promise of the defendant, the agreement was void for want of mutuality. The promise of defendant to pay fifty dollars if plaintiff would not sue him was incomplete till accepted by the plaintiff. Chitty on Contracts, 13.</p> <p id=\"b151-8\" pgmap=\"151\">A mere offer, not assented to, constitutes no contract; for there must be not only a proposal, but an acceptance thereof. Story on Contracts, \u00a7 377, 378.</p> <p id=\"b151-9\" pgmap=\"151(111) 152(122)\">The instruction in other respects is very nearly, if not quite, correct. It assumes that, in order to support the promise, there must have been a horse-trade between the parties, out of which a difficulty had arisen, and that the plaintiff was threatening to sue the defendant, and not deceiving him by any misrepresentations. If by this is to be understood, that the plaintiff must in good faith have supposed that he had a good cause of action against the defendant, growing out of the horse-trade, the instruction is strictly proper. It is immaterial whether the plaintiff could have recovered in such action or not. If he honestly supposed that he had a good cause of action, the compromise of such right was a sufficient consideration to uphold a contract fairly entered into between the parties, irrespective of the question as to mSo was in the right. It has often been decided that the compromise of a doubtful right is a sufficient consideration for a promise; and it is immaterial on whose side the right ultimately turns out to be, as it must always be on one side or the other, because there can be but one good right to the same thing. Taylor v. Patrick, 1 Bibb, 168; Russell v. Cook, 3 Hill, 504; Moore v. Fitzwater, 2 Rand. 442; O\u2019Keson v. Barclay, 2 Penn. Rep. 531.</p> <p id=\"b152-9\" pgmap=\"152\">If the plaintiff was threatening to sue on a claim which he knew was wholly unfounded, and which he was setting up as a mere pretence to extort money from the defendant, a contract founded on a promise not to sue in such a case would be utterly void. In order to support the promise there must be such a claim as to lay a reasonable ground for the defendant\u2019s making the promise, and then it is immaterial on which side the right may ultimately prove to be. Edwards v. Baugh, 11 Mees. &amp; Wels. Rep. 641; Perkins v. Gay, 3 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 331.</p> <p id=\"b152-10\" pgmap=\"152\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b152-11\" pgmap=\"152\">Judgment reversed.</p> <p id=\"b152-12\" pgmap=\"152\">Treat, C.
