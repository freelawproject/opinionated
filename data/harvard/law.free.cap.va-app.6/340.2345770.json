We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Christ George Gologanoff filed a bill of complaint in the Circuit Court of Prince George County on December 20, 1985, alleging that he and his wife, Sharon Marie Coy Gologanoff, had lived separate and apart without any cohabitation and without interruption for one year. He sought a final divorce on this ground. On January 8, 1986, Sharon filed an answer and cross-bill. She did not seek a divorce, but requested the court to award her custody of and maintenance for the children, and to incorporate into the terms and provisions of any final decree a stipulation agreement between the parties entered into on October 14, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">On January 13, 1986, Sharon filed a motion entitled \u201cMotion for Determination of Marital Property Rights.\u201d Since this motion involves the central issue in the case, we state its pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">Your defendant . . . pursuant to \u00a7 20-107.3G, . . . moves this Honorable Court to enter an order upon decreeing a divorce . . . directing that the payment of a percentage of the military pension and retirement benefits [of the plaintiff/husband] ... be paid to the defendant in either a lump sum or over a period of time to the extent that such benefits are payable, in determining that such military pension and retirement benefits derived therefrom are marital property in which your defendant has a right and bona fide interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">On July 29, 1986, Christ took depositions which proved all of the jurisdictional requirements and that he and his wife had lived separate and apart since September 1983. He testified that he and Sharon had entered into a property settlement agreement and he requested that the agreement be incorporated into the final decree of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>On September 2, 1986, Sharon took her depositions. Her testimony primarily concerned the cause of the breakup of the marriage. According to her testimony, which is uncontradicted, breakup of the marriage was the fault of her husband. She also testified that she desired the court to grant her fifty percent of her husband\u2019s retirement pension pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> based upon the facts and circumstances of the cases as outlined by her. She introduced the property settlement agreement into evidence as a defendant\u2019s exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The parties had entered into a property settlement agreement dated October 14, 1983. The preamble of the agreement recites that the parties desired to settle all of their obligations with respect to property rights, support for the children, spousal support for the wife, and to adjust all of the matters in controversy between them. Pertinent to the issue in this case is paragraph 23, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">The parties do expressly acknowledge that any rights and protections available to the Wife pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Uniform Services Former Spouses Protection Act (Title 10, Chapter 21, United States Code, Public Law 97-252) and/or arising under the Code of Virginia, 1950 (as amended) which pertain or relate to any right, title and interest which the Wife may have in the Husband\u2019s military retirement are specifically reserved by the Wife and may be exercised by her at a time subsequent to the execution of this Agreement and/or subsequent to the entry of a final decree of divorce between the parties hereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">After the evidence in the case was taken by deposition and filed in the clerk\u2019s office, Christ served notice upon Sharon that on March 2, 1987, he would appear before the court and move for entry of a final divorce decree. Counsel for both parties appeared at the appointed time and each tendered to the court a sketch of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>proposed decree. In the decree prepared by Sharon\u2019s counsel was a provision stating: \u201cIt is hereby ordered that defendant is awarded a reservation of claim in the complainant\u2019s military retirement pension, pursuant to agreement . . . .\u201d Before signing the decree, the trial court struck this sentence from the sketch of the decree. Since the decree made no other provision concerning the retirement pension, the effect of striking this part of the decree was to deny Sharon a monetary award in the military retirement plan or to reserve to her any such right for future determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The record does not contain a transcript of the March 2, 1987, hearing. Therefore, we are bound by the written statement of facts. Rule 5A:7(a)(7). The statement of facts presented by Sharon in this appeal contains a statement that she made a motion that the court hear evidence regarding what rights, if any, she would have in the military pension and that she be granted fifty percent of the pension, or, alternatively, that the matter be reserved for future determination. Christ\u2019s argument, as reflected in the statement of facts, was that no award be made to Sharon out of the pension, or reserved for future decision, because she had been treated favorably in the property settlement agreement and it would not be equitable to award her any rights in the military pension. The statement of facts states that the trial court held that it could not make a monetary award based upon the military pension alone, and that the court would need to hear evidence concerning all marital property in order to make a monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Christ filed an objection to the statement of facts, contending that it failed to accurately and fully state the court\u2019s decision. The trial court resolved the dispute in a document entitled \u201cResponse of Trial Judge Pursuant to Rule 5A:8(d).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He stated that, in addition to the rationale set forth in Sharon\u2019s statement of facts, neither party pleaded that the trial court decree as to property of the parties pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3, except in the \u201cMotion for Determination of Marital Property Rights\u201d with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>military pension. Neither party made any objection concerning the state of the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Sharon appeals the trial court\u2019s decision on two grounds. First, she maintains that she properly made a \u201crequest\u201d for a monetary award under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A), and second, she asserts that a trial court can make a monetary award based on property not settled by agreement, contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Christ advances several defenses on appeal. He alleges that neither party filed pleadings asking for a monetary award under the equitable distribution statute, other than the \u201cmotion\u201d filed by Sharon, and that the \u201cmotion\u201d was not a sufficient request for a monetary award under Code \u00a7 20-107.3. He also maintains that Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>mandates that the court determine the ownership and value of all real and personal property, and that only thereafter, based upon the equities and the rights and interests of each party in the marital property, may the court grant a monetary award. Since the evidence did not disclose the marital property or its valuation, Christ argues, the court could not make a monetary award based upon a single piece of property, such as the military pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Finally Christ asserts that Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> expressly provides that a reservation of jurisdiction may occur only \u201con the motion of both parties,\u201d that he at no time joined in such a motion, and, therefore, the trial court had no authority to reserve for future determination the question of the military pension, as requested by Sharon. Thus, Christ argues, the final decree has decided all issues before the court and a remand cannot properly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>made.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">II. REQUEST FOR MONETARY AWARD</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Christ maintains that Sharon should have requested a monetary award under Code \u00a7 20-107.3 in her answer and cross-bill by affirmatively setting forth the relief sought. Alternatively, he alleges that Sharon should have filed an amended cross-bill by leave of court in accordance with Rule 2:13.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The essence of his defense is that a \u201crequest for a monetary \u00bfward\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-107.3 must procedurally be in the form of a pleading; otherwise, the issue is not properly before the court for adjudication. We have not previously addressed whether the Rules of Court require a request for a monetary award under Code \u00a7 20-107.3 to be expressly made in formal pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In <em>Ted Lansing Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Royal Aluminum &amp; Construction Corp., </em>221 Va. 1139, 1141, 277 S.E.2d 228, 229 (1981) (quoting <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Mathieson Alkali Works, </em>165 Va. 196, 207, 181 S.E. 521, 525 (1935)), the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of pleadings, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">The basis of every right of recovery under our system of jurisprudence is a pleading setting forth facts warranting the granting of the relief sought. It is the <em>sine qua non </em>of every judgment or decree. No court can base its decree upon facts not alleged, nor render its judgment upon a right, however meritorious, which has not been pleaded and claimed .... Pleadings are as essential as proof, the one being unavailing without the other. A decree cannot be entered in the absence of pleadings upon which to found the same, and if so entered it is void .... Every litigant is entitled to be told by his adversary in plain and explicit language what is his ground of complaint or defense .... The issues in a case are made by the pleadings, and not by the testimony of witnesses or other evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>We held in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>2 Va. App. 16, 20, 340 S.E. 2d 578, 580-81 (1986), that where a wife\u2019s cross-bill sought a divorce but not spousal support, the court did not have authority to award support to her. \u201cDefendant is supposed to know the plaintiffs grievances only from his statement of them in the pleadings. Pleadings are as essential as proof, and no relief should be granted that doesn\u2019t substantially accord with the case as made in the pleadings.\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>200 Va. 799, 802, 108 S.E.2d 356, 358 (1959) (citations omitted). \u201cThe relief granted should in any event be limited to the grievance complained of in the petition. This rule is applicable in proceedings at law, as well as proceedings in equity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u201cA suit in equity [is] commenced by the filing of a bill of complaint in the clerk\u2019s office.\u201d Rule 2:2. Every pleading must state the facts on which the party relies, and a pleading is sufficient if it clearly informs the opposite party of the true matters of the claim or defense. Rule l:4(d). \u201c[A] defendant may at any time before he is in default file in the clerk\u2019s office his pleading in response;\u201d a defendant is in default \u201cif he has not filed a pleading and a period of more than twenty-one days has elapsed after due service of a subpoena upon him in this state.\u201d Rule 2:7.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The general practice in this state for many years has been to commence the bill of complaint with a recital of the jurisdictional requirements. Thereafter, a brief and clear statement of the facts of the case upon which the plaintiff relies is stated. The pleading concludes with the prayer of the complaint or a statement of the relief requested in the case. In a divorce case, all that is necessary to comply with the mandate of Code \u00a7 20-107.3 is a request in the prayer of the bill, or in the prayer of an answer or cross-bill, that the court determine the ownership and value of all property of the parties and render a monetary award in accordance with Code \u00a7 20-107.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">In the case at bar, the defendant, within twenty-one days after service of the subpoena in chancery with bill of complaint attached, filed in the clerk\u2019s office an answer and cross-bill. She did not request a monetary award under Code \u00a7 20-107.3 in either pleading. However, within a week after filing the answer and cross-bill, and still within the twenty-one day period allotted to her to file responsive pleadings, she filed a separate document in the clerk\u2019s office entitled \u201cMotion for Determination of Marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Property Rights\u201d in which she requested the court to award her a percentage of the military pension and retirement benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G). We find that this instrument, which was timely filed within the twenty-one day period in the clerk\u2019s office, was in substantial compliance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-107.3, which only required that she \u201crequest\u201d the court to apply the provisions of the equitable distribution statute to the case. To hold otherwise would be to put form over substance, which we refuse to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">III. MONETARY AWARD BASED UPON A PORTION OF MARITAL ASSETS</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Sharon next contends that the trial court had a right to make a monetary award based upon a single marital asset, the military pension, when all other matters had been settled between the parties. She argues that if the trial court lacks jurisdiction to determine the monetary award based upon a single asset, the motivation of the parties to narrow the area of disagreement by negotiation is substantially reduced. She maintains that property settlements based upon valid consideration and for a lawful purpose are favored in the law. She requests that we remand this case to the trial court with directions that it take further evidence, if necessary, and to direct it to fix an equitable monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Christ contends that, assuming Sharon has requested a monetary award, she failed to meet her burden of production of satisfactory evidence to enable the court to make a decision. He further contends that the court correctly ruled that it could not make an award where the evidence presented involved only a portion of the total marital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">We have on several occasions discussed the statutory scheme of Code \u00a7 20-107.3 for granting a monetary award in an appropriate case based upon the equities and the rights and interests of each party in the marital property. <em>See, e.g., Brinkley </em>v. <em>Brinkley, </em>5 Va. App. 132, 361 S.E.2d 139 (1987). One of the principles running throughout our decisions is that, in making a monetary award, <em>all </em>of the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-107.3 must be followed. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 136-37, 361 S.E.2d at 140-41; <em>Clayberg v. Clayberg, </em>4 Va. App. 218, 222, 355 S.E.2d 902, 904 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) provides that, upon request that a monetary award be made, the court \u201cshall determine the legal title as between the parties, and the ownership and value of <em>all </em>property.\u201d (emphasis added). Code \u00a7 20-107.3(B) provides that, for purposes of the equitable distribution statute only, the parties shall be deemed to have rights and interests in the marital property, but such rights and interests shall not attach to the legal title of such property. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D) states that the court may grant a monetary award to either party based upon the equities and the rights and interests of each party in the marital property. Implicit within the meaning of these provisions is that the Court\u2019s monetary award shall be based upon the equities and the rights and interests of each party in <em>all </em>of the marital property. The scheme of the statute makes no provision for a trial judge to grant a monetary award based upon consideration of less than all of the marital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Sharon\u2019s argument that such a construction would eliminate any motivation for the parties to narrow the area of disagreement and settle a portion of the problems does not follow. Our interpretation of the necessary prerequisites for the trial judge to make a monetary award does not stifle the parties\u2019 incentive to settle all or part of their differences over their property. Its impact upon the motivation for the parties to settle is negligible. The parties may still narrow the areas of disagreement and settle their differences concerning all or part of their property; they may agree to divide their property in any manner that they deem appropriate. However, if they cannot settle all of the property issues, evidence must be presented to the trial judge concerning that portion of the settlement that they are able to accomplish. If their settlement placed a classification and value upon which they reached agreement, the Court must be informed of those classifications and values. If their settlement did not classify and value the property which they agreed to divide, the parties must then, either agree upon classifications and values of the settled property or provide evidence upon which the trial court may classify the settled property as separate or marital and value the property. If, in accordance with the scheme contemplated by the statue, the trial judge is to make a monetary award based upon the unsettled property, the trial judge must be provided with a basis upon which to give effect to the parties\u2019 existing settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>In this case, the evidence did not disclose the particulars of the settlement, including the classification and value of the settled property. Furthermore, the present value of the military retirement plan, which was to be the basis of the monetary award was not in evidence. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(8). Therefore, the evidence was insufficient for the trial court to make a monetary award under Code \u00a7 20-107.3, and the trial court properly ruled that it could not make a monetary award due to the insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Benton, J., and Duff, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\"> Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The court may direct payment of a percentage of pension, profit-sharing or retirement benefits, whether vested or nonvested, payable in a lump sum or over a period of time and only as such benefits are payable.
