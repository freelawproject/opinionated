When he was observed, his moped was being propelled by its motor, although footpedalling was required to initiate its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a) prohibits driving \u201cany motor vehicle or any self-propelled machinery or equipment on any highway\u201d during a period of suspension or revocation of an operator\u2019s license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since a moped is expressly excluded from the definition of a motor vehicle, Code \u00a7 46.1-1(15), its operation is prohibited by Code \u00a7 46.1-350 only if it is \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">The words, \u201cself-propelled machinery,\u201d are not ambiguous. Words are ambiguous if they admit to \u201cbeing understood in more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>than one way\u201d or refer to \u201ctwo or more things simultaneously.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, 229 </em>Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). They may also be ambiguous if they are \u201cdifficult to comprehend,\u201d \u201cof doubtful import,\u201d or lack \u201cclearness and definiteness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The term, \u201cself-propelled machinery\u201d is none of these.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The meaning of \u201cself-propelled machinery,\u201d is clear and has only one meaning. \u201cSelf-propelled\u201d is an adjective meaning \u201c[containing its own means of propulsion . . . .\u201d <em>American Heritage Dictionary </em>1113 (2d College ed. 1982). Machinery refers to \u201c[m] achines or machine parts collectively,\u201d while a machine is \u201c[a] system, usually of rigid bodies, formed and connected to alter, transmit, and direct applied forces in a predetermined manner to accomplish a specific objective . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">According to these definitions, a moped is a \u201cself-propelled\u201d machine. Like a bicycle, it is a system of rigid bodies or parts formed and connected to direct energy in a predetermined manner to accomplish locomotion. Unlike a bicycle, it is equipped with a helper motor and, therefore, contains its own means of propulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Since the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, judicial construction is not required. Brown, 229 Va. at 321, 330 S.E.2d at 87. The general rules of statutory construction do not apply, and we may not \u201cresort to legislative history and extrinsic facts\u201d to interpret words whose meaning is clear. <em>Id. </em>We must \u201ctake the words as written\u201d and give them their plain meaning. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The appellant argues that the words, \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d are ambiguous because they are too inclusive. But, broadly inclusive language in a statute is not ambiguous if the legislature\u2019s objective requires such language. <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Chakrabarty, </em>447 U.S. 303, 315 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Even if we were to accept Digg\u2019s argument that the term is ambiguous, the legislative history supports our conclusion that a moped is \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a). The General Assembly\u2019s broad objective in using the language \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d is apparent from the statute\u2019s history. Immediately preceding the adoption of Code \u00a7 46.2-350(a) the Virginia Advisory Legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Counsel recommended to the General Assembly that anyone whose operator\u2019s license is suspended or revoked be prohibited from operating \u201cany self-propelled <em>farm </em>machinery or <em>construction </em>equipment.\u201d <em>See Report of the Virginia Advisory Legislative Counsel, Safety of Virginia Highways, </em>S. Doc. No. 8, at 7 (1963) (emphasis added). The General Assembly responded by amending Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a) to include \u201cany self-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d without the limitations of the modifying words \u201cfarm\u201d or \u201cconstruction.\u201d This action demonstrated the legislature\u2019s intent that the words \u201cmachinery\u201d and \u201cequipment\u201d have their plain, even though broad, meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">This broad objective of the language in Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a) was not diminished by later legislative amendments to other parts of the motor vehicle laws. The exclusion of bicycles and mopeds from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d eliminated the requirements of registration and operators\u2019 licenses for mopeds but did not alter their status as self-propelled machinery or equipment under Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.1-1(15). The increased use of mopeds has required the General Assembly to amend various parts of the motor vehicle code to either include or exclude mopeds from the application of those provisions. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.1-17, 46.1-171.1, 46.1-215.1, 46.1-229.1, 46.1-263. However, because the language \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d was already sufficiently broad to accomplish the legislature\u2019s objectives in Code \u00a7 46.1-350, it was not necessary to broaden its reach any further. Mopeds were included within its reach without the necessity of amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Diggs contends that another provision of the motor vehicle code, Code \u00a7 46.1-171.1, demonstrates a legislative intent to treat a moped as something other than self-propelled machinery or equipment. Code \u00a7 46.1-171.1 authorizes the State Highway and Transportation Board to prohibit the use of interstate highways \u201cby any or all . . . (1) Pedestrians, (2) persons riding bicycles or mopeds, (3) horse-drawn vehicles, (4) self-propelled machinery or equipment, and (5) animals led, ridden or driven on the hoof.\u201d Diggs suggests that by listing \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d separately from \u201cpersons riding bicycles or mopeds\u201d the legislature intended to treat these categories as separate and distinguishable for purposes of Title 46.1. Therefore, he reasons that, since mopeds are listed separately from \u201cself-propeiied machinery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>or equipment\u201d in Code \u00a7 46.1-171.1, the category of \u201cany self-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 46.1-350 does not include mopeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Since the language of Code \u00a7 46.1-350 is clear and unambiguous, we cannot use judicial construction to give it new meaning; however, if we were to look beyond the meaning of the language, we would not agree with Diggs\u2019 analysis. The categories contained in Code \u00a7 46.1-171.1 are not mutually exclusive. A highway use described by one category may also be described by another. A \u201chorse-drawn\u201d vehicle may also be an animal \u201cled, ridden or driven on the hoof.\u201d Similarly, a \u201cmoped\u201d may also be \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Other provisions of the motor vehicle code do not define \u201cmachinery\u201d or \u201cequipment\u201d nor do they limit the definition of these terms in a way that would exclude mopeds. Diggs points to other provisions where these terms are used and contends that the manner of their use excludes mopeds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, in each instance of their use the terms simply enumerate certain tangible personalty without attempting, either explicitly or implicitly, to define \u201cmachinery\u201d or \u201cequipment\u201d or limit what may be included within their scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In addition, Virginia Attorney General opinions have consistently held, without contrary legislative response, that one whose license is suspended or revoked cannot legally operate a moped on public highways during the period of suspension or revocation. <em>See Op. Va. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>215-16 (Oct. 26, 1984); <em>Op. Va. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>265-67 (July 20, 1977); <em>Op. Va. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>251-52 (Oct. 2, 1975). Although the Attorney General\u2019s opinions are not binding, <em>Barber </em>v. <em>City of Danville, </em>149 Va. 418, 424, 141 S.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>126, 127 (1928), they are persuasive, <em>id., </em>and may be used as an \u201caid in construing legislative intent.\u201d <em>Richard L.

This section provides that no person whose operator\u2019s license has been suspended or revoked \u201cshall therafter drive <em>any motor vehicle or any self-propelled machinery or equipment </em>on any highway in this Commonwealth.\u201d (emphasis added). We, therefore, must determine whether a moped is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d or any self-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d to bring Diggs under the provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">We must first know what a moped is. By statutory definition a moped is a \u201cbicycle-like device with pedals and a helper motor which is rated at no more than two brake horsepower and which produces speeds up to a maximum of thirty miles per hour.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.1-1 (14b). If a vehicle has more power or speed than provided in the statute, it is not a moped. If we use the generally accepted definition of a motor vehicle to ascertain its meaning, a moped is a motor vehicle under Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a). What is obvious, however, turns into obscurity when we read the definitional section of the Motor Vehicle Code. Code \u00a7 46.1-1(15) states: \u201c[A]ny device herein defined as a bicycle or a moped shall be deemed not to be a motor vehicle.\u201d Therefore, since a moped is not a motor vehicle, it is encompassed within the prohibition of Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a) only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>if it is deemed \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment,\u201d a term not defined in the Motor Vehicle Code. We must determine whether Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a) is clear and unambiguous. If so, the plain meaning must be accepted without resort to extrinsic evidence and rules of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u201cIt is a settled rule of construction in this state that where a statute is plain and unambiguous there is no room for construction by the court and the plain meaning and intent of the statute will be given it.\u201d <em>McClung </em>v. <em>Henrico County, </em>200 Va. 870, 874, 108 S.E.2d 513, 516 (1959); <em>see Winston </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>196 Va. 403, 407-08, 83 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1954); <em>Almond v. Gilmer, </em>188 Va. 1, 14-15, 49 S.E.2d 431, 439 (1948).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">Language is ambiguous if it admits to being understood in more than one way or refers to two or more things simultaneously. An ambiguity exists when the language is difficult to comprehend, is of doubtful import, or lacks clearness and definiteness. . . .[WJhen an enactment is unambiguous, extrinsic legislative history may not be used to create an ambiguity, and then remove it, where none otherwise exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\"><em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Applying these rules to the facts of this case, we find the language of Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a), \u201cany motor vehicle or any self-propelled machinery or equipment,\u201d to be ambiguous. Admittedly, the terms \u201cmachinery or equipment\u201d are all inclusive and one can hardly think of any device not included. As already stated, Code \u00a7 46.1-1(15) defines \u201cMotor Vehicle\u201d and exempts from it, by definition, a bicycle or a moped. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1986) defines \u201cmachinery\u201d as (1) \u201cmachines as a functionary unit:\u201d such as \u201cthe constituent parts of a machine or instrument; equipment, stock, or range of machines\u201d; (2) \u201cthe means and appliances by which something is kept in action or a desired result is obtained.\u201d A synonym for \u201cmachinery\u201d is \u201cequipment.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>gives many and varied definitions for \u201cmachine.\u201d The most logical in the context of this case is: \u201cengine, apparatus, appliance, signify [ing], in common, a device, often complex, <em>for doing work </em>beyond human physical or mental limitations or faster than the human hand or mind.\u201d (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>added). Machine applies to a construction or organization whose parts are so connected and interrelated that it can be set in motion and perform work as a unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"><em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201cequipment,\u201d among other things, as (1) \u201cthe implements (as machinery or tools) used in an operation or activity;\u201d (2) \u201call the fixed assets other than land and buildings of a business enterprise;\u201d (3) \u201capparatus, machinery, paraphernalia, outfit, tackle, gear, material ... in common, all the things used in a given work or useful in effecting as given end.\u201d The Commonwealth argues from these definitions that a moped is \u201cmachinery\u201d or \u201cequipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">I think it unreasonable to conclude that the legislature would pass Code \u00a7 46.1-1 (14b) in 1981, providing that a moped is not a motor vehicle, intending at the same time to include the device as \u201cmachinery or equipment.\u201d If the legislature had intended this contradictory result, it presumably would not have excluded \u201cmoped\u201d from the definition of a motor vehicle. The words \u201cmachinery\u201d and \u201cequipment\u201d are so broad that it is difficult to garner from them the meaning and intent of the legislation. Certainly, the precise meaning of these words is difficult to comprehend in the context of this statute. I differ with the view of the majority that the meaning of \u201cself-propelled machinery\u201d is clear and unambiguous. They conclude that judicial construction is not required and that they need not resort to legislative history and extrinsic facts to interpret words whose meaning is clear. I conclude that the language is ambiguous, permitting us to seek legislative history to determine the true meaning and intent of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Since I find that the statute is ambiguous, I must resort to the history of the statute and the rules of construction to determine legislative intent, which is the primary concern of statutory construction. <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Industry </em>v. <em>Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>233 Va. 97, 101-02, 353 S.E.2d 758, 762 (1987). \u201cThe divergent interpretations discussed above demonstrate the difficulty one encounters in trying to ascertain the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 353 S.E.2d at 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The history of the Motor Vehicle Code is informative in determining legislative intent. Section 2154(39)a(b) of the 1930 Code of Virginia defined the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as \u201cevery vehicle, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>herein defined, which is self-propelled.\u201d The term \u201cvehicle\u201d was defined in subsection (a) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">Every device in, upon or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a public highway, except devices moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Code \u00a7 2154(39)a(a) (1930). The 1930 Code does not define the terms bicycle or moped. Notably, as far back as 1930, motor vehicles have been defined as <em>self-propelled, </em>and <em>devices </em>moved by human power have been exempted from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">In 1958, title 46 was repealed and the Motor Vehicle Code was reenacted as title 46.1. Former Code \u00a7 46-347.1 of the 1952 Code was reenacted as Code \u00a7 46.1-350 of the 1958 Code. In 1963, the Virginia Advisory Legislative Council compiled a report entitled \u201cSafety on Virginia Highways\u201d which was presented to thp Governor and the General Assembly of Virginia. <em>See Report of the Virginia Advisory Legislative Council, Safety of Virginia Highways, </em>S. Doc. No. 8 (1963). This report contains numerous recommendations, two of which are pertinent to our inquiry in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">First, the Council recommended that legislation should be adopted making it \u201cunlawful for any person whose operator\u2019s license is under suspension or revocation to operate any self-propelled <em>farm </em>machinery or <em>construction </em>equipment\u201d on Virginia highways. S. Doc. No. 8, at 7 (emphasis added). The reason given for this recommendation was that the privilege to operate such machinery and equipment was abused by those whose licenses had been revoked, and the use of such machinery or equipment in lieu of motor vehicles added \u201can unnecessary hazard to our overcrowded highways.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">In response to the Council\u2019s report, the General Assembly, in its 1964 session, amended Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a) to read, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cNo person . . . whose operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s license . . . has been suspended or revoked . . . shall thereafter drive any motor vehicle <em>or any self-propelled machinery or equipment </em>on any highway in this State.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a) (1967 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Repl. Vol.). The amendment incorporated the language recommended by the Council except that \u201cfarm\u201d was omitted before \u201cmachinery\u201d and \u201cconstruction\u201d was omitted before \u201cequipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Secondly, the Council recommended that \u201cthe State Department of Highways be given authority to prohibit the use of controlled access highways by pedestrians, bicycles, horse-drawn vehicles, self-propelled <em>farm or construction </em>machinery or equipment, and animals led, ridden or driven on the hoof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7 (emphasis added). This recommendation resulted in the enactment of Code \u00a7 46.1-171.1, in 1964, which provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">The State Highway Commission may, when necessary to promote safety, prohibit the use of interstate highways . . . and other controlled access highways or any part thereof by any of the following: (1) Pedestrians, (2) persons riding bicycles, (3) horse-drawn vehicles, (4) <em>self-propelled machinery or equipment, </em>and (5) animals led, ridden or driven on the hoof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Code \u00a7 46.1-171.1 (Repl. Vol). Again, the Council\u2019s recommendation was adopted verbatim except that the words \u201cfarm or construction\u201d were deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Ihe omission of \u201cfarm\u201d and \u201cconstruction\u201d in the statutes suggests that the General Assembly recognized that machinery and equipment were operated upon the highways for uses other than \u201cfarm\u201d and \u201cconstruction\u201d purposes. I think that the report of the Virginia Advisory Legislative Council clearly indicates that the legislature did not have in mind every conceivable mechanical contrivance that man can imagine, but rather those types of self-propelled machinery and equipment usually designed for and associated with agricultural and construction work. The absence of any reference to a moped indicates that the General Assembly did not consider it \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment.\u201d Even if in existence at the time, they clearly would have been included in the term \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d The primary purpose of machines and equipment is to generate energy with which to perform work. A moped has no connection with work. I find nothing in the legislative history of the statutes which indicates that mopeds are ordinarily considered instruments to accomplish work, as is the case with machines and equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>In 1981 the General Assembly made several significant changes in Code \u00a7 46.1-1 concerning definitions which involved mopeds, and they must be read together to determine their intent and meaning. For the first time a moped was defined in the Motor Vehicle Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">A bicycle-like device with pedals and a helper motor which is rated at no more than two brake horsepower and which produces speeds at up to a maximum of thirty miles per hour.... For purposes of Chapter 4 (\u00a7 46.1-168 <em>et seq.) </em>of this title, a moped shall be a vehicle while operated upon a highway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Code \u00a746.1-l(14b).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Chapter Four of the Motor Vehicle Code is entitled Regulation of Traffic. This chapter encompasses Code \u00a7 46.1-171, which specifically provides that \u201c[e]very person riding a bicycle or moped or an animal upon a highway . . . shall have all of the rights and . . . duties applicable to the driver of a vehicle.\u201d Since section 14(b) of Code \u00a7 46.1-1 states that for purposes of chapter 4 a moped shall be treated as a vehicle while operated upon a highway, this by implication denotes that it is not a vehicle for purposes of other chapters in the Motor Vehicle Code. In subsection (14) the definition of \u201cmotorcycle\u201d was amended to except from the motorcycle class any vehicle included within the term \u201cmoped.\u201d The term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d was amended to provide that a moped is not deemed a motor vehicle. The impact of these amendments clearly shows that the General Assembly intended to place a moped in a classification of its own and did not consider it to be \u201cmachinery or equipment.\u201d If it had intended such a result, it would have added the term moped to the devices specified in Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Also in the 1981 session, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 46.1-171.1 to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">The State Highway and Transportation Commission may . . . prohibit the use of interstate highways ... by any or all of the following: (1) Pedestrians, (2) persons riding bicycles <em>or mopeds, </em>(3) horse-drawn vehicles, (4) self-propelled machinery or equipment, and (5) animals led, ridden or driven on the hoof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>(emphasis added). This amendment further demonstrates that the legislature equated bicycles and mopeds and did not intend \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d to encompass mopeds. Otherwise, the language \u201cor mopeds\u201d would be surplusage, and \u201cwe will assume that [the legislature\u2019s] amendments to the law are purposeful and not unnecessary or vain.\u201d <em>Cape Henry Towers, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Gypsum Co., 229 </em>Va. 596, 600, 331 S.E.2d 476, 479 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The legislative intent to equate mopeds with bicycles and not \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d is reinforced by comparing various definitions throughout Title 46.1. First, a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is defined as \u201cself-propelled\u201d in Code \u00a7 46.1-1(15) while the term \u201cself-propelled\u201d does not appear in the definition of \u201cmoped\u201d in Code \u00a7 46.1-1 (14b). This suggests that the legislature did not consider a moped to be \u201cself-propelled\u201d in the context of Title 46.1. The terms \u201cSelf-propelled\u201d and \u201cmachinery\u201d are used in Code \u00a7 46.1-1(7) to define \u201cfarm tractor\u201d and the term \u201cmachinery\u201d is also used in Code \u00a7 46.1-352 to describe certain farm and construction vehicles, yet none of these terms was used to define \u201cmopeds.\u201d Had the legislature considered a moped to be self-propelled machinery or equipment, it presumably would have used those terms in describing a moped as it did in describing other vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Finally, I am cognizant of three opinions of the Attorney General stating that a moped is \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment,\u201d and that it is, therefore, covered by Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a). <em>See Op. Va. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>215-16 (Oct. 26, 1984); <em>Op. Va. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>265-67 (July 20, 1977); <em>Op. Va. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>251-52 (Oct. 2, 1975). Although these opinions are entitled to due consideration, they are not binding. <em>Albemarle County v. Marshall, </em>215 Va. 756, 762, 214 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1975); <em>Barber </em>v. <em>City of Danville, </em>149 Va. 418, 424, 141 S.E. 126, 127 (1928). I am unwilling to conclude that the legislature has, by its inaction, approved the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a) because this interpretation is not consistent with the apparent intent of the legislature as disclosed in the foregoing legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The Commonwealth acknowledges that no Virginia case discusses this issue, and from other jurisdictions cites <em>State v. Senko, </em>457 A.2d 824 (Me. 1983); <em>Royal-Globe Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>385 Mass. 1013, 434 N.E.2d 213 (1982); <em>Lalomia </em>v. <em>Bankers &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>Shippers Insurance Co., </em>312 N.Y.S.2d 1018 (1970), <em>aff'd, </em>291 N.E.2d 724 (1972); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co., </em>502 A.2d 676 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1985); <em>People </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>75 Cal. App. 3d 1, 142 Cal. Rptr. 401 (1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stancil, </em>422 A.2d 1285 (D.C. App. 1980), in support of its position. All of these cases are readily distinguishable from the pending case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\"><em>Senko </em>was based upon a statutory provision in Maine which defined a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as \u201cany self-propelled vehicle not operated exclusively on tracks.\u201d 457 A.2d at 825. <em>Royal-Globe Insurance </em>was decided upon an insurance policy which defined \u201cauto\u201d as \u201ca land motor vehicle.\u201d The defendant admitted that a moped moved over land and had a motor. The court concluded that a moped was a \u201cland motor vehicle.\u201d 385 Mass. at 1013, 434 N.E.2d at 213-14. In <em>Lalomia, </em>a motorized bicycle was held to be a motor vehicle within the meaning of an uninsured motorist endorsement contained in an insurance policy. 312 N.Y.S.2d at 1024. In <em>Myers, </em>a moped was determined to be a motor vehicle because it \u201cwas required to be licensed\u201d under that state\u2019s law. 502 A.2d at 677-78. In <em>Jordan, </em>a moped was considered a motor vehicle in a drunk driving case, 75 Cal. App. 3d at 7, 142 Cal. Rptr. at 405; and in <em>Standi </em>a moped was considered a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of a statute governing unauthorized use of a vehicle. 422 A.2d at 287-88. However, these cases are unlike the pending case because the Commonwealth admits that, by statutory definition, a moped is not a motor vehicle in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The most analogous opinion from another state is <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Criterion Insurance Co., </em>461 So. 2d 1348 (Fla. 1984), where the issue before the court was whether a moped was a self-propelled vehicle. The Florida Supreme Court held that for purposes of the Florida Automobile Reparations Reform Act, the statue in question unambiguously defined a moped as a bicycle. It further held that a bicycle was not a motor vehicle as defined and concluded that the legislature did not intend that a moped be considered a self-propelled vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">I would hope that a moped is not a \u201cmotor vehicle or any self-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d within the meaning and intent of Code \u00a7 46.1-3 50(a). For these reasons, I would reverse the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
