At sentencing the trial court ruled that the mandatory provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 prevented sentencing the accused to an indeterminate commitment to the Department of Corrections under Code \u00a7 19.2-311.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">The sentencing alternatives under Code \u00a7 19.2-311 differ from those required by Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Under Code \u00a7 19.2-311, a trial court may commit certain youthful offenders to the Department of Corrections for a period of four years which shall be an indeterminate commitment except that it shall not exceed four years. On the other hand, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 requires the trial court to sentence a person convicted of the offense of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony to prison for two years for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>first conviction and to four years for each following conviction. Thus, a commitment under Code \u00a7 19.2-311 is contrary to the mandatory provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The mandatory sentence in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 aims to deter violent criminal conduct by imposing a mandatory penalty. \u201cThe purpose of [this statute], keyed to serious crimes and prescribing inflexible penalties, is to deter violent criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Holloman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 196, 198, 269 S.E.2d 356, 358 (1980). By replacing a \u201cwide range of discretionary penalties\u201d with \u201cinflexible penalties,\u201d the General Assembly intended \u201cto deter violent criminal conduct <em>rather than to reform </em>the most dangerous class of criminals.\u201d <em>Ansell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 763, 250 S.E.2d 760, 763 (1979) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">This purpose would be eroded by committing an offender under Code \u00a7 19.2-311 in lieu of sentencing him under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. This would substitute a discretionary penalty for an inflexible one. The General Assembly has directed a contrary policy which courts must follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err, and we affirm the judgments of convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Baker, J., and Hodges, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
