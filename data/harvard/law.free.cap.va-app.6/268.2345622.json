On this appeal, Prince raises the questions whether the walkway on which she fell and injured herself was part of Pan Am\u2019s extended premises and whether her injury is compensable. We conclude that Prince suffered an injury by accident which arose out of and in the course of her employment, and we reverse the commission\u2019s denial of an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">The facts which gave rise to the claim are undisputed and not complex. Pan Am employed Prince as a reservations clerk in an office building where it leased several floors. A walkway extends from the public sidewalk onto the grounds surrounding the building. At a point on the grounds the walkway divides and leads to two entrances, which are located on opposite sides of the building. On Jamiary 3, 1987, the walkway was partly covered by snow and ice which had been deposited by a snowstorm on the previous day.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Prince normally ate her lunch on Pan Am\u2019s premises; however, on this day she and a co-worker went to a restaurant across the street from the building for lunch because the vending machines in the building were empty. Although Prince was paid for a full eight hour day, including her lunch hour, she was free to eat either on or off the premises. As Prince and her co-worker were returning to work from the lunch break, Prince slipped on ice on the walkway and fell backwards approximately five feet from the building\u2019s entrance. She suffered disabling injuries to her hip, low back, neck, and head.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Upon the evidence adduced at the hearing, Commissioner Joyner found that the walkway where Prince fell was part of Pan Am\u2019s extended premises and that the ice on the walkway caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Prince to slip and fall. Citing several commission decisions, including <em>Ocheltree </em>v. <em>Dairy Queen/Brazier, </em>64 O.I.C. 244 (1985)(parking lot of a shopping center was the extended premises of an employer whose business was located there and whose employees were directed to park in distant parts of the lot), Commissioner Joyner held that Prince\u2019s injury arose out of and during the course of employment. Upon review, the full commission reversed the award of compensation, holding that there was \u201cno legal basis for extending the employer\u2019s premises to take care of the sidewalk where this employee fell.\u201d Citing its decision in <em>Cousins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth of Virginia, State Comptroller\u2019s Office </em>(unpublished, May 12, 1977)(\u201centrance to . . . building and at least the first step onto the walkway is deemed in the scope of employment as part of . . . building\u201d), the commission concluded that an employer\u2019s premises stop \u201cwhen the employee has reached the public walkway to the building.\u201d Because we conclude that the walkway where Prince was injured falls within Pan Am\u2019s extended premises, we reverse the decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">[A]n accident occurs in the \u201ccourse of employment\u201d when it takes place within the period of employment, at a place where the employee may be reasonably expected to be, and while he is reasonably fulfilling the duties of his employment or is doing something which is reasonably incident thereto. . . .

Generally, an employee going to and from the workplace is not engaged in activity arising out of and in the course of employment. <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co., </em>143 Va. 62, 66, 129 S.E. 330, 331 (1925). Employment, however, cannot be rigidly limited by the walls of the specific space that constitute the workplace.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">[Tjhere is no concept of \u201cinstantaneous exit\u201d from a place of employment immediately upon termination of work. . . .

Giles, </em>276 U.S. 154, 158 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Initially, we note that the principles applicable to going to and from the workplace are also applicable to the journey to and from a lunch break.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">[W]hen the employee has a definite place and time of work, and the time of work does not include the lunch hour, the trip away from and back to the premises for the purpose of getting lunch is indistinguishable in principle from the trip at the beginning and end of the work day. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">1 A. Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 15.51 (1985); <em>see also Borelli </em>v. <em>New York Telephone Co., </em>93 A.D.2d 940, 940, 462 N.Y.S.2d 305, 306 (1983). Although our Supreme Court held in <em>Taylor v. Binswanger &amp; Co., </em>130 Va. 545, 107 S.E. 649 (1921) and <em>Dreyfus &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Meade, </em>142 Va. 567, 129 S.E. 336 (1925) that the employees, who were injured during their lunch breaks, did not suffer injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, these decisions are not inconsistent with the principle that employees going to and from lunch are of the same status as employees going to and from work. In <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Meade, </em>the employees were injured by automobiles several blocks distant from their employers\u2019 premises while travelling on public streets. In both cases, the employees were beyond any reasonable construction of the employers\u2019 premises or extended premises. In neither case could it be said that the employee was upon the premises of another \u201cin such proximity and relation as to be in practical effect a part of the employers\u2019 premises.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>233 Va. at 252, 355 S.E.2d at 331. Thus, neither <em>Taylor </em>nor <em>Meade </em>conflicts with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>essential premise that when an employee is legitimately entering or leaving the employer\u2019s premises for lunch as expected or required, the nexus to the employment is no greater or less than when the employee is entering or leaving the employer\u2019s premises at the beginning or end of the work day. Consequently, we apply those governing principles to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Pan Am argues that Prince was not on its premises when injured. Pan Am and Prince agree that when Prince slipped and fell on ice approximately five feet from one of two entrances to the building she w\u00e1s no longer on the sidewalk maintained by the city but, rather, she was on the privately owned walkway leading to the building where Pan Am\u2019s offices were located. It is also not disputed that this walkway was open to members of the public who conducted business with the building\u2019s tenants. We conclude that the undisputed evidence that Pan Am was neither the owner of the property nor the sole tenant in the building is not controlling. <em>See Barnes, </em>233 Va. at 252, 355 S.E.2d at 331. Likewise, it is not significant that other tenants and members of the public invited to enter the business had a right to use the walkway. <em>See Chicago Tribune v. Industrial Comm\u2019n of Illinois, </em>136 Ill. App. 3d 260, 483 N.E.2d 327 (1985); <em>In re Harlow\u2019s Case, </em>345 Mass. 765, 186 N.E.2d 925 (1962); <em>Harrold </em>v. <em>Air Terminal Services, Inc., </em>53 O.I.C. 132 (1971); <em>Bertnick </em>v. <em>Hotel Roanoke Beauty Shop, </em>37 O.I.C. 147 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Prince entered the premises legitimately at the conclusion of her lunch to resume work-related duties. Her presence on the walkway to the building, therefore, was required and expected by virtue of her employment by Pan Am. Although not owned by and not required to be maintained by Pan Am, the walkway was provided by the owner of the building as a convenience to the tenants for use by their employees and invitees. According to Professor Larson, when, the workplace is located in an office building, an injury sustained by an employee in that building or on the grounds immediately surrounding the building is generally considered to have taken place on the employer\u2019s premises, even if the employer did not own or lease the particular place where the injury occurred, provided the employer \u201chas some kind of right of passage, as in the case of common stairs, elevators, lobbies, vestibules, concourses, hallways, walkways, ramps, footbridges, driveways, or passageways through which the employer has something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>equivalent to an easement.\u201d 1 A. Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 15.43 (1985). Here, the walkway was a common avenue of passage over the grounds and an essential means of ingress and egress from the public right-of-way to Pan Am\u2019s place of business. As such, it constituted the premises \u201cof another in such proximity and relation as to be in practical effect a part of the employer\u2019s premises.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>233 Va. at 252, 355 S.E.2d at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Pan Am further argues that recovery should be denied because Prince was walking along one of the two available paths leading to the building\u2019s entrances. <em>Cf. Kendrick </em>v. <em>Nationwide Homes, Inc., </em>4 Va. App. 189, 355 S.E.2d 347 (1987)(recovery denied when injury occurred off the plant site on a railroad crossing over one of two roads leading to the plant site). We disagree. Because the injury occurred on property that we deem \u201cto be in practical effect\u201d a part of Pan Am\u2019s premises, it is irrelevant that there were two entrances to the building and that the walkway on which Prince fell was not the exclusive means of entering the building. <em>See generally </em>1 A. Larson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 15.43. Moreover, even if Pan Am had no control or management over the walkway which provided access from the public sidewalk across the private grounds to the building, the hazards of that route quite obviously were hazards of the employment because it was necessary to traverse that route to enter the building from the public right-of-way. \u201c[Ejmployment may begin in point of time before the work is entered upon and in point of space before the place where the work to be done is reached.\u201d <em>Bountiful Brick Co., </em>276 U.S. at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We also note that the record reflects that the path along the walkway to the other entrance was no less hazardous. Prince\u2019s coworker fell on the other path as she and Prince entered the building earlier that morning at the beginning of the work day. Furthermore, Prince was not dawdling at the time she fell. There is no evidence in the record which suggests that she was engaged in a personal venture. The route that Prince was taking was the most direct route from the restaurant to her place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In reversing the award, the commission likened this case to <em>Jessee </em>v. <em>Dr. James Roberson, </em>60 O.I.C. 232 (1981) and distinguished it from the commission\u2019s unpublished opinion of <em>Cousins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth of Virginia, State Comptroller\u2019s Office </em>(May 12, 1977). We disagree with that analysis. In <em>Jessee </em>the employee was returning from lunch \u201cand was approximately two doors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>down from her office when a car jumped the curb and struck her while she was walking down the sidewalk.\u201d <em>lessee </em>at 233. In contrast to the employee in <em>lessee </em>who was not by any definition on the premises of her employer, the employee in <em>Cousins </em>was \u201cstepping from her building\u2019s last granite step onto the icy brick walkway . . . [when] she slipped and fell.\u201d The commission properly determined that \u201cthe entrance to [Cousins\u2019] building and at least the first step onto the walkway is deemed in the scope of employment as part of her building.\u201d We conclude that the circumstances surrounding Prince\u2019s injury, occurring at a place functionally equivalent to the employer\u2019s premises, more closely parallel the facts and holding of <em>Cousins. See also Chicago Tribune </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm\u2019n of Illinois, </em>136 Ill. App. 3d 260, 483 N.E.2d 327 (1985)(a fall in a public shopping gallery located in the lobby of the building where claimant was employed on the eighth floor occurred on the premises and was compensable); <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>Sentry Ins. Co., </em>415 So. 2d 467 (La. Ct. App. 1982)(injury occurring on concrete ramp leading to building where claimant was employed was on the premises and compensable); <em>Interstate United Corp. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd., </em>56 Pa. Commw. 385, 424 A.2d 1015 (1981)(injury which occurred on a footbridge connecting plant grounds to a public street was on the premises and compensable); <em>Morris v. City of Oklahoma City, </em>606 P.2d 1129 (Okla. 1979) (injury on a ramp leading to building where claimant was employed occurred on the premises and was compensable); <em>Bergeron </em>v. <em>Kilnic Co., </em>108 R.I. 313, 274 A.2d 753 (1971)(injury occurring on a driveway which connected the building in which claimant was employed to the public street was on the premises and was a compensable injury); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>YWCA, </em>215 Pa. Super. 19, 257 A.2d 690 (1969)(injury occurring on pavement which was located on employers\u2019 property and which connected employer\u2019s building to the public sidewalk was on the premises and was compensable).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Finally, we note that Pan Am paid Prince her normal hourly rate during her lunch periods as an incident of her contract of employment. However, because her injury occurred in an area which was in practical effect a part of Pan Am\u2019s premises and was compensable, we do not decide the issue which the commission also did not address\u2014whether Prince\u2019s injury necessarily was deemed to have occurred in the course of her employment because she was paid as an incident of her employment during lunch peri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ods. <em>See Kent v. Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co., </em>143 Va. at 66, 129 S.E. at 332; 1 A.
