He was sentenced in accordance with the jury\u2019s recommendations. His appeal raises for our consideration these issues: (1) whether the Commonwealth failed to disclose exculpatory evidence; (2) whether the Commonwealth should have disclosed evidence about (a) Jeffries\u2019 admissions to a fellow jail inmate, and (b) the inmate\u2019s prior criminal convictions; and (3) whether the cumulative effect of the alleged errors denied Jeffries due process and a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">Finding no reversible error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence showed the following: The victim, Beverly, was married to Jeffries at the time of the crimes and was divorced in July of 1985; however, they had been separated since July, 1979. Beverly, thereafter, made her home with her parents in Middleburg, Virginia. On April 6, 1985, around noon, she left her home for the fifteen-minute walk to a neighborhood grocery store. As she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>walking down the street Jeffries drove past her in a green Chevrolet. He pulled into a street she was about to cross, stopped the car and asked her to get in, stating that he wanted to talk to her. She refused and attempted to run across the street toward a house because she was terrified of him and wanted to get help. Jeffries then got out of the car, grabbed Beverly, forced her into the car, and told her to lie down on the front seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The record shows that he then drove a short distance up the street and stopped in front of some trees. At this point, Jeffries raped Beverly and forced her to commit oral sodomy. Thereafter, he drove out of town to a deserted area where he stopped the car, forced Beverly to submit to anal sex, assaulted her with a soda bottle and then raped her once again. Immediately thereafter, Michael Grimes, a friend of Jeffries appeared at the scene and with Jeffries\u2019 assistance, he also raped Beverly.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Jeffries then took Beverly back to Middleburg and let her out of the car with the warning that he would kill her if she told anyone what happened. However, Beverly promptly reported the crimes to Officer Regina Henry. At the time she made the report, she was sobbing hysterically, her clothes were in disarray, and she had blood dripping down the right side of her neck. She was taken to the hospital emergency room where she was examined by a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Jeffries was subsequently arrested and charged with the various offenses. After the indictments were returned, he filed a discovery motion. Although no court order relating to discovery appears in the record, the Commonwealth provided the defense a typed summary with the handwritten notes of Jeffries\u2019 April 15, 1985 interview with the police, as well as copies of two relevant laboratory reports. These reports revealed that a stain in the victim\u2019s panties and blue jeans was analyzed as blood secretion type A, PGM 2-1, PepA 1. The reports also showed that the victim and the defendant were both type O secretors, with blood type PGM 1, PepA 1. The reports also stated, in laboratory terms, that a \u201cmix\u201d of the secretion from a type A secretor with the secretion type of the victim or the defendant would give a combination secretion type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>identical to the secretion in the panties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 29, 1985, the day prior to trial, the Commonwealth advised the defendant that Michael Grimes had blood type O.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Prior to trial, the Commonwealth moved the court for an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the purpose of explaining the presence of semen on the victim\u2019s panties of a secretion type different from that of the victim or the defendant. The defense replied that it had been provided the laboratory reports pursuant to the pre-trial discovery and that it was aware of the test results. The record discloses discussions between the court and defense counsel regarding the purpose of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion; following these discussions, the court deferred ruling on the motion. The hearing requested by the Commonwealth was never held, but during the trial Beverly testified that on the evening of April 5, 1985, (the evening prior to the crime) she had engaged in consensual sexual intercourse with another male whom we will identify as Gordon. She further testified that she wore the same blue jeans on the day before and the day of the attack. Gordon was called as a prosecution witness and confirmed that he had engaged in consensual sex with Beverly on the evening of April 5, 1985. He also testified that his blood was type A.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>/.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Jeffries first contends that he was denied a fair trial by the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to provide the information regarding the victim\u2019s and Gordon\u2019s sexual activity. He argues that such information was exculpatory and would have enabled him to investigate the relationship and to better prepare for cross-examination of Gordon. The Commonwealth denies that it was required to provide the information and asserts that it was not exculpatory of Jeffries\u2019 participation in the crimes. The Commonwealth argues that the relationship between Beverly and Gordon merely explained the presence of type A semen on the clothes and, therefore, was indirectly inculpatory. The Commonwealth also argues that it attempted to provide the explanation by moving for the evidentiary hearing, but ruling on the motion for a hearing was deferred by the court with the implicit concurrence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">We recently examined the consequences of the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to furnish exculpatory evidence in <em>Walker </em>v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 286, 356 S.E.2d 853 (1987). In <em>Walker </em>the defendant specifically requested, and the court ordered the production of a co-defendant\u2019s conviction record, certain plea agreements, and other statements made by the co-defendant. In reversing the conviction, we held that there was a significant likelihood that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to disclose interfered with the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. We also noted that an automatic reversal is not required whenever \u201ca combing of the prosecutor\u2019s files after the trial has disclosed evidence possibly useful to the defense but not likely to have changed the verdict. ...\u201d 4 Va. App. at 301, 356 S.E. 2d at 861 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. Keogh, 391 F.2d 138, 148 (2d Cir. 1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">In <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to the accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment.\u201d In the recent decision of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667 (1985), the Court dealt with the standand of materiality to be applied in determining whether a conviction should be reversed because the prosecutor failed to disclose information that might have been helpful in conducting the cross-examination. The lower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>court held that the failure to provide the information required an automatic reversal. In reversing, and referring to <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 (1984), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">We find the <em>Strickland </em>formulation of the <em>Agurs </em>test for materiality sufficiently flexible to cover the \u201cno request,\u201d \u201cgeneral request,\u201d and \u201cspecific request\u201d cases of prosecutorial failure to disclose evidence favorable to the accused: The evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Assuming, without deciding, that Jeffries\u2019 discovery motion falls within the \u201cgeneral request\u201d concept of <em>Bagley, </em>and assuming further, without deciding, that such evidence was exculpatory, the question still remains whether the identity of Gordon, as the supplier of the type A semen, was material in the constitutional sense so as to require its production by the Commonwealth. Without question it would have enabled the defense to interview Gordon before trial and possibly strenghten the defense\u2019s cross-examination of Gordon. However, we find nothing in the record which furnishes a basis for concluding that there is a reasonable probability that, had Gordon\u2019s identity been revealed prior to trial, the result of the proceedings would have been different. We hold that the failure to furnish Gordon\u2019s identity did not interfere with Jeffries\u2019 right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">The defendant next contends that he was denied a fair trial because the Commonwealth failed to disclose the substance of a statement he allegedly gave to a fellow jail inmate, Francis Longerbeam. He argues that disclosure was required under Rule 3A:11 and the recent case of <em>Lomax </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 168, 319 S.E.2d 763 (1984). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Longerbeam was called as a prosecution witness and testified, without objection, that he had twice shared a cell with the defendant. He said that the defendant had related that he and his buddy were riding around drinking beer, had run across his wife, picked her up and had sex with her. Apart from the defendant\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>object to this testimony or to bring to the trial judge\u2019s attention his claim that the Commonwealth failed to provide proper discovery (<em>see </em>Rule 5A:18), his admission to Longerbeam was contrary to his defense or theory of the case, i.e., that he was not present at the time of the offense. Thus it was not exculpatory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We hold that Rule 3A:11 did not require disclosure of the defendant\u2019s statements to Longerbeam. This Rule provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that upon \u201cwritten motion of an accused\u201d the court shall order disclosure of oral statements by the accused \u201cto any law enforcement officer.\u201d Here, Jeffries\u2019 written motion included only a request for exculpatory statements. His statement to Longerbeam that he and a buddy had sex with his wife was not exculpatory and was not a statement made to a law enforcement officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Jeffries\u2019 reliance on <em>Lomax </em>is misplaced due to the factual differences involved. In <em>Lomax </em>the Commonwealth, pursuant to court-ordered discovery, had furnished a toxicology report to the defense on the morning of trial. It had not been included in other materials furnished two days prior to trial. After receipt of the report, the defendant moved for a continuance, claiming that he needed more time to consult with experts who could determine the effect of the quantity of Preludin shown by the report to have been in the victim\u2019s blood. The court denied the continuance, and the sole issue on appeal was whether the denial of the continuance motion amounted to an abuse of discretion. In a four to three decision the court found that it did, and reversed the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Here, there was no court-ordered discovery. The evidence sought was not exculpatory under defendant\u2019s theory of the case, and there was no request for a continuance after Longerbeam\u2019s testimony. We find that <em>Lomax </em>is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Jeffries also argues that he was denied a fair trial by the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to furnish him the criminal record of Longerbeam prior to trial. He also asserts that Longerbeam lied on the stand when he responded to questioning that he had only one prior conviction of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. The record contains no evidence that Longerbeam testified falsely. The point was raised in a motion to set aside the verdict of the jury and award a new trial. There apparently was a conflict between the Commonwealth\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s understanding of what the record showed. In a letter opinion denying the motion, the trial judge noted \u201cthe attorney for the Commonwealth stated that his record showed but one such felony as of the date of his testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In <em>Correll </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 454, 352 S.E.2d 352 (1987), the Supreme Court held that an undisclosed criminal conviction is \u201cevidence favorable to the accused\u201d within the <em>Brady </em>rule because the defense may use it for impeachment purposes. The nondisclosure of such evidence requires reversal, however, only if it is material within the meaning of that term as defined in <em>Bagley. </em>The <em>Correll </em>opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">Evidence is material in this sense \u201conly if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 465, 352 S.E.2d at 358 (quoting <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">In the present case, the record does not contain Longerbeam\u2019s criminal record. Therefore, we are unable to resolve whether Longerbeam did accurately disclose his record. We further find no support for concluding that, had Longerbeam\u2019s record been disclosed, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Of final concern is Jeffries\u2019 assertion that the cumulative effect of the alleged errors denied him due process and a fair trial. The only new error alleged in this aspect of the appeal is the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit cross-examination about alleged false rape complaints by the victim. The record does not support this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>allegation. The defense did ask the victim how many prior occasions she had accused persons of raping her. Upon objection, the court held a bench conference which was not recorded in the transcript. Thereafter, the defense proceeded with other areas of cross-examination. We cannot tell whether the court sustained the objection or whether the defense withdrew the question as a result of the bench conference. Furthermore, there was no proffer of evidence of any prior rape complaints. Even if we assume that the court sustained the objection to the question and that such ruling was error, we cannot consider the error on appeal without a proffer of what such evidence would have been. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 226, 229, 228 S.E.2d 124, 126 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Thus, we conlude that each of the alleged individual errors is without merit and that the allegation of cumulative error also is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Finding no reversible error, the convictions are</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Barrow, J., and Benton, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\"> \u201cType O, PGM 1, PepA I secretions mixed with secretions from a type A secretor, PGM 2-1, PepA 1 or a type A secretor, PGM2, PepA 1 will give a combination secretion type of A, PGM 2-1, PepA 1.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-7\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">A.

Longerbeam admitted that he was told that \u201cthey would put a recommendation to the Judge\u201d for time served on a failure to appear charge but denied that his testimony was in exchange for such recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b53-9\"><em> </em>Nor do we find the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Henry </em>v. <em>United States, </em>590 F.2d, 544 (1978), <em>aff'd, </em>447 U.S. 264 (1980) applicable to these facts. In <em>Henry, </em>the inmate witness was a paid informant, a \u201cGovernment agent expressly commissioned to secure evidence\u201d from the defendant. Here, there was no contact between the Commonwealth and Longerbeam, relevant to Jeffries, prior to Jeffries\u2019 statement to Longerbeam.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
