J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alz\">These certified appeals arise out of an action brought by the plaintiffs,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the owners of a certain property located in the town of Southington, against the defendant, the city of Bristol, challenging the statement of compensation filed by the defendant in connection with its taking by condemnation of certain interests in the plaintiffs\u2019 property. Before they brought this action, the plaintiffs had brought an action against the defendant in the United Stated District Court for the District of Connecticut (federal court) raising numerous statutory claims, common-law claims and a claim of inverse condemnation, all pertaining to the defendant\u2019s maintenance of a landfill abutting their property which, the plaintiffs alleged, had contaminated the groundwater under their property. The federal court found for the plaintiffs on most of their statutory and common-law claims but denied the plaintiffs\u2019 inverse condemnation claim. Subsequently, the trial court in the present case rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the valuation of the property interests taken by the defendant should be measured by comparing the value of the land in its uncontaminated state to the value of the land in its contaminated state on the ground that the federal court previously had decided that issue in favor of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>dant. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court, which concluded that although the plaintiffs had a right, in principle, to be compensated in this condemnation proceeding for the pretaking contamination of their property, the trial court properly had concluded that, under the circumstances of this case, the plaintiffs were barred by principles of collateral estoppel from making such a claim. <em>Albahary </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>84 Conn. App. 329, 337-41, 853 A.2d 577 (2004). We subsequently granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that in the measurement of the plaintiffs\u2019 just compensation, the plaintiffs had a right to be compensated for the totality of the damage caused to their property by the defendant\u2019s contamination of the plaintiffs\u2019 groundwater?\u201d <em>Albahary </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>271 Conn. 924, 859 A.2d 576 (2004). We also granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, precluded the plaintiffs from obtaining compensation from the defendant for damages arising out of the defendant\u2019s pretaking contamination of the plaintiffs\u2019 groundwater?\u201d <em>Albahary </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>271 Conn. 925, 859 A.2d 576 (2004). We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following facts and procedural history. \u201cThe plaintiffs are joint owners of 87.6 acres of unimproved property in Southington. The property, which is almost entirely in a residential zone, is taxed as open space land. Its northerly part, which abuts [a landfill operated by the defendant], consists of approximately forty-six acres that, since 1992, have been used for the mining of good quality sand and gravel. Its southerly part, approximately forty-two acres, consists of unimproved land.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u201cThe defendant\u2019s abutting landfill was operational from 1946 to 1997, when it was closed down by the state department of environmental protection (department) because of contaminating leachate generated at the site. The leachate polluted the groundwater on the plaintiffs\u2019 property so that it is not potable.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u201cOn October 24, 1995, the department and the defendant entered into a consent order in which the defendant conceded that \u2018[t]he operation of a solid waste disposal area at the [landfill resulted] in a discharge of water, substance or materials, including but not limited to leachate, into the waters of the State.\u2019 The consent order required the defendant to undertake certain investigations and studies with regard to the landfill and to propose plans in order to remediate the leachate contamination that the landfill had caused. The consent order did not require the defendant to clean up the contamination. Instead, it gave the defendant the option to acquire control over all of the polluted groundwater rights or interests therein that were located within a certain \u2018zone of influence\u2019 that included the property of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u201cIn 1996, the legislature enacted No. 96-12 of the 1996 Special Acts, to permit the defendant to acquire or to condemn property outside of its borders. This special act was intended to enable the defendant to comply with the consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u201cOn July 30, 1997, relying on the special act, the defendant began condemnation proceedings to take an easement over twenty-five acres of the plaintiffs\u2019 property. For a thirty-one year period, the easement permits the defendant to access the property to withdraw groundwater, to collect environmental data and to pump and treat groundwater so as to remediate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>existing contamination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant filed a certificate of taking with the clerk of the Superior Court and recorded the certificate in the Southington land records on September 17, 1997. In accordance with a statement of compensation, the defendant made a deposit of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u201cOn January 26, 1998, the plaintiffs filed an appeal in the trial court to challenge the adequacy of the proffered compensation award. They made two claims. Their first claim was that, as a matter of law, their damages should be measured by a valuation formula compensating them for the pollution of their groundwater both before and after the taking of their property rights through eminent domain. Their second claim was that, as a matter of fact, the valuation of their property should take into account possible future uses of their property for purposes other than its present use for mining. The defendant disputed both of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u201cThe trial court rendered a judgment deciding the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of law in favor of the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It agreed with the defendant that the damages suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the condemnation of their property were to be measured by comparing the value of their property at the time of the taking, in its polluted condition, with its value after the condemnation. It also agreed with the defendant that monetary compensation awarded to the plaintiffs for the easement that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>defendant has taken should be based on the likelihood that the plaintiffs would continue to use their property for mining.\u201d <em>Albahary </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 332-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u201cBefore the present state court condemnation proceedings had begun, the plaintiffs filed an action against the defendant in [federal court]. They sought damages and injunctive relief for the injury that they had suffered as a result of the landfill\u2019s contamination of the groundwater on their property prior to the condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u201cThe federal case was decided after the filing of the complaint in this present condemnation case. The federal court held that the plaintiffs had proven most of their statutory and common-law claims, but not their claim of inverse condemnation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to that claim, the court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 receipt of $2.65 million from their mineral extraction contracts demonstrated that the contamination caused by the defendant had not deprived the plaintiffs of the reasonable use of their property. The court denied the plaintiffs any damages even for the claims that they had proven because \u2018the legal remedy of money damages to compensate the current landowners for diminished value of their property is inadequate and highly speculative . . . .\u2019 Instead, the court ordered the defendant to provide the plaintiffs with an alternate potable water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>source and to indemnify the plaintiffs against claims of environmental liability that might be raised by third persons. No appeal was taken from this judgment.\u201d Id., 337-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In the present case, the trial court determined that the damages suffered by the plaintiffs from the condemnation of their property were to be measured by comparing the value of their property at the time of the taking, in its polluted condition, with its value after the condemnation. The trial court stated, in support of its conclusion, that \u201c[t]he record before this court demonstrates that the plaintiffs [in their federal court action] have sought and obtained damages for the [past] contamination to their property caused by the city\u2019s landfill. They are therefore barred from litigating the same issues in this proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court claiming, inter alia, that the trial court \u201cimproperly [had] confined its analysis of the damages they had suffered to a comparison between the value of their property in its polluted condition and its value after the taking of the easement.\u201d <em>Albahary </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 334. The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the valuation in the present case was governed by this court\u2019s holding in <em>Northeast Ct. Economic Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>ATC Partnership, </em>256 Conn. 813, 832-34, 776 A.2d 1068 (2001) <em>(ATC), </em>that the market value of a condemned property must be determined on the basis of the condition of the property on the date of the taking. <em>Albahary </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>supra, 336. The Appellate Court reasoned that \u201c[extension of the valuation formula of <em>ATC </em>to a case such as this one [in which the condemnor itself has caused the contamination] would be difficult to reconcile with the law of inverse condemnation.\u201d Id. The court concluded that, as a general matter, the amount of compensation for a taking is not \u201calways limited to a comparison between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>value of the property at the time of the taking and its value after the taking\u201d; id., 335; but that \u201ca condemnation award may . . . take account of pretaking contamination caused by the condemnor.\u201d Id., 337. The court also concluded, however, that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs\u2019 inverse condemnation claim [related to pretaking contamination of their property] indisputably was \u2018actually litigated and necessarily determined\u2019 by the federal court\u201d; id., 339; and, therefore, was barred by principles of collateral estoppel. Id., 339-41. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Because our resolution of the issue raised in the defendant\u2019s appeal guides our resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, we first address that issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that, in determining the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 just compensation, the plaintiffs had a right, in principle, to be compensated for the totality of the damage caused to their property by the defendant\u2019s contamination of the plaintiffs\u2019 groundwater. In support of this claim, the defendant cites our decision in <em>ATC </em>and a number of other cases for the proposition that personal liability for damages incurred before the taking cannot be liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>gated in a condemnation proceeding, but must be litigated in an independent suit for damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs counter that <em>ATC </em>is inapplicable here because it did not involve damages caused by the condemnor. They further argue that, because the defendant, by depositing contaminants on their property, physically took possession of it before filing its notice of condemnation, the property should be valued as of the date that the defendant took possession. See <em>Slavitt </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>163 Conn. 198, 207, 303 A.2d 13 (1972);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Carl Roessler, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>156 Conn. 131, 143, 239 A.2d 538 (1968).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In turn, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>defendant responds that the plaintiffs waived this claim, which implicitly relies on principles of inverse condemnation, by not raising it before the trial court or the Appellate Court. We conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that, generally, under principles of inverse condemnation, a property owner may seek compensation in an eminent domain proceeding for pretaking damages caused by the condemnor.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">At the outset, we set forth the standard of review. Whether a claim for compensation for the pretaking contamination of a property by the condemning entity may be raised in an eminent domain proceeding is a question of law over which our review is plenary. See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>275 Conn. 580, 607, 881 A.2d 978 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In order to address the substance of the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal, it is necessary first to clarify the nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 underlying claim. The defendant\u2019s principal argument is premised on its characterization of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for damages for the pretaking contamination of their property as an action for in personam liability. The plaintiffs argue in their brief on their appeal that their claim is an action for just compensation for the taking of their property under well settled eminent domain principles. In their brief on the defendant\u2019s appeal, however, the plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to compensation based on the value of the property in its uncontaminated condition because \u201cthe taking occurred when the defendant began its physical occupation of the easement area\u201d and \u201cthe defendant physically took possession of the \u2018property\u2019 it later condemned by depositing chemical contaminants in the easement area before filing its notice of condemnation.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that, as the Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>suggested, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim implicates principles of inverse condemnation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Albahary </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 336 (concluding that denial of right to compensation for pretaking damage would be inconsistent with law of inverse condemnation).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Although this court previously has not had occasion to consider the specific issue in this case\u2014whether <em>prelaking </em>property damages caused by a condemnor are recoverable in a condemnation proceeding\u2014we have considered a related issue. In <em>Plunske </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>171 Conn. 280, 282, 370 A.2d 920 (1976), the defendant, the commissioner of transportation, condemned a portion of the plaintiff landowner\u2019s property in order to improve a road. The defendant also took \u201cfrom the plaintiffs remaining land . . . rights to grade, the right to construct a driveway, and a drainage easement.\u201d Id. The defendant assessed the damages for the taking at $2400 and the plaintiff appealed to the trial court. Id. During the pendency of the appeal, the plaintiffs remaining property was damaged by acts of the defendant\u2019s contractor. Id. The trial court\u2019s award to the plaintiff included the costs of repairing those damages. Id., 283. The defendant appealed to this court claiming that such damages were not recoverable in a condemnation proceeding. Id. We concluded that, in determining damages in a condemnation action, \u201c[t]he court should consider any and all damages which will foreseeably follow from the proper construction of the project, <em>including any damage to the remainder which is a necessary, natural and proximate result of the taking. . . . </em>The use to be made of the land taken is to be considered with regard to its effect on the remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>land, and the fact that injuries are caused by the construction activities of the contractor is not a bar to recovery so long as the damages foreseeably follow such construction activities and are a necessary, natural and proximate result of the taking. . . . Expenses required to cure injuries caused to the remaining land are not recoverable as such, but are merely evidence of elements in the decrease in market value, of which they may be an accurate measure.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 284. Damages caused by the <em>negligence </em>of the condemnor\u2019s contractor, however, ordinarily are not recoverable in a condemnation proceeding, but must be sought in an independent action. Id. Because the trial court in <em>Plunske </em>had not made any findings as to whether the damages were a \u201cnecessary, natural and proximate result of the taking\u201d; id.; or, instead, were caused by the contractor\u2019s negligence, we remanded the case for a new trial. Id., 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Thus, in <em>Plunske, </em>this court concluded that a plaintiff can receive just compensation in a condemnation proceeding for damage to land that has not been formally taken if the damage is the necessary, natural and proximate result of a taking for a public use. Id., 284-85. In other words, we effectively concluded that, if damage to the untaken land is the necessary, natural and proximate result of a public use, then the land, or at least certain interests in it, have been taken by inverse condemnation and the plaintiff is therefore entitled to just compensation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the damages are caused by the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>demnor\u2019s negligence, however, then the plaintiff is relegated to an action sounding in tort. Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>agree with the Appellate Court that, if the damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 property was the necessary, natural and proximate result of a public use, and the claim for compensation was not otherwise barred, the trial court could consider the pretaking contamination in determining the amount of the compensation award. See <em>Albahary </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The defendant argues, however, that \u201cthe legal principles [precluding the litigation of personal liability issues in condemnation proceedings] that drove the outcome of <em>ATC </em>apply with equal force in inverse condemnation actions.\u201d In support of this argument, the defendant relies on <em>Shealy </em>v. <em>Athens-Clarke, </em>244 Ga. App. 853, 537 S.E.2d 105 (2000). In that case, the plaintiffs brought a claim for inverse condemnation alleging that their property had been contaminated by hazardous substances that had escaped from a landfill operated by the defendant. Id. Before the plaintiffs initiated the action, the defendant had initiated two separate condemnation proceedings relating to the property. Id. After the inverse condemnation action was brought, awards were entered in the two condemnation actions. Id., 854. The court in the inverse condemnation action then granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the action as moot in light of the condemnation awards. On appeal, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court reasoning that \u201c[l]osses occurring prior to the date of taking are not compensable in a condemnation proceeding. In particular, losses resulting from a previous taking, even by the same condemnor, are not recoverable in a condemnation proceeding, since [s]uch damages are not a consequence of the instant taking. Such damages must be recovered in an independent suit for damages, and may not be raised in the current condemnation proceeding.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 855. Because pretaking damages could not be recovered in the condemnation proceeding, the court concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to seek them in the inverse condemnation proceeding. Id., 856; see also <em>Flo-Rob, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colonial Pipeline Co., </em>170 Ga. App. 650, 651-52, 317 S.E.2d 885 (1984) (claim for damages for pretaking con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tamination could not be raised as counterclaim in condemnation proceedings because such damages were not consequence of taking; claim had to be made in independent suit for damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">We do not agree with the court in <em>Shealy </em>that an inverse condemnation claim relating to a formally taken property cannot be raised in an ongoing condemnation proceeding. Requiring separate proceedings would be both unnecessarily duplicative and inconsistent with our case law. See <em>Plunske </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 284-85 (claim for damages to formally untaken property may be made in condemnation action); <em>Slavitt </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 163 Conn. 207 (in condemnation action, plaintiff is entitled to compensation based on value of property on date government entered into possession); <em>Carl Roessler, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 156 Conn. 143 (same); <em>Claud-Chambers </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>79 Conn. App. 475, 478-79, 830 A.2d 385 (plaintiffs precluded from bringing separate action for inverse condemnation after conclusion of eminent domain proceeding where plaintiff failed to challenge or appeal from compensation received), cert. denied, 266 Conn. 924, 855 A.2d 472 (2003). Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The defendant also argues that allowing the plaintiffs to recover property damages in a condemnation proceeding would expand improperly the scope of the proceeding as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 8-132.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In support of this argument, the defendant cites our statement in <em>Research Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>New Haven Rede</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>velopment Agency, </em>152 Conn. 137, 140, 204 A.2d 833 (1964), that the \u201cstate referee has authority [under \u00a7 8-132] to determine the value only at the date of taking, and this date ... is fixed by [General Statutes] \u00a7 8-129<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as the date of the recording of the certificate [of taking].\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We also stated in <em>Research Associates, Inc., </em>however, that the date of the taking was fixed by \u00a7 8-129 only \u201cin the absence of special equitable considerations\u201d; id.; and that the condemnee was entitled to claim another date as the \u201ctrue date of the taking . . . prior to entry of the order referring to a referee, for review, the defendant\u2019s assessment of damages.\u201d Id., 140-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Implicitly recognizing this exception to \u00a7 8-129, the defendant in the present case next argues that the plaintiffs are barred from claiming a different date of taking before this court, thereby implicitly raising a claim of inverse condemnation, because they never made such a claim before the trial court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree that the plaintiffs are barred from bringing this claim, but for a different reason. Specifically, we conclude that the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Court properly determined that the claim for diminution in property value in the present case, which implicates principles of inverse condemnation, was barred by principles of collateral estoppel because the federal court concluded that the contamination of the plaintiffs\u2019 property was a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence and granted relief designed to restore the plaintiffs to the position that they would have been in had the contamination never occurred. See <em>Albahary </em>v. Bristol, supra, 84 Conn. App. 337-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u201c[C]ollaterai estoppel, or issue preclusion, is that aspect of res judicata that prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was actually litigated and necessarily determined in a prior action between the same parties or those in privity with them upon a different claim. ... An issue is <em>actually litigated </em>if it is properly raised in the pleadings or otherwise, submitted for determination, and in fact determined.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Efthimiou </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>268 Conn. 499, 506-507, 846 A.2d 222 (2004). Whether the Appellate Court properly applied the principles of collateral estoppel in the present case is a question of law over which our review is plenary. See <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>271 Conn. 679, 688, 859 A.2d 533 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In the federal case, the court concluded that the \u201cplaintiffs have proven that the [defendant] was negligent in its operation of the [l]andfill and that its negligence caused [the] plaintiffs\u2019 property damage.\u201d The court also determined that \u201cthe legal remedy of money damages to compensate [the plaintiffs] for [the] diminished value of their property [was] inadequate and highly speculative,\u201d and that the plaintiffs\u2019 injury was \u201c \u2018otherwise irremediable.\u2019 \u201d Accordingly, \u201cin order to put [the] plaintiffs in the same position they would have been in had the leachate contamination emanating from the [l]andfill not been permitted to pollute the ground<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>water beneath the . . . [pjroperty and render it unusable,\u201d the court ordered injunctive relief, including an order that the defendant provide the plaintiffs with a potable water source for the property and file on the land record documentation that the defendant will indemnify, hold harmless and defend the plaintiffs and subsequent owners against any claims of environmental liability. The court stated that \u201c[t]his injunctive relief . . . restores to the affected property that which it lost, removes, in part, the stigma of known contamination as it affects financing and willingness of lending institutions to finance a sale of the property, and protects future landowners from strict liability for leachate plume migration, for which they bear no responsibility.\u201d Finally, the court held that \u201cno monetary damages for [the] defendant\u2019s negligent operation of the [l]andfill . . . are warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In the present case, the plaintiffs again seek to recover monetary damages for the diminution in their property value as a result of contamination from the defendant\u2019s operation of the landfill. As we have indicated, in order to bring this claim within the context of a condemnation proceeding, the plaintiffs must establish that the damage to their property was the necessary, natural and proximate result of the operation of the landfill, and not the result of the defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Plunske </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 284; cf. <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Queensbury, </em>157 App. Div. 2d 891, 893, 550 N.Y.S.2d 161 (1990) (\u201c[defendant's entry upon plaintiffs property was <em>either </em>a trespass <em>or </em>a de facto appropriation\u201d [emphasis added]). The federal court already has concluded, however, that the contamination was the result of the defendant\u2019s negligence and has ordered a remedy to compensate the plaintiffs fully for the property damage. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was actually litigated and necessarily determined in the federal court and is, therefore, barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>by principles of collateral estoppel. Cf. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Syracuse, </em>79 App. Div. 2d 874, 875, 434 N.Y.S.2d 547 (1980) (\u201c[s]ince respondent\u2019s present [trespass] claim arises out of the same series of events as his [previously adjudicated] <em>defacto </em>condemnation claim, the present claim is barred by <em>res judicata\u201d </em>[emphasis in original]).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To compensate the plaintiffs in the present action for the diminution in their property value in order to place them in the same position that they would have been in if the contamination never had occurred would result in a double recovery for the plaintiffs. They would receive <em>both </em>a permanent source of potable drinking water and permanent indemnification of any future environmental claims against them <em>and </em>compensation on the basis of the value of the land in its uncontaminated condition.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The plaintiffs claim, however, that the federal court did not hold that the plaintiffs were not entitled to monetary compensation for the diminution in the value of their property. In support of this claim, they point out that the court explicitly stated in its memorandum of decision that \u201cthe injunctive remedy ordered is in addition to the monies ordered to be paid in the state law condemnation action, which are intended to pay for the acquisition of rights to the groundwater beneath [the] plaintiffs\u2019 property. It is the intention of the [c]ourt that those funds <em>not </em>be used to offset the costs of providing water to the . . . [property. The form of injunctive relief ordered permits the state court condemnation and challenge to proceed without interference, direct or indirect, by the federal court, thus satisfying this [c]ourt\u2019s comity concerns.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The court concluded that \u201cno monetary damages for [the] defendant\u2019s negligent operation of the [l]andfill, beyond the injunctive relief ordered <em>and the compensation for the groundwater taking, </em>are warranted.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We are not persuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. First, the certificate of taking filed by the defendant affected property interests not at issue in the federal case. It allowed the defendant, for the duration of thirty-one years, to enter onto the plaintiffs\u2019 property for the purpose of withdrawing groundwater, to transport machinery and materials over the plaintiffs\u2019 land for the purpose of monitoring and treating the groundwater, to pump and treat groundwater, and to perform related activities. We interpret the federal court\u2019s statements to mean that, because the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 property as a result of the taking of these interests was not at issue in the federal case, its decision should not affect the state action. Second, the federal court did not conclude that the plaintiffs were not entitled to monetary damages for diminution in property value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>because they would receive such compensation in the present case. Rather, it declined to award such damages because it believed that they would be \u201cinadequate and highly speculative, in light of many variables such as likelihood of zoning changes for [the] plaintiffs\u2019 property, permissible forms of access through its protected wetlands, availability of remaining sand and gravel resources on site, and real estate market interest\u201d and because the court could restore the plaintiffs to the position that they would have been in if the contamination had not occurred by granting injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The plaintiffs also argue that the issue litigated in the federal court was not the same as the issue raised in the present case because the inverse condemnation claim in the federal court case involved the value of the property as a whole, while the present action involves the value of limited interests in the property.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We have not concluded, however, that the claim in the present case is duplicative of the inverse condemnation claim in the federal case. Rather, we have concluded that it is duplicative of the <em>negligence </em>claim in that case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Finally, the plaintiffs argue that the Appellate Court, in determining that they were not entitled to recover the diminution in their property value, improperly ignored the fact that the defendant\u2019s easement allows it to continue contaminating the property. Specifically, they argue that, because the easement deprived them of their right under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-452<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to remediate the property at the defendant\u2019s expense, and because the easement allows the defendant to continue the contamination, \u201cclean groundwater will be legally unavailable to the plaintiffs for [thirty-one] years <em>more </em>than it would have been if the easement had not been taken; and, consequently . . . the value of the easement must be measured by comparing clean land to polluted land.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">We are not persuaded. In support of their claim, the plaintiffs argue that \u201cwhatever \u2018damages\u2019 the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>might have recovered for the pollution existing prior to the date of the taking would not have prevented them, <em>after </em>the date of the taking, from cleaning up the groundwater at [the] defendant\u2019s expense . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Thus, the plaintiffs implicitly argue that the relief ordered by the federal court was intended to compensate them <em>only </em>for the <em>pretaking </em>contamination.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As we have indicated, however, the federal court granted <em>a permanent </em>injunction designed to \u201cput [the] plaintiffs in the same position they would have been in had the leachate contamination emanating from the [l]andfill not been permitted to pollute the groundwater beneath the . . . [property . . . .\u201d Regardless of when the contamination occurred, the harm that it caused was depriving the plaintiffs of a source of potable water on the property and exposing them to environmental claims by third parties. The relief ordered by the federal court fully compensated the plaintiffs for these injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">This becomes clear if we hypothesize a situation in which the pretaking contamination was caused by a third party and was of a more ephemeral nature, such as the discharge of pollutants into a stream running through the plaintiffs\u2019 property. If a court entered a <em>permanent </em>injunction requiring the third party to provide a source of potable water and to indemnify the plaintiffs from environmental claims in order to place the plaintiffs in the same position that they would have been in if the stream had never been polluted, the plaintiffs would not be entitled to additional compensation from a successor polluter on the ground that the stream would have been clean in the absence of the continuing pollution. Rather, the third party would be entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>claim that the permanent injunction against it should be lifted because the successor polluter should now be held responsible for the pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">This court\u2019s decisions in <em>Avery </em>v. <em>White, </em>83 Conn. 311, 76 A. 360 (1910), and <em>Platt Bros. &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>80 Conn. 179, 67 A. 508 (1907), are not to the contrary. Those cases involved claims of ongoing wrongful conduct in which the plaintiffs were found to be entitled to money damages even though they previously had received damages for injuries arising from the same conduct. In both cases, this court concluded that the claims were not barred because the previous damage award had been intended to compensate the plaintiffs for injuries that were not at issue in the case under review. See <em>Avery </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 313 (trial court properly rejected collateral estoppel defense when prior action involved claim for damages for trees cut during one period and present action involved claim for different trees cut during subsequent period); <em>Platt Bros. &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 182 (\u201c[a] judgment for all damage . . . caused [by continuing nuisance] must cover all damage from the unlawful acts done prior to the commencement of the action in which it is rendered; but additional damage caused by like subsequent unlawful acts may be recovered in another action\u201d). In the present case, however, the federal court treated the contamination, both pretaking and posttaking, as a single permanent injury and entered an award that was intended to compensate the plaintiffs fully for it. Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\"> The plaintiffs are Mary L.

It held, however, that the plaintiffs had not proven their claim of inverse condemnation and strict liability.

It could be argued that the issue that we addressed in <em>Plunske </em>was how to determine the scope of a formal taking, rather than how to determine whether land was taken by inverse condemnation, and that <em>Plunske </em>is inapplicable when the scope of a formal taking is not at issue. We can perceive no reason, however, to read <em>Plunske </em>so narrowly. If the scope of a formal taking is subsequently expanded by the operations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>of the condemnor, it only can be by way of inverse condemnation. Accordingly, the standard applied to determine whether the scope has been expanded is equally applicable to claims of inverse condemnation when there has been no prior taking.</p>\n<p id=\"A5e\">Numerous courts have confronted the problem of how to characterize a claim for damage to property caused by a government entity when there has been no formal taking of the damaged property. They generally have agreed that such actions fall into two categories: actions for inverse condemnation and common-law actions for damages.

In effect, <em>de facto </em>appropriation may be characterized as an aggravated form of trespass. . . .

More recently, a New York court has held that, in a case wherein the plaintiff claimed damage to her property as a result of the government\u2019s conduct, \u201c[i]n order for a court to grant an order of inverse condemnation it is necessary to show that the use sought is a public use, that there is a public necessity therefor, and that the taking is under a color of right.\u201d <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>supra, 175 Misc. 2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"A2m\">Other courts have held that \u201c[a] tort action may lie in the proper forum for . . . an incidental or consequential injury, but not a suit for just compensation.

The federal court recognized that, under the federal constitution, \u201cproperty rights are severable, that is, an unconstitutional taking may occur where one property right in the . . . bundle of property rights is infringed.\u2019\u2019 It concluded that the \u201cplaintiffs have not proved that they have been deprived of the reasonable use of their land where the evidence shows that drinking water could be brought to the property . . . .\u201d Read together, these statements reasonably may be interpreted as meaning that the plaintiffs had not proved that their interest in uncontaminated water had been taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> We recognize that the Appellate Court concluded that \u201cthe plaintiffs are precluded from relitigating the federal court\u2019s denial of their <em>inverse condemnation </em>claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Albahary </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 338-39. In the Appellate Court\u2019s view, the federal court rejected this claim because it concluded that \u201cthe plaintiffs did not suffer any economic loss because of the pretaking pollution of the groundwater on their property.\u201d Id., 341. The <em>reason </em>that the plaintiffs suffered no such loss, however, was that the federal court granted full relief to the plaintiffs in connection with their other claims. Id. The federal court explicitly stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>that the plaintiffs had not been deprived of the use of their land because \u201cthe evidence shows that drinking water could be brought to the property ...\u201d Thus, even if we were to agree with the Appellate Court that the federal court addressed the limited taking claim raised by the plaintiffs in the present case as an aspect of their inverse condemnation claim; see footnote 17 of this opinion; we would conclude that the federal court denied the claim on the ground that it was able to grant full relief under the other claims. The inverse condemnation claim in the present case should be denied for the same reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-452 (a) provides: \u201cAny person, firm, corporation or municipality which contains or removes or otherwise mitigates the effects of oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products or hazardous wastes resulting from any discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration of such substance or material or waste shall be entitled to reimbursement from any person, firm or corporation for the reasonable costs expended for such containment, removal, or mitigation, if such oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products or hazardous wastes pollution or contamination or other emergency resulted from the negligence or other actions of such person, firm or corporation.
