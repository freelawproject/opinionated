We conclude that a trial court has continuing jurisdiction in such circumstances. Because the Appellate Court reached a contrary conclusion; see <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>77 Conn. App. 690, 723-24, 825 A.2d 153 (2003); we reverse its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">This case presents a unique, and somewhat convoluted, procedural history, beginning with the filing, in the mid-1990s, of twenty-three lawsuits alleging sexual abuse of minors by clergymen employed by the Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corporation (Diocese).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the course of pretrial discovery in those cases, all of which were pending in the Waterbury judicial district, the trial court, <em>Levin, J., </em>issued sealing and protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>orders<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with respect to certain documents and information that had been obtained by counsel. During the course of the litigation of those cases, and in accordance with those orders, the parties filed with the court numerous sealed documents for review by the court in connection with its adjudication of various motions. On March 12, 2001, prior to trial, all of the lawsuits were settled and withdrawn, with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">On March 26, 2002, The New York Times Company (Times), publisher of The New York Times, filed an \u201cemergency motion\u201d with the clerk\u2019s office of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Waterbury seeking permission to intervene in three of those twenty-three withdrawn actions, namely, <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. CV-93-0157085-S, <em>See </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. CV-93-0157363-S, and <em>Fleetwood </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. CV-95-0156274-S. The Times also sought in its motion an \u201corder vacating orders previously entered in [those] cases sealing judicial documents, including evidentiary materials submitted in connection with summary judgment motions and other matters ruled upon by the court . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The motion stated that the Times also was \u201cseeking leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>file a consolidated omnibus motion requesting identical relief in the . . . twenty other sex abuse cases to which the [Diocese] is a party.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Among the protective orders that the Times sought to have vacated were those that had been issued in the <em>Rosado </em>case on December 8,1994, and in the <em>Fleetwood </em>case on October 23, 1997. Those protective orders, which were identical, provided, inter alia, that information and materials obtained by the parties through the depositions of the defendants<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and certain other persons were not to be disclosed or disseminated to non-parties \u201c[u]ntil further order of the court, which order shall be made not later than the completion of jury selection . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The orders further provided that any document filed with the court containing information covered by those orders was to be filed under seal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>The trial court, <em>McWeeny, </em>J.,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> scheduled a hearing on the Times\u2019 motion for April 24, 2002. Prior to that hearing, however, on April 18, 2002, the Times filed an application with the Superior Court in the judicial district of Waterbury providing, inter alia, that, \u201c[pursuant to the request of the office of the clerk of court for the judicial district of Waterbury . . . [the Times] respectfully applies to the court to open a separate case file for the maintenance of court filings related to the Times\u2019 motion dated March 26, 2002 . . . previously filed in [the <em>Rosado, See </em>and <em>Fleetwood </em>cases] . . . .\u201d The Times explained that it was requesting the court to open a new file in light of the Times\u2019 understanding that the \u201ccourt intends that future filings related to the [Times\u2019 March 26, 2002] motion, or to similar matters in the [twenty-three withdrawn cases], be directed to this newly created case file to facilitate the court\u2019s administrative handling of these matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>On April 22, 2002, The Hartford Courant Company (Courant), publisher of The Hartford Courant, filed a motion to intervene in the <em>Rosado, See </em>and <em>Fleetwood </em>cases. The motion indicated that the Courant sought to join the Times\u2019 motion for the purpose of raising the same claims that the Times had raised in its March 26, 2002 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">On April 23, 2002, the Diocese filed objections to the Times\u2019 March 26, 2002 motion and to the Times\u2019 April 18, 2002 application to open a new file. In its objection to the Times\u2019 motion, the Diocese stated that it also was objecting \u201con behalf of all individual defendants\u201d for whom two specified law firms had appeared in the twenty-three lawsuits including the <em>Rosado, Fleetwood </em>and <em>See </em>cases. With regard to the Times\u2019 motion, the Diocese maintained, inter alia, that the court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the Times\u2019 claim that the protective orders should be vacated because the Times had not filed the motion within the four month limitation period enumerated in \u00a7 52-212a.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> With respect to the Times\u2019 application to open a new case file, the Diocese asserted that: \u201c(1) the court no longer has jurisdiction over [the withdrawn] actions . . . and thus cannot undertake any further proceedings in them; (2) the Times has not been and should not be granted intervenor status in [the withdrawn] actions . . . and thus is not entitled to any substantive or procedural relief of any sort; and (3) granting the Times\u2019 application could arguably impair the Diocese\u2019s rights to object to the Times\u2019 motion based [on] the issues of jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>and intervention.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In summarizing its objection to the Times\u2019 application, the Diocese asserted that the court \u201cshould not take a case that was withdrawn long ago, breathe new life into it, and convert it into a separate, new case that might appear to eliminate jurisdictional barriers and hurdles to intervention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">On April 24, 2002, the trial court held a hearing to address both the Times\u2019 March 26, 2002 motion and its application to open a new file. At the outset of the hearing, the court announced that, because the twenty-three cases had been withdrawn more than one year earlier, it would docket both the motion and the application in a new file. The court assured the parties, however, that, in opening the new file, it was \u201cnot deciding the jurisdictional claims of the [Diocese] . . . .\u201d The court thereupon requested the parties to address the jurisdictional issue. Counsel for the Diocese, however, indicated that he first wished to address the court\u2019s decision to open the new file. Counsel then urged the court to reconsider that decision, asserting that, despite the court\u2019s assurances to the contrary, any action that the court might take in that matter necessarily would affect the withdrawn cases, thereby constituting \u201can end ran around the jurisdictional issue on part of the applicant . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court responded that \u201cthese applications need to be addressed in open court, and the means of doing that, the most expeditious way, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>to open a new file . . . .\u201d After reiterating that the opening of a new file was \u201cnot a resolution of the jurisdictional issue,\u201d the court stated, \u201cwe\u2019re going to address [the jurisdictional issue] now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The court then proceeded to hear the parties on the issue of jurisdiction. The Diocese asserted that, because the Times had failed to file a motion to open or to restore the withdrawn cases to the docket within the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a, the Times\u2019 claims were foreclosed by that statutory provision. In response, the Times argued that \u00a7 52-212a was not a bar to the relief sought because the court had continuing jurisdiction over the cases by virtue of its inherent authority to modify and to enforce court orders that are injunctive in nature and that previously had been issued in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">At the conclusion of the argument on the issue of jurisdiction, the court stated: \u201cWe\u2019ll continue with [a] discussion on the merits. I believe [this court has] jurisdiction, certainly with respect to what is in the clerk\u2019s office in sealed envelopes. ... So we will move on to the merits. \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Counsel for the Diocese then asked: \u201cWhat Your Honor just said is not a ruling, it\u2019s going to be subject to further briefing . . . ?\u201d The court responded: \u201cYes, it will be subject to further briefing. Yes, you can address the jurisdictional issue, but my determination is that [this court does] have jurisdiction, at least with respect to what\u2019s been sealed in the files.\u201d Counsel for the Diocese inquired: \u201cYour Honor is ruling on that point today?\u201d The court responded: \u201cYes, subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>being revisited, but we are going to proceed with a discussion of the merits of the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">An extended discussion of the merits of the claims ensued.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the hearing, the court requested that the parties brief several issues, including the principle of continuing jurisdiction and whether there existed other, independent grounds for the court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction over the files in the court\u2019s possession. The court directed the parties to submit briefs by May 6, 2002, with reply briefs, if any, to be filed no later than May 9, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The following additional relevant facts and procedural history are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court and the record of the trial court. \u201cOn May 3, 2002, the Washington Post Company (Post), publisher of [T]he Washington Post, and the Globe Newspaper Company (Globe), publisher of [T]he Boston Globe,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> filed motions to intervene that were substantially similar in content to the motion of the Courant. That same day, the Diocese filed three separate appeals from the trial court\u2019s [rulings] at the April [24], 2002 hearing. The defendants-appellants in each of those appeals [were] the Diocese; the Reverend Monsignor Thomas J. Driscoll, as the executor of the estate of the late Bishop Walter Curtis; the Reverend Monsignor Andrew T. Cusack; Bishop Edward M. Egan; the Reverend Monsignor Laurence R. Bronkiewicz; and any of the other defendants for whom two specified law firms representing the Diocese had an appearance on file. On May 6, 2002, a fourth appeal was filed by the first five of seven nonparty priests (John Doe priests) who had been per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>mitted by the Appellate Court to intervene as of right in the <em>Rosado </em>case two years earlier. See <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>60 Conn. App. 134, 758 A.2d 916 (2000). The John Doe priests had requested permission to intervene for the purpose of filing motions to quash, for a protective order and for otherwise preventing disclosure of private, confidential information from their respective personnel files.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Id., 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u201cEach of the four appeals was taken from the trial court\u2019s [April 24, 2002] order restoring cases to [the] docket, after passage of more than four months since withdrawal. The third and fourth appeals also were taken from the court\u2019s decision to create a new file.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u201cThereafter, the Diocese notified the court that it would not submit the requested brief in light of the automatic stay triggered by the filing of the four appeals. Nevertheless, on May 8, 2002, the court issued a memorandum of decision . . . addressing a broad range of procedural and substantive issues raised at the . . . hearing [on April 24, 2002], On [May 8, 2002], the court also made rulings as to the sealed and protected materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u201cIn its memorandum of decision, the court initially stated that the Times had not requested adjudication of its motion to intervene on April 10, 2002; therefore, the subject memorandum would not decide that motion . . . but instead would address [inter alia] the Times\u2019 request to vacate . . . [the] protective orders . . . .\u201d <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 700-702. The trial court further stated that, because the twenty-three cases involving the Diocese had been withdrawn more than one year before the Times filed its March 26, 2002 motion, the clerk\u2019s office was unable to docket the Times\u2019 motion due to the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a. The court also noted that, although the files in those cases were subject to destruction on March 12, 2002,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the clerk\u2019s office had not destroyed them as of March 26, 2002, the date of the Times\u2019 motion. Consequently, those files, including the sealed materials relating to them, remained in the custody and control of the Waterbury Superior Court and its clerk\u2019s office. Finally, the court explained that, after discussing the matter with the clerk\u2019s office and the presiding civil judge of the judicial district of Waterbury, it had determined that \u201copening a new file would serve as the most efficient tool for resolving the issues raised by the Times\u2019 [motion].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">With respect to the automatic stay provision of Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (a),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the trial court stated that that provision did not affect its \u201cjurisdiction and obligation to resolve the issues presented by the Times\u2019 applicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ion.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In support of its conclusion, the trial court explained \u201cthat it had not rendered judgment on the application at the April [24], 2002 hearing and that any characterization of its actions as restoring cases to the docket was \u2018completely erroneous.\u2019 The court [also] explained that it had indicated during the hearing that it did not have jurisdiction over the parties, [that] it was not entering rulings in the twenty-three withdrawn cases and [that] none of the files in the twenty-three cases had been opened, despite the fact that the clerk had entered appearances, sua sponte, in the new case file, created at the court\u2019s direction, for all of the firms that had represented the parties in the twenty-three withdrawn cases.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u201cThe [trial] court concluded that Practice Book \u00a7 17-4<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and ... \u00a7 52-212a, which deprive the court of jurisdiction after the passage of four months from the filing of a judgment or withdrawal, were intended to address the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over the parties. The court added that several authorities, including General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 51-52 (b)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> . . . and Practice Book \u00a7 7-7,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u2018all state the obvious, [namely] that the court has custody and control of its own files.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 703-704. The trial court further stated that, \u201c[i]n the absence of the court asserting jurisdiction over its own files, how are the public and the parties to resolve disputes relating to files remaining in the custody of the court for at least eight months after the expiration of the four month period to reopen? If not resolved through the judicial process, then resolution of such disputes would result at the discretion of the clerk\u2019s office or by physical altercation. The court finds that it is essential to the exercise of its inherent powers that the court retain jurisdiction over files that are in its custody.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u201cThe [trial] court described the Diocese\u2019s \u2018purported \u201cappeal\u201d of a decision never entered by [that] court\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>as part of its continuing effort to frustrate the court\u2019s adjudication of a matter of public interest. Although acknowledging that withdrawal of the cases had precluded resolution of the . . . claims [raised by the various plaintiffs in those cases], the court asserted that \u2018the judicial system should not be a party to a coverup by denying access\u2019 to information concerning a matter of such widespread public interest. The [trial] court warned against any \u2018facilitation of the cover-up by the courts\u2019 and noted the \u2018public\u2019s right to review the workings of government, including its judicial system, is widely acknowledged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u201cThe court stated that it was ready to perform its \u2018duty\u2019 to adjudicate the Times\u2019 application,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the very application that the court had invited, and ordered the disclosure of any nonprivileged sealed records in the twenty-three cases on the basis of an extraordinary legitimate public interest. The court noted that the most comprehensive . . . protective order in the files was the <em>Rosado </em>order<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> . . . but rejected the notion that the order had become permanent when the case was withdrawn. Rather, the court found that the <em>Rosado </em>order [was] temporary and had ended by its own terms with the avoidance of trial by settlement, and that even if the order had not expired, the court retained continuing jurisdiction over the sealed materials pursuant to \u00a7 52-212a. The court concluded that no valid order remained denying the public access to materials in the sealed files.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u201cThe court finally ordered that any claims of privilege regarding the sealed and protected documents be submitted in a privilege log no later than May 15, 2002, for consideration at a hearing to be held on May 24, 2002, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>when the claims would be decided. The court envisioned that such claims would be limited to psychiatric records or documents naming the John Doe priests. The court also ordered that documents in the twenty-three cases currently designated as sealed, but not designated as privileged by May 15, 2002, be available for public examination on May 16, 2002. The court denied the Times\u2019 request that all other discovery materials be filed with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u201cOn May 9, 2002, the defendants<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> filed with [the Appellate Court] a motion for review and a motion for supervision of trial court proceedings pending appeal. On May 10, 2002, [the Appellate Court] ordered counsel to file simultaneous briefs, to appear at an en banc hearing and to give reasons why the appeals from the April 24, 2002 hearing should not be dismissed for lack of a final judgment. [The Appellate Court] also ordered, sua sponte, that all trial court proceedings . . . [and] the orders of May 8,2002, regarding the release of sealed documents ... be stayed pending further order of [the Appellate Court], In a supplementary order dated May 13, 2002, [the Appellate Court] ordered counsel to address in their briefs whether the issue of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction was properly before [the Appellate Court] on appeal from the April 24, 2002 hearing, or whether it should be raised on appeal from the May 8, 2002 [orders],</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u201cDuring the en banc hearing, discussion turned to the newspapers\u2019 status. Noting that the trial court appeared to have granted the substantive relief requested without having acted on the motions to intervene, [Appellate Court] panel members questioned the newspapers\u2019 standing to participate in the appeal. Counsel for the Times ultimately conceded that the [trial] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>court had not acted on the motions to intervene, that the newspapers had no greater standing in the cases than any other member of the public and that counsel for the newspapers were present at the hearing only because they had received notice of the appeal and the court\u2019s order requesting briefing. At the conclusion of the hearing, [the Appellate Court] marked the jurisdictional question \u2018off,\u2019 directed the trial court to act on the pending motions to intervene and lifted the stay for that limited purpose. [The Appellate Court] also ordered the trial court to \u2018articulate the basis for its authority to open a new file at the request of a nonparty, who was not granted intervenor status, over the objections of the parties, more than 120 days after the withdrawal of the actions.\u2019 Finally, [the Appellate Court] ordered that the parties and proposed intervenors address that issue in their briefs on the merits, as well as the issue of the trial court\u2019s authority to grant party status to the Times and the Courant.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u201cOn May 21, 2002, the Reverend Charles Carr and the Reverend Walter Coleman filed an appeal from the trial court\u2019s May 8, 2002 orders [purporting to restore the] cases to the docket, after the passage of more than four months from the date of withdrawal, and creating a new file. On May 28, 2002, three more appeals were filed from the May 8 [orders].<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The second appeal was filed by the Diocese; the Reverend Driscoll, as the executor of the estate of the late Bishop Curtis; the Reverends Cusack and Bronkiewicz; Bishop Egan; and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>other defendants for whom the two specified law firms representing the Diocese had an appearance on file. The third appeal was filed by the John Doe priests numbers one through five. The fourth appeal was filed by Father Martin Frederici.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u201cOn June 7, the trial court issued a document indicating that \u2018all pending motions to intervene in the above captioned matter,\u2019 namely, the file designated in the order as <em>Application of New York Times </em>v. <em>Sealed Records, </em>[Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No.] X06-CV-02-0170932-S, which the court had created, sua sponte, without any summons, mesne process, service of process, bond<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> or recognizance,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> had been granted. The document also indicated that \u2018any pending motions to intervene that [had] been filed in any of the cases brought against the [Diocese] and others, which cases were withdrawn in March, 2001,\u2019 had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u201cOn June [13], 2002, the [trial] court issued a memorandum articulating the basis for its authority to open a new file. In its memorandum, the court first declared that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the files in its custody, and that the only actions it had taken at the April 24 [2002] hearing were to issue a briefing schedule and to assure those in attendance that it had no jurisdiction to order the parties to act in the twenty-three cases. The court explained that each of its decisions to date had been informed by the rules of practice dictating the expeditious resolution of issues created by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>orders sealing files,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> which efforts had been rendered futile by the June 5,2002 orders of [the Appellate Court].</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u201cThe [trial] court further explained that the clerk of the court had date stamped the [Times\u2019] emergency motion in the three captioned cases, but had not been able to docket the motion in those three files because the cases had been withdrawn more than one year earlier and could not be restored to pending status. The court, therefore, had determined, after discussing the matter with the clerk\u2019s office and the presiding civil judge of the Waterbury judicial district, that the most efficient tool for resolving the issues raised would be to invite the Times to file a separate application for the relief requested in its [motion].<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Accordingly, following receipt of the Times\u2019 application, the [trial] court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>opened a new file on April 18, 2002. The court emphasized that the motion had been placed in the new file to preserve its content, the file merely serving as a vehicle for compiling all of the papers related to the application and facilitating presentation of the Times\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u201cThe [trial] court stated that ... it had [granted] . . . the motions to intervene filed by the Courant, the Globe and the Post in the newly opened file,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> [but that] it had not done so in the twenty-three withdrawn cases because the motion[s] had not been docketed in those files.\u201d <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 704-10. The trial court noted that it did not open the withdrawn files because they \u201ccould not be restored to pending status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u201c[T]he [trial] court [further] articulated that inactive files are in the custody of the court pursuant to . . . \u00a7 51-52 (b) and Practice Book \u00a7 7-7,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and that the court\u2019s authority to open a new file is derived from its inherent power and duty to address the complaints, applications and petitions that are presented to it. The court stated that its obligation to address such matters was especially compelling in the present circumstances, [in which] \u2018interpretation and clarification of court orders is required.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u201cThe [trial] court stated that it had interpreted and clarified the scope, duration and application of the sealing orders in the May 8, 2002 memorandum of decision, citing as authority [among other cases] <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>260 Conn. 232, [246] 796 A.2d 1164 (2002) ... [in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>we concluded that a trial court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction is rooted in its inherent power to effectuate its prior judgments].<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> . . . The [trial] court [also] stated that it would have been a dereliction of its duty, and morally and legally indefensible, \u2018to ignore its inherent power over its own files behind the fig leaf of a hypertechnical understanding of its jurisdiction . . . <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 710-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Thereafter, the Appellate Court addressed the defendants\u2019 appeals,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> turning first to the appeals relating to the actions taken by the trial court at the April 24, 2002 hearing. The Appellate Court concluded, preliminarily, that the trial court, despite its express representations to the contrary, effectively had restored the withdrawn cases to the docket by asserting jurisdiction over the sealed court files in those cases. Id., 717-18, citing <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>239 Conn. 375, 391, 685 A.2d 1108 (1996) (concluding that action of trial court in connection with withdrawn case was functional equivalent of restoring case to docket), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>250 Conn. 147, 735 A.2d 333 (1999). In light of that determination, the Appellate Court further concluded that the trial court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over those files and its \u201crestoration\u201d of the cases to the docket constituted an appealable final judgment. <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 714-15, 719-20, citing <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Keiser, </em>212 Conn. 741, 747-48, 562 A.2d 524 (1989) (order of trial court opening judgment is appealable final judgment when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>issue raised is power of court to open judgment), and <em>Sicaras </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>44 Conn. App. 771, 775-76, 692 A. 2d 1290 (for final judgment purposes, order restoring withdrawn case to docket is analogous to order opening judgment), cert. denied, 241 Conn. 916, 696 A.2d 340 (1997). The Appellate Court further held, however, that, because the cases had been withdrawn more than one year prior to the Times\u2019 request to unseal the court files relating to the withdrawn cases, the trial court was precluded from restoring the cases to the docket by virtue of the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a. See <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 720, 747. The Appellate Court, therefore, reversed \u201c[t]he decision of the trial court granting the Times\u2019 [motion to vacate the protective orders] and the court\u2019s subsequent orders concerning the disclosure of the sealed and protected materials\u201d; id., 747; without either deciding whether the trial court effectively had permitted the newspapers to intervene in the withdrawn cases; id., 720 n.32; or reaching the merits of the second set of appeals from the trial court\u2019s May 8, 2002 orders. Id., 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We subsequently granted the newspapers\u2019 petitions for certification to appeal limited to the following question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court improperly granted the application to create a new file?\u201d <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>266 Conn. 906, 832 A.2d 71 (2003). Upon review of the record and the briefs of the parties, and after due consideration of the claims raised by the parties at oral argument, we conclude that the certified question is not an adequate statement of the multiple issues raised by this appeal. Consequently, it is necessary to reformulate and to expand the certified question to reflect more accurately the issues presented. See, e.g., <em>Stamford Hospital </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>236 Conn. 646, 648 n.1, 674 A.2d 821 (1996) (this court may modify certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>questions to render them more accurate in framing issues presented). We therefore set forth the following revised certified questions: (1) Did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court effectively restored the withdrawn cases to the docket, thereby giving rise to an appealable final order? (2) If so, did the trial court also effectively permit the newspapers to intervene in the withdrawn cases? (3) Did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a deprived the trial court of the authority to restore the withdrawn cases to the docket and, if not, did the trial court abuse its discretion in restoring those cases to the docket? (4) Did the trial court abuse its discretion in permitting the newspapers to intervene in the withdrawn cases?</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">With respect to the first revised certified question, we agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court, in asserting jurisdiction over the documents that had been filed with the court under seal in the withdrawn cases, effectively restored those cases to the docket. We also agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court\u2019s restoration of the withdrawn cases to the docket constituted an appealable final order. With respect to the second revised certified question, we conclude that the trial court effectively permitted the newspapers to intervene in the withdrawn cases. With respect to the third revised certified question, we conclude that the trial court retained continuing jurisdiction over the -withdrawn cases insofar as the documents filed under seal in those cases are concerned and, therefore, that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a deprived the trial court of jurisdiction over the Times\u2019 claim that the protective orders should be vacated. We also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket. With respect to the fourth revised certified question, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the newspapers to intervene in the withdrawn cases for the limited purpose of litigating the issue of whether the protective orders in those cases should be vacated or otherwise modified. We also conclude, however, that the trial court, in its May 8, 2002 memorandum of decision, improperly purported to adjudicate the merits of the Times\u2019 claim that the protective orders should be vacated or otherwise modified in violation of the automatic stay provision of Practice Book \u00a7 61-11. In light of these conclusions, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction: (1) to affirm the decision of the trial court effectively restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket and granting intervenor status to the newspapers; (2) to vacate the orders issued in connection with the trial court\u2019s May 8, 2002 memorandum of decision; and (3) to remand the case to the trial court for a de novo determination of the merits of the Times\u2019 request to unseal the court files in the withdrawn cases.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The first revised certified question, which implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of this court and the Appellate Court to entertain appeals stemming from the actions of the trial court at the April 24,2002 hearing, consists of two subparts, namely, whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court, by virtue of its actions on April 24, 2002, effectively restored the withdrawn cases to the docket, and, if so, whether the Appellate Court also properly concluded that the restoration of those cases to the docket constituted an appealable final order. We answer each of these two questions, which we address in inverse order, in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">As we repeatedly have observed, \u201c [t]he right of appeal is purely statutory. It is accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute and the rules of court for taking and prosecuting the appeal are met. . . . Moreover, [t]he statutory right to appeal is limited to appeals by aggrieved parties from final judgments .... Because our jurisdiction over appeals . . . is prescribed by statute, we must always determine the threshold question of whether the appeal is taken from a final judgment before considering the merits of the claim.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Underwriters at </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>Lloyd\u2019s &amp; Cos. Collective, </em>271 Conn. 474, 495, 857 A.2d 893 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 974, 125 S. Ct. 1826, 161 L. Ed. 2d 723 (2005). Thus, unless the actions of the trial court on April 24, 2002, constituted a final judgment for purposes of appeal, the Appellate Court was required to dismiss the defendants\u2019 appeals<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>271 Conn. 193, 207-208, 856 A.2d 997 (2004). In concluding that it had jurisdiction to entertain the appeals, the Appellate Court analogized the effect of the trial court\u2019s actions on the withdrawn cases, that is, restoring them to the docket, to that of opening a judgment, which, in the circumstances presented, would provide the basis for an immediate appeal. See <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 715-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Although \u201cit is well established that an order opening a judgment ordinarily is not a final judgment [for purposes of appeal] . . . [t]his court . . . has recognized an exception to this rule [when] the appeal challenges the power of the court to act to set aside the judgment.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Solomon v. Reiser, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 746-47. Thus, \u201c[a]n order of the trial court opening a judgment is ... an appealable final judgment [when] the issue raised is the power of the trial court to open [the judgment]\u201d in light of the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a. Id., 747-48; see also <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 418, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980). The Appellate Court, relying on its holding in <em>Sicaras </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 778, determined that, for final judgment purposes, an order restoring a withdrawn case to the docket is identical in all material respects to an order opening a final judgment when, as in the present case, a colorable claim challenging the authority of the trial court to restore the case to the docket is raised. See Rosado v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Cath</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>olic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 715-16. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In <em>Sicaras, </em>the Appellate Court considered whether the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a applied to an order of the trial court restoring a case to the docket eleven months after it had been withdrawn. See <em>Sicaras </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 776. Analogizing withdrawals to final judgments, the Appellate Court answered that question in the affirmative; see id., 776, 778; noting, first, that \u201c[t]he right of a plaintiff to withdraw his action before a hearing on the merits ... is absolute and unconditional. Under [the] law, the effect of a withdrawal, so far as the pendency of the action is concerned, is strictly analogous to that presented after the rendition of a final judgment or the erasure of the case from the docket.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 775-76, quoting <em>H. G. Bass Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ethan Allen, Inc., </em>26 Conn. App. 426, 431, 601 A.2d 1040 (1992). The Appellate Court further explained that \u201cthe motion to restore a case to the docket is the vehicle to \u2018open\u2019 a withdrawal, while the motion to open is the vehicle to open judgments. ... A motion to restore a case to the docket must have a jurisdictional time limitation in the same way as a motion to open.\u201d <em>Sicaras </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 776-77. The Appellate Court thus concluded that \u201c\u00a7 52-212a applies to the restoration of a case to the docket as well as to the opening of judgments.\u201d Id., 778. We agree with both the logic and the conclusion of the Appellate Court in <em>Sicaras </em>that \u00a7 52-212a is applicable not only to the opening of a case that has proceeded to judgment but also to the restoration of a withdrawn case.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>In the present case, the Appellate Court determined that, because, under <em>Sicaras, </em>the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a applies to withdrawn cases, the restoration of such a case to the docket must be treated the same, for final judgment purposes, as the opening of a judgment, when the party challenging the restoration of the case to the docket raises a colorable claim that the court lacked the authority to do so by virtue of the limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a. See <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 715-16. The Appellate Court further determined that, because, under <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Reiser, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 747-48, an order <em>opening </em>a judgment is immediately appealable when it is challenged on the basis of the court\u2019s authority to open the judgment in light of the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a, an order <em>restoring </em>a case to the docket also must be immediately appealable when that order is challenged on the basis of the court\u2019s authority to restore the case to the docket in light of the limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a. <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 716. We agree with the Appellate Court that this conclusion follows necessarily upon application of the principles enunciated in <em>Solomon </em>and <em>Sicaras. </em>Accordingly, if, in the present case, the trial court is deemed to have restored the withdrawn cases to the docket, then a challenge based on the authority of the trial court to do so in light of the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a rendered the trial court\u2019s restoration of the cases to the docket an immediately appealable final order. We turn, therefore, to the issue of whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court effectively restored the withdrawn cases to the docket.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 375, this court was required to decide, inter alia, whether the trial court had jurisdiction to act on an order that had been issued in a withdrawn case even though no motion to restore the case to the docket had been filed and the trial court had not purported to grant such a motion. See id., 389. We concluded that, if the trial court had been \u201crequired to grant a motion to restore the case to the docket before [acting on the order], we can only regard [the court\u2019s] actions as the functional equivalent of the granting of such a motion.\u201d Id., 391. \u201cTo read the record any other way would be to blink at reality. Under the unique circumstances . . . [the court\u2019s] action on the motions that were before [it] must be deemed to be the equivalent of restoring the case to the docket for the purpose of exercising the corut\u2019s inherent powers to enforce its orders and to provide for the due administration of justice.\u201d Id., 392; cf. <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Reiser, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 747 (action of trial court in connection with case that previously had proceeded to judgment was functional equivalent of opening that judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">We agree with the Appellate Court that the same conclusion is mandated under the circumstances of the present case. As the Appellate Court explained, \u201cthe [trial] court exercised direct authority over the [withdrawn] cases, which had the same effect as restoring those cases to the docket.\u201d <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 716. \u201cDespite the court\u2019s assertions to the contrary, and notwithstanding the absence of a formal motion to restore, [the creation of] the new file allowed the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to conduct a full blown hearing on procedural and substantive issues, request that the parties file briefs and otherwise act as if it had restored the [withdrawn] cases to the docket. In one such act, the clerk of the court entered appearances in the new file, sua sponte, for law firms that had represented the parties in the twenty-three withdrawn cases, despite the fact that the firms themselves had not entered appearances on behalf of their former clients.\u201d Id., 718-19. In other words, \u201cthe [trial] court considered the [Times\u2019] motion on its merits, just as it would have done had the Times filed, and the court granted, a motion to restore the [withdrawn] cases to the docket.\u201d Id., 716. Indeed, the trial court expressly and repeatedly represented that it had \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the sealed documents and protective orders that were the subject of the Times\u2019 motion. Because the very existence of the documents and orders in the court files is bound inextricably to the withdrawn cases, such that the court could not have asserted its authority over those documents and orders without also assuming jurisdiction over the withdrawn cases of which they were a part, the trial court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the documents and orders <em>necessarily </em>had the effect of restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">It is important to note, moreover, that the Times\u2019 March 26, 2002 motion contained the <em>caption </em>of the <em>Rosado, See </em>and <em>Fleetwood </em>cases, and the Times requested the trial court\u2019s permission <em>to intervene in those withdrawn cases </em>for the purpose of seeking, inter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>alia, an order vacating the protective orders that had been issued in those cases. The only reason that the Times\u2019 motion was treated as anything <em>other </em>than a request to have the withdrawn cases restored to the docket for that limited propose was a misunderstanding, on the part of the trial court and court officials, that the clerk was precluded, as a matter of law, from docketing the Times\u2019 motion <em>as it was marked.</em><footnotemark><em>43</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The solution at which the court arrived, in consultation with court personnel, was to label the Times\u2019 motion as something that it was not, namely, a new case. Otherwise, in every pertinent respect, the trial court and the parties treated the Times\u2019 motion as the equivalent of a motion to have the withdrawn cases restored to the docket.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Thus, as we concluded in <em>Chowdhury, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>actions of the trial court reasonably cannot be treated as anything other than the restoration of the withdrawn cases to the docket.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Having concluded that the trial court effectively restored the withdrawn cases to the docket, we next consider whether the trial court also effectively permitted the newspapers to intervene in those cases. We conclude that the trial court did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">As we have explained, the trial court treated the newly opened case as the operative case for the purpose of addressing the Times\u2019 motion to vacate the protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>orders. Moreover, in its articulation, the trial court expressly granted the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene in that new case.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> As we also have explained, the court used that new case as a vehicle for asserting its authority over the documents and protective orders that were the subject of the Times\u2019 motion. We have concluded, however, that, in doing so, the trial court actually was asserting its jurisdiction over the <em>withdrawn cases, </em>thereby effectively restoring them to the docket. See part I of this opinion. In light of our conclusion that the trial court\u2019s act of opening a new case was the functional equivalent of restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket, the court\u2019s act of granting the newspapers party status in that new case necessarily was the functional equivalent of granting the newspapers intervenor status in the withdrawn cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Underscoring the trial court\u2019s express denial of the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene in the withdrawn cases, the defendants<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> contend that it would be \u201codd\u201d for us to construe the denial of a motion as the functional equivalent of granting the motion. We acknowledge that it is somewhat unusual for an appellate court to construe the actions of a trial court in a manner that contradicts the trial court\u2019s own characterization of its actions. In the present case, however, it is no less odd to reject the trial court\u2019s characterization of the effect of its actions concerning the motions to intervene than it is to reject, as we have, the trial court\u2019s characterization of its actions regarding the creation of a new case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>More importantly, in view of our characterization of the trial court\u2019s actions regarding the newly opened case as the functional equivalent of restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket, it would be wholly illogical for us also to conclude that the trial court, in granting the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene in that newly opened case, had not effectively permitted the newspapers to intervene in the withdrawn cases. Indeed, our conclusion that the trial court <em>actually </em>had asserted jurisdiction over the withdrawn cases rather than a new case file does not alter the fact that the trial court always had <em>intended </em>to afford the newspapers party status, at least with respect to the issue of the Times\u2019 request for access to the sealed court documents. Under the circumstances, therefore, it is clear that the effect of the trial court\u2019s actions was not only to restore the withdrawn cases to the docket but also to grant the newspapers intervenor status in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Before addressing the propriety of the trial court\u2019s actions in effectively restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket and granting the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene, we digress briefly to address several points made by the dissent. The dissent disagrees with our conclusion that \u201cthe Appellate Court properly treated the trial court\u2019s actions as the effective equivalent of allowing the [newspapers] to intervene in the withdrawn cases and restoring the cases to the docket.\u201d The dissent asserts that, \u201c[although the trial court ruled unequivocally at the April 24, 2002 hearing that it had jurisdiction over the sealed documents, its ruling that it had jurisdiction to hear arguments on the merits of the Times\u2019 claim without restoring the cases to the docket pursuant to \u00a7 52-212a clearly was provisional.\u201d Accordingly, the dissent \u201cconclude [s] that the court made no determination that can be treated as the functional equivalent of restoring the cases to the docket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>and, therefore, that there was no appealable final judgment.\u201d Simply put, the dissent\u2019s contention\u2014which has not been advanced by any party to this appeal\u2014is unsupported by the facts. The dissent further contends that, even if it were to assume that the trial court effectively restored the withdrawn cases to the docket and granted the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene in those cases, the trial court\u2019s ruling should be reversed because the court was required to determine\u2014before allowing the newspapers to intervene for the purpose of addressing the merits of the Times\u2019 motion to vacate the protective orders\u2014whether the defendants had \u201crelied on the permanence of the protective orders in settling the cases . . . .\u201d If so, the dissent contends, then the trial court was required to deny the newspapers\u2019 request to intervene in the absence of a showing by the newspapers of \u201can extraordinary circumstance\u201d or \u201ccompelling need.\u201d This argument is not supported by the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">As we have explained in part I of this opinion, at the hearing of April 24, 2002, the trial court first heard extensive argument by the parties as to whether it had jurisdiction over the claim of the Times that it was entitled to access to the sealed documents that the trial court had removed from the withdrawn cases and placed into the new case file. Indeed, the sole focus of the first half of the hearing was to determine whether the court had the authority to decide the merits of the Times\u2019 claim that it had a right of access to the documents that had been sealed in accordance with the protective orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">At the conclusion of that portion of the hearing\u2014 that is, at the conclusion of the argument on the court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the merits of the Times\u2019 motion to vacate the protective orders\u2014the court expressly informed the parties of its determination that it <em>had jurisdiction to decide the merits of the Times\u2019 motion. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>In particular, the court stated, \u201cI believe I do have jurisdiction, certainly with respect to what is in the clerk\u2019s office in sealed envelopes. . . . So, we will move onto the merits.\u201d Immediately thereafter, the court reiterated its conclusion in even more unequivocal terms, stating, \u201c[M]y determination is that I do have jurisdiction, at least with respect to what\u2019s been sealed in the files.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Counsel for the Diocese then asked: \u201cYour Honor is ruling on that point today?\u201d The court responded, again unequivocally, in the affirmative. At the request of counsel for the Diocese \u201cto further brief the jurisdictional issue,\u201d the court did agree to give the Diocese and other interested parties another \u201copportunity, [albeit] not a very lengthy one, to address [the] jurisdictional issues . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The record, however, is crystal clear that the court was willing to revisit that issue only because counsel for the Diocese had so requested. The court then turned to a discussion of the merits of the Times\u2019 motion, a discussion that occupied the balance of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Despite the trial court\u2019s willingness to revisit its jurisdictional ruling, neither the Diocese nor any other party elected to file a supplemental brief in an effort to seek reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the jurisdictional issue. Instead, the Diocese and certain other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>defendants chose to exercise their right to take immediate appeals from the court\u2019s ruling. Those appeals were taken properly because the court\u2019s ruling had the effect of restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket. See part I of this opinion. When the Diocese and other defendants took immediate appeals rather than accepting the trial court\u2019s invitation for further briefing,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> or, put another way, when they opted to challenge the court\u2019s ruling on appeal rather than by way of reconsideration, the court had no reason to revisit its ruling, and, consequently, the ruling remained in effect, subject, of course, to any challenges on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Although it is clear from the record of the April 24, 2002 hearing that the trial court was asserting jurisdiction over the sealed documents and protective orders\u2014 and, therefore, effectively restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket\u2014the court\u2019s articulation of June 13, 2002, reinforces this conclusion. For example, the court expressly noted that the only issue raised by the appeals was \u201cwhether <em>the trial court\u2019s April 24, 2002 determination that it had subject matter jurisdiction over its own files </em>was properly made on an application by [the Times].\u201d (Emphasis added.) In characterizing the appeals in that manner, the trial court\u2019s point is unmistakable: the court had determined at the hearing of April 24, 2002, that it had jurisdiction over the sealed documents and protective orders. The court then proceeded to quote verbatim those portions of its comments at the April 24, 2002 hearing, to which we have referred previously, and, thereafter, explained that it had asserted jurisdiction over the sealed cases under its \u201cinherent power\u201d over files in the possession of the court and under its \u201cinherent power\u201d and \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d to issue postjudgment orders after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>expiration of the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Contrary to the contention of the dissent, therefore, there is no doubt that the trial court was asserting jurisdiction over the sealed documents for the purpose of addressing the merits of the Times\u2019 motion to vacate the protective orders. Indeed, the clarity of the trial court\u2019s actions is reflected in the fact that, as we have indicated, <em>'no parly </em>to this appeal contests the Appellate Court\u2019s well reasoned conclusion that the trial court effectively restored the withdrawn cases to the docket. Only the dissent challenges that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">By contrast, the reasoning that the dissent advances in support of its conclusion that the trial court did not effectively restore the withdrawn cases to the docket is fundamentally flawed because it is founded on a wholly untenable assertion. Although the dissent concedes that the trial court ruled definitively, at the April 24, 2002 hearing, that it had jurisdiction over the sealed documents that were the subject of the Times\u2019 motion, it nevertheless asserts that the court ruled only <em>provisionally </em>that it had jurisdiction over the protective orders. Thus, according to the dissent, the court made two rulings: one, which was definitive, that pertained to its jurisdiction over the sealed documents, and a second ruling, which was provisional, that pertained to the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the protective orders. This assertion is untenable because there is absolutely nothing in the record to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Despite the dissent\u2019s effort to separate the court\u2019s ruling on the protective orders from the court\u2019s ruling on the sealed documents, there is no principled way to do so. It is undisputed that the documents at issue are sealed and, therefore, are not available for inspection by the newspapers or the public, solely because of the protective orders that were issued in the cases in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>those documents were filed. For that reason, the parties\u2019 arguments at the hearing of April 24, 2002, necessarily focused on the documents <em>and </em>the protective orders, because they are inextricably intertwined. Indeed, the entire point of the initial, extended argument of the parties at the April 24, 2002 hearing\u2014that is, that portion of the hearing that occurred before the trial court entertained argument concerning the merits of the Times\u2019 motion to vacate the protective orders\u2014was whether the court had jurisdiction to address the Times\u2019 claim that the documents should be unsealed. In other words, the parties\u2019 argument addressed the issue of whether the court had jurisdiction to vacate or to modify the protective orders so that the newspapers and the public would be able to gain access to the documents. Therefore, the dissent\u2019s contention that the trial court ruled definitively that it had jurisdiction over the sealed files, but ruled only \u201cprovisionally]\u201d that it had jurisdiction over the protective orders, is belied by the record of the hearing of April 24, 2002, and is predicated on a wholly artificial distinction, a distinction that no party to this appeal seeks to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The dissent\u2019s assertion also is contrary to the trial court\u2019s articulation of June 13,2002. In that articulation, the trial court, in response to the order of the Appellate Court directing it to explain the basis of its decision to open a new file, stated, inter alia, that its \u201cauthority to open a file under [the] circumstances [of the present case] is essentially based in the inherent power of the trial court, and the duty of a trial court to address complaints, applications and petitions which are presented to it. This obligation is especially compelling under the circumstances here, where the court by law had custody of the files which were the subject of the application, <em>and interpretation and clarification of court orders is required.'\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, the trial court was well aware that, if it concluded that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>had jurisdiction over the files in its possession, it also would be required to address the continued vitality of the protective orders. When, after hearing the parties on the issue, the court determined that it <em>did </em>have jurisdiction over the sealed files, the court necessarily also was exercising jurisdiction over the protective orders.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The dissent\u2019s argument with respect to intervention also is without merit. The dissent asserts that \u201cthe trial court was required to consider whether the parties in the withdrawn cases had settled the cases in reliance on the permanence of the protective orders. If so, the court should not have granted the motions to intervene absent a showing of some extraordinary circumstance or compelling need.\u201d Although the dissent acknowledges that \u201c[s]everal courts have recognized an exception to [the rule disfavoring intervention after an action has been terminated] when intervention is sought for the purpose of modifying a protective order entered in the terminated action,\u201d the dissent nevertheless contends that \u201cthe court must determine whether the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ties relied on the permanence of the protective orders in settling the cases <em>before </em>allowing intervention.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The dissent\u2019s contention ignores the fact that, in all of the cases that the dissent cites for the proposition that a party reasonably may rely on the permanence of a protective order, that issue was addressed by the court in connection with the merits of the relief sought\u2014that is, in connection with the question of whether to vacate the challenged protective orders\u2014and not as a threshold question of intervention. See, e.g., <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission </em>v. <em>TheStreet.com, </em>273 F.3d 222, 229-31 (2d Cir. 2001); <em>In re Agent Orange Product Liability Litigation, </em>821 F.2d 139, 147-48 (2d Cir.) cert. denied sub nom. <em>Dow Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>484 U.S. 953, 108 S. Ct. 344, 98 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1987); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst, </em>677 F.2d 230, 231-32 (2d Cir. 1982). Thus, the very cases on which the dissent relies undermine the dissent\u2019s position, a position that, so far as we can discern, finds no support in the relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Finally, the dissent, in placing such singular importance on the parties\u2019 asserted reliance interest, wholly ignores the significant\u2014and constitutionally based\u2014 public interest in judicial documents and the responsibility of the courts to protect that interest. Of course, a party\u2019s reasonable reliance on the continued vitality of a protective order is a factor that a court must weigh in deciding whether, under the particular facts and circumstances of the case, to vacate or to modify that order. But the dissent goes much farther, elevating that reliance to an exalted status that almost always will be outcome determinative in favor of the party seeking to block public access to court documents. Indeed, under the dissent\u2019s unprecedented view, the public will not even be afforded party status in its effort to obtain documents in the court\u2019s possession unless it <em>first </em>can establish an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d or a \u201ccom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>pelling need\u201d for the sealed materials. In requiring the public to establish a compelling need to overcome the parties\u2019 asserted interest in maintaining the secrecy of documents in the court\u2019s possession, the dissent improperly skews the analysis and bucks the strong consensus favoring disclosure of such documents in the absence of a need for continued secrecy. See parts IV and V of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">We next consider whether the trial court had the authority to restore the withdrawn cases to the docket notwithstanding the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a and, if so, whether the court properly exercised that authority. We conclude that \u00a7 52-212a did not preclude the trial court from restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket because the court had continuing jurisdiction over those cases for the limited purpose of adjudicating the Times\u2019 claim regarding the sealed documents. We also conclude that the trial court acted within the scope of that authority in restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the standards that guide our review of the trial court\u2019s actions regarding the withdrawn cases. Whether a court retains continuing jurisdiction over a case is a question of law subject to plenary review. See <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 239-40. Whether a court properly exercised that authority, however, is a separate inquiry that is subject to review only for an abuse of discretion. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">We first must consider whether the trial court had the authority to restore the withdrawn cases to the docket, beyond the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>212a, under the continuing jurisdiction exception to that limitation period.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The newspapers contend that, because protective orders are injunctive in nature, the trial court had continuing jurisdiction to restore the cases to the docket by virtue of the court\u2019s inherent power to modify injunctions after the expiration of the four month period. We agree with the newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">We recently had occasion to examine the underpinnings of a trial court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction in <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>In that case, the plaintiff, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AvalonBay), applied to the defendant, the plan and zoning commission of the town of Orange (town), for approval to construct a luxury apartment complex that included units of affordable housing. Id., 234. The town rejected the application, and AvalonBay appealed to the Superior Court, which sustained the appeal and ordered the town to approve AvalonBay\u2019s application subject to any reasonable and necessary conditions that might be imposed by the town. Id., 234-35. Seven months later, the town approved AvalonBay\u2019s application subject to sixteen conditions. Id., 236. AvalonBay thereafter filed a motion for contempt in which it claimed, inter alia, that some of the conditions imposed by the town were unreasonable or inconsistent with the court\u2019s prior order and that others were not possible to perform. Id., 236-37. After a hearing, the trial court concluded that AvalonBay had not established grounds for contempt but nonetheless ordered the town to modify or to rescind some of the challenged conditions. Id., 237-38. The town appealed, claiming that, in the absence of a finding of contempt, the trial court lacked continuing jurisdiction over the case and that, because more than four months had passed since judgment was rendered in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>case, the court lacked the authority to direct that the town change the conditions of approval. Id., 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">On appeal, we rejected the town\u2019s claim as predicated on a \u201chypertechnical understanding of the trial court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction to effectuate prior judgments.\u201d Id., 241. We concluded \u201cthat the trial court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction is not separate from, but, rather, <em>derives </em>from, its equitable authority to vindicate judgments.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. On the basis of that determination, we held that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction to effectuate its prior judgments, either by summarily ordering compliance with a clear judgment or by interpreting an ambiguous judgment and entering orders to effectuate the judgment as interpreted, is grounded in its inherent powers, and is not limited to cases [in which] the noncompliant party is in contempt, family cases, cases involving injunctions, or cases [in which] the parties have agreed to continuing jurisdiction.\u201d Id., 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In the course of our discussion of the trial court\u2019s inherent authority to effectuate its prior judgments more than four months after judgment has been rendered, we also expressly noted that \u201ccourts have inherent power to change or modify their own injunctions that is not limited by \u00a7 52-212a . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 242 n.11, citing Adams v. <em>Vaill, </em>158 Conn. 478, 482, 262 A.2d 169 (1969) (\u201c[i]t cannot be doubted that courts have inherent power to change or modify their own injunctions [when] circumstances or pertinent law have so changed as to make it equitable to do so\u201d); see also <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Industrial Park Corp., </em>211 Conn. 648, 652-53 n.2, 560 A.2d 968 (1989) (common law vests courts with continuing jurisdiction to modify their injunctions more than four months after judgment has been rendered). In light of the court\u2019s inherent authority to modify its injunctions, if, as the newspapers claim, a protective order is materially similar to an injunction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>then the trial court in the present case retained continuing jurisdiction, under its inherent power, to restore the withdrawn cases to the docket, more than four months after the withdrawal of the cases, for the limited purpose of determining whether the protective orders should be vacated or otherwise modified due to changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We agree with the newspapers that discovery related protective orders, like the protective orders issued in the withdrawn cases, are injunctive in nature. Such orders have both the force and effect of an injunction, and serve a similar equitable purpose, namely, to regulate prospectively the conduct of the parties, either by restraining them from acting or by requiring them to act under circumstances that, if not so regulated, could lead to unduly harmful consequences. In this respect, a protective order will be tantamount to a prohibitory injunction; see <em>Tomasso Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>October Twenty-Four, Inc., </em>230 Conn. 641, 652, 646 A.2d 133 (1994) (\u201c[a] prohibitory injunction is an order of the court restraining a party from the commission of an act\u201d); or a mandatory injunction; see id. (\u201c[a] mandatory injunction ... is a court order commanding a party to perform an act\u201d); or, like any other injunction, may have attributes of both. See id., 652 n.12. Moreover, a party who violates the terms of a protective order, like a party who violates the terms of an injunction, is exposed to liability for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Furthermore, once issued, protective orders, like injunctions, \u201cneed not remain in place permanently . . . and their terms are not immutable. It is well-settled that a trial court retains the power to modify or lift a protective order that it has entered.\u201d <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Herzke, </em>924 S.W.2d 652, 659 (Tenn. 1996). Indeed, \u201ccourts and commentators seem unanimous in finding . . . [that courts have] an inherent power to modify discovery-related protective orders, even after judgment, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>circumstances justify.\u201d <em>Public Citizen </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>858 F.2d 775, 782 (1st Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1030, 109 S. Ct. 838, 102 L. Ed. 2d 970 (1989); see also <em>United Nuclear Corp. </em>v. <em>Cranford Ins. Co., </em>905 F.2d 1424, 1427 (10th Cir. 1990) (\u201c[a]s long as a protective order remains in effect, the court that entered the order retains the power to modify it, even if the underlying suit has been dismissed\u201d), cert. denied sub nom. <em>American Special Risk Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Rohm &amp; Haas Co., </em>498 U.S. 1073, 111 S. Ct. 799, 112 L. Ed. 2d 860 (1991). Consequently, \u201c[a] protective order, like any ongoing injunction, is always subject to the inherent power of the [trial] court to relax or terminate the order, even after judgment.\u201d <em>Gambale </em>v. <em>Deutsche Bank AG, </em>377 F.3d 133, 141 (2d Cir. 2004). \u201cThis retained power in the court to alter its own ongoing directives provides a safety valve for public interest concerns, changed circumstances or any other basis that may reasonably be offered for later adjustment.\u201d <em>Poliquin </em>v. <em>Garden Way, Inc., </em>989 F.2d 527, 535 (1st Cir. 1993); accord <em>Gambale </em>v. <em>Deutsche Bank AG, </em>supra, 141; see also <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Carnet Holding Corp., </em>809 A.2d 1159, 1162 (Del. 2002). Thus, for all purposes relative to any protective order in the present case, \u201c[d]uring the pendency of the . . . order, including times after [the withdrawal of the case], the order acted as an injunction, setting forth strict limitations on the parties\u2019 use of discovery <em>materials.\u201dPublic Citizen </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>supra, 782. \u201cIn support of this \u2018injunction,\u2019 the [trial] court necessarily had the power to enforce the order, at any point while the order was in effect, including periods after [withdrawal]. . . . Correlative with this power to enforce, the [trial] court necessarily also retained power to modify the protective order in light of changed circumstances.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Because protective orders operate like injunctions and have the same purpose and effect, and because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>courts have inherent power to revisit protective orders or injunctions when a change in circumstances or pertinent law makes it equitable to do so, we see no reason why a protective order that remains in effect more than four months after judgment or withdrawal should be treated any differently, for purposes of \u00a7 52-212a, than an injunction that survives that four month period. We conclude, therefore, that, just as a court has continuing jurisdiction to vacate or to modify an injunction after the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a has expired, so, too, does a court have continuing jurisdiction to vacate or to modify a protective order after the expiration of that limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">This conclusion is consistent with, if not mandated by, two important and well established principles. First, courts retain supervisory authority over documents in their possession. E.g., <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Warner Communications, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 589, 598, 98 S. Ct. 1306, 55 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1978). Second, the public has a presumptive right of access to court proceedings and documents. E.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amodeo, </em>44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995); see also <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Examining Committee, </em>263 Conn. 39, 65 n.16, 818 A.2d 14 (2003). With respect to a court\u2019s supervisory authority over documents in its custody and control, that power is not forfeited merely because the parties have agreed to a settlement and withdrawal of the case. As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals recently has observed, \u201c[t]he court\u2019s supervisory power [over documents in its possession] does not disappear because jurisdiction over the relevant controversy has been lost. The records and files are not in limbo. [As] long as they remain under the aegis of the court, they are superintended by the judges who have dominion over the court.\u201d <em>Gambale </em>v. <em>Deutsche Bank AG, </em>supra, 377 F.3d 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">This supervisory role of the court in relation to its own files is an especially important one insofar as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>pertains to files that contain judicial documents\u2014that is, documents that have been submitted to the court for its review in the discharge of the court\u2019s adjudicatory function\u2014because \u201c[t]he public has a common law presumptive right of access to [such] documents<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> . . . and likely a constitutional one as well.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.) Id., 140; see also <em>Jessup </em>v. <em>Luther, </em>277 F.3d 926, 927-28 (7th Cir. 2002) (\u201cThe general rule is that the record of a judicial proceeding is public. . . . Not only do such records often concern issues in which the public has an interest, in which event concealing the records disserves the values protected by the free-speech and free-press clauses of the First Amendment, but also the public cannot monitor judicial performance adequately if the records of judicial proceedings are secret.\u201d [Citations omitted.]). Although that presumptive right of access is not absolute and, therefore, may yield upon demonstration of a compelling reason for secrecy; e.g., <em>Gambale </em>v. <em>Deutsche Bank AG, </em>supra, 377 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>F.3d 140; <em>Jessup </em>v. <em>Luther, </em>supra, 277 F.3d 928; parties to litigation nevertheless \u201ccannot expunge the public interest by the simple expedient of filing a [withdrawal of action] with the court. The public\u2019s stake in the propriety and particulars of the court\u2019s adjudication does not evaporate upon the parties\u2019 subsequent decision to settle.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> <em>Gambale </em>v. <em>Deutsche Bank AG, </em>supra, 140. Indeed, our review of the sealed documents at issue in the present case reveals that many of those documents are judicial documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\"><em>Gambale, </em>a case that is strikingly similar to the present case in all material respects, provides persuasive support for the conclusion that a court possesses inherent power to modify a protective order concerning documents in its possession even though it otherwise may lack the authority to adjudicate the substantive rights of the parties to the case in which the protective order was issued. In <em>Gambale, </em>the plaintiff, Virginia Gambale, a former managing director employed by the defendant, Deutsche Bank AG (bank), brought an action against the bank alleging that it had discriminated against her on the basis of her sex and had retaliated against her for complaining about it. Id., 135. After pretrial discovery, the bank filed a motion for summary judgment. See id. Gambale\u2019s response to the bank\u2019s motion included certain documents that she filed with the District Court under seal in accordance with a protective order that the court previously had entered. Id. Thereafter, the District Court granted the bank\u2019s motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>judgment as to one of Gambale\u2019s claims, but denied the motion as to a number of other claims. Id., 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Shortly thereafter, the parties advised the District Court that they had settled the action on a confidential basis. Id. The District Court indicated that it disagreed with the parties regarding the propriety of keeping the settlement agreement confidential. Id. Approximately three weeks after they had advised the District Court that they had settled, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice as permitted by the federal rules of civil procedure. Id., 137; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 41 (a) (1) (ii). The bank also sent the District Court a letter asserting that, as a result of the stipulated dismissal of the action, the court no longer had jurisdiction over the case and, therefore, had no authority to permit disclosure of the settlement terms or to unseal any documents related to the action or the settlement. <em>Gambale </em>v. <em>Deutsche Bank AG, </em>supra, 377 F.3d 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The District Court, however, issued an order unsealing the sealed documents that Gambale had filed in opposition to the bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The District Court explained that, despite the parties\u2019 settlement and stipulation of dismissal, the court continued to have jurisdiction over the judicial documents filed with the court in connection with the litigation. Id. The District Court further noted that the bank had failed to demonstrate that its privacy interests in those documents overcame the presumption of access to those documents. Id., 138. The bank appealed from the District Court\u2019s order unsealing the documents, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court had no jurisdiction to issue the unsealing order after the filing of the stipulation of dismissal. Id., 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Although the Second Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged that the filing of a stipulation of dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>generally \u201cdivests the court of its jurisdiction over a case, irrespective of whether the . . . court approves the stipulation\u201d; id., 139; it stated further that \u201c[i]t simply does not follow . . . that the filing of a stipulation of dismissal divests a court of jurisdiction either to dispose of material in its files as it thinks appropriate or to modify or vacate its own protective orders with respect to such documents.\u201d Id., 139-40. After underscoring the public\u2019s presumptive right of access to judicial documents, the District Court\u2019s supervisory authority over documents and files in its possession and that court\u2019s inherent power to modify or to terminate protective orders at any time, the Court of Appeals held that a District Court \u201cacts within its jurisdiction when it modifies or vacates a protective order to allow [a public right of access to judicial documents], irrespective of whether it does so before or after a stipulation of dismissal has been filed.\u201d Id., 142. The Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court \u201cacted within its jurisdiction when it issued the [u]nsealing [o]rder even though the order followed the parties\u2019 filing of the [stipulation of [dismissal.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We fully agree with the reasoning and conclusion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Gambale.</em><footnotemark><em>58</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As in <em>Gambale, </em>the trial court in the present case had inherent power to vacate or to modify the protective orders in the withdrawn cases\u2014even though we may presume that, by operation of \u00a7 52-212a, the court otherwise had been divested of its authority to affect the substantive rights of the parties to those cases\u2014as long as those protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>tive orders remained in effect. To conclude otherwise would require us to ignore both the court\u2019s inherent common-law authority to vacate or to modify its own equitable orders and the acknowledged public interest in documents filed with the court in connection with its adjudicatory function.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The Appellate Court rejected the newspapers\u2019 contention that the trial court had continuing jurisdiction on the ground that the protective orders were not injunctive in nature, explaining that \u201c [injunctions and protective orders are substantively different because an injunction is a remedy . . . and a protective order is a case management tool.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 725. The Appellate Court further noted that the newspapers had cited \u201cno Connecticut authority for the proposition that the protective . . . orders in the withdrawn cases were injunctions subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the court.\u201d Id., 726. We are not persuaded by the reasoning of the Appellate Court. Although a protective order is indeed a case management tool, it most frequently is used to remediate the unduly harsh or unfair consequences that otherwise might result from a party\u2019s obligation, arising under our rules of practice, to divulge information of a particularly private or sensitive nature. In that respect, a protective order shares the same equitable attributes as an injunctive remedy. More fundamentally, however, the Appellate Court has seized upon a distinction without a difference in characterizing an injunction as a remedy and a protective order as a case management tool. As we have explained, a protective order is an equitable device that operates in a manner virtually identical to an injunction. Indeed, in practical effect, a protective order fairly may be described as a type of injunction, albeit of limited scope.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Finally, unlike the Appellate Court, we are unwilling to draw any negative inference about the soundness of equating protective orders with injunctions\u2014a proposition that we believe to be rather unremarkable\u2014from the newspapers\u2019 failure to cite any Connecticut authority for it. Rather, we attribute that dearth of authority to the likelihood that the injunctive nature of protective orders previously has not been the subject of controversy, or even attention, in this state. In any event, we join other jurisdictions in expressly recognizing this essential nature of protective orders.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> See, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>Gambale </em>v. <em>Deutsche Bank AG, </em>supra, 377 F.3d 141; <em>Poliquin </em>v. <em>Garden Way, Inc., </em>supra, 989 F.2d 535; <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Carnet Holding Corp., </em>supra, 809 A.2d 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Having concluded that the trial court retained continuing jurisdiction over the withdrawn cases, we now must determine whether the court acted within its discretion in exercising its authority. For several reasons, we conclude that it did. First, the trial court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the withdrawn cases was limited in scope; the court restored the withdrawn cases to the docket solely for the purpose of considering the Times\u2019 claim regarding sealed documents <em>in the court\u2019s files. </em>Indeed, the court expressly declined to assert its authority over documents that, although subject to the confidentiality provisions of the protective orders, were not in the court\u2019s possession. See footnote 14 of this opinion. Thus, the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the withdrawn cases did not implicate the substantive rights of the parties to those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Second, as we have explained, the public has a real and legitimate interest in the workings of our courts, and vindication of that interest requires, as a general matter, that the courts\u2019 business not be conducted covertly. See, e.g., <em>Citizens First National Bank of Princeton </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>178 F.3d 943, 945 (7th Cir. 1999) (\u201c[T]he public at large pays for the courts and therefore has an interest in what goes on at all stages of a judicial proceeding. . . . That interest does not always trump the property and privacy interests of the litigants, but it can be overridden only if the latter interests predominate in the particular case . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>[Citations omitted.]). Moreover, to the extent that the Times\u2019 motion to vacate the protective orders relates to judicial documents, the Times\u2019 interest in such documents is especially great, and the defendants<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> bear a heavy burden of establishing a compelling interest in preventing those documents from being disclosed to the public.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Furthermore, because the trial court has continuing jurisdiction over the withdrawn cases, by virtue of its inherent power to revisit its protective orders beyond the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a, the fact that the Times did not seek relief in this case until approximately eight months after the expiration of that period does not militate against the court\u2019s exercise of discretion in favor of restoring the cases to the docket for the limited purpose requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Finally, \u201c[i]n reviewing a claim of abuse of discretion, we have stated that [discretion means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice. ... In general, abuse of discretion exists when a court could have chosen different alternatives but has decided the matter so arbitrarily as to vitiate logic, or has decided it based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>on improper or irrelevant factors.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 416, 857 A.2d 808 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 845, 126 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005). Because the trial court\u2019s decision to address the merits of the Times\u2019 motion\u2014thereby effectively restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket\u2014was a reasonable one, we reject the defendants\u2019 contention<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> that the court abused its discretion in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We now turn to the fourth revised certified question, namely, the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action in effectively permitting the newspapers to intervene in the withdrawn cases. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination in that regard was proper.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Because our rules of practice provide no specific articulation of the factors to be considered in determining whether intervention should be allowed, we have turned to rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> for guidance. See <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>187 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>187, 197, 445 A.2d 579 (1982). In reliance on that rule, \u201c[o]ur cases establish that, in determining whether to grant a request for permissive intervention, a court should consider several factors: the timeliness of the intervention, the proposed intervenor\u2019s interest in the controversy, the adequacy of representation of such interests by other parties, the delay in the proceedings or other prejudice to the existing parties the intervention may cause, and the necessity for or value of the intervention in resolving the controversy.\u201d <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>224 Conn. 263, 277, 618 A.2d 1 (1992); accord <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra, 197. With respect to the propriety of the trial court\u2019s balancing of these factors, we have stated that \u201c[a] ruling on a motion for permissive intervention would be erroneous only in the rare case [in which] such factors weigh so heavily against the ruling that it would amount to an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra, 197. A party challenging a ruling on permissive intervention \u201cbear[s] the heavy burden of demonstrating an abuse of . . . discretion . . . <em>I\u2019 In re Baby Girl B., </em>supra, 297. The defendants have failed to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">With respect to the timeliness of the newspapers\u2019 request to intervene, it is undisputed that the Times did not seek access to the sealed documents in the withdrawn cases until approximately one year after the withdrawal of those cases from the docket. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>one year is not an insignificant period of time, we are not persuaded that it is so long as to bar the newspapers from intervening. Indeed, \u201c[n]umerous courts have allowed third parties to intervene in cases . . . involving delays measured in years rather than weeks.\u201d <em>Public Citizen </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>supra, 858 F.2d 785; see <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission </em>v. <em>National Children\u2019s Center, Inc., </em>146 F.3d 1042, 1047 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (noting \u201cgrowing consensus among [federal] courts of appeals that intervention to challenge confidentiality orders may take place long after a case has been terminated\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>San Jose Mercury News, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States District Court, </em>187 F.3d 1096, 1101 (9th Cir. 1999) (noting that \u201cdelays measured in years have been tolerated [when a prospective] intervenor is pressing the public\u2019s right of access to judicial records\u201d); <em>Pansy </em>v. <em>Stroudsburg, </em>23 F.3d 772, 779 (3d Cir. 1994) (\u201ca district court may properly consider a motion to intervene permissively for the limited purpose of modifying a protective order even after the underlying dispute between the parties has long been settled\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see <em>also Beckman Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Ins. Co., </em>966 F.2d 470, 471, 476 (9th Cir. 1992) (trial court properly permitted intervention for purpose of seeking modification to protective orders approximately two years after underlying case had been settled and dismissed), cert. denied sub nom. <em>International Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., </em>506 U.S. 868, 113 S. Ct. 197, 121 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1992); <em>United Nuclear Corp. </em>v. <em>Cranford Ins. Co., </em>supra, 905 F.2d 1427 (allowing intervention three years after settlement of case because intervention was solely for purpose of challenging protective order); <em>Mokhiber </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>537 A.2d 1100, 1105 (D.C. App. 1988) (reversing denial of intervention when intervenor sought to challenge protective orders barring public access to court documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>despite four year delay between settlement of underlying action and motion to intervene, and even though intervenor became aware of action one year before seeking intervention). We, too, decline to place a rigid time limitation on intervention when, as in the present case, the sole purpose of the motion to intervene is to challenge a protective order. To conclude otherwise would be contrary to the important public interest that the motion seeks to vindicate. Moreover, although, in the present case, the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a expired more than eight months before the date on which intervention first was sought, that limitation period did not operate as a bar to intervention because, for the reasons that we previously have explained, the court retained continuing jurisdiction over the protective orders issued in the withdrawn cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">We already have adverted to the second relevant factor, namely, the newspapers\u2019 interest in the controversy. That consideration militates strongly in favor of intervention because the newspapers seek to vindicate the public interest in, and the presumptive right of access to, judicial proceedings and documents. Although the newspapers\u2019 interest in the withdrawn cases is limited in the sense that they do not have, and never have had, a stake in the outcome of those cases, they, and the public, do have a legitimate interest in the contents of the court\u2019s files.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Furthermore, that interest is not adequately represented by other parties to the litigation. Although it is true that the plaintiffs in the withdrawn cases opposed the defendants\u2019 efforts<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> to obtain the protective orders, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the plaintiffs in the withdrawn cases ever sought to vacate or to modify the protective orders, on grounds of changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>circumstances or otherwise, once those orders were issued. The record is similarly devoid of any indication that the plaintiffs in the withdrawn cases are likely to take any future action to accomplish that end. Moreover, the interests of the plaintiffs in the withdrawn cases are distinct from those of the newspapers, which \u201cseek to gain access on behalf of the general public in order to disseminate the information through the media.\u201d <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Herzke, </em>supra, 924 S.W.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">With respect to any delay in the proceedings that the intervention might cause, no such delay will result because the cases that are the subject of the intervention motions have been settled and withdrawn. Thus, as the First Circuit Court of Appeals has explained: \u201cThis factor encompasses the basic fairness notion that intervention should not work a last minute disruption of painstaking work by the parties and the court. . . . For purposes of this factor, therefore, it is necessary to ask why a would-be intervenor seeks to participate, for if the desired intervention relates to an ancillary issue and will not disrupt the resolution of the underlying merits, untimely intervention is much less likely to prejudice the parties.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Public Citizen </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>supra, 858 F.2d 786; accord <em>Pansy </em>v. <em>Stroudsburg, </em>supra, 23 F.3d 779. In the present case, the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene involve an ancillary issue concerning the protective orders, and the underlying cases have been withdrawn. Because the newspapers seek to litigate the issue of whether the protective orders should be vacated rather than an issue involving the merits of the withdrawn cases, we conclude that the delay in intervention caused little, if any, prejudice to the parties to the withdrawn cases.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Pansy </em>v. <em>Stroudsburg, </em>supra, 779-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>We turn, finally, to the last factor, namely, the necessity for or value of the intervention in resolving the controversy. That factor bears no real relevance to the present matter because the cases in which the protective orders were issued have been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Upon consideration of the foregoing factors, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its broad discretion in permitting the newspapers to intervene in the withdrawn cases. Neither the passage of time since the cases were withdrawn nor any other possible inconvenience to the defendants that might result from intervention outweighs the newspapers\u2019 strong interest in challenging the necessity of preserving the protective orders in those cases. Although the defendants will have a full and fair opportunity to defend against the merits of the Times\u2019 motion to vacate the protective orders, the defendants have not established that the trial court was required to deny the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene for the purpose of litigating the merits of the motion to vacate.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">To summarize, we conclude, with respect to the trial court\u2019s actions at the April 24, 2002 hearing, that: (1) the trial court effectively restored the withdrawn cases to the docket; (2) restoration of the cases to the docket constituted an appealable final order; (3) the trial court had continuing jurisdiction over the withdrawn cases for the limited purpose of adjudicating the Times\u2019 motion to vacate the protective orders that had been issued in those cases; (4) the trial court did not abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>its discretion in restoring the cases to the docket; and (5) the trial court effectively permitted the newspapers to intervene in the withdrawn cases and did not abuse its discretion in doing so. With respect to the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision of May 8, 2002, we conclude that, because the trial court rendered that decision in violation of the automatic stay that had been triggered by the defendants\u2019 previously filed appeals, the orders issued in connection with that memorandum of decision must be vacated. Finally, it is necessary that the trial court, on remand, ensure that all parties to the withdrawn cases receive proper notice of this proceeding and any future proceedings in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the decisions of the trial court effectively restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket and granting intervenor status to the newspapers, to vacate the orders issued in connection with the trial court\u2019s May 8, 2002 memorandum of decision, and to remand the case to the trial court for a de novo determination, by a different judge, of the merits of the Times\u2019 motion to vacate the protective orders that were issued in the withdrawn cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In this opinion VERTEFEUILLE and LICARI, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by law and except in such cases in which the court has continuing jurisdiction, a civil judgment or decree rendered in the Superior Court may not be opened or set aside unless a motion to open or set aside is filed within four months following the date on which it was rendered or passed. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\"> Although \u00a7 52-212a also contemplates exceptions to the four month limitation period as \u201cprovided by law\u201d; see footnote 1 of this opinion; only the continuing jurisdiction exception is implicated in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\"> The Diocese was a defendant in all of the lawsuits, along with certain clergymen employed by the Diocese.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-5\"> We hereinafter refer to these sealing and protective orders as \u201cprotective orders.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\"> In its motion, the Times also requested: (1) \u201can order vacating protective orders that restrict public access to pretrial discovery materials\u201d; and (2) \u201can order requiring the filing of all depositions, answers to interrogatories and responses to requests for admission and document requests\u201d in order \u201cto ensure that all members of the public have an equal opportunity to review the complete record of these proceedings . . .

To the extent that any of the foregoing claims implicates the terms of the protective orders, the trial court, on remand, will have the opportunity to consider the terms of those orders in connection with its adjudication of the merits of the Times\u2019 motion to unseal the documents in the court\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The newspapers also contend that the Times\u2019 motion to vacate the protective orders does not implicate the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a because the motion properly is viewed as an \u201cindependent suit based upon [the newspapers\u2019] constitutional rights and their efforts to end the violation of those rights wrought by state action.\u201d Consistent with that position, the newspapers presumably would have us jump directly to a review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>merits of the trial court\u2019s order unsealing the documents at issue. We decline the newspapers\u2019 invitation. The constitutional implications of the Times\u2019 motion do not alter the fact that the documents sought were filed under seal in the withdrawn cases and, therefore, the existence of those sealed files is linked inexplicably to the withdrawn cases. Consequently, a new action seeking to have those documents unsealed would be tantamount to a motion to restore the withdrawn cases to the docket and, presumably, should be treated as such. In any event, we agree with the Appellate Court that to treat the Times\u2019 motion as a new lawsuit would be to ignore the fact that the motion was not styled as an independent action and it met none of the procedural requirements of such an action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\"> See footnote 28 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\"> This principle apparently derives from an earlier Supreme Court case, namely, <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>St. Patrick\u2019s Roman Catholic Church Corp., </em>123 Conn. 166, 170, 193 A. 204 (1937).

Our review of the briefs that the newspapers filed in this court reveals that the newspapers have not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>reasserted that claim expressly in the present appeal. We nevertheless address the issue because it implicates the authority of the Appellate Court, and of this court, to entertain the parties\u2019 claims, on appeal, arising out of the trial court\u2019s actions in connection with the April 24, 2002 hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b221-6\"> Thus, we disagree with the trial court that, in removing the sealed documents and protective orders from the withdrawn cases and having them placed in a new file, that court then could properly treat those documents and protective orders as separate and distinct from the withdrawn cases themselves, thereby rendering \u00a7 52-212a inapplicable. Simply put, the documents and orders were, and remain, an integral part of the withdrawn cases, and the mere act of removing them from those case files cannot make it otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b222-5\"> As the trial court explained in its articulation: \u201cOn March 26, 2002, [the Times] filed with the Waterbury Superior Court clerk\u2019s office an \u2018emergency motion\u2019 to vacate sealing orders, vacate protective orders and require filing of discovery materials in three of the twenty-three cases pending before [the trial] court prior to their final disposition by withdrawal on March 12, 2001. The motion promised in a footnote that \u2018[although this motion addresses the three captioned-cases, [the Times] is seeking leave to file a consolidated omnibus motion requesting identical relief in the approximately twenty other sex abuse cases to which the [Diocese] is a party.\u2019 The clerk\u2019s office date-stamped the motions in the three cases, but these papers were not docketed by the clerk in the files bearing their captions because those three cases, as well as the twenty others, were withdrawn on March 12, 2001, and could not be restored to pending status.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u201cThe clerk\u2019s office initially noted these practical problems and reported them to the presiding civil judge in [the judicial district of] Waterbury. Following consultation with the judicial branch court operations office, it was determined that the most effective way to deal with the Times\u2019 request to view sealed information within the possession of the court was to invite the Times to file an application for the relief requested in its motions. Accordingly, upon receipt of such application on April 18, 2002, a file was opened under the caption, <em>Application of The New York Times </em>v. <em>Sealed Files, </em>[Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No.] X06 CV 02 0170932 S, which file serve[d] as a vehicle for compiling all papers related to the Times\u2019 application and facilitating the presentment of its claims to the trial court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> Indeed, at the April 24, 2002 hearing, the trial court invited the parties to address its continuing jurisdiction, under \u00a7 52-212a, even though the court had opened a new file for the purpose of entertaining the Times\u2019 March 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>2002 motion. Moreover, a review of the arguments made by the Times and the Diocese reveals the underlying assumption of the parties, shared by the court, that, notwithstanding the newly opened file, adjudication of the Times\u2019 motion nonetheless had the effect of restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket. For example, counsel for the Diocese asserted that \u00a7 52-212a precluded the court, from adjudicating the Times\u2019 motion because the cases properly had been withdrawn \u201cby consent and with prejudice, and no motion was ever made to reopen or restore [them] to the docket within four months . . . .\u201d Counsel for the Times maintained, to the contrary, that the \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d exception to the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a eliminated any jurisdictional barrier otherwise posed by that statutory provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b223-9\"> In light of our determination that the trial court effectively restored the withdrawn cases to the docket and, further, that the restoration of those cases to the docket constituted an appealable final order, the trial court\u2019s May 8, 2002 memorandum of decision, in which the court purported to address the merits of the Times' motion to vacate the protective orders, necessarily contravened the automatic stay provision of Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (a). See footnote 19 of this opinion. Because we hereinafter conclude that the trial court effectively permitted the newspapers to intervene in the withdrawn cases; see part II of this opinion; properly restored the withdrawn cases to the docket; see part IV of this opinion; and properly permitted the newspapers to intervene in those cases; see part V of this opinion; we also conclude that the Times is entitled to an abdication of the merits of its motion to vacate the protective orders. Because the trial court purported to decide the merits of that motion in contravention of Practice Book \u00a7 61-11, the orders issued in connection with the trial court\u2019s May 8, 2002 memorandum of decision must be vacated and the case reassigned for a de novo hearing before a different judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b224-6\"> As we have noted; see footnote 34 of this opinion; the trial court stated in its articulation that the Times did not need the court\u2019s permission to seek relief in connection with the newly opened case because the Times was the party that had applied to have the new case opened. For purposes of this appeal, however, the trial court\u2019s granting of the Times\u2019 application to open a new case and the court\u2019s granting of the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene in that matter had the same effect, namely, affording each of those entities intervenor status in the withdrawn cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\"> See footnote 37 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\"> In concluding that it had jurisdiction <em>\u201ccertainly </em>with respect to\u201d and <em>\u201cat least </em>with respect to\u201d the sealed liles, the trial court merely was distinguishing between the sealed documents that were in the possession of the court, on the one hand, and documents, also subject to the protective orders, that were in the possession of the parties, on the other. (Emphasis added.) As we have explained, the Times had claimed that it was entitled to documents in the possession of the parties as well as to the sealed documents in the possession of the court. It is undisputed that the trial court concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over the documents in the possession of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> The trial court then proceeded to hear argument on the merits of the Times\u2019 motion to vacate the protective orders. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court also gave the parties an opportunity to brief supplementally issues relating to the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\"> The trial court itself characterized its actions in precisely these terms in its memorandum of decision of May 8, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\"> It also is perfectly clear that the trial court effectively granted the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene in the withdrawn cases. As we have explained, although 1he trial court denied the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene in the withdrawn cases, the trial court granted the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene in the new case, which case was the vehicle pursuant to which the court asserted jurisdiction over the sealed documents and orders that are the subject of the Times\u2019 motion to vacate the protective orders. Because the new case served as the vehicle by which the court, assumed jurisdiction over those documents and orders, and because those documents and orders were part of the withdrawn cases, it necessarily follows that the court effectively granted the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene in the withdrawn cases when it concluded that it had jurisdiction to entertain the merits of the limes\u2019 motion to vacate. Moreover, upon being directed by the Appellate Court to act on the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene, the trial court, in its articulation of June 13, 2002, expressly granted those motions with respect to the new file. Thus, contrary to the contention of the dissent, the record clearly establishes that the trial court effectively restored the withdrawn cases to the docket and granted the newspapers\u2019 motions to intervene in those cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\"> As we have indicated; see footnote 2 of this opinion; continuing jurisdiction is the only exception to the four month limitation period of \u00a7 52-212a that is implicated in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b239-5\"> With respect to this right of access, it has been aptly stated that \u201c[t]he public\u2019s exercise of its common law access right in civil cases promotes public confidence in the judicial system ....

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASg\">with whom ZARELLA, J., joins, dissenting. The majority concludes that the Appellate Court properly treated the trial court\u2019s actions as the effective equivalent of allowing the New York Times Company (Times), the Globe Newspaper Company, Inc., the Washington Post Company and the Hartford Courant Company (collectively, newspapers), to intervene in the withdrawn cases<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and restoring the cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>to the docket. I would conclude that the trial court\u2019s action is more properly characterized as the effective equivalent of docketing the newspapers\u2019 motions for the limited purpose of determining whether the court had jurisdiction to restore the cases to the docket. Accordingly, I believe that the cases should be remanded to the trial court for a determination as to whether the newspapers should be allowed to intervene and whether the cases should be restored to the docket. I also believe that, in making that determination, the court must consider whether the parties in the withdrawn matters relied on the permanence of the protective orders. If they did, the court should not grant the motions to intervene absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances or compelling need. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">At the April 24,2002 hearing on the emergency motion to vacate the protective orders filed by the Times, counsel for the named defendant, the Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corporation (Diocese),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> argued that because \u201cno motion was ever made to reopen or restore the case to the docket within four months, as required by [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-212a,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>the court lacked jurisdiction over the entire matter. The court responded that \u201c[t]he case, clearly, wasn\u2019t reopened pursuant to that statute, so I don\u2019t see how I have personal jurisdiction, but the question is, that\u2019s not a subject matter jurisdiction statute.\u201d Counsel for the Diocese responded that, in the absence of consent of the parties, the court would have neither personal jurisdiction nor subject matter jurisdiction. Counsel for the Times argued that \u00a7 52-212a did not apply because the court had continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>jurisdiction over the protective orders in that they were injunctive in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The court then asked counsel for the Times whether it could order the parties in the withdrawn matters to file materials in their possession with the court without having personal jurisdiction over the parties. Counsel for the Times argued that the court had ongoing jurisdiction to modify the order prohibiting the dissemination of those materials, but conceded that federal case law indicated otherwise. Counsel for the Diocese stated that the question of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to order the parties to file materials with the court was \u201canother jurisdictional issue,\u201d and argued that the court had no such jurisdiction. He further argued that the Diocese had not had an opportunity to brief the question of whether the cases could be restored to the docket and that the Times had raised the continuing jurisdiction argument for the first time at the hearing. Counsel for the Times responded that \u201cif the court would find, alter this hearing, further briefing is helpful, I would be more than happy to do that. If the suggestion is, let\u2019s go home now until jurisdiction is resolved, then I would just say that that\u2019s probably not the most efficient way to proceed, no harm, no foul, that we proceed to argue the merits and the court makes whatever decision it ultimately makes on the jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The court stated that \u201cmy impression is this is a matter of legitimate public interest that should be handled expeditiously, so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve expedited this process.\u201d The court then ruled that it had jurisdiction \u201cwith respect to what is in the clerk\u2019s office in sealed envelopes. I think, I do not have jurisdiction to order the parties to file anything, so I really don\u2019t feel that there\u2019s jurisdiction to enter that type of order.\u201d The court then reiterated that \u201cmy determination is that I do have jurisdiction, at least with respect to what\u2019s been sealed in the files.\u201d The court indicated that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>would hear the merits of the newspapers\u2019 claims immediately, but also indicated that its ruling that it had jurisdiction to hear the merits was \u201csubject to being revisited\u201d and that the parties should submit briefs on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The Diocese never filed briefs on the issue of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to restore the cases to the docket. Instead, on May 3, 2002, the Diocese filed three appeals to the Appellate Court from \u201cthe trial court\u2019s [April 24, 2002] order restoring cases to docket, after passage of more than four months since withdrawal, and creating new case file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">On May 8, 2002, the trial court issued its memorandum of decision on the merits of the emergency motion to vacate sealing orders. The court indicated that it viewed the appeals to the Appellate Court as inappropriate because it had \u201cspecifically indicated [at the April 24 hearing] that it did not have jurisdiction over the parties and <em>the court did not enter any rulings in the [twenty-three] cases.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) The court also stated it had rendered no judgment in the new \u201cfile\u201d created by the court for the purpose of addressing the newspapers\u2019 application and that it viewed the filing of the appeals and the Diocese\u2019s failure to file a brief on the jurisdictional issue \u201cas indicative of the Diocese\u2019s express waiver of the right to be heard further on the merits of the Times\u2019 application.\u201d The court then addressed the merits of the newspapers\u2019 claims. It deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>mined that the protective orders had expired at the time of settlement and granted the newspapers access to the records in all twenty-three of the withdrawn cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">On May 10, 2002, the Appellate Court ordered the parties to appear and give reason why the appeals should not be dismissed for lack of an appealable final judgment. The court also ordered a stay of all proceedings, including the trial court\u2019s May 8, 2002 order releasing the records. The Appellate Court supplemented this order on May 13, 2002, with an order directing the parties to address in their briefs on the final judgment question whether the appeals properly had been taken from the April 24, 2002 hearing or whether they should have been taken from the May 8, 2002 decision. After the hearing on these issues, the Appellate Court, on June 5, 2002, ordered that its May 10 and May 13, 2002 orders be marked \u201coff,\u201d apparently because it had determined that the trial court had not acted on the pending motions to intervene or articulated the basis for its authority to open a new file at the request of a nonparty more than 120 days after the withdrawal of the actions. Accordingly, the Appellate Court ordered the trial court to act on the motions to intervene and to articulate the basis for its authority to open a new file.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">On June 7, 2002, the trial court granted all pending motions to intervene in the case captioned <em>Application of New York Times </em>v. <em>Sealed Records, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. X06-CV-020170932-S, and denied all pending motions to intervene in the withdrawn cases. On June 13, 2002, the court issued its articulation in which it stated that it was unable to act on the motions to intervene in the withdrawn cases\u2014which never had been docketed\u2014 because the cases had not been reopened. It further stated that it had opened a \u201cnew file\u201d on the basis of its inherent powers to address complaints, applications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>and petitions that are presented to it. The court also relied on this court\u2019s decision in <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>260 Conn. 232, 246, 796 A.2d 1164 (2002), as supporting its authority to enter postjudgment orders after the expiration of the four month period prescribed by \u00a7 52-212a.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">On the basis of this history, the majority concludes that the <em>only possible </em>interpretation of the court\u2019s actions at the April 24, 2002 hearing is that the court effectively restored the cases to the docket. I disagree. Although the trial court ruled unequivocally at the April 24, 2002 hearing that it had jurisdiction over the sealed documents, its ruling that it had jurisdiction to hear arguments on the merits of the Times\u2019 claim without restoring the cases to the docket pursuant to \u00a7 52-212a clearly was <em>provisional. </em>If the issue had been briefed as requested by the court, the court might have been persuaded that it could not take any action that would affect the withdrawn cases without restoring the cases to the docket and that it had no authority to do so. The trial court\u2019s May 8, 2002 decision also should not be treated as the effective equivalent of restoring the cases to the docket because, as the majority recognizes, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to issue any ruling at that point in light of the pending appeals. Accordingly, I would conclude that the court made no determination that can be treated as the functional equivalent of restoring the cases to the docket and, therefore, that there was no appealable final judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For the same reasons, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>would also conclude that the trial court\u2019s actions cannot be treated as the effective equivalent of permitting the newspapers to intervene.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In any event, even if it is assumed that the court effectively restored the cases to the docket, I would reverse that ruling because the trial court never applied the proper standard. I believe that the trial court was required to consider whether the parties in the withdrawn cases had settled the cases in reliance on the permanence of the protective orders.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If so, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>should not have granted the motions to intervene absent a showing of some extraordinary circumstance or compelling need. The general rule is that intervention after an action has been terminated is highly disfavored and will be granted only in extraordinary cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Several courts have recognized an exception to this rule when intervention is sought for the purpose of modifying a protective order entered in the terminated action. See, e.g., <em>Pansy </em>v. <em>Stroudsburg, </em>23 F.3d 772, 778-79 (3d Cir. 1994) (court does not follow rule prohibiting intervention in terminated action where intervention is sought for purpose of modifying protective order). The rationale for this exception is that, because \u201cthe desired intervention relates to an ancillary issue and will not disrupt the resolution of the underlying merits, untimely intervention is much less likely to prejudice the parties. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 779, quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>Public Citizen </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>858 F.2d 775, 786 (1st Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1030, 109 S.

If the court determines that reliance on the permanence of the protective orders was an integral part of the settlement or disposition of the case, I believe that the court should not grant the motions to intervene absent a showing of an extraordinary circumstance or compelling need. Cf. <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission </em>v. <em>TheStreet.com, </em>273 F.3d 222, 229 (2d Cir. 2001) (when parties have relied on protective order, court should not modify order \u201cabsent a showing of improvidence in the grant of [the] order or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling need\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), quoting <em>Martindell </em>v. <em>International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp., </em>594 F.2d 291, 296 (2d Cir. 1979);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> see also <em>In re Agent Orange Product Liability Litigation, </em>821 F.2d 139, 147 (2d Cir.)

I believe that the court, in making that determination, should consider whether the parties relied on the permanence of the protective orders in reaching settlement and, if so, whether there are extraordinary circumstances or compelling needs warranting intervention.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\"> See footnote 3 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\"> For convenience, we refer to the defendants, collectively, as the Diocese.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by law and except in such cases in which the court has continuing jurisdiction, a civil judgment or decree rendered in the Superior Court may not be opened or set aside unless a motion to open or set aside is filed within four months following the date on which it was rendered or passed. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\"> The majority states that \u201cthere is no principled way\u201d to separate the court\u2019s ruling on the protective orders from the court\u2019s ruling on the documents. I disagree. As the trial court recognized, it is clear that the court must have jurisdiction over documents in its possession in the sense that the court ultimately must make the decision as to how and when to dispose of the documents. As I discuss more fully in the body of the opinion, however, if the court does not have personal jurisdiction over the parties to the withdrawn cases or determines that modifying orders entered in those cases will upset the settled expectations of the parties, I do not believe that the court has jurisdiction over those orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\"> The case relied on by the majority, <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>239 Conn. 375, 685 A.2d 1108 (1996), is distinguishable because, in that case, we determined that \u201c[t]he conclusion is inescapable that, had a formal motion to restore to the docket been presented to [the trial court, it] would have granted it.\u201d Id., 392. Nothing in the record before us in the present case leads to any such inescapable conclusion. Indeed, the trial court specifically denied that it had reopened the cases and took no action that would have required the cases to have been reopened until it issued its May 8, 2002 ruling granting the newspapers access to the sealed records, at which time it lacked jurisdiction to take any such action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\"> I agree with the majority's conclusion that, under federal law, intervention appears to be a proper procedural device for a nonparty to seek to modify a protective order, even after the action in which the order was entered has terminated. I see no differences between federal law and Connecticut law to suggest that such a procedure may not be employed here. I am concerned, however, that this procedure occasionally may give rise to practical difficulties. When, as in the present case, there are numerous parties to the underlying action and the motion to intervene is brought long after the termination of the case, it may prove impossible to locate and give notice of the motion to some of the parties. It also is not clear what the procedure for giving notice of the motion to intervene should be or how the court can be expected to give notice of hearings and rulings to parties who are no longer represented by the attorneys who appeared for them in the terminated action. I believe that the inability to give proper notice to all parties should weigh heavily against granting the motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">I also note that, in the present case, it is a mere fortuity that the parties had not retrieved and the court had not destroyed the documents before the newspapers sought to intervene. In my view, that fact should weigh against allowing intervention. If it is acceptable as a policy matter for parties to retrieve document s from the court and for the court to destroy documents at a certain point, then the same policy interests\u2014presumably those favoring stability and finality in the disposition of cases\u2014should militate against restoring the matter to the docket. The mere accident that the documents are still in the court's custody in tire present case is not a reason for treating the case differently from a case in which the parties and the court diligently fulfilled their obligations with respect to the documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\"> The Diocese represents in its brief that \u201c[i]n settling these actions, the Diocese relied upon the existence of the [protective] orders and the confidentiality that they ensured. . . .

Ed. 2d 309 (1976); <em>Crown Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Winthrop Lawrence Corp., </em>531 F.2d 76, 77 (2d Cir. 1976) (intervention after judgment is unusual and not often granted); <em>Black </em>v. <em>Central Motor Lines, Inc., </em>500 F.2d 407, 408 (4th Cir. 1974) (\u201c[intervention is ancillary and subordinate to a main cause and whenever an action is terminated, for whatever reason, there no longer remains an action in which there can be intervention\u201d); <em>Abdul-Raheem </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>672 F. Sup. 1389, 1391 (W.D. Okla. 1986) (when action is terminated, for whatever reason, there no longer remains action in which to intervene); <em>Mundt </em>v. <em>Northwest Explorations, Inc., </em>947 P.2d 827, 830 (Alaska 1997) (motions to intervene made after conclusion of litigation normally are not timely absent showing of justification); <em>In re One Cessna 206 Aircraft, </em>118 Ariz. 399, 402, 577 P.2d 250 (1978), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Associated Milk Producers, Inc., </em>supra, 116; <em>State Employees\u2019 Credit Union, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gentry, </em>75 N.C. App. 260, 264, 330 S.E.2d 645 (1985) (motions to intervene made after judgment has been rendered are disfavored and are granted only after finding of extraordinary and unusual circumstances or upon strong showing of entitlement and justification); <em>Marteg Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Review, </em>425 A.2d 1240, 1243 (R.I. 1981) (because of potential of prejudice to parties, person seeking to intervene after judgment has especially heavy burden).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\"> My research has revealed no cases in which the court has found an exception to the rule prohibiting intervention in a closed case merely because the remedy granted in the case was iryunctive in nature. Cf. <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>Gallen, </em>697 F.2d 452, 455-56 (1st Cir. 1983) (denying postjudgment motion to intervene in case in which court granted injunctive relief as, inter alia, untimely); <em>Vonage Holdings Corp. </em>v. <em>Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 03-5287 (D. Minn. January 14, 2004) (same). Thus, I believe that the majority\u2019s reliance on the rule enunciated in <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 246, that courts always have jurisdiction to effectuate their judgments, and the corollary rule that courts always have jurisdiction to modify injunctions, is misplaced. The rationale for allowing postjudgment intervention for the purpose of modifying a protective order is not that doing so will vindicate the judgment, but that doing so will <em>not affect </em>the rights of the parties as bargained for or arjjudicated before the case was terminated. Conversely, when granting the intervention will undermine the settlement or judgment, it must be denied except in an extraordinary case. Accordingly, I believe that the principle underlying <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc., </em>that the integrity of judgments should be protected, acts to <em>lim.it </em>the court\u2019s power to grant postjudgment intervention for the purpose of modifying a protective order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b262-5\"> In <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission </em>v. <em>TheStreet.com, </em>supra, 273 F.3d 224-25, the intervening plaintiff sought to intervene prior to judgment for the purpose of modifying a protective order. The District Court granted the motion to intervene and unsealed certain documents. Id., 227. On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the defendant did not challenge the intervention, but only the modification of the protective order. Id., 228. The court noted that modification should not be granted absent compelling need or extraordinary circumstances when the protective order has been relied upon. Id., 229. In my view, when intervention is sought <em>after </em>judgment, the principle cited by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals should bar not only modification, but also intervention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\"> In <em>Mokhiber </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 537 A.2d 1105-1106, the court concluded that, when secrecy is integral to settlement, the potential for inequity should affect the court\u2019s evaluation of the merits of the motion to modify a protective order, not the right to intervene. As I have indicated, however, the rationale for allowing intervention after judgment in such cases is that it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>inequitable to do so when it would not affect the litigated rights of the parties. Therefore, I believe that this is a threshold issue that must be resolved <em>before </em>the court considers the merits of the motion for modification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
