No one was charged in connection with her murder until twenty-five years later, when the defendant, Michael Skakel, a fifteen year- old neighbor of the victim at the time of her death, was arrested and charged with the crime. The case initially was brought in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters and, thereafter, transferred to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court. Thereafter, the case was tried to a jury, which found him guilty of murder in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-54a (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from which the defendant appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that: (1) his case improperly was transferred from the docket for juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court; (2) his prosecution was time barred by the five year statute of limitations for felonies that was in effect when the victim was murdered in 1975; (3) the state failed to disclose certain exculpatory evidence in violation of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), thereby depriving him of his right to a fair trial; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>(4) the state\u2019s attorney engaged in pervasive misconduct during closing argument in violation of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial; (5) the trial court improperly permitted the state to introduce into evidence the prior sworn testimony of a certain witness in violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected right of confrontation; and (6) the trial court improperly permitted the state to present evidence of several incriminating statements that the defendant made while a resident at a school for troubled adolescents in Maine. The defendant also challenges the propriety of several other evidentiary rulings of the trial court. We reject each of the defendant\u2019s claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Sometime between 6:30 and 7:30 p.m. on the evening of Thursday, October 30, 1975, the victim left her home on Walsh Lane, located in the Belle Haven section of Greenwich, with a friend, Helen lx, to play and socialize in and around the neighborhood. It was the night before Halloween, commonly referred to as \u201cmischief night,\u201d an evening when the neighborhood children were known to engage in playful mischief. The victim and lx soon were accompanied by other friends who lived nearby. Several times that night, the group stopped by the Skakel home, which was located on Otter Rock Drive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The first time they did so, the defendant was dining at the Belle Haven Club with his siblings, Rushton Skakel, Jr., Julie Skakel, Thomas Skakel, John Skakel, David Skakel and Stephen Skakel, their cousin James Dowdle,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>their tutor Kenneth Littleton, and Julie Skakel\u2019s friend Andrea Shakespeare. The Skakel group arrived home from dinner before 9 p.m., at which time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>the victim and her friends again visited the defendant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Shortly thereafter, the defendant, joined by the victim, lx and Jeffrey Byrne, a friend of the victim, entered one of the Skakel family vehicles, a Lincoln Continental, which was parked on the Skakels\u2019 side driveway, to talk and listen to music. Thomas Skakel, the defendant\u2019s then seventeen year old brother, soon joined the group. Sometime before 9:30 p.m., the group was interrupted by Rushton Skakel, Jr., and John Skakel, who needed to use the Lincoln Continental to drive Dowdle home, where they planned to watch a television program scheduled to air at 10 p.m. Consequently, Thomas Skakel, lx, Byrne and the victim exited the car. As lx began to leave the Skakel property with Byrne, she observed Thomas Skakel and the victim engaging in flirtatious horseplay at the other end of the driveway. Feeling \u201ca bit embarrassed by the flirting,\u201d lx left to go home.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The victim\u2019s mother, Dorothy Moxley, expected that the victim would be home that evening by 10:30 or 11 p.m. At about 1:30 or 2 a.m., upon discovering that her daughter had not returned home, she sent the victim\u2019s brother, John Moxley, out to look for her. Dorothy Moxley thereafter telephoned anyone who she thought might know the victim\u2019s whereabouts, including the defendant\u2019s family, whom Dorothy Moxley called several times. Dorothy Moxley\u2019s efforts to locate the victim were unsuccessful, and she eventually contacted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Greenwich police department, which dispatched an officer to the Moxley home. The officer made a missing persons report and briefly searched the surrounding area. The next morning, at about 8:30 a.m., Dorothy Moxley, believing that the victim may have fallen asleep in the Skakel family motor home that usually was parked in the Skakels\u2019 driveway, went to the defendant\u2019s house. The defendant answered the door, appearing \u201chungover\u201d and dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. The defendant informed Dorothy Moxley that the victim was not at his home, and an inspection of the motor home by a Skakel employee confirmed that she was not there either.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Later that day, at about noon, a neighborhood friend discovered the victim\u2019s dead body under a large pine tree in a wooded area on the Moxley property. The victim was lying facedown, with her pants and panties pulled down around her ankles. Forensic tests revealed that the victim had died from multiple blunt force traumatic head injuries. A large quantity of blood was discovered in two areas in a grassy region approximately seventy feet from the victim\u2019s body, with a distinct drag path leading from the pools of blood to the location where the victim\u2019s body was found. The victim likely was assaulted at or near the farther end of her circular driveway and then dragged approximately eighty feet to the pine tree under which her body subsequently was discovered. Remnants of the murder weapon, a Tony Penna six iron golf club, also were found at the crime scene. The head of the golf club and an eight inch section of its shaft were found on the circular driveway, approximately 116 feet from the area where the large accumulation of the victim\u2019s blood was found. Another piece of the shaft was discovered on the grassy area near the two large pools of blood. The remaining part of the shaft attached to the club handle never was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Harold Wayne Carver II, a forensic pathologist and the state\u2019s chief medical examiner, testified regarding the findings of the original autopsy performed by then chief medical examiner Elliot M. Gross, also a forensic pathologist. Carver stated that the victim\u2019s injuries appeared consistent with having been inflicted by a golf club. In addition to the fatal head injuries, the victim had been stabbed in the neck with a piece of the golf club shaft. According to Carver, Gross had used an ultraviolet light to detect the presence of semen on the victim\u2019s pubic region and also had taken vaginal and anal swabs. No semen was found in those areas, however. Nothing in the autopsy report indicated that the ultraviolet light had been applied to the victim\u2019s buttocks or to other parts of the victim\u2019s body. With respect to the time of death, Carver testified that the victim had been dead for some time before her body was found. He further opined that the time of death more likely was closer to 9:30 p.m. on October 30,1975, when she was last seen alive, rather than noon the following day, when her body was discovered. Because the autopsy was conducted twenty-four hours after the discovery of the victim\u2019s body, a more precise time of death could not be ascertained.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Henry Lee, a forensic scientist and the former state chief criminalist, reviewed the documents, photographs and physical evidence compiled by the investigators and performed a partial reconstruction of the crime scene. On the basis of his investigation, Lee testified as to the likely nature and sequence of events leading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>up to the victim\u2019s death. In particular, he indicated that the golf club that was used to assault and kill the victim probably had broken into pieces from the force with which the victim had been struck. This force, according to Lee, likely propelled the head of the golf club, and a piece of its shaft, over seventy feet, from the location of the fatal assault to the location inside the circular driveway where those pieces subsequently were discovered. According to Lee, the remaining piece of the golf club shaft then was used as a sharp weapon to stab the victim. Lee further testified that, in light of the amount of blood found on the inside of the victim\u2019s jeans and panties, those garments likely were pulled down before the assault occurred. Lee also stated that the absence of vertical blood drippings on the victim\u2019s shoes and jeans indicated that the victim was lying on the ground when the perpetrator inflicted the injuries to her head and neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">James Lunney, a detective with the Greenwich police department in 1975, testified that, on the day that the victim\u2019s body was discovered, he briefly visited the defendant\u2019s home and noticed a barrel containing several items, including golf clubs, in a hallway near the rear of the home. Lunney testified that one of the golf clubs, a Tony Penna four iron, later was seized from the property with the written consent of the defendant\u2019s father. Thomas G. Keegan, a captain in the detective division of the Greenwich police department in 1975, testified that an examination of the seized golf club and the golf club parts found at the crime scene revealed that the murder weapon came from the defendant\u2019s home.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>In the days and months following the victim\u2019s murder, the Greenwich police conducted numerous interviews in furtherance of its criminal investigation into the victim\u2019s death. The defendant and his siblings were among those interviewed in the early stages of that investigation. On November 15, 1975, the defendant, who was accompanied by his father, gave a tape-recorded interview to the Greenwich police at the police station. Responding to inquiries concerning his whereabouts on the night of the murder, the defendant explained that he had accompanied his brothers and Dowdle to Dowdle\u2019s home, which was about twenty minutes away, and watched the television show \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus.\u201d According to the defendant, he returned to his home around 10:30 or 11 p.m.,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and went to bed about fifteen minutes later. When asked specifically about whether he left the house after he went to his bedroom that night, the defendant responded, \u201cno.\u201d The defendant acknowledged, however, that, on other occasions, he had left his home after ostensibly retiring to his room for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In 1977, two years following the victim\u2019s murder, the defendant revealed certain feelings of guilt and remorse to Larry Zicarelli, who then was employed by the defendant\u2019s family as a driver and general handyman. While being driven by Zicarelli to an appointment in New York City, the defendant, distraught from an earlier altercation with his father, told Zicarelli that he \u201chad done something very bad\u201d and that he \u201ceither had to kill himself or get out of the country.\u201d On another occasion, Zicarelli and the defendant were stopped in traffic on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the Triborough Bridge in New York on their way home when the defendant \u201copened the [car] door, started to jump out of the car and ran to the side ... of the bridge.\u201d Zicarelli ran after the defendant and forced him back into the car. As Zicarelli was proceeding to the driver\u2019s side door, the defendant again exited the car and ran toward the other side of the bridge. Zicarelli once again hurried toward the defendant and forced him back into the car. Just before Zicarelli and the defendant arrived at the Skakel home, Zicarelli asked the defendant, \u201c[W]hy would [you] want to do what [you were] trying to do?\u201d The defendant responded that, \u201cif [you] knew what [I] had done, [you] would never talk to [me] again.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Immediately following this incident, Zicarelli terminated his employment with the Skakels.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">From 1978 to 1980, the defendant was a resident at the Elan School, a residential facility for troubled adolescents located in Poland Springs, Maine. Several former Elan residents testified about the deplorable conditions at the institution, which employed a behavioral modification approach predicated on controversial techniques of intimidation, confrontation and humiliation of its residents. As a result, Elan residents regularly endured mental and physical abuse at the hands of their peers and Elan staff members. While a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>resident at Elan, the defendant frequently was confronted and inteixogated about his involvement in the victim\u2019s murder. For example, Charles Seigen, who was enrolled at Elan with the defendant from 1978 to 1979, testified that he recalled attending two or three group therapy sessions, supervised by a staff member and typically attended by eight residents, during which the defendant was confronted about the victim\u2019s murder. According to Seigen, the defendant sometimes responded to such probing with annoyance. On other occasions, however, the defendant became veiy upset, cried and stated that he did not know if he had done it. The defendant also stated in these group sessions that, on the night of the victim\u2019s murder, he was \u201cblind drunk\u201d and \u201cstumbling.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Dorothy Rogers, another former resident of Elan, testified that, on one occasion, when she and the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>dant were talking at an Elan social function, the defendant told her that he had been drinking on the night of the murder and that he could not recall whether he was involved in the victim\u2019s death. The defendant further explained to Rogers that his family had enrolled him at Elan because they feared that he may have murdered the victim and wanted him in a location far removed from the investigating officers. Gregory Coleman, a resident at Elan from 1978 to 1980, testified about an exchange that he had had with the defendant while Coleman stood \u201cguard\u201d over the defendant following the defendant\u2019s failed escape attempt from Elan. During this conversation, the defendant confided in Coleman about murdering a girl who had rejected his advances. According to Coleman, the defendant had admitted killing the girl with a golf club in a wooded area, that the force with which he had hit her had caused the golf club to break in half, and that he had returned to the body two days later and masturbated on it. John Higgins, another former resident of Elan, recounted certain emotional admissions that the defendant had made to him while the two were on guard duty one night on the porch of the men\u2019s dormitory at Elan. In particular, Higgins testified that the defendant had told him that, on the night of the murder, there was a \u201cparty of some kind or another\u201d at the defendant\u2019s home. The defendant also told Higgins that he remembered rummaging through his garage looking for a golf club, running through the woods with the club and seeing pine trees. Higgins further stated that, as the conversation continued, the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment of his culpability in the victim\u2019s murder progressed from \u201che didn\u2019t know whether he did it\u201d to \u201che may have done it\u201d to \u201che must have done it,\u201d and finally to \u201cI did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Elizabeth Arnold and Alice Dunn, both of whom had attended Elan during the defendant\u2019s stay at the facility, also testified about certain inculpatory statements that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>the defendant had made to them. Both testified that the defendant had expressed uncertainty as to whether he or his brother had murdered the victim. Arnold also recalled a group therapy session in which the defendant, upon being questioned about the victim\u2019s murder, stated that \u201c[h]e was very drunk and had some sort of a blackout\u201d that night, that his brother had \u201cfoolfed] around\u201d with his \u201cgirlfriend,\u201d and that his brother had stolen her from him. Dunn, who graduated from Elan in 1978 and subsequently became a staff member there, testified that while she was employed at Elan, the defendant stated that he was not in \u201chis normal state\u201d on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Thereafter, in the summer of 1987, the defendant told Michael Meredith, a former Elan resident who was staying temporarily in the defendant\u2019s home, that, on the night of the victim\u2019s murder, he had climbed a tree on the Moxley property and masturbated in the tree while watching the victim through her window. According to Meredith, he first learned of the victim\u2019s murder in this conversation. The defendant also told Meredith that while he was in the tree, he saw his brother Thomas Skakel walk across the Moxley property toward the victim\u2019s home but that Thomas Skakel had not seen him in the tree. The defendant related a similar story to Andrew Pugh, a close childhood friend, when the two saw one another in 1991. The defendant had expressed a desire to renew their friendship, which gradually had faded following the victim\u2019s murder. In an effort to ease Pugh\u2019s concerns about the defendant\u2019s involvement in the victim\u2019s death, the defendant assured Pugh that he did not kill the victim but mentioned that he had masturbated in a tree on the night that she was murdered. Pugh understood that the tree to which the defendant referred was the tree under which the victim\u2019s body was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The most descriptive account of the defendant\u2019s activities on the night of the murder came in 1997 from an taped-recorded conversation between the defendant and Richard Hoffman, a writer who was collaborating with the defendant on a book about the defendant\u2019s life. On that tape, the defendant explained to Hoffman that, earlier in the evening of the victim\u2019s murder, he had invited the victim, who was seated with the defendant in his father\u2019s car, to accompany him to his cousin\u2019s house to watch the Monty Python Flying Circus television show. The victim declined the invitation because of her curfew, and the two instead made plans to go \u201ctrick or treating\u201d the next night. The defendant thereafter left for Dowdle\u2019s home with his brothers Rushton Skakel, Jr., and John Skakel, as well as Dowdle.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The defendant told Hoffman that, after returning to his own home from Dowdle\u2019s house, he had walked through the house in search of various people. Upon observing that the door to his sister\u2019s room was closed, he had \u201cremember[ed] that [his sister\u2019s friend, Shakespeare] had gone home . . . .\u201d He then indicated that he had gone into \u201cthe master bedroom [but] there was nobody there, the [television] was on but nobody was there.\u201d The defendant went upstairs to bed shortly thereafter, but he became \u201chomy\u201d and decided to spy on a \u201clady\u201d who lived on Walsh Lane. The defendant then \u201csnuck out\u201d of his house and went to this person\u2019s home, hoping to see her through her window. Unsuccessful in that endeavor, he thought, \u201c[f]uck this . . . Martha likes me, I\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll go get a kiss from Martha.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The defendant then proceeded to the victim\u2019s home, climbed a tree near the victim\u2019s front door and masturbated in the tree for about thirty seconds. Shortly thereafter, \u201ca moment of clarity came into [his] head,\u201d and the defendant climbed down from the tree and walked back home. On his way home, he threw rocks into the dark, repeatedly yelling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>\u201cWho\u2019s in there?\u201d He and his friends previously had done this while shooting BB guns into the dark. The next morning, the defendant awoke to \u201c[Dorothy] Moxley saying \u2018Michael . . . have you seen Martha?\u2019 \u201d The defendant thought to himself, \u201cOh my God, did they see me last night?\u201d At that moment, the defendant told Hoffman, he \u201cremember[ed] just having a feeling of panic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The state also adduced evidence establishing that the defendant, who was infatuated with the victim, had grown resentful of her flirtatious friendship with his older brother Thomas Skakel, whom he considered his nemesis. According to Pugh, who in 1975 was friendly with the victim and the defendant, the defendant had \u201ctold [him] that he liked Martha quite a bit and had a crush on her.\u201d Pugh also testified that the defendant had told him that \u201che would have liked to have a relationship with her.\u201d Pugh testified that he had observed the defendant and the victim engage in \u201chorseplay, roughhousing, fooling around . . . [and] kissing one time in the [Skakel family motor home].\u201d With respect to Thomas Skakel\u2019s relationship with the victim, Jacqueline Wettenhall O\u2019Hara, a neighborhood friend of the victim, recounted observing flirtatious conduct between the victim and Thomas Skakel in the months leading up to the victim\u2019s death. Entries recorded in the victim\u2019s diary in the two months preceding her murder disclosed the victim\u2019s friendship with the defendant and Thomas Skakel, and also revealed the sometimes flirtatious nature of her relationship with Thomas Skakel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In addition, lx testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>fied that she had observed the victim and Thomas Skakel engaging in flirtatious horseplay the last time she saw the victim alive. Moreover, one of the sneakers that the victim was wearing when her body was recovered had the name \u201cTom\u201d written on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The defendant raised an alibi defense at trial. In particular, he claimed that the victim had been murdered at approximately 10 p.m. on October 30, 1975,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and that he was at Dowdle\u2019s home, some twenty minutes away from the murder scene, at that time. The defendant also raised a third party culpability defense, pointing to Littleton as a likely perpetrator of the victim\u2019s murder. In fact, Littleton, who had been hired as a part-time tutor by the Skakel family, had taken up residence at the Skakel home on October 30, 1975, the day that the victim was last seen alive, and had slept there with the Skakel children that night. Littleton testified that, after returning home from dinner at 9 p.m., he remained at the house all night, stepping outside briefly at approx<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>imately 9:30 p.m. only to investigate a disturbance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition, testimony adduced by the defendant revealed that Littleton, who began to manifest serious psychiatric and behavioral problems in the years following the murder, may have made a statement, several years after the killing, in which he implicated himself in the crime. Littleton emphatically denied that he had had anything to do with the victim\u2019s death, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of murder. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s posttrial motions and, thereafter, sentenced the defendant to a period of incarceration of twenty years to life imprisonment. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the court, <em>Dennis, J. </em>(juvenile court), improperly transferred his case from the docket for juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court. Specifically, the defendant claims that the juvenile court improperly: (1) failed to require a complete investigation into the defendant\u2019s personal history and background in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7\u00a7 17-60a<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>and 17-66,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which, at all times relevant to this appeal, governed the transfer of a juvenile matter to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court; (2) relied on the current regulations of the department of children and families (department) in concluding that there was no state institution suitable for the care and treatment of the defendant within the meaning of \u00a7 17-60a (2); and (3) failed to explore the existence of facilities outside the state suitable for the care and treatment of the defendant. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the juvenile court improperly transferred his case to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Because the defendant was fifteen years old at the time of the offense, he initially was charged as a delinquent in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters. The state subsequently filed a motion under \u00a7 17-60a to transfer the defendant\u2019s case to the regular criminal docket. The juvenile court there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>after conducted a hearing to determine whether, pursuant to \u00a7 17-60a, there was reasonable cause to believe that the defendant had committed the murder with which he had been charged. Following the presentation of evidence on that issue, the juvenile court concluded that there was reasonable cause to believe that the defendant had committed that offense.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The juvenile court also issued an order pursuant to \u00a7 17-60a directing that an investigation be conducted in accordance with \u00a7 17-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">After the investigation was complete, the juvenile court reconvened the defendant\u2019s statutorily mandated transfer hearing for the purpose of addressing the remaining elements of \u00a7 17-60a. At the hearing, the parties elicited testimony from the supervisor of juvenile probation, Joseph Pacquin, who had been assigned to conduct the investigation required by \u00a7 17-60a. Pacquin acknowledged that his investigation had focused primarily on the possible availability of a state facility that would be suitable for the defendant, and not on the defendant\u2019s personal, family and educational background. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 17-66. Pacquin gave several reasons for failing to investigate the defendant\u2019s personal history and family background, notwithstanding the dictates of \u00a7 17-66, including the fact that the defendant was forty years of age at the time of the transfer hearing. With specific regard to the defendant\u2019s education, Pacquin testified that he had not looked into that facet of the defendant\u2019s background because \u00a7 17-66 does not require such a review unless the child is or legally should be attending school. Additionally, Pacquin testified that he had not sought a physical or mental examination of the defendant because the court had not ordered such an examination to be conducted pursuant to \u00a7 17-66. With respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>possible residential and treatment alternatives, Pacquin testified that the department is the state agency solely responsible for the detention and treatment of juveniles, and that the department cannot lawfully accept for placement persons over the age of eighteen. Pacquin\u2019s testimony in this regard was consistent with the testimony of Judith Kallen, a program director employed by the department, who testified at the defendant\u2019s reasonable cause hearing that department regulations prohibited the commitment or placement of individuals over the age of eighteen into the care and custody of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">In support of his objection to the state\u2019s motion to transfer, defense counsel adduced testimony from Clinton Roberts, a former state probation officer and president of Alternative Sentencing Consultants, Inc., a private sentencing consulting firm. Roberts indicated that, contrary to the testimony of Pacquin, there is a private, nonprofit facility located in Newtown that admits both juveniles and adults, and that the Newtown facility might serve the residential treatment needs of the defendant. On cross-examination, however, Roberts conceded that the facility operated primarily as a substance abuse treatment center, and he could not say whether the facility was appropriate for the defendant. Defense counsel also elicited testimony that the state juvenile justice system occasionally places juveniles in programs located in other states, but that these placements are reserved for juveniles with special needs that cannot be met in programs located within the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">In a memorandum of decision issued after the conclusion of the hearing, the juvenile court noted that, under the particular circumstances presented, the provisions of \u00a7 17-66 \u201care not totally applicable . . . .\u201d The court further observed that department regulations prohibit the placement with the department of anyone over the age of eighteen. The court; also noted that, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 17-68 (c)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> provides for the commitment of a child directly to a hospital or other appropriate institution if the child is determined to be mentally ill, the issue of mental illness never was raised at any time by the defendant, and the record otherwise was devoid of any indication that the defendant suffered from any such illness. The court thereafter concluded that \u201cthere [was] no available or suitable state institution designed for the care and treatment of children to which the juvenile court could commit the . . . forty year old [defendant] that would be suitable for his care and treatment, should he be adjudicated delinquent for the murder of [the victim],\u201d and that \u201cthe facilities of the adult criminal division of the Superior Court afford[ed] and provide [ed] a more effective setting for the disposition of this case, and the institutions to which the adult criminal division of the Superior Court may sentence a defendant [were] more suitable for the care and treatment of this [defendant], should he be found guilty of the murder of [the victim].\u201d Accordingly, the juvenile court transferred the case to the regular criminal docket.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Before addressing the defendant\u2019s claims, we set forth the legal principles that govern our resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>those claims. \u201cThere is no dispute that adjudication as a juvenile rather than prosecution as an adult carries significant benefits, chief among which are a determination of delinquency rather than criminality . . . confidentiality . . . limitations with respect to sentencing . . . erasure of files . . . and isolation from the adult criminal population.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel C., </em>245 Conn. 93, 103, 715 A.2d 652 (1998). Accordingly, \u201ca juvenile in whom a liberty interest in his or her juvenile status has vested, has a substantial liberty interest in the continuation of that juvenile status and that the juvenile cannot and should not be deprived of that status without [proper] procedural protections . . . .\u201d Id.; see also <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U.S. 541, 557, 86 S. Ct. 1045, 16 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1966) (juvenile court\u2019s failure to conduct full investigation, as required by statute, prior to juvenile\u2019s transfer to regular criminal docket resulted in deprivation of liberty without due process of law). Importantly, however, \u201c[a]ny [special treatment] accorded to a juvenile because of his [or her] age with respect to proceedings relative to a criminal offense results from statutory authority, rather than from any inherent or constitutional right. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel C., </em>supra, 104. Accordingly, in the present matter, to the extent that the defendant possesses a liberty interest in his juvenile status, that interest derives from, and is limited by, the statutory provisions governing the transfer, adjudication and commitment of juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">We turn next to the relevant statutory provisions. Under the statutory scheme in effect in 1975,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the juvenile court had original and exclusive jurisdiction \u201cover all proceedings concerning uncared-for, neglected, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>dependent and delinquent children within this state . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 17-59. Statutes governing the authority and proceedings of the juvenile court define a \u201cchild\u201d as \u201cany person under sixteen years of age,\u201d who may be found \u201cdelinquent\u201d by the court if, inter alia, the child \u201chas violated any federal or state law or municipal or local ordinance . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 17-53. With respect to a child who has been referred to the juvenile court because that child allegedly had committed the crime of murder, \u00a7 17-60a authorizes the court to transfer the child to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court provided that the child was at least fourteen years of age when the murder was committed. Such a transfer is not permitted by \u00a7 17-60a, however, unless an investigation of the child\u2019s personal and family background has been completed in accordance with \u00a7 17-66, and the juvenile court has determined, after a hearing, that there is reasonable cause to believe that: (1) the child has committed the crime charged; (2) there is no available state institution designed for the care and treatment of children that would be suitable for the child, or community safety requires that the child be detained in a custodial setting for a period extending beyond majority age; and (3) the facilities of the Superior Court provide a more effective setting for disposition of the case and the adult institutions to which the child may be sentenced are more appropriate for his or her care or treatment. With respect to the mandated investigation, General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 17-66 mandates that the required investigation include an examination of \u201cthe parentage and surroundings of the child, his age, habits, and history, and . . . also an inquiry into the home conditions, habits and character of his parents or guardians.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The defendant first claims that his transfer from the docket for juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket was improper because Pacquin did not conduct a complete investigation into the defendant\u2019s personal and family background as required by \u00a7\u00a7 17-60a and 17-66. We agree with the defendant that Pacquin\u2019s investigation did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 17-66, and that, normally, a failure to meet those requirements would render invalid the transfer of any case from juvenile court to the regular criminal docket pursuant to \u00a7 17-60a. It also is clear, however, that a \u00a7 17-66 investigation is mandated by \u00a7 17-60a solely for the purpose of assisting the juvenile court in its determination of whether, under the circumstances, there exists a suitable state institution to which the child may be committed in preference to the facilities otherwise available for the treatment and punishment of adult offenders. In the present case, however, testimony adduced at the transfer hearing established that the age of the then forty year old defendant foreclosed his adjudication in juvenile court because the department was prohibited by state regulations<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> from accepting for placement anyone over the age of eighteen, regardless of whether such placement would involve a custodial or noncustodial setting. Thus, the juvenile court necessarily would have concluded, irrespective of the results of a complete investigation in accordance with \u00a7 17-66, that the defendant\u2019s age mandated the transfer of his case to the regular criminal docket. Consequently, Pacquin\u2019s failure to complete the investigation contemplated by \u00a7 17-66, and the juvenile court\u2019s failure to consider facts that might have been brought to light upon the completion of that investigation, had no bearing on that corut\u2019s ultimate decision under \u00a7 17-60a to transfer the defendant\u2019s case to the regular criminal docket.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The defendant next claims that the juvenile court improperly relied on regulations of the department that were in effect at the time of the transfer hearing in concluding that there was no state institution suitable for his care and treatment. In particular, the defendant claims that the juvenile court\u2019s reliance on the regulations prohibiting the placement with the department of anyone over the age of eighteen thwarts the will of the legislature as expressed in the statutory scheme that was in effect in 1975, because that age limitation on placements with the department was not a part of the statutory scheme at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 17-60a provides in relevant part that no transfer shall be valid unless the juvenile court finds that \u201cthere is no state institution designed for the care and treatment of children <em>to which [the] court may commit such child </em>which is suitable for his care or treatment . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) We agree with the juvenile court that this statutory provision \u201cnarrowly focus [es] on the availability and suitability of state institutions \u2018designed for the care and treatment of children\u2019 to which the juvenile court <em>has authority to \u2018commit such child.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>added.) Thus, under \u00a7 17-60a, the commitment alternatives available to the juvenile court are those alternatives available at the time of the transfer hearing.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Because the juvenile court properly considered those commitment options, and not the commitment options that might have been available in 1975, the defendant\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">We also disagree with the defendant\u2019s final claim, namely, that the juvenile court improperly failed to explore the suitability of placing the defendant in an out-of-state institution. Under General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 17-420, the commissioner of children and families (commissioner) may transfer \u201cany person committed, admitted or transferred to the department . . . to any private agency or organization within or without the state under contract with the department,\u201d provided that certain conditions are satisfied. Thus, a necessary prerequisite to the out-of-state transfer of a juvenile found to be delinquent is that the juvenile first must be \u201ccommitted, admitted or transferred\u201d to the care and custody of the department. As the trial court properly determined, however, under state law, no person over the age of eighteen may be committed to the care and custody of the department. Because the defendant could not be placed with the department, he could not be transferred by the commissioner to an out-of-state institution and, accordingly, the juvenile court properly declined to explore out-of-state placement alternatives for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendant has failed to establish that the juvenile court improperly transferred his case to the regular criminal docket. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>that transfer was proper, the state\u2019s prosecution of the defendant as an adult was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly concluded that his prosecution for murder was not barred by the applicable statute of limitations. We disagree, albeit on the basis of an analysis that differs from that of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The following factual and procedural background is necessary to our resolution of this claim. The defendant was arrested on January 19, 2000, for the October, 1975, murder of the victim and, as we have explained; see part I of this opinion; his case was transferred from the docket for juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information on the ground that his prosecution for murder was barred by the five year limitation period of General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 54-193,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the statute of limitations that was in effect at the time of the victim\u2019s murder. The trial court, <em>Kavanewsky, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that the five year limitation period of \u00a7 54-193, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>facially applicable to all felonies, including murder and all other class A felonies, was inapplicable to the crime of murder.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The trial court acknowledged that \u00a7 54-193 contains no express exception for murder and that this court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>189 Conn. 346, 350, 456 A.2d 305 (1983), had concluded that the 1976 amendment to \u00a7 54-193; Public Acts 1976, No. 76-35, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 76-35); which excepted all class A felonies, including murder, from the purview of \u00a7 54-193, did not apply retroactively to offenses committed prior to April 6, 1976, the effective date of P.A. 76-35. The trial court further recognized that, in <em>Paradise, </em>we ultimately had determined, on facts materially identical to the facts of the present case, that the prosecution of the defendants for murder in that case was barred by the five year limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193, the same version of \u00a7 54-193 that was in effect at the time of the murder of the victim in the present case. The trial court explained, however, that our determination in <em>Paradise </em>must be considered in light of two subsequent cases, <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 460, 497 A.2d 974 (1985),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golino, </em>201 Conn. 435, 438-39, 518 A.2d 57 (1986), the holdings and rationale of which, in the trial court\u2019s view, lead to the conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>five year limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193 was inapplicable to the crime of murder.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The trial court therefore denied the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>dant\u2019s motion to dismiss, and the case proceeded to trial, following which a jury found the defendant guilty of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In support of his claim that the trial court improperly declined to dismiss the information as time barred, the defendant maintains that this case is both factually and legally indistinguishable from <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 346, which, the defendant asserts, is therefore controlling and requires the dismissal of the information in the present case. The state asserts that we should overrule our holding in <em>Paradise </em>that P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, did not apply retroactively, a conclusion that was predicated on our determination that criminal statutes of limitation presumptively have prospective applicability only. See id., 351-53. Alternatively, the state maintains that the trial court correctly concluded that <em>Paradise </em>does not bar the state\u2019s prosecution of the defendant for murder because our determination in <em>Paradise </em>that the murder prosecutions in that case were time barred rested on a faulty assumption, namely, that the five year limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193 applied to murder as well as to all other felonies. See footnote 30 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Upon reconsideration, we are persuaded that <em>Paradise </em>was wrongly decided. In particular, we conclude that we were misguided in establishing a presumption that, in the absence of a contrary indication of legislative intent, an amendment to a criminal statute of limitations is not to be applied retroactively. As we explain more fully hereinafter, we are convinced that, with respect to those offenses for which the preamendment limitation period has not expired, it is far more likely that the legislature intended for the amended limitation period to apply to those offenses. In view of the fact that the five year limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193 had not expired with respect to the October, 1975 murder of the victim when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the 1976 amendment to that statutory provision became effective, we conclude that P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, is the operative statute of limitations for purposes of this case.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Because, under P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, there is no time period within which murder and other class A felonies must be prosecuted, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">We begin our analysis of this issue with a brief overview of the pertinent statutory provisions. The defendant was convicted of murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a, which, in 1975, specified that the offense \u201cis punishable as a class A felony unless it is a capital felony and the death penalty is imposed as provided by section 53a-46a.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-54a (c). Because the defendant was not charged with capital murder,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> his offense was punishable as a class A felony, which, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-35 (b) (1), carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. At the time of the offense in October, 1975, General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 54-193 provided in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be prosecuted . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>for any crime or misdemeanor of which the punishment is or may be imprisonment . . . except within five years next after the offense has been committed . . . .\u201d In 1976, however, the legislature amended \u00a7 54-193 to provide: \u201cNo person shall be prosecuted for any offense, except a capital felony or a class A felony for which the punishment is or may be imprisonment in excess of one year, except within five years next after the offense has been committed .... There shall be no limitation of time within which a person may be prosecuted for a capital felony or a class A felony.\u201d P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We next turn to a review of our relevant prior precedent construing legislative amendments to criminal statutes of limitation, beginning with <em>Paradise. </em>In <em>Paradise, </em>the defendants, Brian Ellis and Wilmer Paradise, were charged, in 1981, with murder, felony murder and kidnapping, all class A felonies, in connection with a murder that had been committed in 1974. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 347. The trial court dismissed the charges against Ellis and Paradise; id., 348; concluding that their prosecutions were barred by the five year limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193, which was in effect at the time of the offenses. See id., 350. On appeal, the state claimed that P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, which excluded class A felonies, including murder, from the purview of the five year limitation period of \u00a7 54-193, was procedural in nature and, therefore, had retroactive applicability absent a contrary legislative intent. Id. In support of its position, the state relied primarily on \u201can extensive body of civil case law\u201d; id.; in which this court had held that \u201cprocedural statute [s] . . . ordinarily will be applied retroactively without a legislative imperative to the contrary . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Id., 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>We declined, however, to decide whether the 1976 amendment was substantive or procedural. Id., 353. Although we reaffirmed \u201cthe continued vitality and utility of the principle that procedural statutes will be applied retrospectively absent a contrary legislative intent in the civil field\u201d; id., 351; we concluded that this tenet was inapplicable to criminal statutes in light of the principle that such statutes \u201cmust be strictly construed.\u201d Id., 352. In accordance with this principle, we concluded that \u201ccriminal statutes are not to be accorded retrospective effect absent language clearly necessitating such a construction . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Id., 353. After observing that \u00a7 54-193 must be strictly construed because it is \u201cpenal in nature\u201d; id., 352; we explained that, because the language of P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, did not indicate \u201ca clear legislative intent that the statute have a retrospective effect\u201d; id., 353; it could not be applied retroactively to conduct that had preceded its effective date. See id. In view of the fact that all of the parties in <em>Paradise </em>had proceeded on the assumption that the five year limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193 applied to all felonies, including murder, we affirmed the judgment of the trial court dismissing the information as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>228 Conn. 393, 398-99, 636 A.2d 804 (1994), we expressly reaffirmed our conclusion in <em>Paradise </em>that criminal statutes of limitation are accorded prospective effect only. The sole issue presented in <em>Crowell </em>was whether the seven year limitation period of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 54-193a was applicable to the state\u2019s prosecution of the defendant, Martin Crowell, for offenses relating to his alleged sexual molestation of a child when the amendment establishing that seven year limitation period became effective after the commission of the charged offenses but prior to the expiration of the preamendment five year limitation period. Id., 394-95. In urging this court to overrule <em>Paradise, </em>the state maintained that our holding in that case was \u201cbased on the faulty premise that a statute of limitations that extends a previous limitation period before that previous period has expired is \u2018retroactive.\u2019 \u201d Id., 398. Specifically, the state claimed that, \u201cto be \u2018retroactive,\u2019 a statute must affect a \u2018vested right\u2019 that existed on the date it took effect. Because a defendant has no right to a statute of limitations defense while the original limitation period remains unexpired, a new statute of limitations that takes effect before the original limitations period has expired does not affect a vested right and therefore cannot be retroactive.\u201d Id. We rejected the state\u2019s claim, noting that \u201c[t]he holding in <em>Paradise </em>was based firmly on the principle that criminal statutes must be strictly construed . . . [and] not, as the state claims, on a technical misunderstanding of the nature of retroactivity.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 399. Because there was nothing in the language of the amendment to indicate that the extended limitation period had retrospective effect, we concluded that the trial court properly had followed the dictates of <em>Paradise </em>in dismissing as time barred the charges against Crowell.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The next case relevant to our inquiry is <em>In re Daniel H., </em>237 Conn. 364, 678 A.2d 462 (1996), in which this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>court addressed the issue of whether a 1994 amendment to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127, the mandatory juvenile transfer statute, had retroactive applicability. See id., 366-67. We concluded that the 1994 amendment, which eliminated the right to an immediate appeal from a court order transferring a juvenile matter to the regular criminal docket, had prospective effect only. See id., 378. In so concluding, we explained, first, that our resolution of the issue was guided by the canon of strict construction applicable to criminal statutes.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Id., 373. In contrast to <em>Paradise, </em>however, that conclusion did not end our analysis. After noting that, under General Statutes \u00a7 55-3,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> substantive changes to the law presumptively have prospective application only; id., 372; we stated that \u201c[t]he first step in ascertaining whether the 1994 amendment was intended to apply retroactively ... is to decide whether the removal of a juvenile\u2019s ability to appeal immediately from a court\u2019s transfer order is a substantive change in the law.\u201d Id., 373. We answered that question in the affirmative and, therefore, concluded that the change presumptively had prospective applicability only. Id., 375-76. We further determined that, because the presumption of prospective applicability was not rebutted by a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary, the amendment did not apply retroactively. Id., 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Thereafter, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Parra, </em>251 Conn. 617, 619-20, 741 A.2d 902 (1999), we considered whether a statutory amendment limiting the time within which a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>may move to vacate a judgment and withdraw a previously entered plea properly was applied to crimes committed prior to the effective date of the amendment. The defendant, Juan Parra, relied on <em>Paradise </em>in support of his claim that the amendment could not operate retroactively because it lacked explicit statutory language requiring such an application. Id., 622. Although we acknowledged that <em>\u2018Paradise </em>created a bright line rule on matters involving the statutory construction of criminal statutes . . . namely, that the language of the statute itself must clearly necessitate a retrospective construction for one to be given\u201d; (citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted) id., 624; we nevertheless reasoned that \u201cthe breadth of [our] holding in <em>Paradise\u201d; </em>id.; is limited to \u201ccertain types of criminal statutes, such as a statute of limitations for the prosecution of a crime . . . .\u201d Id., 625. In reaching this conclusion, we noted that, in <em>In re Daniel H., </em>we previously had \u201cmade clear that there are instances in which . . . <em>Paradise . . </em>. [does not prevent] this court from considering the legislative history of a criminal statute in determining whether such a statute should be applied retroactively.\u201d Id. As we explained in <em>Parra, </em>\u201c[i]n <em>In re Daniel H., </em>we determined whether a statutory amendment eliminating the right to an immediate appeal from an order transferring a juvenile matter to the regular criminal docket applied retroactively. . . . While we specifically held that the statutory amendment at issue was a criminal statute that affected substantive rights . . . we, nonetheless, looked to its legislative history to determine whether the amendment should be applied retroactively. . . . Thus, we did not limit our analysis to a determination of whether the language of the amendment clearly necessitated a retrospective application, but, rather, used the normal tools of statutory construction to determine the legislature\u2019s intent on the issue of retroactive application of the amendment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>We further explained that the amendment at issue in <em>Parra </em>fell within \u201cthose other areas of the criminal process ... to which the holding of <em>Paradise </em>does not extend\u201d; (citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted) id., 626; because the provision \u201caffect[ed] an area of the criminal process far removed from the actual criminal conduct for which the defendant originally was charged. For example, [the amendment did] not change the elements of the crime with which the defendant was charged, alter the elements of his defense to that crime or make more burdensome the punishment for that crime, after its commission.\u201d Id. Accordingly, we concluded that we were not restricted to the language of the amendment in deteimining whether the legislature had intended that it be applied retroactively; rather, the \u201cproper test . . . [was] whether the language of [the amendment] or its legislative history . . . indicates that the legislature clearly and unequivocally intended for the statute to apply retroactively.\u201d Id., 627. We noted, finally, that, because the pertinent legislative histoiy evinced a clear legislative intent to apply the amendment retroactively; id., 628; it was not necessary to determine whether the amendment was substantive or procedural. Id., 628 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">With this background in mind, we now reexamine our conclusion in <em>Paradise </em>that P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, has prospective effect only. As we explain hereinafter, that conclusion is fundamentally flawed because it is founded solely on the mistaken premise that the rule of strict construction bars the presumption of retroactivity otherwise applicable to amendments to statutes of limitation. In view of our determination that our conclusion in <em>Paradise </em>rested on a faulty premise, we are obliged to take a fresh look at the issue of whether a criminal statute of limitations should be applied retroactively or prospectively in circumstances such as those of the present case, in which the legislature has not clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>evinced an intent one way or the other. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that, with respect to those criminal offenses for which the applicable preamendment statute of limitations period has not yet expired, an amendment to that statute of limitations is presumptively retroactive. Because the limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193 had not expired with respect to the offense in the present case prior to the effective date of the 1976 amendment, and because the legislature did not evince an intent to have the amendment apply prospectively only, we conclude that P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, provides the operative statute of limitations in the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Of course, our ultimate objective in construing statutes is to discern and effectuate the apparent intent of the legislature. E.g., <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Manhattan Auto Financial Corp., </em>276 Conn. 1, 7, 882 A.2d 597 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>263 Conn. 1, 12, 818 A.2d 1 (2003). Although that objective is the same for both civil and criminal statutes, we have recognized that certain principles of statutory construction bear special relevance to our interpretation of criminal statutes, one of which is the rule of strict construction. Thus, it has long been held that, \u201cunless a contrary interpretation would frustrate an evident legislative intent, criminal statutes are governed by the fundamental principle that such statutes are strictly construed against the state.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 69, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004). Indeed, the rule, which \u201cis perhaps not much less old than construction itself\u2019; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiltberger, </em>18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95, 5 L. Ed. 37 (1820); finds its roots in Sir Edward Coke\u2019s opinion in <em>Hey don\u2019s Case, </em>76 Eng. Rep. 637 (Ex. 1584); see M. Radin, \u201cA Short Way with Statutes,\u201d 56 Harv. L. Rev. 388, 389 (1942); and, in this state, it can be traced back to at least 1821. See <em>Daggett </em>v. <em>State, 4 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Conn. 60, 63 (1821). Succinctly stated, \u201c[t]he purpose of the rule of strict construction is ... to enable the people of the State to know clearly and precisely what acts the legislature has forbidden under a penalty, that they may govern their conduct accordingly, and to make sure that no act which the legislature did not intend to include will be held by the courts within the penalty of the law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Faro, </em>118 Conn. 267, 274, 171 A. 660 (1934); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Zazzaro, </em>128 Conn. 160, 167, 20 A.2d 737 (1941). \u201cStrict construction is a means of assuring fairness to persons subject to the law by requiring penal statutes to give clear and unequivocal warning in language that people generally would understand, concerning actions that would expose them to liability for penalties and what the penalties would be.\u201d 3 J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction (6th Ed. Singer 2001) \u00a7 59:3, p. 142. \u201cAnother reason for strict construction is to protect the individual against arbitrary discretion by officials and judges. ... A related argument is to the effect that since the power to declare what conduct is subject to penal sanctions is legislative rather than judicial, it would risk judicial usurpation of the legislative function for a court to enforce a penalty whe[n] the legislature had not clearly and unequivocally prescribed it.\u201d Id., pp. 144-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The requirement that criminal statutes shall be strictly construed is therefore predicated on two fundamental principles. First, the public is entitled to fair notice of what the law forbids. Second, legislatures and not courts are responsible for defining criminal activity. Neither of these two principles is advanced, however, by applying the rule of strict construction to criminal statutes of limitation. Because the statutory limitation period has nothing to do with the scope or reach of the substantive offense, neither the public\u2019s right to fair warning of the legislatively proscribed conduct nor the risk that the offense will be enlarged judicially beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>the contemplation of the legislature is implicated by the statutory limitation period. Consequently, applying the rule of strict construction to criminal statutes of limitation would be \u201c[t]o enforce the rule beyond its purpose [and, thereby] to exalt technicalities above substance.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Faro, </em>supra, 118 Conn. 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Indeed, because criminal statutes of limitation do not define criminal conduct, establish the punishment to be imposed or otherwise burden defendants, such statutes are not truly penal at all. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>George, </em>430 Mass. 276, 279, 717 N.E.2d 1285 (1999) (\u201c[statutes of limitation do not define criminal conduct, are not penal statutes, and may not be subject to . . . strict construction against the [state]\u201d). In fact, such statutes represent an expression of \u201clegislative grace\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodgson, </em>108 Wash. 2d 662, 667, 740 P.2d 848 (1987), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Fied </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>485 U.S. 938, 108 S. Ct. 1117, 99 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1988); for \u201cthey are a surrendering by the sovereign of its right to prosecute\u201d; id.; after a specified period of time has elapsed from the acts constituting the offense. Put differently, because such statutes inure to the <em>benefit </em>of criminal defendants, it is illogical to characterize those statutes as penal for purposes of determining the proper approach to their construction. -</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">In <em>Paradise, </em>we did not explain our conclusion that \u00a7 54-193 is penal in nature, and, therefore, that that provision must be strictly construed. Indeed, we cited only one case, namely, <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1976-6), </em>33 Conn. Sup. 34, 358 A.2d 691 (1976) <em>(Anonymous), </em>to support that conclusion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 352. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1976-6), </em>supra, 39, a judge of the Court of Common Pleas<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> concluded, also without analysis or explanation, that \u00a7 54-193 is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>penal statute and, therefore, subject to the canon of strict construction. In support of its assertion that \u00a7 54-193 is a penal statute, the court in <em>Anonymous </em>relied solely on <em>State </em>v. <em>Bello, </em>133 Conn. 600, 53 A.2d 381 (1947), a case in which this court affirmed the conviction of the defendant, Riggs Bello, for gambling. See id., 601, 604. In <em>Bello, </em>however, we applied the canon of strict construction in connection with our interpretation of the antigambling statute itself, not any applicable statutory limitation period. See id., 604. Thus, the cases that provide the basis for our conclusion in <em>Paradise </em>that \u00a7 54-193 is a penal statute to which the canon of strict construction applies simply do not support that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Contrary to our determination in <em>Paradise, </em>\u00a7 54-193, like other criminal statutes of limitation, is <em>remedial </em>in nature. \u201cThe purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain fixed period of time following the occurrence of those acts the legislature has decided to punish by criminal sanctions. Such a limitation is designed to protect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have become obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment because of acts in the far-distant past. Such a time limit may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law enforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity.\u201d <em>Toussie </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U.S. 112, 114-15, 90 S. Ct. 858, 25 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1970). Indeed, it is because of the remedial nature of criminal statutes of limitation that they \u201care to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>In <em>Paradise, </em>the rule of strict construction provided the sole basis for our determination that P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, has prospective effect only. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 352. Because we are not persuaded that that rule applies to criminal statutes of limitation, the validity of our holding in <em>Paradise </em>necessarily is suspect.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Even if we were to assume that the rule is applicable to such statutes, however, we see no reason why its application would lead inexorably to the presumption against retroactivity that we announced in <em>Paradise. </em>Indeed, as we had recognized long before <em>Paradise, </em>\u201c[t]he rule of strict construction does not require that the narrowest technical meaning be given to the words employed in a criminal statute in disregard of their context and in frustration of the obvious legislative intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Faro, </em>supra, 118 Conn. 274. In other words, the principle of strict construction should not be applied in a manner that is \u201chostile\u201d to an evident legislative pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>pose; <em>State </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>103 Conn. 138, 141, 130 A. 96 (1925); or in a way that is contrary to common sense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 70. Thus, as a leading commentator on statutory construction has explained, \u201c[t]he rule of strict construction is not the only factor which influences the interpretation of [criminal] laws. Instead, the rule is merely one among various aids which may be useful in determining the meaning of penal laws. This has been recognized time and again by the decisions, which frequently enunciate the principle that the intent of the legislature, or the meaning of the statute, must govern and that a strict construction should not be permitted to defeat the policy and purposes of the statute.\u201d 3 J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 59:6, pp. 159-61. At a minimum, therefore, our reliance in <em>Paradise </em>on the canon of strict construction, to the exclusion of all other considerations, casts serious doubt on the validity of our conclusion.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reject as logically unfounded our holding in <em>Paradise </em>that the canon of strict construction requires the conclusion that P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, has prospective effect only. We therefore must determine whether our conclusion in <em>Paradise </em>nevertheless was correct. We conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">It is axiomatic that, \u201c[w]hether to apply a statute retroactively or prospectively depends upon the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>of the legislature in enacting the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>250 Conn. 674, 695, 741 A.2d 873 (1999). In seeking to discern that intent, \u201c[o]ur point of departure is ... \u00a7 55-3,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> which ... we have uniformly interpreted ... as a rule of presumed legislative intent that statutes affecting substantive rights shall apply prospectively only. . . . The Legislature only rebuts this presumption when it clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Vermilyn Brown, Inc., </em>232 Conn. 780, 786, 657 A.2d 616 (1995); see also <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 316, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997). As a corollary to this principle, we also \u201chave presumed that procedural or remedial statutes are intended to apply retroactively absent a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <em>Miano </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>218 Conn. 170, 175, 588 A.2d 189 (1991); accord <em>In re Daniel H., </em>supra, 237 Conn. 372-73. \u201cWhile there is no precise definition of either [substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>tive or procedural law], it is generally agreed that a substantive law creates, defines and regulates rights while a procedural law prescribes the methods of enforcing such rights or obtaining redress.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>273 Conn. 573, 593, 872 A.2d 385 (2005). Moreover, the \u201cretroactive application of a law occurs only if the new or revised law was not yet in effect on the date that the relevant events underlying its application occurred.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Faraday, </em>268 Conn. 174, 197, 842 A.2d 567 (2004); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>264 Conn. 327, 421-22, 824 A.2d 778, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1055, 124 S. Ct. 819, 157 L. Ed. 2d 708 (2003); <em>In re Daniel H., </em>supra, 377. Finally, in determining the retrospective applicability of any criminal statute, we must be mindful that the ex post facto clause of the United States constitution<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> bars any state from enacting \u201cany law [that] imposes a punishment for an act [that] was not punishable at the time [that] it was committed; or imposes additional punishment to that then prescribed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 28, 101 S. Ct. 960, 67 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1981). Although \u201ca law enacted after expiration of a previously applicable limitations period violates the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause when it is applied to revive a previously time-barred prosecution\u201d; (emphasis in original) <em>Stogner </em>v. <em>California, </em>539 U.S. 607, 632-33, 123 S. Ct. 2446, 156 L. Ed. 2d 544 (2003); because it deprives the defendant of a fully vested defense to prosecution, the constitution \u201cdoes <em>not </em>prevent the State from extending time limits . . . for prosecutions not yet time barred.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Application of these considerations leads unmistakably to the conclusion that, subject to the limitations of the ex post facto clause, criminal statutes of limitation, including P. A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, should be accorded a presumption of retroactivity. Indeed, we long have held that civil statutes of limitation are presumed to apply retroactively because they do not affect or alter substantive rights. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Caton, </em>224 Conn. 483, 488, 619 A.2d 844 (1993); see, e.g., <em>Jones Destruction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Upjohn, </em>161 Conn. 191, 195-96, 286 A.2d 308 (1971). As we have explained, \u201c[a] statute of limitations is generally considered to be procedural, [and therefore presumptively retroactive] especially whe[n] the statute contains only a limitation as to time with respect to a right of action and does not itself create the right of action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>201 Conn. 16, 22, 513 A.2d 660 (1986); accord <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Caton, </em>supra, 488. \u201cThis is so because . . . the limitation merely acts as a bar to a remedy otherwise available.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>supra, 22. The fundamental purpose and effect of criminal statutes of limitation are the same as civil statutes of limitation; as the United States Supreme Court has stated in noting the similarities between such statutes, they both \u201crepresent a legislative judgment about the balance of equities in a situation involving the tardy assertion of otherwise valid rights: [t]he theory is that even if one has a just claim it is unjust not to put the adversary on notice to defend within the period of limitation and that the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 322-23 n.14, 92 S. Ct. 455, 30 L. Ed. 2d 468 (1971). Because both criminal and civil statutes of limitation are predicated on the same general policy considerations and perform the same basic functions, it makes sense to treat them the same for the purpose of determining whether they give rise to a presumption of retroactive or prospective applicability, at least in the absence of good reason not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">We know of no such reason. Unless the statute of limitations that was in effect when a crime was committed has expired with respect to that crime, a defendant accused of that crime has no right to have that limitation period applied to his conduct. Succinctly stated, \u201c[statutes of limitations are measures of public policy only. They are entirely subject to the will of the legislature, and may be changed or repealed altogether in any case [in which] a right to acquittal has not been absolutely acquired by the completion of the [original] period of limitation. Such a statute is an act of grace in criminal prosecutions. The State makes no contract with criminals at the time of the passage of acts of limitations that they shall have immunity from punishment if not prosecuted within the statutory period.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Isaacs, </em>37 Ill. 2d 205, 229, 226 N.E.2d 38 (1967); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Petrucelli, </em>156 Vt. 382, 383, 592 A.2d 365 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodgson, </em>supra, 108 Wash. 2d 668 (\u201cuntil the [criminal] statute [of limitations] has run it is a mere regulation of the remedy . . . subject to legislative control\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In such cases, a defendant also has no legitimate expectancy interest in the application of that limitation period: defendants do not engage in criminal conduct with an eye on the then applicable statute of limitations, and, even if they did, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>society, for obvious reasons, is not prepared to recognize any such reliance as reasonable.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>The canon of statutory construction that procedural or remedial statutes are to be applied retroactively in the absence of a contrary legislative intent is grounded in the presumption that the legislature intended that result because such retroactive application will most broadly and comprehensively effectuate the legislative policy embodied in the enactment without upsetting any settled rights or reliance interests. Labeling a statute as substantive or procedural, however, will not always resolve the fundamental issue of legislative intent.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Thus, we have recognized that \u201c[t]he test of whether a statute is to apply retroactively, absent an express legislative intent, is not a purely mechanical one and even if it is a procedural statute, which ordinarily will be applied retroactively without a legislative imperative to the contrary, it will not be applied retroactively if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>considerations of good sense and justice dictate that it not be so applied.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>200 Conn. 734, 741, 517 A.2d 610 (1986); see also <em>In re Daniel H., </em>supra, 237 Conn. 372-73 (\u201c[Although we have presumed that procedural or remedial statutes are intended to apply retroactively absent a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary ... a statute which, in form, provides but a change in remedy but actually brings about changes in substantive rights is not subject to retroactive application. . . . The rule is one of obvious justice and prevents the assigning of a quality or effect to acts or conduct which they did not have or did not contemplate when they were performed.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Considerations of good sense and justice dictate that a court give retroactive effect to a criminal statute of limitations, absent an indication of a contrary legislative intent, when, as in the present case, that retroactive application does not revive a prosecution already time barred by a previous limitation period. As we noted previously, statutes of limitation \u201crepresent legislative assessments of relative interests of the State and the defendant in administering and receiving justice\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>supra, 404 U.S. 322; and as such, they reflect the legislature\u2019s considered judgment as to the \u201cdifficult balance between the public demand for justice and the [interest] of the individual to be free from the continual threat of prosecution for past misconduct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 458 n.18. When the legislature implements that policy decision by modifying, through amendment, a preexisting criminal limitation period, we can conceive of no logical reason why the legislature would not have intended for that new limitation period to apply to <em>all </em>offenses that were not previously time barred under the original provision. Put differently, it is unreasonable to presume that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>legislature would have intended that the exact same crimes shall be subject to different limitation periods merely because of the fortuity that one defendant committed the crime the day <em>before </em>the enactment of the amendment to the limitation period while another defendant committed the identical crime the day <em>after </em>the enactment of that amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Furthermore, as we observed in <em>Paradise, </em>the language of P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, sheds no light on whether the legislature intended for that amendment to have retroactive effect. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 353. In <em>Paradise, </em>however, we limited our retroactivity analysis to the language of the amendment; see id.; and did not consider the amendment\u2019s legislative history. To the extent that the legislative history may be deemed to have a bearing on that issue, it is scant. As we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golino, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 445, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 460, however, Senator David H. Neiditz, the sponsor of the amendment, indicated that it was intended to clarify existing law. See 19 S. Proc., Pt. 1, 1976 Sess., p. 341. It is well established that legislation deemed to be clarifying generally is accorded retroactive effect. E.g., <em>Andersen Consulting, LLP </em>v. <em>Gavin, </em>255 Conn. 498, 517, 767 A.2d 692 (2001); <em>Toise </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>243 Conn. 623, 628, 707 A.2d 25 (1998). Although not conclusive, Senator Neiditz\u2019 comment supports our determination that P. A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, has retroactive applicability.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Moreover, our conclusion that an amendment to a criminal statute of limitations is presumptively applicable to crimes not previously barred by the original limitation period is supported by the considerable weight of authority. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Sample, </em>161 Cal. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>3d 1053, 1058, 208 Cal. Rptr. 318 (1984); <em>State v.

Such a statute, however, cannot operate to revive offenses that were barred at the time of its enactment, since that would make the statute ex post facto.\u201d). Although several courts have concluded otherwise; see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>512 F.2d 105, 106 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>Stoner v. State, </em>418 So. 2d 171, 178 (Ala. Crim.

Manucy </em>v. <em>Wadsworth, </em>293 So. 2d 345, 347 (Fla. 1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Merolla, </em>100 Nev. 461, 464, 686 P.2d 244 (1984); the courts in those cases relied solely on the faulty premise that the result was dictated by the canon of strict construction. Because those cases, like <em>Paradise, </em>are founded on the same rote and erroneous application of that interpretative principle\u2014 we have not found one such case in which the court engaged in any meaningful analysis of the issue\u2014they suffer from the same logical infirmity as <em>Paradise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Our conclusion today also resolves a tension between our mode of analysis in <em>Paradise </em>and the approach to the construction of statutes in the criminal realm that we have employed more recently in cases such as <em>In re Michael S., </em>258 Conn. 621, 784 A.2d 317 (2001), <em>State </em>v. <em>Parra, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 617, and <em>In re Daniel H., </em>supra, 237 Conn. 364. In each of those latter cases, we expressly recognized that the focus of our inquiry was the presumed intent of the legislature, and we thereafter proceeded to identify various relevant interpretative aids, <em>including </em>the canon of construction that procedural statutes cany a presumption of retroactivity, as a means to that fundamental end. See, e. <em>g., In re Michael S., </em>supra, 627-29; <em>In re Daniel H., </em>supra, 372-73, 376. In <em>Paradise, </em>by contrast, our statutory interpretation was guided solely by the rule of strict construction, an approach that, as we have explained, was unduly cramped and formalistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Moreover, in <em>Parra, </em>we acknowledged that the rule that we had announced in <em>Paradise </em>does not extend to those areas of the criminal process that bear only a remote connection to the criminal conduct for which the defendant was charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Parra, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 626. By way of illustration, we noted that the amendatory provision at issue in <em>Parra </em>did \u201cnot change the elements of the crime with which the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>was charged, alter the elements of his defense to that crime or make more burdensome the punishment for that crime, after its commission.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Id. The same can be said of criminal statutes of limitation because they also do not purport to define or regulate criminal conduct in any way. We therefore see no reason why a criminal limitation period should not be included among those provisions that, although a part of our system of criminal laws, nevertheless carry a presumption of retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful, of course, of the doctrine of stare decisis, which \u201ccounsels that a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it. . . . Stare decisis is justified because it allows for predictability in the ordering of conduct, it promotes the necessary perception that the law is relatively unchanging, it saves resources and it promotes judicial efficiency. ... It is the most important application of a theory of decisionmaking consistency in our legal culture and it is an obvious manifestation of the notion that decisionmaking consistency itself has normative value.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>St. George </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>264 Conn. 538, 553-54 n.16, 835 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>A.2d 90 (2003). Stare decisis, however, \u201cis not an end in itself. . . . Experience can and often does demonstrate that a rule, once believed sound, needs modification to serve justice better. . . . The flexibility and capacity of the common law is its genius for growth and adaptation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brocuglio, </em>264 Conn. 778, 793, 826 A.2d 145 (2003). Indeed, \u201c[i]f law is to have current relevance, courts must have and exert the capacity to change a rule of law when reason so requires.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vakilzaden, </em>251 Conn. 656, 663, 742 A.2d 767 (1999). \u201c[Thus] [t]his court . . . has recognized many times that there are exceptions to the rule of stare decisis.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">We also acknowledge that, \u201c[i]n assessing the force of stare decisis, our case law has emphasized that we should be especially cautious about overturning a case that concerns statutory construction. . . . Despite this reluctance, however, we have, on occasion, overruled cases that have involved the interpretation of a statute. . . . Thus the fact that there is preexisting case law on point is not, in and of itself, determinative of the issue presently before us.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 538, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002). It is important to note, moreover, that the holding of <em>Paradise </em>was considerably more far-reaching than our conclusion therein that P.A. 76-35 has prospective effect only: we also held, in the exercise of our common-law authority, that <em>all </em>criminal statutes of limitation are to be applied prospectively unless the language of the statute clearly expresses a contrary intent.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The breadth of our holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>in Paradise\u2014involving, as it does, a common-law rule of statutory construction\u2014necessarily tempers our traditional reluctance to upset the settled interpretation of a particular statute.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Because \u201ca judicious reconsideration of precedent cannot be as threatening to public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>faith in the judiciary as continued adherence to a rule unjustified in reason . . . [we are confident that] [r]espect for the process of adjudication [will] be enhanced, not diminished, by our ruling [in the present case].\u201d <em>Moragne </em>v. <em>States Marine Lines, </em>398 U.S. 375, 405, 90 S. Ct. 1772, 26 L. Ed. 2d 339 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">To summarize, the rationale of <em>Paradise </em>does not withstand careful analysis. Although we will not lightly reverse long-standing precedent, we are unwilling to compound the error that we made in <em>Paradise </em>by approving it again today. Our responsibility to reconsider prior decisions of this court when a party has so requested, together with our firm conviction that <em>Paradise </em>was wrongly decided, prevent us from doing so. We conclude, therefore, that an amendment to a criminal statute of limitations applies to a crime committed prior to the enactment of the amendment, in the absence of a clear expression of legislative intent to the contraiy, as long as the preamendment limitation period had not yet expired when the amendment became effective. Because there is no indication that the legislature intended that P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, was to have prospective effect only, that amendment, contrary to our conclusion in <em>Paradise, </em>applies retroactively to crimes that were committed before its effective date but for which the preamendment limitation period had not yet expired. Consequently, P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, applies to the October, 1975 murder of the victim. Because the defendant had no vested statute of limitations defense prior to the enactment of P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, and because that provision excludes all class A felonies, including murder, from its five year limitation period, the state\u2019s prosecution of the defendant for the victim\u2019s murder was not time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The defendant next claims that the state improperly withheld certain exculpatory evidence, namely, a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>posite drawing of a man observed walking near the crime scene on the evening of October 30, 1975, and two reports prepared by a state investigator profiling Kenneth Littleton and Thomas Skakel as potential suspects. The defendant further claims that the state\u2019s failure to disclose that evidence deprived him of his right to a fair trial in violation of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 83, and its progeny. We reject each of these claims, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The following facts and procedural history are necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim that the state violated his rights under <em>Brady </em>by failing to disclose the composite drawing. On May 21, 2001, the defendant filed a pretrial motion for disclosure and production, requesting, inter alia, that the state disclose any \u201c [ijnformation and/or material which is exculpatory in nature,\u201d including \u201c[pjhotographs, composite sketches or other media replications that depict the likeness or physical attributes of [any] alleged perpetrator of this crime.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The state, which had indicated that it was adopting an open file policy for purposes of the case, did not object to this particular request, and, on August 15,2001, the trial court issued an order requiring that the state comply with this and all other discovery requests to which the state had not objected. In accordance with its open file policy and the court\u2019s order pertaining to discovery, the state provided the defendant with numerous reports and documents relating to the investigation of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">One such report states that, on October 31, 1975, investigating officers searching the general vicinity of the murder scene were approached by special officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Charles Morganti, Jr. Morganti informed the officers that he had been on special duty patrol of the Belle Haven neighborhood the previous evening when, at about 10 p.m., he observed a white male walking in a northerly direction on Field Point Road. Morganti then observed the man turn onto Walsh Lane. Morganti approached the individual and asked him where he was going. The individual replied that he lived on Walsh Lane and that he was going home. Morganti further reported to the officers that he obseived the man again, a few minutes later, walking northbound on Otter Rock Drive, just north of the Walsh Lane intersection.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">A second such report reflects the fact that Morganti was interviewed by the police again the following day. That report states that Morganti had agreed to \u201cappear at the [d]etective [b]ureau for the purpose of putting [together] a composite picture of the subject that he had observed on Field Point [Road] near Walsh [Lane] on Thursday, [October 30, 1975].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Another police report indicates that, on November 5, 1975, the police interviewed Carl Wold, a resident of Walsh Lane in the Belle Haven neighborhood. Wold informed the police that, at about 7:20 p.m. on October 30, 1975, he went out for his nightly walk. According to Wold, he walked east on Walsh Lane, turned right onto Field Point Road and then turned south toward Field Point Circle.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> He recalled having a short conversation with an officer at the Field Point police booth and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>later, on his way home, being stopped by a special police officer on Field Point Road, just south of the Walsh Lane intersection. This officer had inquired of Wold where he was headed, and Wold responded that he was returning to his home on Walsh Lane. Wold further stated that he returned home at about 8 p.m. and remained there for rest of the evening.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Wold denied walking on Otter Rock Drive that evening.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Approximately nineteen years later, on October 8, 1994, Inspector Frank Garr of the office of the state\u2019s attorney interviewed Morganti again.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The written report of that interview reflects that Morganti informed Garr that James F. Muiphy, a private investigator who had been retained by the Skakel family, had contacted him and questioned him about the \u201cincident involving the individual [that Morganti had] stopped on Field Point Road, in Belle Haven\u201d on the evening of October 30,1975. Morganti also told Garr that he saw that person walking north on Field Point Road at approximately 8 p.m. that evening. Morganti further stated that he was replacing a fallen road stanchion just north of the residence of Cynthia Bjork on Otter Rock Drive sometime between 9:30 and 10 p.m. that evening when, from a distance of approximately one hundred yards, he observed the same individual \u201cwalking in a northerly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>direction through the front yard of a residence on Otter Rock Drive, across from the Skakel residence.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The report also states that, at the time of the original police investigation of the victim\u2019s murder, \u201cMorganti reported the entire episode to the [police] investigators and assisted in the making of a composite sketch of the individual. A complete investigation into the matter was instigated, and it was determined that the individual was . . . Carl Wold.\u201d The report further states that Garr, who was accompanied by Murphy and, apparently, Morganti, then proceeded to the location on Otter Rock Drive where Morganti recalled having observed the individual for a second time on the evening of October 30, 1975.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Following the jury verdict and shortly before sentencing, the defendant, on August 26,2002, filed an amended motion for a new trial and request for an evidentiary hearing,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> claiming, inter alia, that the state had violated his rights under <em>Brady </em>by failing to make a timely disclosure of a composite drawing of the individual who Morganti had observed on the evening of October 30,1975.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In support of his claim, the defendant asserted that the state had not provided him with a copy of that drawing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>until August 21, 2002,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and that the drawing was significant because it tended to buttress his third party culpability defense. In particular, the defendant asserted that the composite drawing bore a strong resemblance to Littleton, a former suspect in the victim\u2019s murder whom the defendant, in support of his third party culpability defense, had identified as a likely perpetrator. The defendant farther maintained that, although the state had concluded that Wold was the person who Morganti had observed near the crime scene at or near the time of the victim\u2019s murder, discrepancies in Wold\u2019s and Morganti\u2019s statements as to when Morganti saw Wold cast doubt on the state\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The trial court heard argument on the defendant\u2019s motion on August 28, 2002, the same day that the sentencing hearing commenced. At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion, defense counsel represented that, despite the state\u2019s open file policy in the case, the composite drawing was not among the materials that the state had made available to the defendant\u2019s trial counsel prior to trial.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Defense counsel further represented that the state had provided the defendant\u2019s trial counsel with 1806 pages of discovery in connection with the case.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">During the argument, the trial court asked the defendant\u2019s trial counsel whether he had received, prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>trial, the 1975 investigative report that refers to Morganti\u2019s willingness to participate in the creation of a composite drawing, and the 1994 investigative report that refers to a completed composite drawing. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel answered in the affirmative with respect to both reports. At the conclusion of the argument, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and for an evidentiary hearing on that motion.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant renews his claim that he was deprived of a fair trial by virtue of the state\u2019s failure to produce the composite drawing prior to trial.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim begins with the pertinent standard, set forth in <em>Brady </em>and its progeny, by which we determine whether the state\u2019s failure to disclose evidence has violated a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. In <em>Brady, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 87. In <em>Strickler </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1999), the United States Supreme Court identified the three essential components of a <em>Brady </em>claim, all of which must be established to warrant a new trial: \u201cThe evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\u201d Id., 281-82; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>254 Conn. 441, 452, 758 A.2d 824 (2000) (\u201c[t]o establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, the defendant must show that [1] the government suppressed evidence, [2] the suppressed evidence was favorable to the defendant, and [3] it was material [either to guilt or to punishment]\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Under the last <em>Brady </em>prong, the prejudice that the defendant suffered as a result of the impropriety must have been material to the case, such that \u201cthe favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Kyles </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 435, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995). The trial court concluded that the defendant had failed to demonstrate either that the composite drawing was suppressed or that it was material. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the defendant cannot show that the state suppressed the composite drawing for purposes of <em>Brady. </em>Consequently, we need not, and, therefore, do not, reach his claim concerning the materiality prong of the <em>Brady </em>test.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>For purposes of this appeal, we presume that the state did not provide the defendant with a copy of the drawing prior to August 21, 2002.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> To the extent that the state failed to do so, that failure constituted a violation of the open file policy to which the state had announced it would adhere in the case.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> That fact alone, however, is not dispositive of the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the suppression component of <em>Brady </em>because it is well established that \u201cevidence is not considered to have been suppressed within the meaning of <em>the Brady doctrine if the defendant or his attorney either knew, or should have known, of the essential facts permitting him to take advantage of [that] </em>evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>63 F.3d 1200, 1208 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1165, 116 S. Ct. 1056, 134 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1996); accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Zichettello, </em>208 F.3d 72, 103 (2d Cir. 2000), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Lysaght v. United States, </em>531 U.S. 1143, 121 S. Ct. 1077, 148 L. Ed. 2d 954 (2001); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>LeRoy, </em>687 F.2d 610, 618 (2d Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1174, 103 S. Ct. 823, 74 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1983). The rationale underlying this exception to the state\u2019s disclosure obligation under <em>Brady </em>is obvious: <em>Brady </em>is designed to assure that the defendant is not denied access to exculpatory evidence known or available to the state but unknown or unavailable to him. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>LeRoy, </em>supra, 619; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ruggiero, </em>472 F.2d 599, 604 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 939, 93 S. Ct. 2772, 37 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1973). It is not intended either to relieve the defense of its obligation diligently to seek evidence favorable to it or to permit the defense to close its eyes to information likely to lead to the discovery of such evidence. Thus, the composite drawing will not be deemed to have been suppressed by the state, notwithstanding the open file policy in effect in this case, if the defendant or the defendant\u2019s trial counsel reasonably was on notice of the drawing\u2019s existence but nevertheless failed to take appropriate steps to obtain it. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>LeRoy, </em>supra, 618-19 (defendant cannot prevail under <em>Brady </em>if he was on notice of essential facts that would have enabled him to take advantage of exculpatory evidence but he failed to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">We agree with the finding of the trial court that, in the present case, the defendant or his trial counsel clearly was on notice of the existence of the composite drawing. First, the 1975 investigative report refers to the fact that Morganti had agreed to return to police headquarters to assist in the preparation of a composite drawing of the person he had observed in the vicinity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>of the crime scene on the evening of October 30, 1975. Second, the 1994 investigative report states that Morganti had \u201cassisted in the making of a composite sketch of [that] individual.\u201d Thus, as the defendant had noted in the memorandum that he filed with the trial court in support of his amended motion for a new trial, \u201c[t]he circumstances surrounding the preparation of the sketch are provided in the police reports prepared during the investigation.\u201d Finally, the state provided the defendant and his trial counsel with those reports during discovery, and the defendant\u2019s trial counsel acknowledged that he was aware of them. The defendant or his trial counsel, therefore, had actual notice of the existence of the composite drawing and, consequently, the defendant was obliged to supplement his general <em>Brady </em>request with a specific request for that particular piece of evidence.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Moreover, the defendant was well aware of Morganti\u2019s potential significance as a witness long before trial. Indeed, Murphy, the defendant\u2019s investigator, interviewed Morganti in 1994 and, together with Garr and Morganti, went to the location where Morganti had observed the individual who the defendant contends may have been Littleton. It is well known, of course, that police investigators routinely use composite drawings to aid in identifying potential suspects, and the defendant\u2019s investigator, who had unfettered access to Morganti, had every opportunity to ask Morganti if he had assisted the police in creating one.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The defendant asserts that it is unreasonable to conclude that the 1975 and 1994 investigative reports were sufficient notice of the existence of the composite drawing because those reports were \u201cburied\u201d among 1806 pages of other documents produced by the state. This argument founders on the acknowledgment of the defendant\u2019s own trial counsel that he was aware of the two reports. Moreover, the defendant makes no claim that the reports were disclosed late or that he or his trial counsel otherwise did not have ample time, opportunity or resources to consider them.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The defendant also contends that, notwithstanding the existence of the 1975 and 1994 reports, he did not have adequate notice of the exculpatory nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>composite drawing. This claim is predicated on the defendant\u2019s dual assertion that: (1) he could not have known the exculpatory value of the drawing until he saw it and compared it to a photograph of Littleton; and (2) the 1994 report indicated that, in the view of the police, the person depicted in the drawing was Wold, who was not a suspect in the victim\u2019s murder. Neither of these assertions is reason to excuse the defendant\u2019s failure to have requested the drawing. The defendant had a duty to request the composite drawing because it <em>was potentially </em>exculpatory, irrespective of what the state may have thought about the drawing\u2019s import. In other words, the defendant could not wait until the completion of the trial to ascertain the value of the drawing to his defense; rather, he was obligated to obtain that evidence and to evaluate its utility prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The defendant further argues that he cannot be faulted for failing to make a specific request for the composite drawing, despite the references to the drawing in the reports he did receive, because he was entitled to conclude that, in light of the state\u2019s open file policy, the state would have produced the drawing if it existed. In support of this contention, the defendant cites a number of cases that have articulated the general principle that a defendant normally may rely on the government\u2019s representation that it has made full disclosure of information to which the defendant is entitled under <em>Brady. </em>E.g., <em>Strickler </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 284; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>supra, 63 F.3d 1207-1208. In each of those cases, however, the court also indicated that defense counsel had no reason to know that the government\u2019s disclosure was less than complete. <em>See Strickler v. Greene, </em>supra, 284; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>supra, 1208. In the present case, by contrast, the defendant or his trial counsel had actual notice of the existence of the allegedly exculpatory evidence, yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>failed to notify the state that it had not provided them with a copy of it. The defendant has cited no case, and we are aware of none, in which a defendant had notice of the existence of potentially exculpatory evidence but nevertheless was excused by the court from taking reasonable steps to obtain it. We, too, decline to endorse such an approach because there simply is no reason why a defendant who is aware of such evidence should not be required to seek it at a point in time when any potential constitutional infirmity arising from the state\u2019s failure to provide the evidence can be avoided without the need for a new trial.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s contention that he reasonably believed that his responsibility to obtain <em>Brady </em>material ended with the state\u2019s announcement of an open file policy is belied by the record. In particular, long after that announcement, the defendant filed two supplemental written requests for the disclosure of exculpatory evidence under <em>Brady. </em>One such request was made during jury selection, the other shortly after the commencement of trial, and each was considerably more specific than the defendant\u2019s initial <em>Brady </em>request.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> It is apparent, in light of those supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>requests, that the defendant knew of his continuing responsibility to identify and seek exculpatory material under <em>Brady </em>despite the state\u2019s open file policy. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682-83, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985) (\u201cthe more specifically the defense requests certain evidence, thus putting the prosecutor on notice of its value, the more reasonable it is for the defense to assume from the nondisclosure that the evidence does not exist\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the facts fully support the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant failed to establish that the state suppressed the composite drawing within the meaning of <em>Brady. </em>Consequently, the defendant cannot prevail on his claim that he is entitled to a new trial by virtue of the state\u2019s failure to provide him with a copy of the composite drawing prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The defendant also contends that the trial court improperly rejected his contention that the state had violated his rights under <em>Brady </em>by failing to provide him with two reports, authored by state investigators, profiling Littleton and Thomas Skakel as possible suspects. We also reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">The factual and procedural background relevant to this claim may be summarized as follows. On May 13, 2002, John F. Solomon, a former supervisory inspector with the office of the state\u2019s attorney in the judicial district of Fairfield, testified outside the presence of the jury concerning issues that were raised in a motion then pending before the court. During his testimony, Solomon referred to a copy of a report that he had prepared in connection with the investigation of the victim\u2019s murder. Solomon characterized that report, which he wrote in 1992, as a profile of Littleton summarizing why, at the time the report was written, Littleton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>was considered a suspect. Immediately after Solomon referred to the report, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel requested a copy, to which the court responded: \u201cNot right now. You are talking about examining the witness.\u201d At that same proceeding, the state elicited testimony from Solomon indicating that he had prepared a similar profile of Thomas Skakel, who, at one time, also was a suspect in the victim\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The defendant failed to renew his request for those reports before the conclusion of the trial, and his original motion for a new trial, which was timely filed on June 12, 2002,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> did not refer to the two reports. The defendant did raise the issue, however, in his amended motion for a new trial, which was filed on August 26, 2002, claiming that the state had withheld the profiles of Littleton and Thomas Skakel in violation of its obligation under <em>Brady </em>to disclose exculpatory evidence. At the August 28,2002 hearing on the defendant\u2019s amended motion for a new trial, the state asserted that the defendant\u2019s claim was time barred because it had not been raised until long after the expiration of the five day period for the filing of such motions prescribed by Practice Book \u00a7 42-54,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> and just prior to the sentencing hearing that also was scheduled to commence on that same day. The state also maintained that the two reports were internal office documents and, therefore, exempt from discovery under Practice Book \u00a7 40-14<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>work product doctrine,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> and that it had turned over to the defendant all of the factual information contained in the reports prior to trial, in accordance with the court\u2019s discoveiy order. After reviewing the two reports in camera, the trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim, concluding that: (1) the defendant had failed to renew his request for the reports during trial; (2) the claim otherwise was untimely because it had not been made within the five day period specified by Practice Book \u00a7 42-54, and the defendant had proffered no justification for the untimely claim; and (3) the reports appeared to be work product that is exempt from discovery under Practice Book \u00a7 40-14.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The court also noted that it had no reason to question the state\u2019s representation that the state had provided the defendant with all of the data contained in the two reports during pretrial discovery. Because the discovery documents containing those data had not been filed with the court, however, the court also observed that it had not conducted an independent review of the documents to confirm the accuracy of the state\u2019s representation. The court further indicated that, in light of that fact, its rejection of the defendant\u2019s claim did not rest on the state\u2019s contention that the defendant previously had been provided with all of the factual information contained in the two reports. Finally, at the conclusion of the hearing and after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>court had denied the defendant\u2019s amended motion for a new trial, the defendant requested permission to file with the court the 1806 pages of documents that the state had turned over to him during pretrial discovery.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s request, and the documents were marked for identification only.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Although we also have no reason to doubt the state\u2019s representation that it had provided the defendant, in advance of trial, with all of the data contained in the two reports, that representation also need not be the basis for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Rather, we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim on the ground that the defendant had failed to raise it in a timely manner under Practice Book \u00a7 42-54. Even though the defendant became aware of the two reports during trial, he did not raise a <em>Brady </em>challenge to the state\u2019s failure to provide him with the reports until two and one-half months after the five day limitation period of Practice Book \u00a7 42-54 had expired. The defendant provided the trial court with no reason for the delay, and he has not offered one on appeal. Moreover, because the defendant did not provide the court and the state with copies of the 1806 pages of discovery documents until after the hearing on the defendant\u2019s amended motion for a new trial, the court could not ascertain, prior to ruling on the defendant\u2019s claim, whether, as the state had maintained, the data contained in those discovery documents had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>been provided to the defendant prior to trial. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The defendant next claims that the state\u2019s use of the prior testimony of Gregory Coleman violated his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this claim. Coleman, a former resident of the Elan School, testified for the state at the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing in April, 2001. Coleman testified that, one night in 1978, while Coleman and the defendant were residents at Elan, the defendant told Coleman that he had killed the victim with a golf club. Coleman, a heroin addict who acknowledged that he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms during his probable cause hearing testimony, was subject to cross-examination at that hearing. Coleman died in August, 2001, prior to the defendant\u2019s trial. At trial, the state, over the objection of the defendant, introduced into evidence a transcript of Coleman\u2019s probable cause hearing testimony under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (l).<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>\u201cWith respect to the principles that govern application of the hearsay rule in criminal cases, [a]n out-of-court statement offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay. ... As a general rule, such hearsay statements are inadmissible unless they fall within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\u201cBeyond [applicable] evidentiary principles, the state\u2019s use of hearsay evidence against an accused in a criminal trial is limited by the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment. . . . The sixth amendment to the constitution of the United States guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be confronted with the witnesses against him. This right is secured for defendants in state criminal proceedings. <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, [403] 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965). . . . [T]he primary interest secured by confrontation is the right of cross-examination. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974). . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">\u201cIn defining the specific limits of the confrontation clause, the United States Supreme Court consistently has held that the confrontation clause does not erect a per se bar to the admission of hearsay statements against criminal defendants. ... At the same time, [although . . . hearsay rules and the [confrontation [c]lause are generally designed to protect similar values, [the court has] also been careful not to equate the [confrontation [c]lause\u2019s prohibitions with the general rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay statements. . . . The [c]onfrontation [c]lause, in other words, bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">\u201cTraditionally, for purposes of the confrontation clause, all hearsay statements were admissible if (1) the declarant was unavailable to testify, and (2) the statement bore adequate indicia of reliability. <em>Ohio </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980). . . . [H]owever, the United States Supreme Court [subsequently] overruled <em>Roberts </em>to the extent that it applied to testimonial hearsay statements. See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004). In <em>Crawford, </em>the court concluded that the reliability standard set forth in the second prong of the <em>Roberts </em>test is too amorphous to prevent adequately the improper admission of core testimonial statements that the [confrontation [c]lause plainly meant to exclude. . . . The court held, therefore, that such testimonial hearsay statements may be admitted as evidence against an accused at a criminal trial only when (1) the declarant is unavailable to testify, and (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">\u201cIn so concluding, the court drew a distinction between testimonial hearsay statements and those deemed nontestimonial. Where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design to afford the [sjtates flexibility in their development of hearsay law\u2014as does <em>Roberts, </em>and as would an approach that exempted such statements from [confrontation [c]lause scrutiny altogether. ... In other words, nontestimonial hearsay statements may still be admitted as evidence against an accused in a criminal trial if it satisfies both prongs of the <em>Roberts </em>test, irrespective of whether the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">\u201cAlthough the court declined to define the terms testimonial and nontestimonial, it considered three formulations of th[e] core class of testimonial statements .... The first formulation consists of ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent\u2014that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>sonably expect to be used prosecutorially .... The second formulation consists of extrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions .... Finally, the third formulation consists of statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial .... The court did not adopt any one particular formulation, noting that [t]hese formulations all share a common nucleus and then define the [clause's coverage at various levels of abstraction around it.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>275 Conn. 785, 815-18, 882 A.2d 604 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The testimony at issue in the present case, namely, Coleman\u2019s prior probable cause hearing testimony, falls squarely within <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>core class of testimonial evidence. Accordingly, the confrontation clause bars the state\u2019s use of that testimony unless Coleman was unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine Coleman at the probable cause hearing. Coleman\u2019s unavailability, due to his death, is undisputed. With respect to the defendant\u2019s prior opportunity to cross-examine Coleman, our review of the record of Coleman\u2019s probable cause hearing testimony indicates that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel questioned Coleman extensively, underscoring Coleman\u2019s struggle with drug addiction, his prior acts of misconduct, his prior inconsistent statements about the subject matter of his testimony, his lack of recollection due to the passage of time and ongoing drug abuse, and his failure to report the defendant\u2019s alleged confession either to Elan administrators or to law enforcement authorities. Indeed, the defendant does not seriously contest the fact that his trial counsel fully availed himself of the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>attack Coleman\u2019s credibility vigorously at the probable cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The defendant contends, however, that the trial court nevertheless should have barred the state from using Coleman\u2019s probable cause hearing testimony because, according to the defendant, that testimony was inherently unreliable. As the court in <em>Crawford </em>noted, however, although the \u201cultimate goal [of the confrontation clause] is to ensure reliability of evidence ... it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee.\u201d <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 61. In other words, the confrontation clause \u201ccommands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination. The [cjlause thus reflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined.\u201d Id. With respect to testimonial evidence, therefore, <em>Crawford </em>makes clear that the <em>opportunity </em>for cross-examination satisfies the requirements of the confrontation clause. To the extent that Coleman\u2019s probable cause hearing testimony was not worthy of belief, as the defendant claims, the defendant had ample opportunity to challenge Coleman\u2019s credibility at that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Indeed, even if more were needed, for purposes of the confrontation clause, to establish the reliability, and, thus, the admissibility, of Coleman\u2019s testimony, that standard clearly has been satisfied. The record indicates that Coleman gave his testimony under oath and that he was subject to penalty for perjury. Moreover, his testimony was given before a judicial tribunal that kept an accurate record of the proceedings. The defendant was present at the hearing at which Coleman gave his testimony and was represented by the same counsel who later represented him at trial. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Outlaw, </em>216 Conn. 492, 505, 582 A.2d 751 (1990) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>(identifying <em>pre-Crawford, </em>factors for determination of admissibility of prior testimony). Most importantly, however, as we have explained, \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s cross-examination comported with the principal purpose of cross-examination: to challenge whether the declarant was sincerely telling what he believed to be the truth, whether the declarant accurately perceived and remembered the matter he related, and whether the declarant\u2019s intended meaning is adequately conveyed by the language he employed. <em>[Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 71] . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Outlaw, </em>supra, 506. The confrontation clause requires no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The defendant also contends that the trial court improperly permitted the state to adduce certain incriminatory statements that he allegedly had made while he was a resident at Elan in violation of his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant maintains that the state\u2019s use of his statements violated his right to due process because \u201cthey were extracted while [he] was subjected to an atmosphere of physical and psychological torture and intimidation\u201d at Elan. The defendant concedes that he did not raise this claim in the trial court, and he therefore seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> The state contends that the defendant\u2019s federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>constitutional claim fails as a matter of law because the defendant cannot establish a fundamental element of that claim, namely, that state officials, rather than private actors, were responsible for eliciting the allegedly coerced statements. With respect to the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim, the state contends that the record is inadequate for our review of that claim. We conclude that the defendant cannot establish that the statements at issue were obtained in violation of his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The following facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims. As we explained previously, from 1978 to 1980, the defendant attended the Elan School, a residential school for troubled adolescents located in Poland Springs, Maine. The undisputed evidence revealed that the atmosphere at Elan was extremely harsh and oppressive. Residents at Elan were subjected to a behavioral modification program that was predicated on ridicule and fear. For example, residents of Elan regularly were required to attend \u201cgeneral meetings,\u201d the purpose of which was to confront and humiliate residents who, in the opinion of the staff, needed to be disciplined. At those meetings, residents deemed by Elan staff to be in need of discipline were subjected to physical and emotional hazing, and abuse from other residents and staff.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> See footnote 12 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>While attending Elan, the defendant made several statements to residents there in which he implicated himself in the victim\u2019s murder. The defendant made one such statement to Elizabeth Arnold, who testified that the defendant had told her that his brother had had sex with the victim on the night of the murder. The defendant also told Arnold that he was very drunk that night, that he had experienced some sort of blackout and that he did not know if he or his brother had killed the victim. John Higgins, another former Elan resident, testified that he and the defendant were alone one evening on the porch of their dormitory when the defendant told Higgins that he had been involved in a murder. Higgins further testified that the defendant also had stated that he had taken a golf club from the garage of his home and that he remembered running through the woods with the golf club in hand. Finally, Higgins recalled that the defendant continued to speak about the murder, stating, initially, that \u201che didn\u2019t know whether he did it,\u201d followed by \u201che may have done it,\u201d and \u201che must have done it,\u201d and concluding with, \u201cI did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The defendant also made incriminating statements to Gregory Coleman, a resident of Elan who had been assigned to \u201cguard\u201d the defendant after the defendant had returned to Elan following his failed escape attempt. According to Coleman, the defendant volunteered that, \u201cI am going to get away with murder because I am a Kennedy . . . .\u201d The defendant further stated that he had made romantic advances toward the victim, that she had spumed these advances and that he had beaten her to death with a golf club.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Another acquaintance of the defendant, Dorothy Rogers, testified that she was speaking with the defendant at an Elan social function when the defendant told her that he had been drinking on the night of the victim\u2019s death and that he could not remember what he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>done. According to Rogers, the defendant further explained that his family had sent him to Elan because they were afraid that he had committed the murder. The defendant also had two conversations with Alice Dunn, another Elan resident, about the victim\u2019s murder. One such conversation occurred at Elan while the defendant was cleaning the kitchen floor, and a second conversation occurred when Dunn and the defendant were together at a restaurant. In those conversations, the defendant told Dunn that he had been drinking on the night of the victim\u2019s murder, that he did not know if he had killed the victim and that either he or his brother could have committed the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The defendant contends that these statements were the product of the coercive environment at Elan and, therefore, that the statements were introduced into evidence in violation of the defendant\u2019s right to due process. For the reasons that follow, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">It is well settled that \u201cany use in a criminal trial of an involuntary confession is a denial of due process of law. ... In order to be voluntary a confession must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>be the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by the maker. ... If it is not, if his will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired, the use of the confession offends due process. . . . The determination of whether a confession is voluntary must be based on a consideration of the totality of circumstances surrounding it . . . including both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\u201cUnder the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, [however] in order for a confession to be deemed involuntary and thus inadmissible at trial, [t]here must be police conduct, or official coercion, causally related to the confession . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Therefore, \u201c[t]he most outrageous behavior by a private party seeking to secure evidence against a defendant does not make that evidence inadmissible under the Due Process Clause . . . [because] suppressing [such] statements would serve absolutely no purpose in enforcing constitutional guarantees. The purpose of excluding evidence seized in violation of the [federal] [constitution is to substantially deter future violations . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 166, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986). In the present case, the defendant does not claim that his inculpatory statements were procured, either directly or indirectly, by any state official or any person acting on behalf of the state. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional claim fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s claim under the due process clause of the state constitution, it is true that, \u201cin some instances . . . the protections afforded to the citizens of this state by our constitution go beyond those provided by the federal constitution . . . .\u201d (Cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>tion omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>228 Conn. 281, 295-96, 636 A.2d 351 (1994).

We need not decide whether the state constitution bars the use of involuntary statements that are not the product of police coercion, however, because, even if we assume, arguendo, that the state constitution does prohibit the use of such statements, the record is inadequate for our review of the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">\u201cIn order to be voluntary a confession must be the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by the maker. . . . If it is not, if his will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired, the use of the confession offends due process. . . . The determination of whether a confession is voluntary must be based on a consideration of the totality of circumstances surrounding it . . . including both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation. . . . Factors that may be taken into account, upon a proper factual showing, include: the youth of the accused; his lack of education; his intelligence; the lack of any advice as to his constitutional rights; the length of detention; the repeated and prolonged nature of the questioning; and the use of physical punishment, such as the deprivation of food and sleep. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s findings as to the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s interrogation and confession are findings of fact . . . which will not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>241 Conn. 322, 328-29, 696 A.2d 944 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>In view of the fact that the defendant failed to raise a challenge in the trial court to the admissibility, on state constitutional grounds, of the statements that he made while a resident at Elan, the trial court never made any inquiry as to the voluntariness of those statements. Because that inquiry necessarily is fact-bound, the absence of a factual predicate is fatal to the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal. In other words, \u201c[w]e do not know . . . whether the trial court, after conducting a full evidentiary hearing and applying the state constitutional standard now urged by the defendant, would have found the defendant\u2019s statements to have been involuntary. . . . [Sjince such a determination is a question of fact, even if we were to agree with the defendant [on his interpretation of the Connecticut constitution], we would have to remand the case to the trial court for that factual determination, rather than to grant the defendant a new trial. Since, under the test in <em>Golding, </em>we must determine whether the defendant can <em>prevail </em>on his claim, a remand to the trial court would be inappropriate. The first prong of <em>Golding </em>was designed to avoid remands for the purpose of supplementing the record.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 300-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">It is true, as the defendant observes, that, although we defer to the trial court\u2019s findings on the subsidiary facts, our scope of review is plenary with respect to the ultimate question of voluntariness. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>265 Conn. 184, 197, 827 A.2d 690 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinder, </em>250 Conn. 385, 420-21, 736 A.2d 857 (1999). The defendant contends that, in light of the plenary nature of our review, we may decide his state constitutional claim despite the absence of any factual findings by the trial court. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention. Because the claim was not raised in the trial court, we do not know the precise circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>under which the defendant\u2019s statements were made, or the defendant\u2019s state of mind when he made them. We therefore are unable to determine the extent to which the atmosphere at Elan may have affected the voluntariness of those statements, if at all. Indeed, to the extent that the defendant\u2019s statements were the subject of testimony at trial, there was nothing inherently coercive about the particular circumstances surrounding the statements to indicate that they had not been given freely. In fact, in the case of each such statement, the defendant appears to have been confiding, voluntarily, in a fellow Elan resident. On appeal, we cannot assume that the atmosphere at Elan was so coercive that any incriminating statement by the defendant necessarily was the product of that coercive environment. The defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim, therefore, fails under the first prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The defendant further alleges three evidentiary improprieties which, according to the defendant, entitle him to a new trial. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) permitted the state to introduce into evidence a prior inconsistent statement of Mildred lx even though that statement contained inadmissible hearsay; (2) permitted the state to impeach a witness with three newspaper articles that contained sensational allegations about the defendant and the Kennedy family; and (3) barred the defendant from impeaching Kenneth Littleton with evidence of his 1977 felony convictions. We reject each of the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">We begin by setting forth the standard that governs our review of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. \u201cIt is axiomatic that [t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. ... In this regard, the trial court is vested with wide discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>in determining the admissibility of evidence .... Accordingly, [t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>271 Conn. 218, 252, 856 A.2d 917 (2004). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling, and we will upset that ruling only for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Finally, \u201c[i]t is a fundamental rule of appellate review of evidentiary rulings that if [the] error is not of constitutional dimensions, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him. . . . Two lines of cases have developed setting forth the standard for reversing nonconstitutional, evidentiary improprieties. Under one line of cases, the defendant must establish, in order to obtain a reversal of his conviction, that it is more probable than not that the result of the trial would have been different if the error had not been committed. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavell, </em>235 Conn. 711, 721-22, 670 A.2d 261 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Buster, </em>224 Conn. 546, 561, 620 A.2d 110 (1993). According to a second line of cases, the defendant must show that the prejudice resulting from the impropriety was so substantial as to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>245 Conn. 351, 371-72, 716 A.2d 36 (1998). Under either formulation, [w]hether [the improper admission of a witness\u2019 testimony] is harmless in a particular case depends [on] a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the [improperly admitted] evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial. ... If the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the [verdict] of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Gonzalez, 272 Conn. 515, 527-28, 864 A.2d 847 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court improperly admitted the prior inconsistent statement of Mildred lx because it contained hearsay not admissible under any established hearsay exception. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">At trial, the state presented the testimony of Mildred lx, a resident of the Belle Haven neighborhood at the time of the victim\u2019s murder. Mildred lx testified that she had been close to the defendant\u2019s deceased mother, and that she also was a good friend of the defendant\u2019s father, Rushton Skakel, Sr. She also testified that, after the death of the defendant\u2019s mother, she occasionally helped the defendant\u2019s father with problems or other matters relating to his children. On direct examination, the state asked Mildred lx whether she recalled a conversation in which the defendant\u2019s father had confided in her that the defendant had admitted that he may have killed the victim. Mildred lx responded that she did not. Thereafter, the state offered into evidence the prior grand jury testimony of Mildred lx in accordance with the rule that we adopted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986), which allows the \u201csubstantive use of prior written inconsistent statements, signed by the declarant, who has personal knowledge of the facts stated, when the declarant testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>fies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.\u201d Id., 753. The proffered testimony provided in relevant part: \u201cI can\u2019t remember who told me that, but it was\u2014oh, it was . . . [the defendant\u2019s father]. He said . . . [the defendant] had come up to him and he said, you know, I had a lot ... to drink that night and I would like to see ... if I could have had so much to drink that I would have forgotten something, and I could have murdered [the victim], and I would like to make sure at that night knowing something like that happened. So he asked to go under Sodium Pentothal<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> or whatever it was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Defense counsel objected to the state\u2019s use of the prior grand jury testimony of Mildred lx on the ground that the testimony contained hearsay that did not fall within any established hearsay exception. The trial court overruled the objection, concluding that, although the statement contained three levels of hearsay, each level was independently admissible under a firmly rooted hearsay exception. Specifically, the court determined that the first level of hearsay, namely, the grand jury testimony of Mildred lx, was admissible under the hearsay exception for prior inconsistent statements carved out by this court in <em>Whelan. </em>See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-5 (1). With respect to the second level of hearsay, namely, the statement of the defendant\u2019s father to Mildred lx, the court determined that that statement was admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule. See id., \u00a7 8-9. Finally, the court concluded that the third level of hearsay, namely, the defendant\u2019s alleged statement to his father, was admissible as an admission by a party opponent. See id., \u00a7 8-3 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">On appeal, the defendant does not dispute the trial court\u2019s determination that the first and third levels of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>hearsay contained in the statement of Mildred lx were admissible under the hearsay exceptions identified by the trial court. Rather, he challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusion that his father\u2019s statement to Mildred lx was admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule. Specifically, the defendant contends that the trial court placed unwarranted reliance on the nature of his father\u2019s friendship with Mildred lx in assessing the trustworthiness and reliability of the statement. In support of this contention, the defendant maintains that communications between close friends are not so inherently reliable as to overcome the general prohibition against the admission of hearsay testimony. The defendant further asserts that the trial court improperly concluded that it was unlikely that a father would relay a matter of such a sensitive nature about his son to a close confidant unless it were true. We disagree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">As we previously have noted, out-of-court statements offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted are hearsay. Such statements generally are inadmissible unless they fall within an exception to the hearsay rule. \u201cA hearsay statement that does not fall within one of the traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule nevertheless may be admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule provided that the proponent\u2019s use of the statement is reasonably necessary and the statement itself is supported by equivalent guarantees of trustworthiness and reliability that are essential to other evidence admitted under traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-9; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 809, 709 A.2d 522 (1998).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Aaron L., </em>272 Conn. 798, 812, 865 A.2d 1135 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The requirement of reasonable necessity \u201cis met when, unless the hearsay statement is admitted, the facts it contains may be lost, either because the declar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>ant is dead or otherwise unavailable, or because the assertion is of such a nature that evidence of the same value cannot be obtained from the same or other sources.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 809; accord Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-9, commentary. At trial, the declarant, namely, the defendant\u2019s father, testified that he did not recall confiding in Mildred lx that the defendant had admitted to him that he may have been involved in the victim\u2019s murder. Upon examining the transcript of her grand jury testimony, Mildred lx confirmed that she had had a conversation with the defendant\u2019s father in which he stated that the defendant wanted to take a Sodium Pentothal test, but she denied that the defendant\u2019s father had said anything about the defendant\u2019s possible involvement in the victim\u2019s murder. In light of the fact that the only two parties to the conversation, Mildred lx and the defendant\u2019s father, did not recall the statement that the defendant allegedly had made to his father, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that admission of the statement was reasonably necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">We next address the trustworthiness and reliability of the statement. We previously have identified several factors that bear upon the trustworthiness and reliability of an out-of-court statement, including: (1) whether \u201cthe circumstances are such that a sincere and accurate statement would naturally be uttered, and no plan of falsification [could] be formed\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 810; (2) the closeness of the relationship between the declarant and recipient; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>268 Conn. 351, 369, 844 A.2d 191 (2004); (3) whether the statement was made spontaneously and in confidence or obtained in response to government questioning conducted in anticipation of litigation; id., 370; (4) the temporal proximity between the alleged statement and the events to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>the statement refers; id., 370-71; and (5) whether the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 665, 491 A.2d 345 (1985). Applying these factors to the present case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the challenged statement bore the requisite indicia of trustworthiness and reliability for admission under the residual exception to the hearsay rale.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">First, Mildred lx and the defendant\u2019s father had a personal relationship, and, from time to time, they spoke about issues involving the Skakel children. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s father made the challenged statement to Mildred lx in confidence and on his own initiative. In such circumstances, it is most doubtful that he would have repeated the defendant\u2019s statement to Mildred lx unless the defendant, in fact, had made such a statement to him. Moreover, as a general matter, it is highly unlikely that a father would implicate his child falsely in a serious crime, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the defendant\u2019s father had any reason or cause to do so in the present case. Furthermore, because the defendant\u2019s father made the statement to Mildred lx in 1980 or 1981, his recall likely was more accurate at that time than when he testified at trial more than twenty years later.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Finally, Mildred lx and the defendant\u2019s father testified and were subject to cross-examination concerning the challenged statement and its contents. In such circumstances, the statement bore sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant its admission into evidence. Because the trial court also reasonably concluded that the state had a legitimate need for the statement, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court abused its discretion in per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>mitting the state to use the grand jury testimony of Mildred lx as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly permitted the state to introduce into evidence, for impeachment purposes, three irrelevant and prejudicial newspaper articles,<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> and that that impropriety entitles him to a new trial. We also reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">At trial, Geranne Ridge testified that, in 1997, the defendant attended a gathering at her home. At that gathering, Ridge overheard the defendant state, \u201c[A]sk me why I killed my neighbor.\u201d According to Ridge, the defendant had made that comment \u201cin jest . . . .\u201d Ridge claimed that she could not recall the defendant making any other statements about his alleged involvement in the victim\u2019s murder. The state thereafter introduced into evidence, in accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753, a tape-recorded telephone conversation between Ridge and a friend, Matthew Attanian, that had taken place in February, 2002. In the conversation, Ridge told Attanian in relevant part: \u201c[T]his is the real story. Um, [an unintelligible] name is used from now on, okay? . . . Um, John Doe was, was, um, watching this particular girl at her bedroom window, changing. And he was up in a tree, masturbating, [be] cause he liked her. She went and had sex with his brother Tommy that same night, while he was outside smoking pot and doing LSD and acid and really big-time drugs, mind, you know, altering drugs. After he found out that, that his, that John Doe\u2019s brother had sex with this girl, he got so violent and he was so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>screwed up, he did that to her.\u201d Attanian replied, \u201cWow. And he told you he did that?\u201d Ridge responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Ridge also told Attanian that the defendant had told her and the guests at her home that, \u201cI did hit her with a golf club . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">On cross-examination, Ridge maintained that the defendant had not, in fact, made any admissions to her about the victim\u2019s murder, and that her only contact with the defendant consisted of her overhearing his \u201coff the cuff\u2019 comment, \u201c[A]sk me why I killed my neighbor.\u201d Ridge further maintained that it was her houseguest, Marisa Verrochi, and not she, who had invited the defendant to her home, and that she had never even been introduced to the defendant. Ridge also explained that she had lied to Attanian about the defendant\u2019s admissions in order to satisfy Attanian\u2019s curiosity about the murder and to appear more knowledgeable about that crime than she actually was. In addition, Ridge testified that the information that she had relayed to Attanian \u201ccame from magazines, newspapers and from Marisa Verrochi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">On redirect examination, the state\u2019s attorney asked Ridge whether three newspaper articles that her attorney had brought to court that day were the source of the information that she had conveyed to Attanian. She responded that they were \u201c[m]ost of the source, yes . . . .\u201d The state\u2019s attorney then asked Ridge to examine the three publications and to identify any reference in the articles concerning the details of the statement attributed to the defendant by Ridge in her tape-recorded telephone conversation with Attanian. Defense counsel objected to this inquiry on the ground that the articles were not in evidence, and the court sustained the objection. The state\u2019s attorney thereafter questioned Ridge about each specific fact that she had attributed to the defendant in her telephone conversation with Attanian, inquiring as to whether the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>was mentioned in the three newspaper articles. Ridge responded that each such fact was contained in one or more of the articles.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> At that point, the state sought to introduce the three newspaper articles into evidence, and defense counsel objected, claiming that the articles were irrelevant and prejudicial. The trial court overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection. The court instructed the jury, however, that the articles were not being admitted for the truth of the information contained therein but, rather, for the limited purpose of impeaching Ridge\u2019s testimony that they had been the source of the details that she had related to Attanian. The state\u2019s attorney then asked Ridge to examine the articles and to point out those portions of the articles that contained the information that she had provided to Attanian. Ridge responded that she had not thoroughly reviewed the articles, but that they did not contain some of the details that she had related to Attanian in their telephone conversation.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> On recross-examination, Ridge testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>the three articles were not the only sources of the information that she had conveyed to Attanian. At the conclusion of the trial, the court again instructed the jury regarding the limited purpose for which the articles had been introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the newspaper articles into evidence because they were irrelevant and prejudicial. Specifically, the defendant maintains that the articles contain sensational stories of sex, alcohol and drugs involving the defendant and the Kennedy family, generally \u201cunderscored the pervasive theme of the state\u2019s case that the defendant believed [that] he was above the law because he was a Kennedy,\u201d and otherwise suggested that the defendant, like other members of his family, was a liar who had much to hide.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>It is well established that \u201c[Relevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . One fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with other facts, renders the existence of the other either more certain or more probable. . . . Evidence is irrelevant or too remote if there is such a want of open and visible connection between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>evidentiary and principal facts that, all things considered, the former is not worthy or safe to be admitted in the proof of the latter. . . . Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not [unfairly] prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 200-201, 864 A.2d 666 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">We agree with the trial court that the newspaper articles were relevant to the state\u2019s contention that Ridge did not, in fact, obtain the information that she had conveyed to Attanian from the newspaper articles but, rather, from the defendant himself, as she had represented to Attanian.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> In light of Ridge\u2019s testimony that the newspapers, and not the defendant, were the source of that information, the fact that most of the information was not contained in the articles provided a proper avenue of impeachment for the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">With respect to the prejudicial effect of evidence admitted at trial, we have stated that, \u201c[although relevant, evidence may be excluded by the trial court if the court determines that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value. . . . [T]he trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>court\u2019s discretionary determination that the probative value of evidence is . . . outweighed by its prejudicial effect will not be disturbed on appeal unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown. . . . [B]ecause of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process . . . every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. ... Of course, [a] 11 adverse evidence is damaging to one\u2019s case, but it is inadmissible only if it creates <em>undue </em>prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to be admitted. . . . [Accordingly] [t]he test for determining whether evidence is unduly prejudicial is not whether it is damaging to the [party against whom the evidence is offered] but whether it will improperly arouse the emotions of the jur[ors].\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>263 Conn. 524, 544, 821 A.2d 247 (2003); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Whether the trial court reasonably concluded that the probative value of the articles was not outweighed by their potential prejudicial effect presents a close question. Our review of the articles reveals that they are comprised primarily of sensationalized reports of allegedly scandalous conduct by members of the Kennedy family. Although the articles also mention the defendant\u2019s abuse of drugs and alcohol, ample evidence of that abuse was admitted into evidence at trial. Moreover, to the extent that the articles refer to the present case and to the defendant\u2019s purported involvement in the victim\u2019s murder, those references are relatively brief and, with minor exceptions, involve facts that already were properly before the jury. See footnote 94 of this opinion. Nevertheless, because of the sensational nature and tone of the articles, their introduction into evidence created some risk of prejudice to the defendant. That risk, however, undoubtedly was minimized by virtue of the trial court\u2019s limiting instructions.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>need not decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the state to introduce the articles into evidence, however, because the defendant cannot establish that any prejudice that may have flowed from their admission into evidence was so substantial as to warrant a new trial. In other words, under either formulation of the test that this court applies in determining whether an evidentiary error warrants a new trial; compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavell, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 721-22 (result of trial likely would have been different but for evidentiary impropriety), with <em>State </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 371-72 (prejudice resulting from erroneous evidentiary ruling is so substantial as to undermine confidence in fairness of verdict); the defendant cannot establish harm because the jury already was aware of most of the facts contained in the articles; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 528-29 (\u201c[i]t is well recognized that any error in the admission of evidence does not require reversal of the resulting judgment if the improperly admitted evidence is merely cumulative of other validly admitted testimony\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); and because the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury regarding the limited admissibility of the articles.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">\u201cGenerally, evidence that a witness has been convicted of a crime is admissible to impeach his credibility if the crime was punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. General Statutes \u00a7 52-145 (b); Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-7 (a). In determining whether to admit evidence of a conviction, the court shall consider: (1) the extent of the prejudice likely to arise; (2) the significance of the particular crime in indicating untruthfulness; and (3) the remoteness in time of the conviction. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-7 (a); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 513, 522, 447 A.2d 396 (1982) (recognizing same three part test at common law prior to adoption of Connecticut Code of Evidence). Moreover, [i]n evaluating the separate ingredients to be weighed in the balancing process, there is no way to quantify them in mathematical terms. . . . Therefore, [t]he trial court has wide discretion in this balancing determination and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling .... Reversal is required only whe[n] an abuse of discretion is manifest or whe[n] injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Label Systems Corp. </em>v. <em>Aghamohammadi, </em>270 Conn. 291, 307, 852 A.2d 703 (2004). With respect to the remoteness prong of the balancing test, we have endorsed a general guideline of ten years from conviction or release from confinement for that conviction, whichever is later, as an appropriate limitation on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>use of a witness\u2019 prior conviction. See, e.g., id., 313; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dorans, </em>261 Conn. 730, 755-56, 806 A.2d 1033 (2002). \u201c[T]he ten year benchmark . . . [however] is not an absolute bar to the use of a conviction that is more than ten years old, but, rather, serves merely as a guide to assist the trial judge in evaluating the conviction\u2019s remoteness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Label Systems Corp. </em>v. <em>Aghamohammadi, </em>supra, 313. We have recognized, moreover, that \u201cconvictions having some special significance upon the issue of veracity surmount the standard bar of ten years and qualify for the balancing of probative value against prejudice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dorans, </em>supra, 755-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Although Littleton\u2019s burglary convictions are probative of a lack of honesty; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>227 Conn. 417, 436, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993) (\u201c[breaking and entering with criminal intent [is] a crime . . . associated with larceny and, therefore, implying dishonesty in the general sense directly affecting the credibility of [a] witness\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 363-64 (noting that crimes involving larcenous intent are probative of lack of honesty); we nevertheless conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding them. The twenty-five year time span between Little-ton\u2019s convictions and his trial testimony<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> greatly surpasses the ten year benchmark. Even though the crimes reflect a lack of honesty, their probative value was minimal, at best, in view of the long span of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>between the convictions and Littleton\u2019s testimony. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Dorans, supra, 261 Conn. 756 (trial court properly excluded conviction that involved larcenous intent and that was more than twenty years old). Consequently, the trial court acted within its discretion in concluding that the convictions were too remote to have any meaningful bearing on Littleton\u2019s veracity as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The defendant claims, nevertheless, that the trial court improperly excluded the proffered impeachment evidence because that evidence was not unduly prejudicial to the state and because of Littleton\u2019s importance to the defendant\u2019s theory of the case. In support of this claim, the defendant relies primarily on <em>State </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 351. In <em>Askew, </em>the defendant, Willie Askew, was convicted of robbery in the first degree. Id., 352. At trial, Askew testified on his own behalf, and the state was permitted to impeach him with evidence of his prior robbery conviction. See id., 359. The robbery victim, who was the key state\u2019s witness; see id., 369; also had a prior felony larceny conviction, which, at the time of the trial, was ten years and seven months old. Id., 356. The trial court barred Askew from using the victim\u2019s prior conviction for impeachment purposes because the conviction was more than ten years old. See id., 357. On appeal, Askew claimed that the trial court had abused its discretion in prohibiting him from impeaching the victim with his prior conviction, and we agreed. Id., 371. We observed that, \u201cas a general matter, it is unlikely that the use of a criminal conviction to impeach a state\u2019s witness will give rise to any undue prejudice\u201d;<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> id., 363; that the crime underlying the vic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>tint\u2019s conviction was probative of a lack of honesty; id.; and that the victim\u2019s conviction, \u201cwhile exceeding our ten year benchmark for presumptive admissibility, [was] not so remote as to impair, to any meaningful degree, its probative value.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Id., 364. Additionally, we observed that the state\u2019s case rested almost exclusively on the testimony of the victim. See id., 369. Because the outcome of the trial in that case \u201cturned on the jury\u2019s assessment of the relative credibility of the victim and [Askew]\u201d; id., 369-70; we were persuaded that the trial court improperly had failed to consider the centrality of the victim\u2019s testimony and, thus, the importance of his credibility, in assessing the probative value of the proffered impeachment evidence. See id., 370-71. We concluded, under all of the circumstances, that the trial court had abused its discretion in excluding the victim\u2019s prior felony conviction. Id., 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In contrast to the conviction at issue in <em>Askew, </em>the span between Littleton\u2019s prior felony convictions and his trial testimony is not close to the ten year benchmark for admissibility; it surpasses that benchmark by fifteen years. Furthermore, Littleton was not a key state\u2019s witness; indeed, he testified that he had no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the murder of the victim. Although the defendant sought to advance the possibility that Littleton had murdered the victim, the evidence adduced by the defendant in support of that theory was, at best, thin. Finally, because the defendant\u2019s third party culpability defense did focus on Little-ton, the state had a legitimate concern that the defendant\u2019s use of Littleton\u2019s twenty-five year old convictions would give rise to an undue risk that the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>attention would be diverted from the important issues in the case. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Lastly, the defendant claims that his right to a fair trial was violated as a result of prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments. Specifically, the defendant contends that the state\u2019s attorney improperly: (1) maintained that the defendant had fabricated a story to explain the possible future discovery of his semen at the scene of the crime; (2) asserted that the Skakel family hfid conspired to fabricate an alibi for the defendant; (3) contended that the Skakel family believed that the defendant was guilty of the murder of the victim; (4) referred to the defendant as a \u201ckiller\u201d and a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d; (5) asserted that the defendant had masturbated on the victim\u2019s body; and (6) misused evidence in an audiovisual presentation to make it appear that the defendant had confessed to the murder. Although the defendant acknowledges that he did not object to any of the alleged misconduct that he challenges on appeal, he nevertheless claims that he is entitled to a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the legal principles that govern our review of the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claims of prosecutorial misconduct. \u201cIn <em>[State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 849 A.2d 626 (2004)], we clarified our due process analysis in cases involving incidents of prosecutorial misconduct to which no objection has been raised at trial.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> We explained that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>in such cases, it is unnecessary for the defendant to seek to prevail under the specific requirements of . . . <em>Golding </em>. . . and, similarly, it is unnecessary for a reviewing court to apply the four-pronged <em>Golding </em>test. The reason for this is that the touchstone for appellate review of claims of prosecutorial misconduct is a determination of whether the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial, and this determination must involve the application of the factors set out by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). As we stated in that case: In determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, this court, in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">\u201cRegardless of whether the defendant has objected to an incident of misconduct, a reviewing court must apply the <em>Williams </em>factors to the entire trial, because there is no way to determine whether the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial unless the misconduct is viewed in light of the entire trial. The application of the <em>Williams </em>factors, therefore, is identical to the third and fourth prongs of <em>Golding, </em>namely, whether the constitutional violation exists, and whether it was harmful. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240. Requiring the application of both <em>Williams </em>and <em>Golding, </em>therefore, would lead ... to confusion and duplication of effort. Furthermore, the application of the <em>Golding </em>test to unchallenged incidents of misconduct tends to encourage analysis of each incident in isolation from one another. Because the inquiry must involve the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>trial, all incidents of misconduct must be viewed in relation to one another and within the context of the entire trial. The object of inquiry before a reviewing court in [due process] claims involving prosecutorial misconduct, therefore, is always and only the fairness of the entire trial, and not the specific incidents of misconduct themselves. Application of the <em>Williams </em>factors provides for such an analysis, and the specific <em>Golding </em>test, therefore, is superfluous. In light of these observations, we conclude that, following a determination that prosecutorial misconduct has occurred, regardless of whether it was objected to, an appellate court must apply the <em>Williams </em>factors to the entire trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that the absence of an objection at trial does not play a significant role in the application of the <em>Williams </em>factors. To the contrary, the determination of whether a new trial or proceeding is warranted depends, in part, on whether defense counsel has made a timely objection to any [incident] of the prosecutor\u2019s improper [conduct]. When defense counsel does not object, request a curative instruction or move for a mistrial, he presumably does not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial enough to seriously jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. . . . [Thus], the fact that defense counsel did not object to one or more incidents of misconduct must be considered in determining whether and to what extent the misconduct contributed to depriving the defendant of a fair trial and whether, therefore, reversal is warranted. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 572-76.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>270 Conn. 568, 591-93, 854 A.2d 718 (2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1055, 125 S. Ct. 921, 160 L. Ed. 2d 780 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\u201cWe now address the standards that guide our review of claims of prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments. [Pjrosecutorial misconduct of a constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>tional magnitude can occur in the course of closing arguments. ... In determining whether such misconduct has occurred, the reviewing court must give due deference to the fact that [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . Thus, as the state\u2019s advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. . . . Moreover, [i]t does not follow . . . that every use of rhetorical language or device [by the prosecutor] is improper. . . . The occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument. . . . Nevertheless, the prosecutor has a heightened duty to avoid argument that strays from the evidence or diverts the jury\u2019s attention from the facts of the case. . . . This heightened duty derives from our long recognition of the special role played by the state\u2019s attorney in a criminal trial. He is not only an officer of the court, like every attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the [s]tate, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. In discharging his most important duties, he deserves and receives in peculiar degree the support of the court and the respect of the citizens of the county. By reason of his office, he usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty [is] at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment. If the accused be guilty, he should [nonetheless] be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe. While the privilege of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury ha[s] no right to consider. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">\u201cOr to put it another way while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one. ... A prosecutor must draw a careful line. On the one hand, he should be fair; he should not seek to arouse passion or engender prejudice. On the other hand, earnestness or even a stirring eloquence cannot convict him of hitting foul blows.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 593-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">It is well established, furthermore, \u201cthat a prosecutor, in fulfilling his duties, must confine himself to the evidence in the record. . . . Statements as to facts that have not been proven amount to unsworn testimony, which is not the subject of proper closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">\u201cA prosecutor may invite the jury to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence; however, he or she may not invite sheer speculation unconnected to evidence. . . . Moreover, when a prosecutor suggests a fact not in evidence, there is a risk that the jury may conclude that he or she has independent knowledge of facts that could not be presented to the jury.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 400, 832 A.2d 14 (2003). In addition, \u201c[a] prosecutor may not appeal to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors. . . . [S]uch appeals should be avoided because they have the effect of diverting the [jurors\u2019] attention from their duty to decide the case on the evidence. . . . When the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>appeals to emotions, he invites the jury to decide the case, not according to a rational appraisal of the evidence, but on the basis of powerful and irrelevant factors which are likely to skew that appraisal. ... No trial\u2014civil or criminal\u2014should be decided upon the basis of the jurors\u2019 emotions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Thus, \u201c[i]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial misconduct, we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether misconduct occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that misconduct deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. ... As we have indicated, our determination of whether any improper conduct by the state\u2019s attorney violated the defendant\u2019s fair trial rights is predicated on the factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540, with due consideration of whether that misconduct was objected to at trial.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 595-96. With these overarching principles in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s specific allegations of prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">The defendant claims that the state\u2019s attorney falsely asserted that the defendant had fabricated a story about masturbating on or near the body of the victim for the purpose of explaining the possible future discovery of his semen, through the use of DNA technology, at the scene of the crime. The defendant also contends that the state\u2019s attorney improperly imputed this motive to the defendant on the basis of an assertion that was not supported by the record, namely, that the investigatory value of DNA technology was widely known when the defendant made certain statements, in the early 1990s, in furtherance of his masturbation story. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>contends that, contrary to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s assertion, the evidence established that DNA technology was only just emerging in the early 1990s and, therefore, its value was not widely known.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. As we previously have explained, the defendant initially told investigators that he had not left his home after returning from the home of his cousin, James Dowdle, on the night of the murder. At trial, however, several witnesses testified that the defendant had told them that, on the night of the murder, he had left his house and masturbated in the vicinity of the location where the victim\u2019s body was found. Michael Meredith, one of the state\u2019s witnesses, testified that, in 1987, the defendant stated that, on the night of the murder, he had climbed a tree on the Moxley property and masturbated while watching the victim through her bedroom window. Another witness, Andrew Pugh, testified that, in 1992, the defendant told him that, on the night that the victim was murdered, he had masturbated in the tree under which the victim\u2019s body was found. Pugh further testified that immediately after the defendant told him this story, Pugh received more than two dozen telephone calls from Sutton Associates, an investigatory agency that the defendant had retained, requesting that Pugh meet with them to discuss the victim\u2019s murder. When Pugh did not return the calls, the defendant contacted Pugh and implored him to speak to the investigators, explaining that the investigators were trying to \u201cclear\u201d the defendant\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The state also introduced the prior testimony of Gregory Coleman, who testified that while he and the defendant were residents at the Elan School, the defendant confessed to him that, two days after he killed the victim with a golf club, he had returned to her body and masturbated on it. In addition, the state introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>a 1997 tape-recorded conversation between the defendant and Richard Hoffman in which the defendant explained to Hoffman how he had snuck out of the house on the night of the murder and masturbated in a tree on the Moxley property.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Finally, the state adduced the testimony of Henry Lee, the state\u2019s former chief criminalist, who explained that he had published a paper in 1979 about the potential application of DNA technology to forensic science. Lee further testified that, by the end of 1989, DNA technology was being used in criminal investigations in the United States, although, according to Lee, DNA technology still was a new and developing technique as of 1991. Lee also explained that, by the early 1990s, DNA testing had become even \u201cmore sensitive\u201d through a new method of DNA typing known as the polymerase chain reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In his closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney asserted that the reason that the defendant began telling people that he had left his house on the night of the murder and masturbated in the vicinity of the victim\u2019s body was because he feared that his original \u201c1975 alibi wouldn\u2019t cover every eventuality, particularly that his semen might one day be identified in a crime lab, or even that one day, someone might surface who had actually seen him over there.\u201d The state\u2019s attorney further argued that, by the early 1990s, the defendant\u2019s need to establish an alternative explanation for the presence of his semen at the crime scene took on a particular urgency because, by then, DNA had become \u201cthe real deal in criminal investigation,\u201d and because \u201cevery criminal investigator on the planet was totally attuned to this miraculous new technology, and, of course, that would include the [private investigators] that the Skakel family had hired to assist them in the defense, Sutton Associates.\u201d Thus, according to the state\u2019s attorney, what began in 1987 as a story of spying on the victim while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>masturbating in a tree outside the victim\u2019s bedroom window had, by 1992, evolved into a story of masturbating in the same tree under which the victim\u2019s body was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The defendant contends that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument was improper for two reasons. First, the defendant claims that the state\u2019s attorney intentionally misrepresented the chronology of events to make it appear as though the defendant, with the assistance of Sutton Associates, had devised the masturbation story only after Lee became involved in the investigation in the early 1990s. Second, the defendant contends that the state\u2019s attorney, without support in the record and for the purpose of advancing the theory that the defendant had fabricated the masturbation story in the early 1990s in anticipation of the possible discovery of DNA evidence at or near the crime scene, improperly asserted that, by 1992, DNA was the \u201creal deal\u201d in criminal investigations, and that \u201cevery criminal investigator on the planet was totally attuned to this miraculous new technology . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">We reject the defendant\u2019s first contention that the state\u2019s attorney misrepresented the chronology of events in order to make it appear that the defendant began telling his masturbation story only after Lee had entered the investigation. On the contrary, the state\u2019s attorney referred to Meredith\u2019s testimony throughout his closing argument, explicitly stating that the defendant had related the masturbation story to Meredith in 1987, five years before Lee\u2019s involvement in the case. The state\u2019s attorney underscored Pugh\u2019s testimony because it lent support to the state\u2019s theory regarding the defendant\u2019s motive for disseminating the masturbation story in the first place: as we have explained, Pugh testified that, in 1992, the defendant stated that he had masturbated in the same tree under which the victim\u2019s body was found. Pugh further testified that, immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>ately after the defendant told him this story, he began receiving repeated telephone calls from the defendant\u2019s private investigators requesting that Pugh meet with them to discuss the victim\u2019s murder. Pugh also explained that, when he did not return their calls, the defendant himself called to urge him to talk to the investigators. In light of the conduct of the defendant and his investigators, it was not improper for the state\u2019s attorney to argue that the defendant, or Sutton Associates, or both, in 1992, considered it urgent that Pugh repeat the story that the defendant had told him. It also was not improper for the state\u2019s attorney to argue that the defendant\u2019s urgent interest in the matter likely was related to the fact that the state recently had reopened its investigation into the victim\u2019s murder, and that Lee had part of that investigation. Because the state\u2019s attorney merely urged the jury to draw reasonable inferences from the facts, the argument was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We also are not persuaded that the defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated by the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s assertion that DNA technology and its efficacy were well-known in 1992. We acknowledge that there was not a great deal of testimony regarding the precise state of DNA science as of that date, and that, in light of the relative paucity of such testimony, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments reasonably might be characterized as something of an overstatement of that testimony. Nevertheless, by 1992, professional investigators, such as Sutton Associates, undoubtedly were aware of DNA technology and its enormous potential in the forensic arena.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> We are mindful, also, that \u201cclosing arguments often have a rough and tumble quality about them, [and that] some leeway must be afforded to the advocates in offering arguments to the jury in final argument.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>90 Conn. App. 82, 95 n.7, 876 A.2d 561, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 924, 883 A.2d 1250 (2005). As we previously have noted, moreover, defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument when it was made indicates that he did not believe that it was unfair in view of the record of the case at the time. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 576. As we also have observed, \u201cdefense counsel may elect not to object to arguments that he or she deems marginally objectionable for tactical reasons, namely, because he or she does not want to draw the jury\u2019s attention to it or because he or she wants to . . . refute that argument [later].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. That may have occurred in the present case. In any event, we reiterate that \u201c[defense] counsel\u2019s failure to object at trial, while not by itself <em>fatal </em>to a defendant\u2019s claim, frequently will indicate on appellate review that the challenged comments do not rise to the magnitude of constitutional error .... Put differently . . . prosecutorial misconduct claims [are] not intended to provide an avenue for the tactical sandbagging of our trial courts, but rather, to address gross prosecutorial improprieties that . . . have deprived a criminal defendant of his right to a fair trial.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Even if the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s characterization of the state of DNA evidence as of the early 1990s was somewhat overblown, that characterization did not represent the kind of gross or flagrant impropriety for which a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The defendant claims that the state\u2019s attorney improperly argued that the Skakel family had created an alibi for the defendant. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">At trial, the state adduced evidence that, on the day that the victim\u2019s body was discovered, Kenneth Littleton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>was directed to take the defendant, his brothers Thomas Skakel and John Skakel, their cousin James Dowdle, and James Terrien to the family\u2019s hunting lodge in Wind-ham, New York, which he did the following morning. On cross-examination, Littleton testified that he likely was the one who proposed to the \u201csuits\u201d and lawyers who came to the Skakel home on the day following the murder that he should take the Skakel children to Windham. On redirect examination, however, Littleton indicated that the decision to take the children to Wind-ham probably had been made as a group. Littleton testified that, because, at the time, he could not have known that the Skakels had a house in Windham, he likely heard about the house from one of the \u201csuits,\u201d and that he then volunteered to take the children there. The state also adduced testimony from the defendant\u2019s father, Rushton Skakel, Sr., who stated that, although he did not specifically recall directing Littleton to take the children to Windham, Littleton would not have had the authority to take the children anywhere without his permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Finally, the state adduced the testimony of James Lunney, a former detective with the Greenwich police department. Lunney testified that he had contacted the defendant\u2019s father on November 14,1975, and requested that he bring his children to the station to provide statements about their whereabouts and activities at and around the time of the victim\u2019s murder. According to Lunney, the next day, the defendant\u2019s father brought all of his children, with the exception of Rushton Skakel, Jr., who was away at college, to the police station. Lunney also testified that the defendant\u2019s father remained in the room with the defendant while the defendant gave his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">In his closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney asserted that the defendant\u2019s family, and in particular the defendant\u2019s father, had \u201cproduced\u201d an alibi for the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>after the murder. Specifically, the state\u2019s attorney argued that, on the day that the victim\u2019s body was found, someone in the family, most likely the defendant\u2019s father, had decided to send the defendant, Thomas Skakel and John Skakel to Windham to shield them from the police and to give them time to construct their story. The state\u2019s attorney further maintained that, had the trip simply been for the purpose of protecting the Skakel children from a killer on the loose, the defendant\u2019s younger brothers and sister also would have gone to Windham, but they had remained at home. Finally, the state\u2019s attorney asserted that a few weeks after the trip\u2014and after the defendant\u2019s alibi witnesses had been afforded a sufficient opportunity to craft a cohesive story\u2014the defendant\u2019s father escorted all of those witnesses to the police station, where they each gave an unsworn statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The defendant contends that the foregoing argument was not based on the facts in evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">With respect to the remarks of the state\u2019s attorney about the trip to Windham, the evidence adduced at trial indicated that, on the day that the victim\u2019s body was discovered, several unidentified persons, whom Littleton described as \u201csuits,\u201d came to the Skakel residence to help take control of the situation. While they were there, it was decided that Littleton would take the defendant, his brothers Thomas Skakel and John Skakel, their cousin Dowdle, and Terrien to the family\u2019s hunting lodge in Windham. The defendant\u2019s father also testified that Littleton would not have had the authority to take his children anywhere without his permission. Accordingly, we conclude that the state\u2019s argument that Littleton was directed to take the four boys out to Wind-ham on the basis of \u201c[s]omeone seeing the police all over the place\u201d was not improper because it was founded on reasonable inferences drawn from the testimony of Littleton and the defendant\u2019s father. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>because the only family members to go to Windham were the chief proponents of the defendant\u2019s alibi\u2014the defendant\u2019s other siblings were left behind\u2014it also was proper for the state\u2019s attorney to argue that the trip had been arranged for the purpose of placing these crucial witnesses temporarily out of reach of the authorities in order to give them time to prepare a unified account of the events that occurred on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">We also are not persuaded that the state\u2019s attorney transcended the bounds of proper argument when he urged the jury to infer that the defendant\u2019s father had been instrumental in orchestrating the defendant\u2019s alibi. There is nothing unusual, of course, about the defendant\u2019s father\u2019s act of accompanying his children to the police station. The state\u2019s attorney urged the jury to consider that conduct, however, in light of the fact that a number of persons had descended on the Skakel residence immediately after the discovery of the victim\u2019s body, apparently for the purpose of managing the situation, and, further, that the older Skakel siblings, along with Dowdle and Terrien, had been whisked away to Windham as soon as possible after the murder. Although the state\u2019s attorney did not, and could not, point to any direct evidence of a concerted effort by the defendant\u2019s father or other members of the Skakel family to orchestrate an alibi for the defendant, it was reasonable for the state\u2019s attorney to implore the jury to infer, on the basis of the circumstantial evidence, that such an effort had been undertaken on the defendant\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The defendant also contends that the state\u2019s attorney improperly asserted that the defendant\u2019s family believed that he had killed the victim because, otherwise, he would not have been sent to the Elan School. The defendant further claims that the state\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>improperly argued that the jury could infer from the evidence that the defendant\u2019s family had told Elan school administrators that the defendant had been involved in the victim\u2019s murder. We also reject these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The following evidence is relevant to our review of this claim. As we have indicated, the state adduced testimony from several former Elan students regarding statements that the defendant had made while he resided at Elan. Two of those witnesses, Gregory Coleman and Dorothy Rogers, testified that the defendant had disclosed to them that he had been sent to Elan by his family to protect him from the authorities responsible for investigating the victim\u2019s murder. Several witnesses also testified that it was common at Elan for residents to be confronted either about issues that had precipitated their referral there or about problems they purportedly developed while in residence.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Alice Dunn testified that, at a general meeting that was conducted in response to the defendant\u2019s failed escape attempt, Joseph Ricci, the executive director at Elan, appeared to be reading from a \u201cgood sized\u201d file when he confronted the defendant about the victim\u2019s murder. According to Dunn, during the course of this general meeting, Ricci\u2019s interrogation of the defendant included references to the golf club that had been used to kill the victim. Dunn further testified that Elan administrators usually obtained the information used to confront residents from institutions that the residents previously had attended or, with their parents\u2019 approval, from their therapists.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Detective Lunney testified that the Greenwich police department had played no role in the defendant\u2019s referral to Elan, and that the department never had commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>nicated with Elan administrators about the victim\u2019s murder. Lunney further testified that, during the time period in which the defendant was enrolled at Elan, he was not considered a suspect in the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Finally, evidence adduced at trial indicated that the defendant had told his father that he might have killed the victim. In particular, the defendant\u2019s father confided in his close friend, Mildred lx, that the defendant had stated that he had been drinking on the night of the murder and that he might have been involved in the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In his closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney outlined the reasons why the defendant had been sent to Elan, underscoring the evidence demonstrating that the defendant\u2019s family had sought to shield him from the police and that Elan administrators routinely confronted him with the victim\u2019s murder. The state\u2019s attorney asserted in relevant part: \u201cOne thing that I submit helps tie all this together, particularly on the subject of Elan ... is the defendant\u2019s very presence at that place. The defense scoffs at the idea despite I think such clear evidence of a cover up. Why was the defendant at Elan? This is really not a matter of seeing the forest from the trees. It is genuinely transparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">\u201cClearly, the defendant had a major problem. Already he was an alcoholic, a substance abuser. Already he was beyond the control of his family. He was becoming suicidal. I doubt his family was even aware of the sexual turmoil he was going through. Elan was a last resort but why exactly so drastic a resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">\u201cYou heard from Rogers and Coleman [that] he was being hidden from the police is probably part of it. It is likely, also, if it was a private juvenile justice system, basically, a family\u2019s response is what can we do to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again. And where does that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>ring the truest? At the horrible general meeting with the monster himself, Joe Ricci.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">\u201cOne thing every client of Elan who was there during that particular era recalls vividly is Joe Ricci referring to a file and telling the defendant that he wasn\u2019t getting out of [the boxing] ring until he explained why he killed her, and then being forced to wear a sign, \u2018Confront me on the murder of my neighbor.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">\u201cWhere did Ricci get that information?' Clearly, he didn\u2019t get it from the police. Why did Ricci have that information? Why did Ricci confront the defendant with that information? The answer, the only one that makes sense, lies in why the defendant was there in the first place, lies in why his family felt a need to put him in that awful place. Why? Because that\u2019s what they decided that they had to do with the killer living under their roof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">The defendant contends that this argument was improper because it was based on inadmissible hearsay, namely, statements about the defendant\u2019s involvement in the victim\u2019s murder that the defendant\u2019s family allegedly had made to Ricci and on inadmissible opinion evidence, namely, evidence that the defendant\u2019s family had sent him to Elan because they believed that he had murdered the victim. We are not persuaded by either of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">The assertion of the state\u2019s attorney that the defendant had been sent to Elan because of his apparent involvement in the victim\u2019s murder was not founded on inadmissible hearsay but, rather, on the testimony of Rogers and Coleman, both of whom testified that the defendant himself had explained that his family had enrolled him at Elan to shield him from the police. With respect to the defendant\u2019s challenge to the argument of the state\u2019s attorney that the defendant\u2019s family had informed Elan administrators of their concern that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>defendant had been involved in the victim\u2019s murder, the focus of that argument was the likelihood that the defendant had disclosed his involvement in the murder to one or more members of his family. The inference that the state\u2019s attorney urged was founded on the evidence: several witnesses testified that it was common practice at Elan for students to be confronted by school administrators about events that had precipitated their enrollment at the school. On several occasions, Elan staff members had confronted the defendant regarding his involvement in the victim\u2019s murder. Furthermore, the defendant was not a suspect in the victim\u2019s death when he attended Elan, and the police had no contact with Elan officials while the defendant was a student there. Finally, the defendant had intimated to his father that he was involved in the victim\u2019s murder. In light of that evidence, the argument of the state\u2019s attorney as to what Elan administrators likely had learned from the defendant\u2019s family about the defendant\u2019s involvement in the victim\u2019s murder was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The defendant next claims that, during the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s closing argument, he improperly referred to the defendant as a \u201ckiller\u201d and a \u201cspoiled brat . . . .\u201d We conclude that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s use of the term \u201ckiller,\u201d when placed in its proper context, was not improper. We also conclude that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s reference to the defendant as a \u201cspoiled brat,\u201d although arguably injudicious, manifestly did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">In his closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney asserted that the defendant\u2019s family had sent the defendant to Elan \u201c[b]ecause that\u2019s what they decided that they had to do with the killer living under their roof.\u201d When the word \u201ckiller\u201d is considered in the fuller context of the argument in which it was used, it is clear that the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>attorney\u2019s use of that word was neither gratuitous nor inflammatory; rather, the state\u2019s attorney employed the term merely as a shorthand for \u201cthe person who had killed the victim.\u201d When considered contextually, the challenged reference was benign.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">On two occasions during his closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney described the defendant as a \u201cspoiled brat . ...\u201d On each such occasion, the state\u2019s attorney used the expression while underscoring the evidence that the defendant had told Coleman that he had killed the victim and that he was going to get away with it. In particular, in his initial closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney asserted that, \u201cbefore any resident in Elan had an inkling of the defendant\u2019s having committed this murder, the spoiled brat smugly boasted, I can get away with anything and continued to describe to Coleman how he had beaten [the victim\u2019s] head in with a golf club . . . .\u201d Later, during rebuttal argument, the state\u2019s attorney made a similar assertion, again referring to the defendant as a \u201cspoiled brat . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The state argues that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s use of the term \u201cspoiled brat\u201d was proper because it was based on the testimony of two Elan witnesses, one of whom testified that, while the defendant was a student at Elan, he had been forced to wear a large sign around his neck that stated, \u201cPlease confront me on why I am a spoiled brat,\u201d and another who testified that officials at Elan required the defendant to wear a large white poster board around his neck that stated, \u201cI am a spoiled brat, please confront me on the murder of my friend, Martha Moxley . . . .\u201d The state further maintains that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s reference to the defendant as a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d merely was intended to counter the suggestion, which defense counsel had raised during his cross-examination of Coleman, that, contrary to Coleman\u2019s testimony, the defendant would not have spoken in such an arrogant manner to Coleman because, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the time the defendant allegedly made his remarks to Coleman, Coleman was standing guard over him with a baseball bat. In essence, therefore, the state contends that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s reference to the defendant as a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d was not inappropriate because the reference reasonably was intended to explain the defendant\u2019s \u201csmug bravado in confessing to Coleman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Notwithstanding the evidentiary basis for the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks and the justification advanced by the state for those comments, we believe that it would have been preferable for the state\u2019s attorney to have avoided using the moniker, \u201cspoiled brat,\u201d in referring to the defendant. When the objectionable references are viewed in the broader context of the entire trial, however, it is apparent that they were isolated, relatively innocuous and not unduly prejudicial to the defendant. Because there is no likelihood that the challenged comments affected the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial, his claim of a due process violation is clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s contention that the state\u2019s attorney improperly asserted that the defendant had masturbated on the victim\u2019s dead body. Specifically, the defendant claims that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks were improper because they were based, in part, on the untrustworthy testimony of Coleman. The defendant also contends that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks were improper because they were unsupported by the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">As we have explained, the state introduced into evidence the prior sworn testimony of Coleman. In that testimony, Coleman explained that the defendant had confessed to killing the victim and returning to her body two days later and masturbating on it. Coleman also testified in detail about his struggle with drug addiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>and its effect on his memory. Coleman also acknowledged the discrepancy between his testimony that the defendant had admitted to returning to the victim\u2019s body two days after her death, and the fact that the victim\u2019s body was found the day after she was murdered. In his closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney argued that, after killing the victim, the defendant then had masturbated on her dead body.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument was improper because Coleman was not a credible witness. The defendant was free to argue, and he did argue, and the jury reasonably could conclude, in light of Coleman\u2019s long history of drug abuse, and the questionable nature of his recall with respect to the timing of crucial events, that Coleman\u2019s testimony was not credible. Indeed, Coleman\u2019s testimony that the defendant had admitted to returning to the victim\u2019s body two days after her death lacks credibility because the victim\u2019s body was discovered within a day of her killing. Nevertheless, a fact finder is free to credit one aspect of a witness\u2019 testimony and to discredit another portion thereof. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>260 Conn. 372, 381, 796 A.2d 1191 (2002) (\u201c[i]t is axiomatic that evidentiary inconsistencies are for the jury to resolve, and it is within the province of the jury to believe all or only part of a witness\u2019 testimony\u201d). The fact that the jury could have concluded that some, or even all, of Coleman\u2019s testimony was unworthy of belief, however, did not render the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s reliance on that testimony improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The defendant further contends that the state\u2019s attorney improperly argued that two red marks found on the inside of the victim\u2019s right and left thighs tended to substantiate his contention that the defendant had masturbated on the victim. This claim also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Henry Lee, the criminalist, testified that two reddish marks discovered on the upper portion of the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>inner thighs were consistent with bloody hands attempting to push the victim\u2019s legs apart. On the basis of this evidence, and in view of the defendant\u2019s statement to Coleman that the defendant had masturbated on the victim\u2019s dead body, the state\u2019s attorney urged the jury to conclude that the defendant had masturbated on the victim\u2019s dead body after pushing her legs apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We agree with the state that Lee\u2019s testimony, coupled with the defendant\u2019s alleged statement to Coleman that he had masturbated on the victim\u2019s body, provided a sufficient factual basis for the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument. Although the inference urged by the state\u2019s attorney was far from inescapable, we do not judge the propriety of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument by that standard; we ask, rather, whether the inference was reasonably supported by the evidence. The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument satisfies that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The argument also finds support in the fact that the defendant acknowledged to other witnesses that he had masturbated in a tree next to the victim\u2019s home. In fact, Pugh testified that the defendant had indicated that the tree under which the defendant masturbated was the same tree under which the victim\u2019s body was found. On the basis of this testimony, the state\u2019s attorney argued forcefully that the defendant belatedly had fabricated this version of the events to explain any future discovery of his semen on the victim\u2019s dead body. That argument, which, as we previously have concluded, is supported by the evidence, dovetails persuasively with the state\u2019s theory that the defendant had, in fact, masturbated on the victim\u2019s body after killing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Finally, the defendant contends that the state\u2019s argument was inconsistent with the fact that an autopsy of the victim failed to disclose the presence of semen. It is true that no semen was discovered during the victim\u2019s autopsy. Harold Wayne Carver II, the state\u2019s chief medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>cal examiner, testified, however, that, although the pathologist who performed the victim\u2019s autopsy had failed to detect the presence of semen in the victim\u2019s pubic region, nothing in the autopsy report indicated that any attempt had been made to determine whether semen was present on other areas of the victim\u2019s body, including her buttocks. Because the autopsy did not rule out the possibility of the existence of semen on those other parts of the victim\u2019s body, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument underscoring that possibility was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Finally, the defendant challenges the propriety of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s use of audiovisual evidence in its rebuttal argument. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the state manipulated the defendant\u2019s tape-recorded comments about masturbating in a tree to make it seem as if he were confessing to murder. The defendant claims that the state did this by splicing together a \u201cdeceptively edited version\u201d of his tape-recorded interview and then using it as a voice-over to photographs of the murder scene. We disagree that the state\u2019s use of the audiovisual exhibits was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">At the close of the state\u2019s rebuttal argument, the state\u2019s attorney played for the jury, in three separate segments, approximately two minutes of the thirty-two minute tape-recorded interview that the defendant had given to Richard Hoffman and which previously had been played for the jury in its entirety during the state\u2019s case-in-chief.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> In each segment, the state displayed a transcript of the interview on a screen while the corresponding audio was amplified over a speaker. In the first segment, the following transcript was displayed while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>the corresponding audio was amplified: \u201c[A]nyway, we got home and all the lights, most of the lights were out, and I went walking around the house. Nobody was on the porch, um, went upstairs to my sister\u2019s room. Her door was closed, um, and I remember that Andrea [Shakespeare] had gone home . . . .\u201d After a short pause, the same text appears on the screen again, only this time the last phrase, \u201cand I remember that Andrea [Shakespeare] had gone home\u201d appears in slightly larger font and in red letters, while the rest of the text appears in slightly smaller, black letters. Immediately following the first segment, the state\u2019s attorney argued to the jury in relevant part: \u201cOn supposedly getting home from [James Dowdle\u2019s house] he goes to his sister\u2019s room and remembers that [Shakespeare] had gone home. If you recall the credible testimony in this trial, the Monty Python tour, it already departed when Julie [Skakel] and [Shakespeare] had stepped out of the house to take [Shakespeare] home. Somebody who had actually left already would have had no idea of [Julie Skakel\u2019s] trip to take Andrea [Shakespeare] home. On the other hand, the \u2018Michael come back here\u2019 [figure], as he ran past Julie [Skakel] as she exited the house, would have been fully aware of this fact.\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The second segment displayed the following text while the corresponding audio of the defendant\u2019s voice was amplified over a speaker: \u201cI said, \u2018Fuck this, [y]ou <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>know why should I do this, you know, Martha likes me, I\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll go get a kiss from Martha.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll be bold tonight.\u2019 [Y]ou know booze gave me, made me, gave me courage again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Finally, at the very end of his rebuttal argument, the state\u2019s attorney stated in regard to the interview conducted by Hoffman: \u201cAnd then, the defendant does the most amazing thing .... He takes us on his staggering walk down memory lane. He first avoids the driveway oval where the club head was found and, more likely, [where] he first caught up with [the victim], given [Henry] Lee\u2019s testimony about blood in the driveway where the whole terrible thing started. Then he has himself under a street light throwing rocks and yelling into that circle with the exact same motion that had to have been [sic] used to beat [the victim] to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">\u201cWhy this explanation. It\u2019s kind of obvious. As he explained to . . . Hoffman, what if somebody saw me last night and then . . . .\u2019\u2019At this point, the state\u2019s attorney stopped talking and the third segment of the Hoffman interview appeared on the screen while the corresponding audio was amplified over the speaker: \u201cAnd then I woke up, went to sleep, then I woke up to [Dorothy] Moxley saying \u2018Michael, have . . . you seen Martha?\u2019 \u201d Just as the defendant finishes saying, \u201c \u2018Michael, have . . . you seen Martha,\u2019 \u201d a photograph of the victim, smiling, appeared in the lower right hand comer of the screen beneath the written text. After a short pause, the following text appeared on the screen while the corresponding audio was amplified: \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018What?\u2019 And I was like still high from the night before, a little drunk, then I was like \u2018What?\u2019 I was like \u2018Oh my God, did they see me last night?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I\u2019m like, and I remember just having a feeling of panic.\u201d At this point, a photograph, previously introduced into evidence, depicting the victim\u2019s body lying under the pine tree, appeared in the lower right-hand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>comer of the screen, to the side of the written text. After a few seconds, the photograph disappeared and the following text appeared while the corresponding audio was amplified: \u201cLike \u2018Oh shit.\u2019 You know. Like my worry of what I went to bed with, like may ... I don\u2019t know, you know what I mean. I just had, I had a feeling of panic.\u201d Another photograph, which also had been introduced into evidence, depicting the victim\u2019s badly beaten body, then appeared in the lower right-hand comer of the screen, next to the written text. The state\u2019s attorney argued: \u201cHow could the sight of Dorothy Moxley possibly produce a feeling of panic in an innocent person, in a person who had gone to sleep knowing nothing of [the victim\u2019s] murder. The evidence tells you that only a person who had experienced that poor girl lying under the tree, not in his dreams but firsthand, would have a cause to panic on awakening that morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">As we previously have stated, \u201ccounsel is entitled to considerable leeway in deciding how best to highlight or to underscore the facts, and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, for which there is adequate support in the record. We therefore never have categorically barred counsel\u2019s use of such rhetorical devices, be they linguistic or in the form of visual aids, as long as there is no reasonable likelihood that the particular device employed will confuse the jury or otherwise prejudice the opposing party. Indeed, to our knowledge, no court has erected a per se bar to the use of visual aids by counsel during closing arguments. On the contrary, the use of such aids is a matter entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">We conclude that it was not improper for the state\u2019s attorney to play for the jury approximately two minutes of the defendant\u2019s tape-recorded interview with Hoffman and to display trial exhibit photographs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>victim while the tape was being played. Because the defendant does not contest the propriety of the state\u2019s use of the first two segments of the tape-recorded interview, we focus solely on the defendant\u2019s claims regarding the third segment. In particular, the defendant claims that the state\u2019s use of the third segment of the tape-recorded interview was improper because it omitted portions that contradicted the argument of the state\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that \u201c[t]he omitted passage just before the excerpts highlighted by the state clearly indicates that the defendant was talking about his panic regarding masturbating in the tree, not about his involvement in the murder of [the victim].\u201d The defendant contends that, by not playing the earlier portions of the tape and by displaying two gruesome photographs of the murder scene while the jury listened to the defendant express his fear that he may have been seen in the victim\u2019s yard on the night of the murder, the state conveyed to the jury the unfair impression that the defendant\u2019s panic was due to the fact that he had murdered the victim, when, in reality, it was due to his fear that someone may have seen him masturbating in the tree on the Moxleys\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>After viewing the audiovisual presentation, we are not persuaded that there is any reasonable likelihood that the state\u2019s presentation confused the jury or prejudiced the defendant in any way. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the presentation itself was not deceptive. That presentation consisted of the written transcript of the interview with Hoffman, which the jury already had seen in its entirety, the corresponding audio and three unaltered photographs of the victim that had been entered into evidence, one of which depicted her alive and smiling and two of which had been taken at the scene of the crime. As we previously have noted, the three photographs were juxtaposed with the transcript of the defendant\u2019s statements to Hoffman describing his panic upon seeing the victim\u2019s mother on the morning after the victim\u2019s murder but before her body had been discovered. By juxtaposing the photographs of the victim with the defendant\u2019s statements, the state\u2019s attorney sought to convey to the jury in graphic form what the state believed was the real reason for the defendant\u2019s panic, that is, that he had killed the victim. The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s prefatory and follow-up remarks to the segment make this point unmistakably clear.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the state\u2019s use of audiovisual aides during closing argument violated his right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">In this opinion SULLIVAN, C.

Shakespeare, however, was unable to articulate the basis of her recollection and conceded that she had no specific memory either of the Lincoln Continental leaving without the defendant or seeing the defendant in the house after the car had departed for Dowdies home.

She recalled hearing dogs barking and what sounded like excited young voices.

Keegan testified that, along with the visible similarities between the murder weapon and the club seized from the Skakel home, namely, the brand and the make, a criminalist\u2019s examination of the murder weapon and the seized club revealed that the markings on the heads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>of the clubs were consistent with the two clubs previously having come in contact with one another.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\"> Dowdle and Rushton Skakel, Jr., corroborated 1he defendant\u2019s statement that he had spent part of that <em>evening </em>at Dowdle\u2019s home watching television.

Julie Skakel testified that the defendant had contemplated jumping off the Triborough Bridge because he felt guilty about having slept in his deceased mother\u2019s dress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b668-8\"> The state also introduced the testimony of Matthew Tucharoni, who stated that, in the spring of 1976, the defendant, accompanied by Eushton Skakel, Jr., and Julie Skakel, came to the barbershop in Greenwich where Tucharoni then was employed and inquired about a haircut. Tucharoni testified that while he was preparing to cut the defendant\u2019s hair, he overheard the defendant say, \u201cI am going to kill him.\u201d According to Tucharoni, Julie Skakel responded, \u201cyou can\u2019t do that,\u201d and the defendant replied, \u201cWhy not?

According to Seigen, \u201c[a] general meeting was probably the scariest word that you would hear when you were at Elan.\u201d A typical general meeting, which was attended by 100 or more Elan residents and staff, focused on one or two residents who were singled out for violating Elan rules. Seigen recalled that the defendant was the subject of a general meeting as a result of his failed attempt to run away from the facility. Seigen stated that he first learned of the defendant\u2019s possible involvement in the victim\u2019s murder when it was announced at a general meeting by Joseph Ricci, Elan\u2019s executive director. Elizabeth Arnold, another former Elan resident, testified that, at that particular general meeting, which lasted approximately three hours, Ricci continuously had confronted the defendant about various issues and that four or five Elan residents \u201cbrutalized\u201d the defendant in a boxing ring. Other former residents of Elan also testified about the details of the torment that the defendant had endured at this meeting, including accusations leveled against the defendant that he had killed the victim. The defendant\u2019s initial response to this interrogation was to deny his involvement in the murder. After several rounds in the boxing ring, however, the defendant stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d in response to questioning regarding his involvement in the murder. During the course of his enrollment at Elan, the defendant also was forced to wear a large cardboard sign around his neck, another form of punishment at Elan. The sign read, \u201cConfront me on why I murdered Martha Moxley,\u201d or words to that effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\"> For example, the victim made an. entry in her diary on September 12, 1975, in which she stated that, while she was out driving in Thomas Skakel\u2019s car with several other teenagers, including the defendant, \u201cI drove a little then ...

In that entry, the victim stated that \u201cMichael was so totally out of it that he was being a real asshole in his actions [and] words. He kept telling me that I was leading [Thomas Skakel] on when I don\u2019t like him (except as a friend) [and] I said, well how about you [and] Jackie.

I can\u2019t be friends [with Thomas Skakel] just because I talk to him, it doesn\u2019t mean I like him.\u201d In a subsequent entry, dated October 4, 1975, the victim describes events that had occurred at a school dance and at a party after the dance at a neighbor\u2019s home. The entry included the following: \u201cAfterwards I went to Mouakaud\u2019s for a party! I saw everybody. [Thomas Skakel] was being an ass. At the dance he kept putting his arms around me [and] making moves.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b674-8\"> Defense counsel adduced testimony from Joseph Alexander Jachimczyk, a forensic pathologist from Houston, Texas, who concluded that the time of the victim\u2019s death most likely was around 10 p.m. on October 30, 1975. Jachimczyk\u2019s testimony was bolstered by the testimony of several people, including Dorothy Moxley, lx and David Skakel, that they had heard dogs barking in the vicinity of the crime scene at approximately that time.

First, at no time during the transfer stage of the proceedings in juvenile court did the defendant ever claim that he was mentally ill or deficient, and he never challenged the express finding of the juvenile court that there was nothing in the record to suggest that a mental health commitment was warranted. Second, the defendant concedes that the juvenile court could not have ordered him to undergo a physical or mental evaluation because the court was barred from doing so by Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7 1125 (2) (Cum.

Id., 347; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 438. The appeal in <em>Ellis </em>followed the decision by the state, after our decision in <em>Paradise, </em>to charge Ellis and Paradise with capital felony arising out of the same murder that had been the subject of the appeal in <em>Paradise. </em>Following the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the capital felony charges against Ellis and Paradise, the state appealed, and we reversed the judgment of the trial court, concluding, inter alia, that the prosecution of Ellis and Paradise was not barred by the five year limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 460.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b687-4\"> In <em>Paradise, </em>the sole issue presented was whether P.A. 76-35, which, as we have explained, expressly excepted all class A felonies, including murder, from the five year limitation period otherwise applicable to felonies, applied retroactively to offenses committed prior to the effective date of that amendment, that is, April 6, 1976. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 347. After concluding that the amendment had prospective effect only; id., 350; we affirmed the judgment dismissing the murder charges, which was based on the trial court\u2019s application of the five year limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193. In light of the narrow issue raised by the parties in <em>Paradise, </em>we had no occasion expressly to consider, in that case, whether the legislature had intended to subject the offense of murder to the five year limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193; rather, we assumed, like the parties, that the limitation period applied equally to murder as to all other felonies. Thereafter, in <em>Ellis, </em>we were required to decide whether the five year limitation period of the pre1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193 applied to the offense of capital felony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 441. After undertaking a detailed historical analysis of this state\u2019s criminal statutes of limitation, we concluded that the statutory scheme governing capital felonies was not intended to upset the \u201cdeep-rooted understanding\u201d; id., 459; that capital crimes, because of their gravity, are not subject to repose. Id., 459-60. We reached a similar conclusion in <em>State v. Golino, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 435. In <em>Golino, </em>this court considered the claim of the defendant, Anthony Golino, that his prosecution for a 1973 murder in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 53a-54 (a) was barred by the five year limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193 because Golino had not been charged with that murder until 1984. In contrast to the 1975 revision of the murder statute under which the defendants in <em>Ellis </em>were charged, the 1972 revision of the murder statute under which Golino was charged effectively had been declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972). As we explained in <em>Golino, </em>the then applicable murder statute carried a possible penalty of death; <em>State </em>v. <em>Golino, </em>supra, 439; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 53a-54 (c); and, therefore, for statute of limitation purposes, we treated the case as one \u201cpunishable by death . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golino, </em>supra, 447. We further concluded that, although the state was barred by <em>Furman </em>from seeking the death penalty against Golino, that fact did not affect the conclusion, based on our historical analysis, that we had reached in <em>Ellis, </em>namely, that the legislature never intended for capital crimes, because of their gravity, to be subject to any period of limitation.

The trial court in the present case relied heavily on the historical analysis that we employed in <em>Ellis </em>and <em>Golino </em>in concluding that, despite the broad language of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193, the legislature never intended to establish a limitation period for the offense of murder because of the gravity of <em>that </em>offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\"> In light of our conclusion that P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, applies to the offense in the present case, we have no reason to address the state\u2019s alternate contention that the legislature never intended to establish a limitation period for murder and, consequently, that the five year limitation period of the pre1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193, despite its facial applicability to <em>all </em>felonies, including murder, does not bar the state\u2019s prosecution of the defendant for the murder of the victim. Indeed, this court is bound to consider <em>first </em>the state\u2019s claim that P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, applies retroactively to the offense in the present case because, if that claim has merit, P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, necessarily trumps the possible applicability of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193. Because we conclude that P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, does, indeed, have retrospective applicability to the offense in the present case, the issue of whether the legislature intended for the pre-1976 limitation period of \u00a7 54-193 to apply to murder is a moot question for purposes of this case. For purposes of our analysis and resolution of the issue presented, however, we assume, without deciding, that the five year limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193 applies to murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b689-8\"> There is no dispute that the murder of the victim in the present case did not give rise to a charge of capital murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\"> In <em>Paradise, </em>the state maintained that the retroactive application of the 1976 amendment to \u00a7 54-193 did not affect Paradise\u2019s or Ellis\u2019 substantive rights because, at the time that they allegedly had committed the murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>with which they were charged, the five year limitation period of the pre1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193 had not yet expired.

Because the remedial purpose of a criminal statute of limitation is to provide for repose after the expiration of a specified period of time, the statute must be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>strued liberally to effectuate that purpose. This maxim of liberal construction, however, is not determinative of whether the pre-1976 amendment version or theposi-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193 applies to the criminal conduct that is the subject of the present case because <em>both </em>provisions represent a legislative mandate; the question is <em>which </em>such mandate applies. Of course, once it has been determined which provision is applicable, then that provision must be liberally construed in favor of repose. But until such time as the applicable statute is identified, the doctrine of liberal construction has no applicability. Thus, although in <em>Paradise, </em>we referred to this tenet of statutory construction; <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 352; it provides no guidance on the issue of whether the pre-1976 amendment or the post-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193 applies to the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\"> We also note that our holding in <em>Paradise </em>leads to a result that is inconsistent with the rationale underlying that holding when it is applied to a statutory amendment that <em>reduces </em>the limitation period.

This result is incompatible with the rationale of our holding in Paradise, namely, the rule of strict construction, a rule that, when applicable, requires us to construe statutes against the state and in favor of criminal defendants.

Rather, the court must ask whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment. The conclusion that a particular rule operates \u2018retroactively\u2019 comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event. Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity. However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have \u2018sound . . . instinct[s],\u2019 . . . and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 269-70. As this court recently has observed, however, in criminal cases, we generally look to the date of the offense in determining whether a change in the law is considered retroactive; <em>In re Daniel H., </em>supra, 237 Conn. 377; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 401 (rejecting argument of state that applying amendatory extension of statute of limitations to conduct occurring before expiration of preamend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>ment limitation period does not constitute retroactive application of amendment); and, for purposes of this appeal, we adhere to that general rule. It is important to note, though, that regardless of whether the application of an amendment to a criminal statute of limitation is characterized as prospective because the original limitation period had not expired prior to the amendment\u2019s enactment, or, under the same factual scenario, that amendment is deemed to apply retroactively because it is procedural or remedial in nature, the result is precisely the same: the limitation period as amended, rather than the original limitation period, is the applicable limitation period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> Indeed, as the Washington Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[a] review of the multitude of cases decided by many courts on [the] subject [of whether an amendment extending a criminal statute of limitation applies to offenses not already time barred when the amendment was enacted] suggests that the labeling of statutes of limitation and changes thereto as \u2018procedural\u2019 or \u2018substantive\u2019, \u2018prospective\u2019 or \u2018retrospective\u2019 or \u2018retroactive\u2019, and as subject to \u2018strict\u2019 or \u2018liberal\u2019 interpretation, and then letting the consequences flow according to the label affixed, tends to obscure rather than clarify the law.

We fully agree with the essential thrust of this statement. It bears reiteration that we use the procedural-substantive distinction, like other canons of statutory construction, merely as a means to attain the fundamental goal of ascertaining the presumed intent of the legislature. Indeed, it is only after consideration of \u201cwhat statutes of limitations in criminal cases are, and how they function\u201d; id; that we, like the Washington Supreme Court in <em>Hodgson, </em>have reached the conclusion that such statutes are presumptively retroactive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\"> We note lhat, in both <em>Ellis </em>and <em>Golino, </em>we underscored the significance of Senator Neiditz\u2019 comment that P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1, was intended to clarify existing law.

The similarity between the two inquiries is not surprising: both involve a determination of whether the retroactive application of a statute will upset vested rights or reasonable reliance interests such that applying the statute retroactively would be fundamentally unfair.

As we previously has observed, although legislative inaction following our interpretation of a statute does not necessarily constitute legislative affirmation of that interpretation, such inaction may be understood as a validation of our construction. See, e.g., <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>254 Conn. 214, 252, 756 A.2d 1264 (2000). Under the present circumstances, we do not believe that legislative inaction provides a reason to refrain from overruling <em>Paradise. </em>We issued our opinion in <em>Paradise </em>in March, 1983, approximately seven years after the April 6, 1976, effective date of P.A. 76-35, \u00a7 1. Thus, any uncharged murder or class A felony that, under our opinion in <em>Paradise, </em>was subject to the five year limitation period of the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193, necessarily had been committed no less than seven years prior to the issuance of our opinion in <em>Paradise. </em>Consequently, by the time we issued our opinion in <em>Paradise, </em>the five year limitation period that we had deemed applicable to those crimes in <em>Paradise </em>already would have expired with respect to those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Although the United States Supreme Court first held in 2003 that the ex post facto clause of the United States constitution prohibits a state from extending the limitation period for an offense committed after the expiration of the original limitation period; see <em>Stogner </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 539 U.S. 632; it was universally recognized at the time of our decision in <em>Paradise </em>that an amendment that operated to revive an expired limitation period with respect to a particular offense violated the ex post facto clause. See, e.g., id., 617-19 (explaining unanimous agreement of courts and commentators that ex post facto clause bars amendment to limitation period that revives previously expired limitation period). Indeed, in <em>Paradise, </em>we expressly declined to decide whether the retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitation violated the ex post facto clause; <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 350; even though, as in the present case, the extended limitation period became effective prior to the expiration of the previously applicable limitation period.

Because it was clear in 1983 that the ex post facto clause prohibited any amendment to \u00a7 54-193 that purported to revive a previously time barred prosecution, we must presume that the legislature elected to refrain from amending the pre-1976 amendment version of \u00a7 54-193 for <em>that </em>reason, and <em>not necessarily </em>because it agreed with our conclusion in <em>Paradise.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\"> The defendant\u2019s discovery request was twenty pages in length.

In any event, the trial court never made any findings on the materiality issue, which necessarily involves a fact specific inquiry into the relative import of any exculpatory evidence that has been suppressed in view of the trial evidence as a whole. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gil, </em>297 F.3d 93, 103 (2d Cir. 2002) (\u201cWe assess materiality or prejudice in light of the trial evidence. Where the evidence against the defendant is ample or overwhelming, the withheld <em>Brady </em>material is less likely to be material than if the evidence of guilt is thin.\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>221 Conn. 264, 294, 604 A.2d 793 (1992) (noting that reviewing court will give deference to finding of trial court, on claim of possible <em>Brady </em>violation because of \u201cdifficulty inherent in measuring the effect of nondisclosure in the course of a lengthy trial with many witnesses and exhibits\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). For that reason, and because our rejection of the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s resolution of the suppression issue is dispositive of the defendant\u2019s claim concerning the composite drawing, we do not address the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court improperly determined that the drawing was not material.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\"> We make this presumption in light of the defendant\u2019s representation that he had not been provided with a copy of the composite drawing and because the trial court, having rejected the defendant\u2019s request for a hearing on the issue, made no factual finding on that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\"> As we previously have stated, \u201calthough we encourage the use of open file policies and recognize that this practice may increase the efficiency and the fairness of the criminal process ...

The defendant, however, never filed a supplemental discovery request for the composite drawing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\"> Because the defendant or his trial counsel had actual notice of the existence of the composite drawing, we need not decide whether the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>dant\u2019s ready access to Morganti would have been sufficient, without more, to have relieved the state of its burden of production under <em>Brady. </em>See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>LeRoy, </em>supra, 687 F.2d 619 (government\u2019s failure to disclose witness\u2019 allegedly exculpatory grand jury testimony does not constitute suppression of that testimony for purposes of <em>Brady </em>when defendant knew of witness and fact that witness might have testified).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\"> We note that the trial court issued its discovery order on August 15, 2001, and that the state filed a notice with the court on September 25, 2001, that it had complied with that order. In the absence of any claim or indication to the contrary, we presume that the 1975 and 1994 investigative reports that refer to the composite drawing were included in the materials turned over to the defendant and his trial counsel in accordance with the state\u2019s notice of compliance. Because the evidentiary portion of the trial did not commence until May 7, 2002, the defendant and his trial counsel had more than sufficient opportunity to review those reports prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gil, </em>297 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2002), is therefore misplaced. In <em>Oil, </em>the government did not disclose a certain exculpatory memorandum until one business day before trial even though the defendant, John Gil, had made numerous specific requests for such evidence. Id., 105-106. In addition, because the memorandum was located \u201camong five reams\u201d of other documents and not clearly indexed, it was \u201cnot easily identifiable as a document of significance . . . .\u201d Id., 106. Under all of the circumstances of the government\u2019s belated disclosure, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the memorandum had been suppressed because, \u201c[although the . . . memo[randum] was produced before trial, the defense was not in a position to read it, identify its usefulness, and use it.\u201d Id. In the present case, the defendant or his trial counsel had notice of the composite drawing well in advance of trial but failed to request it until after the trial had concluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"73\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\"> We fully acknowledge, of course, that, as the United States Supreme Court recently has observed, the decisions of that court \u201clend no support to the notion that defendants must scavenge for hints of undisclosed <em>Brady </em>material when the prosecution represents that all such material has been disclosed.\u201d <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Dretke, </em>540 U.S. 668, 695, 124 S.

Nevertheless, when, as in the present case, a defendant is on notice of the existence of <em>Brady </em>material that the state has failed to turn over, the defendant is required to make reasonable efforts to obtain the exculpatory evidence.

Several different people took turns in the ring with the defendant, and he was required to fight each of them. The staff at Elan did not terminate the fighting until the defendant stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d in response to the accusation that he had murdered the victim.

The Globe article is largely devoted to purported Kennedy secrets, many of which allegedly were to be revealed in the defendant\u2019s unfinished and unpublished tell-all book; apparently, the book proposal had been leaked to the press. The article does state, however, that the defendant admitted that he had \u201clied to investigators probing the murder of [the victim] in 1975\u201d; T. Kuncl, \u201cMichael Skakel Linked to Shocking Book Proposal That Airs . . . Kennedy Dirty Laundry,\u201d Globe, February 29, 2000, p. 4; and that he once was required to wear a sign around his neck indicating that he had murdered the victim when he was attending the Elan School. Id., p. 9. Although these statements relate directly to the defendant and his purported involvement in the victim\u2019s murder, other evidence adduced at trial established the same facts. In particular, the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>not truthful with the police. He told them that, on the night of the murder, he went to bed shortly after returning from James Dowdle\u2019s house and that he did not leave the house thereafter, even though he subsequently admitted that, later that evening, he masturbated in a tree outside the victim\u2019s room. Moreover, the defendant himself presented evidence demonstrating that Elan officials had accused him of murdering the victim and that he had been forced to say and do things, including wearing signs, indicating that he had murdered the victim. In addition, the Globe article indicates that, according to the leaked book proposal, the defendant disapproved of his family\u2019s \u201csecrets,\u201d and did not intend to perpetuate them. For example, the article quotes the defendant as stating: \u201cI am a member of a family sick unto death with generations of secrets\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., p. 4; \u201cI have concluded that there is no escape from recurrent tragedy that does not begin with telling the truth\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; and \u201c T have seen wasted lives, tremendous pain and needless death\u2019 due to the Kennedy secrets . . . [a]nd [I don\u2019t] want to be a part of it any longer.\u201d Id., p. 9. We note, finally, that the Globe article contains a disclaimer that the defendant\u2019s attorney had informed the Globe that \u201cthe book proposal does not contain the words of [the defendant] and that [the defendant] did not endorse or approve the text of the proposal. [The defendant] claims it was written by the co-author, Richard Hoffman.</p>\n<p id=\"A-X\">\u201c[The defendant\u2019s] lawyer says the proposal was \u2018leaked and circulated in an effort to discredit [the defendant] and various members of his family. \u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"AmI\">The National Enquirer article also contains certain references to the defendant and his purported involvement in the victim\u2019s murder. In particular, the article mentions the allegedly close friendship between the defendant and a Kennedy family babysitter and recounts the speculation of a \u201cfriend\u201d that the defendant may have confessed to the babysitter that he had murdered the victim. \u201cShocking Murder Case Evidence Will Blow the Lid Off . . . Kennedy Family\u2019s Darkest Secrets,\u201d National Enquirer, March 19, 2002, pp. 16-17. The article also contains, however, a denial of that speculative comment by the defendant\u2019s attorney. See id., p. 17. Additionally, the article mentions \u201ctalk of a Kennedy family cover-up\u201d of the victim\u2019s murder. Id. The article states that the defendant\u2019s brother, Thomas Skakel, \u201cwas shipped off to Ireland a month after the investigation began. And [the defendant] refused to cooperate with police.\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"95\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\"> The defendant notes that the National Enquirer article, which was published on March 19, 2002, postdated Ridge\u2019s conversation with Attanian and, therefore, that article was irrelevant to the issue of from what source Ridge had obtained the information about the defendant that she had provided to Attanian. Although we agree that Ridge could not possibly have obtained the information from that article, that fact supports, rather than undermines, the state\u2019s claim that, contrary to Ridge\u2019s testimony, the article was not a source of the information 1hat she had provided to Attanian. Moreover, defense counsel neither objected to the state\u2019s use of the National Enquirer article on that ground nor offered to stipulate that the article could not have been the source of any of the facts to which Ridge had referred in her conversation with Attanian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"96\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\"> Immediately following the admission of the articles, the trial court instructed the jury that the articles were \u201cnot being admitted for the truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>of what they contain .... They are not being admitted for the truth of what they contain, only in connection with this witness\u2019 testimony that she collected them as some sources of information relating to these claims that she gave Mr. Attanian, that she claims not to have known directly from the defendant . . . .\u201d The trial court reiterated its limiting instruction in its charge to the jury: \u201c[Ridge] disavowed some of the statements she attributed to the defendant about what he had said concerning the killing and what she later related to her then friend Attanian. You will recall [Ridge] identifying certain tabloids as representative of the sources she used to make such statements. The tabloids, the papers, were not admitted for the truth of what they published but, instead, as evidence that they did not contain certain information she had accredited to the defendant and related to Attanian. So, the state is asking you to believe that she heard these things from the defendant. That\u2019s for you to decide. But this is why those exhibits were admitted, and you must follow this and other limiting instructions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"97\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\"> The record reveals that Littleton did not serve a prison sentence in connection with his burglary convictions.

See Conn.

I agree with the majority\u2019s well reasoned and thorough opinion concluding that the judgment of conviction of the defendant, Michael Skakel, for the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley must be affirmed. With respect to the threshold issue, however, of whether the defendant\u2019s prosecution was time barred, although I agree with the majority that it was not, I reach that conclusion by a different route. I would dispose of that issue on the basis of the statute of limitations in effect at the time of the 1975 murder, as did the trial court, consistent with our long-standing jurisprudential approach to construction of criminal statutes, and in response to the state\u2019s principal argument to this court, and, therefore, I would not reach the issue of whether the 1976 amendment to the statute of limitations had a retroactive effect. In my view, the crime of murder was not subject to the statute of limitations in effect in 1975, and, indeed, there never has been a limitations period on the prosecution of murder. Accordingly, I join in all but part II of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">As with any issue of statutory construction, I begin with the pertinent language of the statute itself. The statute of limitations in effect at the time of the murder, General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 54-193, provided in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be prosecuted for . . . any crime or misdemeanor of which the punishment is or may be imprisonment . . . except within five years next after the offense has been committed . . . .\u201d The defendant was charged and convicted of the crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>murder under General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-54a (c), which provided: \u201cMurder is punishable as a class A felony unless it is a capital felony and the death penalty is imposed as provided by section 53a-46a.\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The defendant was not charged under the capital felony statute, General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-54b, and, therefore, could have been sentenced only to a term of imprisonment and not sentenced to death. In accordance with that fact, the defendant makes the following arguments in support of his claim that the prosecution is time barred: (1) the plain language of the statute of limitations precludes his prosecution because the defendant was indicted for a class A felony, punishable by imprisonment, and not a capital felony; (2) in <em>State </em>v. Paradise, 189 Conn. 346, 353, 456 A.2d 305 (1983), this court implicitly recognized, under facts indistinguishable from this case, that the same statute of limitations barred the prosecution of the defendants in that case; (3) when the legislature amended the Penal Code in 1973 to reinstate the death penalty, it intended that only the most heinous murders\u2014those designated as capital felonies\u2014would not be subject to the statute of limitations; and (4) the legislature\u2019s intent to exclude only capital felony murders from the statute of limitations is consistent with the legislative history of the murder statutes because noncapital murders that formerly were labeled \u201csecond degree\u201d murders were subject to a statute of limitations for 125 years\u2014from 1846 to 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">As an initial matter, I reject out of hand the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 346, and welcome the opportunity to correct a misimpression of the law that it suggests. In <em>Paradise, </em>the \u201csole issue\u201d before the court was whether the 1976 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>amendment to \u00a7 54-193, which expressly permitted unlimited prosecution of any class A felony, not just a capital felony, was by its own terms retroactive so as to apply to a 1974 murder. Id., 347. The state had failed to assert that the pre-1976 version of \u00a7 54-193 did not apply to a class A felony murder, and, consequently, the <em>Paradise </em>court undoubtedly proceeded from the premise that the defendants\u2019 prosecution in that case was time barred under \u00a7 54-193 when addressing the state\u2019s claim that the 1976 amendment to that statute applied retroactively. As such, the <em>Paradise </em>court never considered the question at issue here, relying on the superficial reading of the statute of limitations conceded by the parties in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Looking beyond a superficial reading of \u00a7 54-193, I disagree that the \u201cplain language\u201d of the statute of limitations compels the result suggested by the defendant. As the discussion that follows amply demonstrates, the \u201ccrime\u201d to which the statute of limitations refers is the general crime of murder\u2014a crime punishable <em>either </em>as a class A felony or as a capital felony. Accordingly, the crime of murder implicitly is excluded from the statute of limitations. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 441, 497 A.2d 974 (1985) (concluding that crimes that must or <em>may </em>be punished by death are excluded by necessary implication from statute of limitations), on appeal after remand sub nom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>213 Conn. 388, 567 A.2d 1221 (1990). My conclusion, however, rests not only on the language of the statute, but also on the well settled principle of statutory construction that the court does not construe a statute in a manner that runs counter to reason. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z (permitting resort to legislative history when plain meaning of statute yields absurd or unworkable result); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>263 Conn. 524, 553, 821 A.2d 247 (2003). The defendant\u2019s \u201cplain language\u201d construction would yield such a result because, contrary to the defendant\u2019s view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>it would disturb a long-standing and consistent practice in this state of excluding murder from the statute of limitations. I begin, therefore, with the histoiy of the statute of limitations and the murder statutory scheme evidencing this long-standing practice and then turn to the amendments to this scheme immediately preceding and following 1975 to ascertain whether the legislature intended to depart radically from that practice by subjecting the prosecution of most murders to a five year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">It is undisputed that the crime of murder was excluded, by implication, from Connecticut\u2019s earliest statutes of limitations, beginning in 1672 until 1846.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 441-44. Throughout this period, murder was a capital offense. Id., 448-49. Although, in 1846, our legislature divided murder into first degree (capital) and second degree (noncapital) offenses; Public Acts 1846, c. 16; thereby permitting certain less heinous murders to be punished by imprisonment, our early case law indicates that the legislature did not intend by this change to alter the bedrock rule that murder is not subject to a statute of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>19 Conn. 388, 392 (1849) (\u201cIt is apparent from [the 1846 public act], that it was not the design of the legislature to create any new offen[s]e; or [to] change the law applicable to murder, except so far as the punishment was concerned. The crime still remains, as it was at common law; and in the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>aggravated cases, the person convicted is liable to the original punishment, while others, whose crimes are less aggravated, are punished with less severity.\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cross, </em>72 Conn. 722, 729, 46 A. 148 (1900) (\u201cThe meaning of our statute defining murder in the first degree, as enacted in 1846, has not been changed by subsequent legislation. It does not define a new crime, nor in any way affect the definition of the crime of murder as it before existed; it simply sets forth the circumstances attending the crime which must determine the punishment of murder, whether it be death or imprisonment for life.\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>132 Conn. 39, 43-44, 42 A.2d 354 (1945) (\u201c[t]he [1846 public act] was not designed to create any new offense or change the law applicable to murder except as to the punishment\u201d), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomassi, </em>137 Conn. 113, 123, 75 A.2d 67 (1950); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacowitz, </em>128 Conn. 40, 44, 20 A.2d 470 (1941) (\u201cMurder, at common law, is the unlawful killing of one human being by another with malice aforethought. . . . The Connecticut statute, Cum. Sup. 1935, \u00a7 1685c, has not changed this definition but provides a more severe penalty where certain features such as premeditation are present.\u201d). Indeed, for twenty-four years after the 1846 amendment, until 1870, the state was not even required to specify the degree of the murder in the indictment; the jury made such a distinction after determining whether the defendant was guilty of the general common-law crime of murder. See General Statutes (1849 Rev.) tit. 6, c. 2, \u00a7 3 (\u201cthe jury before whom any person indicted for murder shall be tried, shall, if they find such person guilty, ascertain in their verdict, whether it be murder in the first degree or second degree\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>47 Conn. 95, 117 (1879) (noting that legislature changed law in 1870; Acts of 1870, c. 73; requiring that indictment specify degree of offense). Even then, the impetus for doing so apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>was to give notice to the defendant of whether the state alleged that the crime was premeditated. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>supra, 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">What implicitly had been understood under well established practice\u2014that there was no statute of limitations on the common-law crime of murder, irrespective of whether the defendant had been convicted of first or second degree murder\u2014became manifest as a result of the legislature\u2019s enactment of the Penal Code in 1969. See Public Acts 1969, No. 828, \u00a7\u00a7 54, 55. Under the 1969 Penal Code, which was made effective in 1971, the legislature abolished the distinction between the two degrees of murder, providing a single, simplified definition of murder and conferring discretion on the jury or the court to decide in each case whether to impose the death penalty depending on the circumstances of the crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 53a-46 (b) (permitting jury or court to consider either death or imprisonment); General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 53a-54 (c) (\u201c[m]urder is punishable as a class A felony unless the death penalty is imposed as provided by section 53a-46\u201d). Thus, under the 1969 Penal Code, there clearly was no statute of limitations on murder. In other words, because <em>any </em>murder potentially could be punished by death, there was no statute of limitations on the prosecution of <em>all </em>murders under the 1969 Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>In 1973, however, the legislature repealed that scheme and enacted \u00a7 53a-54a,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> pursuant to which the defendant in the present case was convicted, providing for punishment of murder <em>either </em>as a class A felony or, under specific circumstances, as a capital felony. See Public Acts 1973, No. 73-137, \u00a7 2 (P.A. 73-137); General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-54a. Thus, the critical question is whether the legislature intended, when making these changes, to disturb the existing, long-standing statutory scheme under which murder was not subject to a statute of limitations. The context in which these changes took place and the legislative history of P.A. 73-137 strongly indicate that the legislature did not intend to distinguish between class A felony murder and capital felony murder for statute of limitations purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The legislature\u2019s actions in 1973 to repeal and replace the existing murder scheme was necessitated by the 1972 decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972), in which that court struck down as unconstitutional the broad, discretionary type of capital murder scheme that was in effect under our 1969 Penal Code. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>164 Conn. 661, 661-62, 295 A.2d 666 (1972). House Bill No. 8297 proposed to repeal that discretionary scheme and to adopt \u00a7 53a-54a, which deemed murder a class A felony unless it was a capital felony, and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b, which defined five specific circumstances under which murder consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>tuted a capital felony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the bill was debated vigorously and extensively in the legislature, it is telling that, in 350 pages of transcribed floor debates and committee hearings, there is not a single reference to the statute of limitations. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1973 Sess., pp. 125-33, 144-86, 192-200; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1973 Sess., pp. 369-77, 407-10, 417-28, 470-80, 484, 488-500, 510-13, 533-50, 556-60, 569-70, 576-79, 593-96, 601-605; 16 H.R.

Indeed, the absence of opposition is especially telling considering that the capital felony provision enacted in 1973 did not yet include the murder of a child; see Public Acts 1995, No. 95-16, \u00a7 4; or the murder of two or more persons or a murder committed in the course of a sexual assault. See Public Acts 1980, No. 80-335. We have recognized that, \u201c[i]n the interpretation of a statute, a radical departure from an established policy cannot be implied.

In accordance with these principles, this court previously has recognized that legislative changes to punishments under the Penal Code may not necessarily reflect a legislative intent to affect the limitations period. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golino, </em>201 Conn. 435, 442-47, 518 A.2d 57 (1986) (concluding that literal reading of statute of limitations did not apply to murder, even though defendant could be sentenced only to imprisonment after death penalty held unconstitutional); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 457 (\u201cwe fail to see how legislation specifically addressed to capital punishment, and only indirectly affecting the statute of limitations, is any better gauge of legislative intent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The legislative history to \u00a7 53a-54a, therefore, indicates that the crime of \u201cmurder,\u201d a crime punishable either as a noncapital, class A felony or as a capital felony, was excluded from the statute of limitations. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>234 Conn. 324, 364-65, 662 A.2d 1199 (1995) <em>(Borden, J., </em>concurring in part arid dissenting in part) (Agreeing with the majority \u201cthat capital felony is a form of the generic crime of murder, as is arson murder under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54d, and indeed felony murder under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c. That conclusion is consistent with our pre-penal code legislation, under which the single crime of murder was divided into two degrees. ... It also follows from the language and structure of our current homicide statutes, under which murder is defined by ... \u00a7 53a-54a, and pursuant to which \u2018[m]urder is punishable as a class A felony in accordance with subdivision [2] of section 53a-35a unless it is a capital felony or murder under section 53a-54d.\u2019 \u201d [Citation omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">To the extent that any doubt lingered as to its intent in 1975 in that regard, the legislature made its intent manifest by clarifying the statute of limitations in a 1976 amendment, wherein for the first time it expressly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>rather than implicitly, excluded class A and capital felonies from the statute\u2019s scope.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Public Acts 1976, No. 76-35, \u00a7 1, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (a) (\u201c[t]here shall be no limitation of time within which a person may be prosecuted for a capital felony, a class A felony or a violation of section 53a-54d or 53a-169\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Golino, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 445 (referring to amendment as clarifying); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 459-60 (same). Accordingly, to construe \u00a7 53a-54a as the defendant would have us do in the present case would create the anomaly that for a three year period out of the state\u2019s history since colonial times\u2014 from 1973 until 1976\u2014the legislature subjected all murders except those five circumstances designated as capital felony murder to a statute of limitations.

We believe that the 1846 legislature effectively divided murder into separate crimes for purposes of the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 456.</p>\n<p id=\"AJV\">This summary conclusion, which was merely dicta, must be rejected as unsound in the absence of any support beyond the legislature\u2019s general statement of purpose explaining its rationale for imposing a two tier punishment scheme. The <em>Ellis </em>court did not consider any of our early case law cited in our previous discussion in the text of this opinion, which strongly indicates a contrary conclusion. Indeed, other jurisdictions have concluded, when analyzing statutory schemes structured similarly to our two degree murder scheme, that this division was intended to affect merely the punishment imposed and not the limitations period for prosecuting the common-law crime of murder generally. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Haun, </em>44 Cal. 96, 97-98 (1872) (making distinction between first and second degree murder as to seriousness of offense, but not as to statute of limitations); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>22 N.J. 405, 412, 126 A.2d 161 (1956) (\u201cAlfthis [common law or statutory history] reveals the essential quality of murder as a single offense, divided by the statute . . . into degrees, first and second, for the purpose of punishment alone, according to the gravity and heinousness of the felonious act, the moral obliquity that determines the difference between express and implied malice. . . . These statutes have not altered the nature of murder at common law; they are concerned only with the character of the punishment; the degrees do not constitute separate and distinct crimes, but merely grades of the same offense. Murder in either of the statutory degrees is murder at common law.\u201d [Citations omitted.]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Short, </em>131 N.J. 47, 56-57, 618 A.2d 316 (1993) (affirming reasoning of <em>Brown </em>and distinguishing between degrees of murder and manslaughter under statute of limitations); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vance, </em>328 N.C. 613, 622-23, 403 S.E.2d 495 (1991) (The court noted that a 1893 act dividing murder into first and second degree offenses was made only for \u201cpurposes of assigning punishment; it does not define or redefine the crime of murder. . . . [T]he definition of that crime remains the same as it was at common law . . . .\u201d [Citations omitted.]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\"><em> </em>Under the 1969 Penal Code, murder was defined simply as an intentional killing, thereby eliminating the distinction of premeditation and deliberation that previously had been required to differentiate first degree murder from second degree murder; however, the legislature added an affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance that could reduce the offense of murder to first degree manslaughter. See Public Acts 1969, No. 828, \u00a7\u00a7 54, 55; Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. (West 1985) \u00a7 53a-54a, pp. 32-33. Notably, there is nothing in the extensive legislative history to the enactment of the 1969 Penal Code reflecting that the code would effectuate any change to the statute of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b799-6\"> Section 53a-54a was essentially identical to its predecessor, \u00a7 53a-54, except for the addition of the following italicized words: \u201cMurder is punishable as a class A felony unless <em>it is a capital felony and </em>the death penalty is imposed as provided by section 53a-46a.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-54a (c). Felony murder, however, which previously had been encompassed within \u00a7 53a-54, was separated into its own section under Public Acts 1973, No. 73-137, \u00a7 2. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-54c (felony murder provision).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b800-6\"> As originally enacted, the capital felony provision designated six offenses that were death penalty eligible, only one of which was not predicated on murder. See P.A. 73-137, \u00a7 3 (\u201c[a] person is guilty of a capital felony who is convicted of any of the following: [1] Murder of a member of the state police department or of any local police department, a county detective, a sheriff or deputy sheriff, a constable who performs criminal law enforcement duties, a special policeman appointed under section 29-18 of the 1969 supplement to the general statutes, an official of the department of correction authorized by the commissioner of correction to make arrests in a correctional institution or facility, or of any fireman, as defined in subsection [10] of section 53a-3 of the 1971 noncumulative supplement to the general statutes, while such victim was acting within the scope of his duties; [2] murder committed by a defendant who is hired to commit the same for pecuniary gain or murder committed by one who is hired by the defendant to commit the same for pecuniary gain; [3] murder committed by one who has previously been convicted of intentional murder or murder committed in the course of commission of a felony; [4] murder committed by one who was, at the time of commission of the murder, under sentence of life imprisonment; [5] murder by a kidnapper of a kidnapped person during the course of the kidnapping or before such person is able to return or be returned to safety; [6] the illegal sale, for gain, of cocaine, heroin or methadone to a person who dies as a direct result of the use by him of such cocaine, heroin or methadone, provided such seller was not, at the time of such sale, a drug-dependent person\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\"> The following comments exemplify the focus of the discussion in this regard on House Bill No. 82-97. Representative James F. Bingham, the chairman of the judiciary committee in the House of Representatives, stated: \u201cThis bill was drafted very carefully to comply with the death penalty deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>sion . . . 16 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 2928. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, after discussing the <em>Furman </em>decision at length, stated: \u201cThe Bill before us today has been devised I presume in the hope that changing the sentencing procedure by providing a mandatory death penalty for conviction of certain enumerated crimes and carefully defining the circumstances under which judges and juries must act before imposing death will result in legislation able to withstand the scrutiny of the United States Supreme Court.\u201d 16 S. Proc., supra, p. 1904. \u201cI do not believe that the proposed legislation could withstand the constitutional test.\u201d Id., p. 1908, remarks of Senator Lieberman. Senator Romeo G. Petroni remarked in support of the bill: \u201cIn my judgment, the fullest due process we can find within the guidelines of <em>Furman </em>is clearly set forth in this bill.\u201d Id., p. 1924. Senator George C. Guidera, the chairman of the judiciary committee in the Senate and a sponsor of the legislation, commented extensively about <em>Furman </em>and then remarked: \u201cThe mitigating and aggravating circumstances which are outlined in this Bill . . . have received great thought not only by the Judiciary Committee in Connecticut but by the Judiciary Committee in Washington D.C. [and] I think will prove to make the Bill constitutional .... [It] will set a guideline for the jury so that there is no doubt as to how they should approach the subject of the sentence.\u201d Id., p. 1870.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b803-6\"> Although the legislative history to the 1976 amendment is sparse, the few comments made on the proposed amendment indicate that the legislature intended to clarify, rather than substantively change, the statute of limitations. Senator David H. Neiditz, the sponsor of the amendment, Senate Bill No. 203, explained: \u201cThis bill clarifies the statute ... of limitations for a capital or a class A felony, that (here is no statute of limitations on these offenses and it clears up the language in the statute which, up until now, is referred to for a crime for which someone may be sent to a specific institution. It was made necessary by the abolition of capital punishment and the reinstatement of capital punishment . . . .\u201d 19 S. Proc., Pt. 1, 1976 Sess., p. 341. Senator George L. Gunther appeared before the judiciary committee to speak in favor of several pending bills, remarking: \u201cThe last [bill] is [Senate Bill No. 203] which is concerning the statute of limitations and Mr. Chairman, I\u2019m happy to see a clarification of this part of the statute.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1,1976 Sess., p. 163.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\"> Notably, even under the defendant\u2019s construction of the statutory scheme, wherein he claims that second degree murder was subject to a statute of limitations, his position defies reason. It would require us to conclude that the legislature eliminated such a distinction in 1969, without comment, then four years later, in 1973, decided to subject almost all murders to a five year limitations period, even those that previously had been excluded from the statute of limitations as first degree murder, and then three years later, in 1976, amend the statute to exclude once again all murders from the statute of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
