J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADj\">This appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arises out of a complaint filed by the plaintiff, Gregory D. Hanks, against the defendants, Powder Ridge Restaurant Corporation and White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., doing business as Powder Ridge Ski Resort, seeking compensatory damages for injuries the plaintiff sustained while snowtubing at the defendants\u2019 facility. The trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants, concluding that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hyson </em>v. <em>White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 636, 829 A.2d 827 (2003), precluded the plaintiffs negligence claim as a matter of law. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">The record reveals the following factual and procedural history. The defendants operate a facility in Middlefield, known as Powder Ridge, at which the public, in exchange for a fee, is invited to ski, snowboard and snowtube. On February 16, 2003, the plaintiff brought his three children and another child to Powder Ridge to snowtube. Neither the plaintiff nor the four children had ever snowtubed at Powder Ridge, but the snowtub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ing ran was open to the public generally, regardless of prior snowtubing experience, with the restriction that only persons at least six years old or forty-four inches tall were eligible to participate. Further, in order to snowtube at Powder Ridge, patrons were required to sign a \u201cWaiver, Defense, Indemnity and Hold Harmless Agreement, and Release of Liability\u201d (agreement). The plaintiff read and signed the agreement on behalf of himself and the four children. While snowtubing, the plaintiffs right foot became caught between his snow-tube and the man-made bank of the snowtubing ran, resulting in serious injuries that required multiple surgeries to repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff filed the present negligence action against the defendants. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants negligently caused his injuries by: (1) permitting the plaintiff \u201cto ride in a snow tube that was not of sufficient size to ensure his safety while on the snow tubing run\u201d; (2) \u201cfail[ing] to properly train, supervise, control or otherwise instruct the operators of the snow tubing ran in the proper way to ran the snow tubing course to ensure the safety of the patrons, such as the plaintiff\u2019; (3) \u201cfail[ing] to properly groom the snow tubing ran so as to direct patrons . . . such as the plaintiff away from the sidewalls of [the] ran\u201d; (4) \u201cplacing] carpet at the end of the snow tubing run which had the tendency to cause the snow tubes to come to an abrupt halt, spin or otherwise change direction\u201d; (5) \u201cfailing] to properly landscape the snow tubing run so as to provide an adequate up slope at the end of the run to properly and safely slow snow tubing patrons such as the plaintiff\u2019; (6) \u201cfail[ing] to place warning signs on said snow tubing ran to warn patrons such as the plaintiff of the danger of colliding with the side wall of [the] snow tubing ran\u201d; and (7) \u201cfail[ing] to place hay bales or other similar materials on the sides of the snow tubing ran in order to direct patrons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>such as the plaintiff away from the sidewalls of [the] run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The defendants, in their answer to the complaint, denied the plaintiffs allegations of negligence and asserted two special defenses. Specifically, the defendants alleged that the plaintiffs injuries were caused by his own negligence and that the agreement relieved the defendants of liability, \u201ceven if the accident was due to the negligence of the defendants.\u201d Thereafter, the defendants moved for summary judgment, claiming that the agreement barred the plaintiffs negligence claim as a matter of law. The trial court agreed and rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Specifically, the trial court determined, pursuant to our decision in <em>Hyson </em>v. <em>White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 265 Conn. 640-44, that the plaintiff, by signing the agreement, unambiguously had released the defendants from liability for their allegedly negligent conduct. Thereafter, the plaintiff moved to reargue the motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied the plaintiffs motion and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The plaintiff raises two claims on appeal. First, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the agreement clearly and expressly releases the defendants from liability for negligence. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that a person of ordinary intelligence reasonably would not have believed that, by signing the agreement, he or she was releasing the defendants from liability for personal injuries caused by negligence and, therefore, pursuant to <em>Hyson </em>v. <em>White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 265 Conn. 643, the agreement does not bar the plaintiffs negligence claim. Second, the plaintiff claims that the agreement is unenforceable because it violates public policy. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that a recreational operator cannot, consistent with public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>policy, release itself from liability for its own negligent conduct where, as in the present case, the operator offers its services to the public generally, for a fee, and requires patrons to sign a standardized exculpatory agreement as a condition of participation. We disagree with the plaintiffs first claim, but agree with his second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Before reaching the substance of the plaintiffs claims on appeal, we review this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hyson. </em>The plaintiff in <em>Hyson </em>was injured while snowtubing at Powder Ridge and, thereafter, filed a complaint against the defendant, White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., alleging that the defendant\u2019s negligence proximately had caused her injuries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., 637-39. Prior to snowtubing at Powder Ridge, the plaintiff had signed an exculpatory agreement entitled \u201cRELEASE FROM LIABILITY.\u201d Id., 638 and n.3. The issue presented in <em>Hyson </em>was whether the exculpatory agreement released the defendant from liability for its negligent conduct and, consequently, barred the plaintiffs negligence claims as a matter of law. Id., 640. We concluded that it did not. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In arriving at this conclusion, we noted that there exists \u201cwidespread support in other jurisdictions for a rule requiring that any agreement intended to exculpate a party for its own negligence state so expressly\u201d; id., 641-42; and that this court previously had acknowledged \u201cthe well established principle . . . that \u2018[t]he law does not favor contract provisions which relieve a person from his own negligence ....\u2019\u201d Id., 643. Accordingly, we determined that \u201cthe better rule is that a party cannot be released from liability for injuries resulting from its future negligence in the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>language that expressly so provides.\u201d Id. This rule \u201cprevents individuals from inadvertently relinquishing valuable legal rights\u201d and \u201cdoes not impose . . . significant cost[s]\u201d on entities seeking to exculpate themselves from liability for future negligence. Id. Examining the exculpatory agreement at issue in <em>Hyson, </em>we observed that \u201cthe release signed by the plaintiff [did] not specifically refer to possible negligence by the defendant\u201d but, instead, only referred to \u201cinherent and other risks involved in [snowtubing] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 640. Thus, \u201c[a] person of ordinary intelligence reasonably could believe that, by signing this release, he or she was releasing the defendant only from liability for damages caused by dangers inherent in the activity of snowtubing.\u201d Id., 643. Accordingly, we concluded that the exculpatory agreement did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>expressly release the defendants from liability for future negligence and, therefore, did not bar the plaintiffs claims. Consequently, we declined to decide whether a well drafted exculpatory agreement expressly releasing a defendant from prospective liability for future negligence could be enforced consistent with public policy. See id., 640 (\u201cwe do not reach the issue of whether a well drafted agreement purporting to have such an effect would be enforceable\u201d); id., 643 n.ll (\u201cwe do not decide today whether a contract having such express language would be enforceable to release a party from liability for its negligence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">As an initial matter, we set forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201c[T]he standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is well established. Practice Book [\u00a7 17-49] provides that summaiy judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>D\u2019Eramo </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>273 Conn. 610, 619, 872 A.2d 408 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">We first address the plaintiffs claim that the agreement does not expressly release the defendants from liability for personal injuries incurred as a result of their own negligence as required by <em>Hyson. </em>Specifically, the plaintiff maintains that an ordinary person of reasonable intelligence would not understand that, by signing the agreement, he or she was releasing the defendants from liability for future negligence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u201c]T]he law does not favor contract provisions which relieve a person from his own negligence . . . <em>Hyson </em>v. <em>White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>supra, 265 Conn. 643. \u201c[T]he law\u2019s reluctance to enforce exculpatory provisions of this nature has resulted in the development of an exacting standard by which courts measure their validity. So, it has been repeatedly emphasized that unless the intention of the parties is expressed in unmistakable language, an exculpatory clause will not be deemed to insulate a party from liability for his own negligent acts .... Put another way, it must appear plainly and precisely that the limitation of liability extends to negligence or other fault of the party attempting to shed his ordinary responsibility ....</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u201cNot only does this stringent standard require that the drafter of such an agreement make its terms unambiguous, but it mandates that the terms be understandable as well. Thus, a provision that would exempt its drafter from any liability occasioned by his fault should not compel resort to a magnifying glass and lexicon. ... Of course, this does not imply that only simple or monosyllabic language can be used in such clauses. Rather, what the law demands is that such provisions be clear and coherent . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>B &amp; D Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>73 Conn. App. 66, 72, 807 A.2d 1001 (2002), quoting <em>Gross </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>49 N.Y.2d 102, 107-108, 400 N.E.2d 306, 424 N.Y.S.2d 365 (1979); see also <em>Hyson </em>v. <em>White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 265 Conn. 643 (\u201ca party cannot be released from liability for injuries resulting from its future negligence in the absence of language that expressly so provides\u201d). \u201cAlthough ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact . . . [w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>269 Conn. 550, 559-60, 849 A.2d 368 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The agreement<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at issue in the present case provides in relevant part: \u201cI understand that there are inherent risks involved in snowtubing, including the risk of seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ous physical injury or death and <em>I fully assume all risks associated with [s]nowtubing, </em>even if due to the NEGLIGENCE of [the defendants] . . . including but not limited to: variations in the snow conditions; steepness and terrain; the presence of ice, moguls, bare spots and objects beneath the snowtubing surface such as rocks, debris and tree stumps; collisions with objects both on and off the snowtubing chutes such as hay bales, trees, rocks, snowmaking equipment, barriers, lift cables and equipment, lift towers, lift attendants, employees, volunteers, other patrons and spectators or their property; equipment or lift condition or failure; lack of safety devices or inadequate safety devices; lack of warnings or inadequate warnings; lack of instructions or inadequate instructions; use of any lift; and the like. . . . I . . . <em>agree I will defend, indemnify and hold harmless </em>[the defendants] . . . from any and all claims, suits or demands by anyone arising from my use of the Powder Ridge snowtubing facilities and equipment including claims of NEGLIGENCE on the part of [the defendants] . . . . I . . . hereby release, and agree that <em>I will not sue </em>[the defendants] . . . for money damages for personal injury or property damage sustained by me while using the snowtubing facilities and equipment even if due to the NEGLIGENCE of [the defendants] . . . (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We conclude that the agreement expressly and unambiguously purports to release the defendants from prospective liability for negligence. The agreement explicitly provides that the snowtuber <em>\u201cfully assume[s] all risks associated with [s]nowtubing, </em>even if due to the NEGLIGENCE\u201d of the defendants. (Emphasis in original.) Moreover, the agreement refers to the negligence of the defendants three times and uses capital letters to emphasize the term \u201cnegligence.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that an ordinary person of reasonable intelligence would understand that, by signing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>agreement, he or she was releasing the defendants from liability for their future negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The plaintiff claims, however, that the agreement does not expressly release the defendants from liability for their prospective negligence because the agreement \u201cdefine[s] the word \u2018negligence\u2019 solely by reference to inherent [risks] of the activity.\u201d We disagree. The agreement states that the snowtuber <em>\u201cfully </em>assume[s] <em>all risks associated with [s]nowtubing, </em>even if due to the NEGLIGENCE of [the defendants]\u201d and provides a nonexhaustive list of such risks. (Emphasis in original.) We acknowledge that some of the risks listed arguably can be characterized as inherent risks because they are innate to the activity, \u201care beyond the control of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>[recreational] area operator and cannot be minimized by the operator\u2019s exercise of reasonable care.\u201d <em>Jagger </em>v. <em>Mohawk Mountain Ski Area, Inc., </em>269 Conn. 672, 692, 849 A.2d 813 (2004). Other risks listed in the agreement, for example, \u201clack of safety devices or inadequate safety devices; lack of warnings or inadequate warnings; lack of instructions or inadequate instructions\u201d are not inherent risks. The recreational operator has control over safety devices, warnings and instructions, and can ensure their adequacy through the exercise of reasonable care. Thus, a snowtuber who, by virtue of signing the present agreement, assumes the risk of inadequate safety devices, warnings or instructions, necessarily assumes the risk of the recreational operator\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the agreement in the present matter expressly purports to release the defendants from liability for their future negligence and, accordingly, satisfies the standard set forth by this court in <em>Hyson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">We next address the issue we explicitly left unresolved in <em>Hyson </em>v. <em>White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 265 Conn. 640, namely, whether the enforcement of a well drafted exculpatory agreement purporting to release a snowtube operator from prospective liability for personal injuries sustained as a result of the operator\u2019s negligent conduct violates public policy. We conclude that it does and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Although it is well established \u201cthat parties are free to contract for whatever terms on which they may agree\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Capano, </em>241 Conn. 725, 730, 699 A.2d 68 (1997); it is equally well established \u201cthat contracts that violate public policy are unenforceable.\u201d <em>Solomon v. Gilmore, </em>248 Conn. 769, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>774, 731 A.2d 280 (1999). \u201c[T]he question [of] whether a contract is against public policy is [a] question of law dependent on the circumstances of the particular case, over which an appellate court has unlimited review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Parente </em>v. <em>Pirozzoli, </em>87 Conn. App. 235, 245, 866 A.2d 629 (2005), citing 17A Am. Jur. 2d 312, Contracts \u00a7 327 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">As previously noted, \u201c[t]he law does not favor contract provisions which relieve a person from his own negligence . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hyson </em>v. <em>White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 265 Conn. 643. This is because exculpatory provisions undermine the policy considerations governing our tort system. \u201c[T]he fundamental policy purposes of the tort compensation system [are] compensation of innocent parties, shifting the loss to responsible parties or distributing it among appropriate entities, and deterrence of wrongful conduct .... It is sometimes said that compensation for losses is the primary function of tort law . . . [but it] is perhaps more accurate to describe the primary function as one of determining when compensation [is] required. . . . An equally compelling function of the tort system is the prophylactic factor of preventing future harm .... The courts are concerned not only with compensation of the victim, but with admonition of the wrongdoer.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lodge </em>v. <em>Arett Sales Corp., </em>246 Conn. 563, 578-79, 717 A.2d 215 (1998). Thus, it is consistent with public policy \u201cto posit the risk of negligence upon the actor\u201d and, if this policy is to be abandoned, \u201cit has generally been to allow or require that the risk shift to another party better or equally able to bear it, not to shift the risk to the weak bargainer.\u201d <em>Tunkl </em>v. <em>Regents of the University of California, </em>60 Cal. 2d 92, 101, 383 P.2d 441, 32 Cal. Rptr. 33 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Although this court previously has not addressed the enforceability of a release of liability for future negligence, the issue has been addressed by many of our sister states. A frequently cited standard for determining whether exculpatory agreements violate public policy was set forth by the Supreme Court of California in <em>Tunkl </em>v. <em>Regents of the University of California, </em>supra, 60 Cal. 2d 98-101. In <em>Tunkl, </em>the court concluded that exculpatory agreements violate public policy if they affect the public interest adversely; id., 96-98; and identified six factors <em>(Tunkl </em>factors) relevant to this determination: \u201c[1] [The agreement] concerns a business of a type generally thought suitable for public regulation. [2] The party seeking exculpation is engaged in performing a service of great importance to the public, which is often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public. [3] The party holds himself out as willing to perform this service for any member of the public who seeks it, or at least for any member coming within certain established standards. [4] As a result of the essential nature of the service, in the economic setting of the transaction, the party invoking exculpation possesses a decisive advantage of bargaining strength against any member of the public who seeks his services. [5] In exercising a superior bargaining power the party confronts the public with a standardized adhesion contract of exculpation, and makes no provision whereby a purchaser may pay additional reasonable fees and obtain protection against negligence. [6] Finally, as a result of the transaction, the person or property of the purchaser is placed under the control of the seller, subject to the risk of carelessness by the seller or his agents.\u201d Id., 98-101. The court clarified that an exculpatory agreement may affect the public interest adversely even if some of the <em>Tunkl </em>factors are not satisfied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Various states have adopted the <em>Tunkl </em>factors to determine whether exculpatory agreements affect the public interest adversely and, thus, violate public policy. See, e.g., <em>Anchorage </em>v. <em>Locker, </em>723 P.2d 1261, 1265 (Alaska 1986); <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Molzen, </em>558 S.W.2d 429, 431 (Tenn. 1977); <em>Wagenblast v. Odessa School District, </em>110 Wash. 2d 845, 851-52, 758 P.2d 968 (1988). Other states have developed their own variations of the <em>Tunkl </em>factors; see, e.g., <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Dressel, </em>623 P.2d 370, 376 (Colo. 1981) (\u201c[i]n determining whether an exculpatory agreement is valid, there are four factors which a court must consider: [1] the existence of a duty to the public; [2] the nature of the service performed; [3] whether the contract was fairly entered into; and [4] whether the intention of the parties is expressed in clear and unambiguous language\u201d); <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Layne &amp; Bowler Pump Co., </em>93 Idaho 496, 499-500, 465 P.2d 107 (1970) (\u201cexpress agreements exempting one of the parties for negligence are to be sustained except where: [1] one party is at an obvious disadvantage in bargaining power; [2] a public duty is involved [public utility companies, common carriers]\u201d); while still others have adopted a totality of the circumstances approach. See, e.g., <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>335 Md. 525, 535, 644 A.2d 522 (1994) (expressly declining to adopt <em>Tunkl </em>factors because \u201c[t]he ultimate determination of what constitutes the public interest must be made considering the totality of the circumstances of any given case against the backdrop of current societal expectations\u201d); <em>Dalury </em>v. <em>S-K-I, Ltd., </em>164 Vt. 329, 333-34, 670 A.2d 795 (1995) (same). The Virginia Supreme Court, however, has determined that all exculpatory agreements purporting to release tortfeasors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>from future liability for personal injuries are unenforceable because \u201c[t]o hold that it was competent for one party to put the other parties to the contract at the mercy of its own misconduct . . . can never be lawfully done where an enlightened system of jurisprudence prevails. Public policy forbids it . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hiett </em>v. <em>Lake Barcroft Community Assn., </em>244 Va. 191, 194, 418 S.E.2d 894 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Having reviewed the various methods for determining whether exculpatory agreements violate public policy, we conclude, as the <em>Tunkl </em>court itself acknowledged, that \u201c[n]o definition of the concept of public interest can be contained within the four comers of a formula.\u201d <em>Tunkl </em>v. <em>Regents of the University of California, </em>supra, 60 Cal. 2d 98. Accordingly, we agree with the Supreme Courts of Maryland and Vermont that \u201c[t]he ultimate determination of what constitutes the public interest must be made considering the totality of the circumstances of any given case against the backdrop of current societal expectations.\u201d <em>Wolf v. Ford, </em>supra, 335 Md. 535; <em>Dalury </em>v. <em>S-K-I, Ltd., </em>supra, 164 Vt. 333-34. Thus, our analysis is guided, but not limited, by the <em>Tunkl </em>factors, and is informed by any other factors that may be relevant given the factual circumstances of the case and current societal expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">We now turn to the merits of the plaintiffs claim. The defendants are in the business of providing snowtubing services to the public generally, regardless of prior snowtubing experience, with the minimal restriction that only persons at least six years old or forty-four inches tall are eligible to participate. Given the virtually unrestricted access of the public to Powder Ridge, a reasonable person would presume that the defendants were offering a recreational activity that the whole family could enjoy safely. Indeed, this presumption is borne out by the plaintiffs own testimony. Specifically, the plaintiff testified that he \u201ctrusted that [the defendants] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>would, within their good conscience, operate a safe ride.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The societal expectation that family oriented recreational activities will be reasonably safe is even more important where, as in the present matter, patrons are under the care and control of the recreational operator as a result of an economic transaction. The plaintiff, in exchange for a fee, was permitted access to the defendants\u2019 snowtubing runs and was provided with snowtubing gear. As a result of this transaction, the plaintiff was under the care and control of the defendants and, thus, was subject to the risk of the defendants\u2019 carelessness. Specifically, the defendants designed and maintained the snowtubing run and, therefore, controlled the steepness of the incline, the condition of the snow and the method of slowing down or stopping patrons. Further, the defendants provided the plaintiff with the requisite snowtubing supplies and, therefore, controlled the size and quality of the snow-tube as well as the provision of any necessary protective gear. Accordingly, the plaintiff voluntarily relinquished control to the defendants with the reasonable expectation of an exciting, but reasonably safe, snowtubing experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Moreover, the plaintiff lacked the knowledge, experience and authority to discern whether, much less ensure that, the defendants\u2019 snowtubing runs were maintained in a reasonably safe condition. As the Vermont Supreme Court observed, in the context of the sport of skiing, it is consistent with public policy \u201cto place responsibility for maintenance of the land on those who own or control it, with the ultimate goal of keeping accidents to the minimum level possible. [The] [defendants, not recreational skiers, have the expertise and opportunity to foresee and control hazards, and to guard against the negligence of their agents and employees. They alone can properly maintain and inspect their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>premises, and train their employees in risk management. They alone can insure against risks and effectively spread the costs of insurance among their thousands of customers. Skiers, on the other hand, are not in a position to discover and correct risks of harm, and they cannot insure against the ski area\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u201cIf the defendants were permitted to obtain broad waivers of their liability, an important incentive for ski areas to manage risk would be removed, with the public bearing the cost of the resulting injuries. ... It is illogical, in these circumstances, to undermine the public policy underlying business invitee law and allow skiers to bear risks they have no ability or right to control.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.) <em>Dalury </em>v. <em>S-K-I, Ltd., </em>supra, 164 Vt. 335. The concerns expressed by the court in <em>Dalury </em>are equally applicable to the context of snowtubing, and we agree that it is illogical to permit snowtubers, and the public generally, to bear the costs of risks that they have no ability or right to control.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Further, the agreement at issue was a standardized adhesion contract offered to the plaintiff on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis. The \u201cmost salient feature [of adhesion contracts] is that they are not subject to the normal bargaining processes of ordinary contracts.\u201d <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>206 Conn. 409, 416, 538 A.2d 219 (1988); see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) (defining adhesion contract as \u201c[a] standard form contract prepared by one party, to be signed by the party in a weaker position, [usually] a consumer, who has little choice about the terms\u201d). Not only was the plaintiff unable to negotiate the terms of the agreement, but the defendants also did not offer him the option of procuring protection against negligence at an additional reasonable cost. See Restatement (Third), Torts, Apportionment of Liability \u00a7 2, comment (e), p. 21 (2000) (factor relevant to enforcement of contractual limit on liability is \u201cwhether the party seeking exculpation was willing to provide greater protection against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>tortious conduct for a reasonable, additional fee\u201d). Moreover, the defendants did not inform prospective snowtubers prior to their arrival at Powder Ridge that they would have to waive important common-law rights as a condition of participation. Thus, the plaintiff, who traveled to Powder Ridge in anticipation of snowtubing that day, was faced with the dilemma of either signing the defendants\u2019 proffered waiver of prospective liability or forgoing completely the opportunity to snowtube at Powder Ridge. Under the present factual circumstances, it would ignore reality to conclude that, the plaintiff wielded the same bargaining power as the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The defendants contend, nevertheless, that they did not have superior bargaining power because, unlike an essential public service, \u201c[s]nowtubing is a voluntary activity and the plaintiff could have just as easily decided not to participate.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We acknowledge that snowtubing is a voluntary activity, but we do not agree that there can never be a disparity of bargaining power in the context of voluntary or elective activities.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>Dalury </em>v. <em>S-K-I, Ltd., </em>supra, 164 Vt. 335 (\u201c[w]hile interference with an essential public service surely affects the public interest, those services do not represent the universe of activities that implicate public concerns\u201d). Voluntary recreational activities, such as snowtubing, skiing, basketball, soccer, football, racquetball, karate, ice skating, swimming, volleyball or yoga, are pursued by the vast majority of the population and constitute an important and healthy part of everyday life. Indeed, this court has previously recognized the public policy interest of promoting vigorous participation in such activities. See, e.g., <em>Jagger </em>v. <em>Mohawk Mountain Ski Area, Inc., </em>supra, 269 Conn. 702 (important public policy interest in encouraging vigorous participation in skiing); <em>Jaworski </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>241 Conn. 399, 409, 696 A.2d 332 (1997) (important public policy interest in promoting vigorous participation in soccer). In the present case, the defendants held themselves out as a provider of a healthy, fun, family activity. After the plaintiff and his family arrived at Powder Ridge eager to participate in the activity, however, the defendants informed the plaintiff that, not only would they be immune from claims arising from the inherent risks of the activity, but they would not be responsible for injuries resulting from their own carelessness and negligence in the operation of the snowtubing facility. We recognize that the plaintiff had the option of walking away. We cannot say, however, that the defendants had no bargaining advantage under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the agreement in the present matter affects the public interest adversely and, therefore, is unenforceable because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>it violates public policy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The defendants and the dissent point out that our conclusion represents the \u201cdistinct minority view\u201d and is inconsistent with the majority of sister state authority upholding exculpatory agreements in similar recreational settings. We acknowledge that most states uphold adhesion contracts releasing recreational operators from prospective liability for personal injuries caused by their own negligent conduct. Put simply, we disagree with these decisions for the reasons already explained in this opinion. Moreover, we find it significant that many states uphold exculpatory agreements in the context of <em>simple </em>negligence, but refuse to enforce such agreements in the context of <em>gross </em>negligence. See, e.g., <em>Farina </em>v. <em>Mt. Bachelor, Inc., </em>66 F.3d 233, 235-36 (9th Cir. 1995) (Oregon law); <em>Wheelock </em>v. <em>Sport Kites, Inc., </em>839 F. Sup. 730, 736 (D.

Williston, Contracts (4th Ed. 1998) \u00a7 19:23, pp. 291-97 (\u201c[a]n attempted exemption from liability for a future intentional tort or crime or for a future willful or grossly negligent act is generally held void, although a release exculpating a party from liability for negligence may also cover gross negligence where the jurisdiction has abolished the distinction between degrees of negligence and treats all negligence alike\u201d). Connecticut does not recognize degrees of negligence and, consequently, does not recognize the tort of gross negligence as a separate basis of liability. See, e.g., <em>Matthiessen </em>v. <em>Vanech, </em>266 Conn. 822, 833 and n. 10, 836 A.2d 394 (2003). Accordingly, although in some states recreational operators cannot, consistent with public policy, release themselves from prospective liability for conduct that is more egregious than <em>simple </em>negligence, in this state, were we to adopt the position advocated by the defendants, recreational operators would be able to release their liability for such conduct unless it rose to the level of <em>recklessness. </em>Id., 832 (recklessness is \u201ca conscious choice of a course of action either with knowledge of the serious danger to others involved in it or with knowledge of facts which would disclose this danger to any reasonable man, and the actor must recognize that his conduct involves a risk substantially greater . . . than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). As a result, recreational operators would lack the incentive to exercise even <em>slight </em>care, with the public bearing the costs of the resulting injuries. See 57A Am. Jur. 2d 296, Negligence \u00a7 227 (2004) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>(\u201c \u2018gross negligence\u2019 is commonly defined as very great or excessive negligence, or as the want of, or failure to exercise, even slight or scant care or \u2018slight diligence\u2019 \u201d).

In <em>Dalury, </em>the court did not rely solely on the volume of public participation in determining that exculpatory agreements violate public policy in the context of skiing. Rather, the court relied on the following relevant factors: \u201c(1) the ski area operated a facility open to the general public, (2) the ski area advertised and invited persons of every level of skiing ability onto its premises, (3) the ski area, and not recreational skiers, had the expertise and opportunity to foresee and control hazards and to guard against the negligence of its employees and agents, (4) the ski area was in a better position to insure against the risks of its own negligence and spread the cost of the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>among its customers, and (5) if ski areas were permitted to obtain broad waivers of their liability, incentives for them to manage risks would be removed, with the public bearing the cost.\u201d <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Killington, Ltd., </em>167 Vt. 137, 141, 702 A.2d 35 (1997) (discussing <em>Dalury). </em>likewise, we conclude today that the agreement at issue in this case violates public policy, not solely because of the volume of public participation, but because: (1) the defendants invite the public generally to snowtube at their facility, regardless of snowtubing ability; (2) snowtubers are under the care and control of the defendants as a result of an economic transaction; (3) the defendants, not recreational snowtubers, have the knowledge, experience and authority to maintain the snowtubing runs in reasonably safe condition, to determine whether the snowtubing equipment is adequate and reasonably safe, and to guard against the negligence of its employees and agents; (4) the defendants are in a better position to insure against the risk of their negligence and to spread the costs of insurance to their patrons; (5) if we were to uphold the present agreement under the facts of this case, the defendants would be permitted to obtain broad waivers of their liability and the incentive for them to maintain a reasonably safe snowtubing environment would be removed, with the public bearing the cost; (6) the agreement at issue is a standardized adhesion contract, offered to snowtubers on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis, and without the opportunity to purchase protection against negligence at an additional, reasonable fee; and (7) the defendants had superior bargaining authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\"> The defendants also claim, and the dissent agrees, that the defendants did not have superior bargaining power because the plaintiff \u201ccould have participated in snowtubing elsewhere, either on that day or another day.\u201d We are not persuaded. Snowtubing is a seasonal activity that requires the provision of specific supplies and particular topographic and weather conditions. Although the dissent correctly states that \u201c \u2018snowtubing occurs regularly at locations all across the state, including parks, backyards and golf courses\u2019 we point out that, even when weather conditions are naturally appropriate for snowtubing, not all individuals are fortunate enough to have access to places where snowtubing is both feasible topographically and permitted freely. Moreover, the dissent argues that the plaintiff had ample opportunity to select a snowtubing environment \u201cbased on whatever safety considerations he felt were relevant.\u201d As already explained in this opinion, however, the defendants, not the plaintiff, had the requisite knowledge and experience to determine what safety considerations are relevant to snowtubing. As such, it was reasonable for the plaintiff to presume that the defendants, who are in the business of supplying snowtubing services, provide the safest snowtubing alternative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\"> We need not decide whether an exculpatory agreement concerning a voluntary recreational activity violates public policy if the <em>only </em>factor militat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ing against enforcement of the agreement is a disparity in bargaining power because, in the present matter, there are additional factors that combine to render the agreement contrary to public policy. See footnote 9 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\"> We clarify that our conclusion does not extend to the risks inherent in the activity of snowtubing. As we have explained, inherent risks are those risks that are innate to the activity, \u201care beyond the control of the [recreational] area operator and cannot be minimized by the operator\u2019s exercise of reasonable care.\u201d <em>Jagger v. Mohawk Mountain Ski Area, Inc., </em>supra, 269 Conn. 692 (distinguishing between inherent risks of skiing and ski operator\u2019s negligence); see also <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Killington, Ltd., </em>167 Vt. 137, 143, 702 A.2d 35 (1997) (same). For example, risks inherent in the sport of skiing include, but are not limited to, the risk of collision with another skier or a tree outside the confines of the slope. See Public Acts 2005, No. 05-78, \u00a7 2. The risks inherent in each type of recreational activity will necessarily vary, and it is common knowledge that some recreational activities are inherently more dangerous than others.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b360-7\">NORCOTT, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUh\">with whom BORDEN and PALMER, Js., join, dissenting. Although I concur in part I of the majority opinion, I disagree with its conclusion in part II, namely, that the prospective release of liability for negligence executed by the plaintiff, Gregory D.

I would follow the overwhelming majority of our sister states and would conclude that prospective releases from liability for negligence are permissible in the context of recreational activities. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to take a road that is, for many persuasive reasons, far less traveled.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">I begin by noting that \u201c[i]t is established well beyond the need for citation that parties are free to contract for whatever terms on which they may agree. This freedom includes the right to contract for the assumption of known or unknown hazards and risks that may arise as a consequence of the execution of the contract.

Nevertheless, contracts that violate public policy are unenforceable.

Because I consider the <em>Tunkl </em>factors to be dispositive, I address them at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u201c[T]he attempted but invalid [release agreement] involves a transaction which exhibits some or all of the following characteristics. [1] It concerns a business of a type generally thought suitable for public regulation. [2] The party seeking exculpation is engaged in performing a service of great importance to the public, which is often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public. [3] The party holds himself out as willing to perform this service for any member of the public who seeks it, or at least for any member coming within certain established standards. [4] As a result of the essential nature of the service, in the economic setting of the transaction, the party invoking exculpation possesses a decisive advantage of bargaining strength against any member of the public who seeks his services. [5] In exercising a superior bargaining power the party confronts the public with a standardized adhesion contract of exculpation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>makes no provision whereby a purchaser may pay additional reasonable fees and obtain protection against negligence.

Thus, the ultimate test is whether the exculpatory clause affects the public interest, not whether all of the characteristics that help reach that conclusion are satisfied.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Health Net of </em>California, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health </em>Services, 113 Cal.

LEXIS 2043 (March 3, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Notwithstanding the statutory origins of the <em>Tunkl </em>factors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> numerous other states have adopted them to determine whether a prospective release violates public policy under their common law. See, e.g., <em>Morgan </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>South Central Bell Telephone Co., </em>466 So. 2d 107, 117 (Ala. 1985); <em>Anchorage </em>v. <em>Locker, </em>723 P.2d 1261, 1265 (Alaska 1986); <em>La Frenz </em>v. <em>Lake County Fair Board, </em>172 Ind. App. 389, 395, 360 N.E.2d 605 (1977); <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Santa Fe National Bank, </em>97 N.M. 554, 558-59, 627 P.2d 1247 (1981); <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Molzen, </em>558 S.W.2d 429, 431 (Tenn. 1977); <em>Wagenblast </em>v. <em>Odessa School District, </em>110 Wash. 2d 845, 852, 758 P.2d 968 (1988); <em>Schutkowski </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>725 P.2d 1057, 1060 (Wyo. 1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Applying the six <em>Tunkl </em>factors to the sport of snow-tubing, I note that the first, second, fourth and sixth factors support the defendants, Powder Ridge Restaurant Corporation and White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., doing business as Powder Ridge Ski Resort, which operate the Powder Ridge facility, while the third and fifth factors support the plaintiff. Accordingly, I now turn to a detailed examination of each factor as it applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The first of the <em>Tunkl </em>factors, that the business is of a type thought suitable for regulation, cuts squarely in favor of upholding the release. Snowtubing runs generally are not subject to extensive public regulation. Indeed, the plaintiff points to no statutes or regulations that affect snowtubing, and I have located only one statutory reference to it. This sole reference, contained in No. 05-78, \u00a7 2, of the 2005 Public Acts, explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>exempts snowtubing from the scope of General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 29-212, which applies to liability for injuries sustained by skiers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, while the legislature has chosen to regulate, to some extent, the sport of skiing, it conspicuously has left snowtubing untouched.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The second <em>Tunkl </em>factor also works in the defendants\u2019 favor. Snowtubing is not an important public service. Courts employing the <em>Tunkl </em>factors have found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>this second element satisfied in the contexts of hospital admission and treatment, residential rental agreements, banking, child care services, telecommunications and public education, including interscholastic sports. See <em>Henrioulle </em>v. <em>Marin Ventures, Inc., </em>20 Cal. 3d 512, 573 P.2d 465, 143 Cal. Rptr. 247 (1978) (residential rental agreements); <em>Tunkl v. Regents of the University of California, </em>supra, 60 Cal. 2d 92 (hospitals); <em>Gavin W. </em>v. <em>YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles, </em>106 Cal. App. 4th 662, 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 168 (2003) (child care); <em>Vilner </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank, </em>89 Cal. App. 3d 732, 152 Cal. Rptr. 850 (1979) (banking); <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>South Central Bell Telephone Co., </em>supra, 466 So. 2d 107 (telephone companies); <em>Anchorage </em>v. <em>Locker, </em>supra, 723 P.2d 1261 (telephone companies); <em>Wagenblast </em>v. <em>Odessa School District, </em>supra, 110 Wash. 2d 845 (public schools and interscholastic sports). The public nature of these industries is undeniable and each plays an important and <em>indispensable </em>role in everyday life. Snowtubing, by contrast, is purely a recreational activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The fourth <em>Tunkl </em>factor also counsels against the plaintiffs position that snowtubing affects the public interest because snowtubing is not an essential activity. The plaintiffs only incentive for snowtubing was recreation, not some other important personal interest such as, for example, health care, banking or insurance. The plaintiff would not have suffered any harm by opting not to snowtube at Powder Ridge, because snowtubing is not so significant a service that a person in his position would feel compelled to agree to any terms offered rather than forsake the opportunity to participate. Furthermore, \u201c[ujnlike other activities that require the provision of a certain facility, snowtubing occurs regularly at locations all across the state, including parks, backyards and golf courses.\u201d <em>Hyson </em>v. <em>White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 636, 650 n.4, 829 A.2d 827 (2003) <em>(Norcott, J., </em>dissenting). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the plaintiff had ample opportunity to snowtube in an environment of his choosing, which he could have selected based on whatever safety considerations he felt were relevant. In the absence of a compelling personal need and a limited choice of facilities, I cannot conclude that the defendants enjoyed a significant bargaining advantage over the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Finally, the sixth <em>Tunkl </em>factor weighs against a determination that the release implicates the public interest. The plaintiff did not place his person or property under the defendants\u2019 control. Unlike the patient who lies unconscious on the operating table or the child who is placed in the custody of a day care service, the Powder Ridge patron snowtubes on his own, without entrusting his person or property to the defendants\u2019 care. In fact, the attraction of snowtubing and other recreational activities often is the lack of control associated with participating.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In contrast, the third and fifth <em>Tunkl </em>factors support the plaintiffs position. With respect to the third factor, although the defendants restricted access to the snow-tubing run to persons at least six years old or forty-four inches tall, this minimal restriction does not diminish the fact that only a small class of the general public is excluded from participation. See <em>Tunkl </em>v. <em>Regents of the University of California, </em>supra, 60 Cal. 2d 102 (research hospital that only accepted certain patients nevertheless met third prong of <em>Tunkl </em>because it accepted anyone who exhibited medical condition that was being researched at hospital). Such a small exclusion does not diminish the invitation to the public at large to partake in snowtubing at the defendants\u2019 facility, because the snowtubing run is open to any person who fits within certain easily satisfied parameters. See id., 99-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Finally, I examine the fifth <em>Tunkl </em>factor, namely, whether the release agreement is an \u201cadhesion contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>. . . .\u201d Id., 100. \u201c[The] most salient feature [of adhesion contracts] is that they are not subject to the normal bargaining processes of ordinary contracts.\u201d <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>206 Conn. 409, 416, 538 A.2d 219 (1988). Although the plaintiff made no attempt to bargain as to the terms of the release, it defies logic to presume that he could have done so successfully. As the majority correctly notes, the defendants presented patrons with a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d situation, conditioning access to the snowtubing run on signing the release agreement. Accordingly, the fifth <em>Tunkl </em>factor indicates that the agreement does affect the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In sum, I conclude that, under the <em>Tunkl </em>factors, the defendants\u2019 release at issue in this case does not violate public policy with respect to the sport of snowtubing. This conclusion is consistent with the vast majority of sister state authority, which upholds releases of liability in a variety of recreational or athletic settings that are akin to snowtubing as not violative of public policy.

Individuals participate in them for a variety of reasons, including to exercise, to experience a rush of adrenaline, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>engage their competitive nature. These activities, while surely increasing one\u2019s enjoyment of life, cannot be considered so essential as to override the ability of two parties to contract about the allocation of the risks involved in the provision of such activity. When deciding to engage in a recreational activity, participants have the ability to weigh their desire to participate against their willingness to sign a contract containing an exculpatory clause.\u201d <em>Hyson </em>v. <em>While Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 265 Conn. 649 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>dissenting). It also is consistent with the view of the American Law Institute, as embodied in 2 Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 195 (1981),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Restatement (Third) of Torts, Apportionment of Liability \u00a7 2 (2000).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Notwithstanding the foregoing authority, the majority adopts the Vermont Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Dalury </em>v. <em>S-K-I, Ltd., </em>supra, 164 Vt. 334, and concludes that the release agreement in the present case violates public policy. In <em>Dalury, </em>the plaintiff \u201csustained serious injuries when he collided with a metal pole that formed part of the control maze for a ski lift line. Before the season started, [the plaintiff] had purchased a midweek season pass and signed a form releasing the ski area from liability.\u201d Id., 330. The release signed by the plaintiff in <em>Dalury </em>clearly disclaimed liability for negligence. Id. Citing the <em>Tunkl </em>factors, but fashioning an alternative test based on the totality of the circumstances, the <em>Dalury </em>court held the release invalid as against public policy. Id., 333-35. The <em>Dalury </em>court, like the majority in the present case, concluded that a recreational activity affected the public interest because of the considerable public participation. Id., 334.1 find the Vermont court\u2019s opinion unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Although the number of tickets sold to the public is instructive in determining whether an agreement affects the public interest, it is by no means dispositive. Private, nonessential industries, while often very popular, wield no indomitable influence over the public. The average person is capable of reading a release agreement and deciding not to snowtube because of the risks that he or she is asked to assume.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By contrast, in those fields <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>implicating the public interest, the patron is at a substantial bargaining disadvantage. Few people are in a position to quibble over contractual obligations when seeking, for example, insurance, medical treatment or child care. A general characteristic of fields entangled with the public interest is their indispensability; snow-tubing hardly is indispensable. Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, nearly any release affects the public interest, no matter how unnecessary or inherently dangerous the underlying activity may be.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That position remains the distinct minority view, followed only by the courts of Vermont and Virginia.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Hiett </em>v. <em>Lake Barcroft Community Assn., </em>244 Va. 191, 194, 418 S.E.2d 894 (1992) (\u201c[t]o hold that it was competent for one party to put the other parties to the contract at the mercy of its own misconduct . . . can never be lawfully done where an enlightened system of jurisprudence prevails\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>The majority also contends that, because of the status of Connecticut negligence law, my conclusion would have broader public policy implications than the decisions of other courts upholding releases. Specifically, the majority contends that because the law of Connecticut does not recognize differing degrees of negligence, my position allows snowtube operators to insulate themselves from liability even for grossly negligent acts. This is a contrast from states that do recognize a separate claim for gross negligence. Thus, the majority avers, in this state, it would be possible to insulate oneself from liability for all acts not rising to the level of recklessness, whereas elsewhere only simple negligence may be disclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Although the majority\u2019s theory initially appears compelling, closer examination reveals that the line it draws is a distinction without a difference because many states that prohibit prospective releases of liability for gross negligence define gross negligence in a way that mirrors Connecticut recklessness law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See Mich.

Such a result is incongruous with the vast majority of American law and I am aware of no other case in which a court held that a release of liability for negligence in such a sensitive context did not implicate the public interest. In my view, VFol/'illustrates the significant problem inherent in employing an amorphous \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"> The <em>Tunkl </em>court construed California Civil Code \u00a7 1668, which provides: \u201cAll contracts which have for their object, directly or indirectly, to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another, or violation of law, whether willful or negligent, are against the policy of the law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tunkl </em>v. <em>Regents of the University of California, </em>supra, 60 Cal. 2d 95. Despite the sweeping language of the statute, California courts had construed it inconsistently, with many allowing prospective releases from liability for negligence. See id., 95-98. The <em>Tunkl </em>court, in reconciling conflicting lower court decisions, confined the effect of \u00a7 1668 on releases from liability for negligence to situations affecting the public interest, stating: \u201cWhile obviously no public policy opposes private, voluntary transactions in which one party, for a consideration, agrees to shoulder a risk which the law would otherwise have placed upon the other party, [circumstances affecting the public interest] pose a different situation.\u201d Id., 101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\"> I note that still other states have chosen to adopt variations on the <em>Tunkl </em>factors.
