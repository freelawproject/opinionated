J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABk\">The primary issue in this appeal is whether the plaintiff, Rani Sikand, is entitled to non-emergency medical transportation services to and from her psychologist\u2019s office under the state\u2019s medicaid program. LogistiCare, Inc. (LogistiCare), the medical transportation broker for the department of social services (department), had provided transportation services between the plaintiffs home and her psychologist\u2019s office. In April, 2003, LogistiCare terminated the transportation services, claiming that they were no longer covered following certain amendments to the medicaid program that eliminated coverage of services of independently enrolled psychologists. After an administrative hearing, the hearing officer upheld the termination of the services. The plaintiff then appealed from that decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the trial court sustained the appeal. The defendant, Patricia Wilson-Coker, the commissioner of social services (commissioner), now appeals from the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">To provide context for the facts and procedural history of this case, we set forth at the outset a brief overview of the relevant medicaid provisions. \u201cTitle XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396\u20141396s, commonly known as the Medicaid Act, is a federal-state cooperative program designed to provide medical assistance to persons whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of medical care.\u201d <em>Weaver </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>v. <em>Reagen, </em>886 F.2d 194, 197 (8th Cir. 1989). \u201cAlthough a state is not required to participate in the Medicaid program, once it chooses to do so it must develop a plan that complies with the Medicaid statute and . . . regulations [promulgated by the secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services].\u201d <em>Himes </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em>999 F.2d 684, 686 (2d Cir. 1993). Federal medicaid regulations mandate that certain specified health services must be covered by a state plan; see 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 440.210 and 440.220; and allow states the option of covering other types of services. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.225.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">General Statutes \u00a7 17b-2 (8)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> designates the department as the state agency responsible for administering the state\u2019s medicaid program. The commissioner is authorized to promulgate regulations necessary for the administration of the program. See General Statutes \u00a7 17b-262.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 2002, the legislature enacted General Statutes \u00a7 17b-28e, which required the commissioner to amend the state medicaid plan to \u201cimplement the provisions of public act 02-1 of the May 9 special session concerning optional services under the Medicaid program.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In response, the commissioner eliminated from the plan, inter alia, services provided by independently enrolled psychologists to individuals over the age of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>twenty-one, effective January 1, 2003. See Department of Social Services, Policy Transmittal 2002-12 (December, 2002); Department of Social Services, Policy Transmittal 2002-009 (December 30, 2002). The plan continued, however, to cover services provided by psychologists associated with a clinic, hospital or other institutional program. See Memorandum from the Connecticut Medicaid Managed Care Council (December 13, 2002); Letter from David Parrella, Director, Medical Care Administration, Department of Social Services, to Connecticut Community Providers Association (January 13, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In addition to mandating coverage of certain health services, federal medicaid regulations require participating states to \u201censure necessary transportation for recipients to and from providers . . . .\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.53; see also Regs., Conn.

Health Care Financing Administration, Medical Assistance Manual, Pt. 6, \u00a7 6-20-00 (F) (1978) (Medical Assistance Manual).

Notice of Proposed Changes to the Connecticut Medicaid State Plan (Title XIX), Connecticut Law Journal, Vol. 65, No. 22, p. 2B (November 25, 2003). The department proposed deleting the bracketed word and adding the emphasized words, so that the amended language would read as follows: \u201cThe State agency will assure necessary transportation of Medicaid clients to and from providers of Medicaid covered services . . . .\u201d Department of Social Services, Policy Transmittal 2003-020, Attachment 3.1\u2014D (2) (December 29,2003), p. 1. The amended language was approved on March 3, 2004.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>With this statutory and regulatory framework in mind we turn to our review of the facts and procedural history in the present case. The plaintiff has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and borderline personality disorder with associated self-mutilation. As of April, 2003, she had been receiving treatment from Mitchell Danitz, a clinical psychologist, twice weekly for thirteen years. During that period, LogistiCare provided the plaintiff with transportation between her home in Willimantic and Danitz\u2019 office in West Hartford. On April 22, 2003, LogistiCare notified the plaintiff that it would no longer provide transportation services because the December, 2002 amendment to the state medicaid plan had eliminated services provided by independently enrolled psychologists.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The plaintiff requested an administrative hearing to contest the termination of the transportation services. A hearing was held on May 19, 2003, and, on May 28, 2003, the hearing officer issued a ruling affirming the termination of the services. The officer concluded that the plaintiffs \u201cpsychologist is not a Medicaid-enrolled provider, and effective January 1, 2003, did not provide services that otherwise would be covered by the Medicaid program.\u201d She further concluded that \u201c[t]here is no provision in federal law or state regulations with respect to the Medicaid program to support payment of the [plaintiffs] non-emergency medical transportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>costs for travel to a non-Medicaid-enrolled provider for services that are not covered by the Medicaid program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The plaintiff appealed from the ruling to the trial court pursuant to \u00a7 4-183. The plaintiff also filed an ex parte motion for temporary injunctive relief requesting that the trial court temporarily enjoin the termination of the transportation services. The court granted the ex parte motion and, after a hearing, continued the injunction pending resolution of the appeal. Thereafter, the court heard arguments on the merits of the appeal and, on May 4, 2004, issued its ruling sustaining the appeal. The court reasoned that, under \u00a7 17-134d-33 (e) (1) (C) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, \u201cin order to qualify for nonemergency medical transportation . . . [the plaintiff] must (1) receive treatment that is paid for by a source other than medicaid; (2) the treatment must be necessary; and (3) the medical service must be covered by medicaid.\u201d The court stated that it was undisputed that the first two requirements had been met. It also noted that \u201cboth parties agree that the state plan continues to provide and pay for psychological services so long as they are provided in an institutional or clinic setting.\u201d The court concluded that psychological services provided to the plaintiff were, therefore, \u201cof a type of service \u2018covered by medicaid.\u2019 \u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that the commissioner was required to provide the plaintiff with transportation services. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The commissioner raises two claims on appeal. First, she claims that the trial court improperly determined that services provided by an independent psychologist constitute \u201cmedical services covered by Medicaid\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 17-134d-33 (e) (1) (C) of the regulations. Second, she claims that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiffs claim for injunctive relief. Specifically, she claims that the doctrine of sovereign immunity bar's such a claim in the context of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>administrative appeal and that, even if the claim for injunctive relief could be characterized as a request for a stay pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (f),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the plaintiff did not meet the criteria for granting a stay. We agree with the commissioner\u2019s first claim and conclude that the second claim is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Whether the trial court properly concluded that the psychological services provided to the plaintiff were \u201cmedical services covered by Medicaid\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-134d-33 (e) (1) (C); is a question of statutory interpretation and, therefore, is a pure question of law. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>266 Conn. 108, 116, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003). \u201cWe have recognized that [a]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. . . . Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . We have determined, therefore, that the traditional deference accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory term is unwarranted when the construction of a statute . . . has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The question before us has not previously been the subject of judicial scrutiny. Therefore, our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The parties are in agreement that an individual is entitled to nonemergency medical transportation to and from a medical provider only if the services provided are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>\u201cmedical services covered by Medicaid.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-134d-33 (e) (1) (C). The commissioner argues, however, that \u201cmedical services covered by Medicaid\u201d means services for which the medicaid program actually will pay, not services <em>of a type </em>that are covered by medicaid. The plaintiff counters that medical services are covered by medicaid if the medicaid program will pay for the same type of services provided in another setting, even if the program will not pay for them if provided in the setting under review. Because the medicaid program will pay for psychological services provided in a clinic or hospital setting, she argues, psychological services are covered by medicaid regardless of where they are provided.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree with the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>First, the plain language of \u00a7 17-134d-33 (e) (1) (C) of the regulations, that \u201c[transportation may be paid only for trips to or from a medical provider for the purpose of obtaining medical services covered by Medicaid,\u201d clearly suggests that the actual services provided must be covered by medicaid. The plaintiffs interpretation would require us to read language into the regulation that does not exist, namely, that \u201ctransportation may be paid only for trips to or from a medical provider for the purpose of obtaining medical services <em>of a general type </em>covered by medicaid.\u201d \u201cWe are constrained to read a statute as written . . . and we may not read into clearly expressed legislation provisions which do not find expression in its words . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ghent </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>219 Conn. 511, 515, 594 A.2d 5 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Second, we are not persuaded that services provided by an independent psychologist in a private office setting necessarily <em>are </em>of the same type as psychological services provided in a clinic or hospital setting. The memorandum from the Connecticut Medicaid Managed Care Council, supra, states that the medicaid program \u201cwill continue to reimburse [psychological] services provided as <em>part </em>of a clinic, hospital or other institutional program.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, the commissioner points out that the State Medicaid Manual provides that \u201cMedicaid provides coverage of various types of organized outpatient programs of psychiatric treatment. These programs are covered primarily as either outpatient hospital services (42 CFR [\u00a7] 440.20 [a]) or as clinic services (42 CFR [\u00a7] 440.90).\u201d Health Care Financing Authority, State Medicaid Manual, Pt. 4, \u00a7 4221 (A) (1988) (State Medicaid Manual). It also provides that patients who receive outpatient clinic or hospital psychiatric services should be evaluated by a team including, \u201cat a minimum, a physician <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>and an individual experienced in diagnosis and treatment of mental illness . . . .\u201d Id., \u00a7 4221 (B). These provisions suggest that, if the state has not adopted an optional medicaid provision covering psychological services, then the medicaid program does not contemplate the provision of psychological services <em>as such, </em>but only as a component of hospital or clinic services.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The plaintiff does not dispute, and the record supports a conclusion, that there is a rational basis for distinguishing between services provided by an independent provider and services provided in a clinic or hospital, even when the underlying services are similar. We note, for example, that the memorandum from the Connecticut Medicaid Managed Care Council, supra, and the provisions of \u00a7 4221 of the State Medicaid Manual, supra, suggest that one basis for the distinction may be that patients in an institutional setting generally have more severe disorders and more extensive medical needs than those who seek treatment from independent psychologists and, therefore, that psychological services provided in such settings are more essential to maintaining the patient\u2019s quality of life. This distinction may be illustrated by way of analogy. If the department determined that the medicaid program would pay for major surgery performed in a hospital; i.e., heart surgery, but not for more routine surgical care provided in a physician\u2019s office; i.e., removal of a splinter, it would make little sense to conclude that, even though medicaid would not pay for the removal of a splinter by a private physician, the service was the \u201csame type\u201d of service as heart surgery and, therefore, medicaid must provide transportation services to the private physician.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It would be more reasonable to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the state intended that an individual should go to the hospital if his medical condition is serious and, if it is not, the patient should either provide his own transportation to the physician\u2019s office or forgo treatment altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Indeed, it would appear that medical services provided by virtually <em>any </em>type of independent health care provider could be provided as a hospital service. See Memorandum from the Connecticut Medicaid Managed Care Council, supra (department will no longer cover services from independent podiatrists, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists, licensed audiologists and speech therapists, but will reimburse for such services provided in institutional setting). A conclusion that all medical services provided by independent providers are therefore covered by medicaid within the meaning of \u00a7 17-134d-33 (e) (1) (C) of the regulations would virtually eliminate the limits on the state\u2019s obligation to provide transportation services. Such a conclusion also would mean either that the state intended to go beyond federal guidelines providing <em>that</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> states are not obligated </em>to provide for transportation to secure medical care not included under the Medicaid plan\u201d; (emphasis in original) Medical Assistance Manual, supra, \u00a7 6-20-00 (F); or that the federal government intended that the limits on the state\u2019s obligation would be similarly insignificant. We see no basis for either proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The state has determined that psychological services provided by an independent provider, unlike those provided in a clinic or hospital, may be eliminated from the state medicaid program without seriously undermining the public health interests that the program was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>intended to protect. We cannot conceive of any reason why the state, with the approval of the relevant federal agencies, would reach that conclusion, yet also conclude that such services are so important that transportation services must be provided to and from the independent provider. Accordingly, we conclude that psychological services provided by an independent provider are not covered by medicaid within the meaning of \u00a7 17-134d-33 (e) (1) (C) of the regulations and that, therefore, the plaintiff was not entitled to transportation services to and from Danitz\u2019 office.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The plaintiff insists, however, that, although the amendment to the state plan \u201cdisallowed independent psychologists as compensable medicaid providers, a plain reading of the state regulation and state plan demonstrates [that] the [commissioner] anticipated situations in which [transportation services] would be provided although the medical provider was not compensated by medicaid.\u201d In support of this claim, she relies on the language of \u00a7 17-134d-33 (e) (1) (C) of the regulations that, \u201c[i]f the medical service is paid for by a source other than the Department, the Department may pay for the transportation as long as the medical service is necessary and is covered by Medicaid.\u201d We agree with the plaintiff that the regulation contemplates the provision of transportation services in <em>some </em>situations in which the medical provider is not compensated by medicaid. For example, if an individual received psychological services in a hospital that participates in the medicaid program and a party other than medicaid paid for them, the individual might still be eligible for transportation services paid for by medicaid because the psychological services were covered by medicaid in the sense that medicaid would pay for them as a payor of last resort.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That does not mean necessarily, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>however, that if an independent psychologist provides services, for which medicaid would not pay under any circumstances, and a party other than medicaid pays for them, the services are covered by medicaid. For the reasons discussed previously, we have concluded that that is not the case. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">We next address the commissioner\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly granted injunctive relief in the context of an administrative appeal. We conclude that this issue is moot. Because the trial court ordered the commissioner to provide transportation services pending resolution of the administrative appeal, the relief terminated upon the filing of this appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>this court can grant no practical relief to the commissioner. See <em>Wyatt Energy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Motiva Enterprises, LLC, </em>81 Conn. App. 659, 661, 841 A.2d 246 (2004) (\u201c[a]n issue is moot when the court can no longer grant any practical relief\u2019 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the Superior Court as provided in this section. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\"> The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b643-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17b-2 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Department of Social Services is designated as the state agency for the administration of ...

Services include:</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">\u201c(A) counseling and psychotherapy to individuals who are experiencing problems of a mental or behavioral nature; and</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">\u201c(B) measuring and testing of personality, aptitudes, emotions, and attitudes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Section 17b-262-471 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The department shall pay for the following psychological services:</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">* ** *</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">\u201c(2) Counseling and Psychotherapy</p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">\u201c(A) Diagnostic Interview</p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">\u201cInitial contact, review of available records, and personal interview with subject. Applicable only when formal testing is not possible;</p>\n<p id=\"b649-16\">\u201c(B) Individual Counseling or Psychotherapy; and</p>\n<p id=\"b649-17\">\u201c(C) Group Counseling or Psychotherapy. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b651-5\"> We do not intend to suggest that the plaintiffs mental disorder in the present case was comparable in severity to an injury from a splinter. Indeed, it is possible that her mental disorder was as severe as mental disorders treated in institutional settings. Nevertheless, the state reasonably could conclude that individuals receiving psychological services from independent physicians are, <em>as a class, </em>generally in lesser need of care than the class of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>individuals receiving psychological services from clinics or hospitals and that, if the option of seeking treatment from independent providers were eliminated, many individuals would be able to forgo treatment without dire consequences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\"> In support of its decision, the trial court relied in part on the department\u2019s decision in <em>In re B.H., </em>Department of Social Services, Opinion No. 930221 (August 11,1993). In that case, the department denied the appellant\u2019s request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>for transportation services to a physical therapist who was not an enrolled medicaid provider. Id., 5. The appellant\u2019s mother paid for the physical therapy. Id. The hearing officer upheld the appeal and ordered the department to provide transportation services, partly because there was no dispute that the physical therapy at issue \u201cwould be covered if the provider participated in Medicaid . . . .\u201d Id., 7.</p>\n<p id=\"AfF\">In the present case, the trial court concluded that this decision \u201csupports a determination that in deciding whether or not [transportation services are] required is determined by the type of \u2018medical service\u2019 to be provided rather than the status of the \u2018service provider.\u2019 \u201d The commissioner argues that the decision \u201cis inapplicable . . . because it predates the state plan amendment at issue here, and does not seem to have been followed by the agency itself or any court decision since its issuance.\u201d She argues that, contrary to the <em>In re B.H. </em>decision, medical services are covered by medicaid only if they are provided by a \u201cprovider\u201d as that term is defined by federal regulation. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.203 (defining \u201cprovider\u201d as \u201cany individual or entity furnishing Medicaid services under an agreement with the Medicaid agency\u201d). We need not decide that question in the present case, however, because we have concluded that psychological services, as such, are not covered by medicaid, unless they are provided as a component of hospital or clinic services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\"> Cf.
