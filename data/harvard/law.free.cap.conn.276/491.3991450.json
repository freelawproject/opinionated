Williams, appeals from the decision of the trial court denying his motion to modify the terms of a dissolution judgment with respect to alimony payments he was obliged to make to the defendant, Karen G. Williams. The issue in this appeal is whether, pursuant to the terms of the dissolution judgment, the trial court properly imposed on the plaintiff the burden to prove that the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances had been altered as a result of her remarriage. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The record discloses the following pertinent facts. The plaintiff commenced an action for dissolution of his marriage to the defendant, resulting in a written settlement agreement between the parties. On March 4,1999, the dissolution court, <em>Moore, J., </em>incorporated by reference that agreement into the dissolution judgment. The judgment provided for the plaintiff to pay alimony to the defendant, setting forth the amount, duration and conditions for modification of the alimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>On May 7,2004, the plaintiff filed a motion for modification of the judgment, requesting a termination or reduction of the amount of alimony on the grounds that the defendant was going to remarry on May 15, 2004, and that the plaintiffs earning capacity had been reduced due to health problems. The defendant opposed the motion on the ground that her remarriage was not a proper legal basis on which to modify the judgment. On July 23, 2004, following an evidentiary hearing, <em>Hon. John D. Brennan, </em>judge trial referee (trial court), issued a memorandum of decision denying the plaintiffs motion to modify the judgment. The trial court first noted that, despite a popular belief to the contrary, \u201calimony does not automatically terminate upon remarriage of the recipient.\u201d It then determined that, because the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, as incorporated into the dissolution judgment, required that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> govern modifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>tions; see footnote 1 of this opinion; the plaintiff was required to prove that the defendant\u2019s remarriage had caused a change in circumstances so as to alter her financial needs. Because the plaintiff had not met this burden, the trial court denied the motion to modify. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly required him to prove that the defendant\u2019s financial needs had been altered as a result of her remarriage. According to the plaintiff, in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Cary </em>v. <em>Cary, </em>112 Conn. 256, 152 A. 302 (1930), the trial court should have placed the burden on the <em>defendant </em>to demonstrate that the presumption that alimony terminates upon remarriage should not apply. The plaintiff further claims that the burden set forth under \u00a7 46b-86 (b), requiring the party seeking modification to prove a change in the recipient\u2019s financial circumstances, applies only in the case of cohabitation, not remarriage. Accordingly, the plaintiff claims that the trial court\u2019s improper inteipretation of the dissolution judgment rendered its decision denying the plaintiffs motion for modification improper as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The defendant responds that the trial court, in accordance with the terms of the dissolution judgment, properly placed the burden on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant\u2019s remarriage had a beneficial financial impact on her. The defendant also points to the fact that, at the hearing before the trial court on the motion to modify, the plaintiff conceded that burden when, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>answer to questions by the trial court and before evidence was offered, the plaintiff explained that his motion to modify was based on two facts: (1) the defendant\u2019s remarriage would have a beneficial financial impact on her; and (2) the plaintiffs recent diagnosis of having a serious health condition that affected his ability to work and caused his financial situation to decline. Thereafter, the plaintiff explicitly acknowledged to the court that it was his burden to demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s remarriage had a beneficial economic impact on her.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant that, according to the terms of the dissolution judgment, in order to modify his alimony obligation, the plaintiff had the burden of proving that the defendant\u2019s financial needs had changed by virtue of her remarriage, and that, accordingly, the trial court\u2019s judgment was not improper as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">As a threshold matter, we must address the standard of review. \u201cAn appellate court will not disturb a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>court\u2019s orders in domestic relations cases unless the court has abused its discretion or it is found that it could not reasonably conclude as it did, based on the facts presented. ... In determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action. . . . <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>249 Conn. 265, 282-83, 752 A.2d 1023 (1999). Notwithstanding the great deference accorded the trial court in dissolution proceedings, a trial court\u2019s ruling on a modification may be reversed if, in the exercise of its discretion, the trial court applies the wrong standard of law. <em>Borkowski </em>v. <em>Borkowski, </em>228 Conn. 729, 740, 638 A.2d 1060 (1994).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>262 Conn. 299, 305, 811 A.2d 1283 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u201cIn a marriage dissolution action, an agreement of the parties executed at the time of the dissolution and incorporated into the judgment is a contract of the parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>66 Conn. App. 501, 504, 784 A.2d 1047 (2001). \u201cThe construction of a contract to ascertain the intent of the parties presents a question of law when the contract or agreement is unambiguous within the four comers of the instrument. . . . The scope of review in such cases is plenary . . . [rather than] the clearly erroneous standard used to review questions of fact found by a trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Amodio v. Amodio, </em>56 Conn. App. 459, 470, 743 A.2d 1135, cert. granted, 253 Conn. 910, 754 A.2d 160 (2000) (appeal withdrawn September 27, 2000). Because the language of the settlement agreement in the present case, as incorporated into the dissolution judgment, is clear and unambiguous, our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">There are two pertinent provisions in the dissolution judgment, those governing teimination and modifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tion of alimony. Section 6.2 provides: \u201cDuration. Alimony shall terminate upon the death of either party or July 1, 2008.\u201d Section 6.4 provides in relevant part: \u201cModification.....Pursuant to ... \u00a7 46b-86 (b), husband\u2019s alimony obligation may be modifiable upon wife\u2019s remarriage or cohabitation.\u201d Thus, under the plain terms of the judgment, the parties expressly agreed that alimony would continue until a party\u2019s death or July, 2008, not until a party\u2019s death <em>or </em>the defendant\u2019s <em>remarriage, </em>and they further agreed that modification, either in the event of cohabitation <em>or remarriage, </em>was to be determined under \u00a7 46b-86 (b), which requires proof that the recipient\u2019s financial needs have changed. See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The plaintiff contends nevertheless that the trial court was required to apply a presumption that the plaintiffs alimony obligation terminated upon the defendant\u2019s remarriage and that, because \u00a7 46b-86 (b) applies only in the case of cohabitation unaccompanied by marriage, he did not have to prove a favorable change in the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances in order to obtain relief from his alimony obligation. He relies on <em>Cary </em>v. <em>Cary, </em>supra, 112 Conn. 256, for his proposition that, because \u201cevery marriage alters the financial needs of the party,\u201d the trial court was required to presume that his alimony obligation was terminated unless the plaintiff could demonstrate exceptional circumstances dictating otherwise. His reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">In <em>Cary, </em>the court stated: \u201c[T]he remarriage of the wife should relieve the husband from the obligation of supporting the wife of another man. To permit her to have alimony from the first husband as an equivalent for her support after she had secured the legal obligation from the second husband to support her would give her support from her present and her former husband, and . . . would offend public policy and good morals. . . . Two husbands should not be liable for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>obligation of support for a woman who is the divorced spouse of one and the wife of the other.\u201d Id., 261. Thus, <em>Cary </em>has been relied upon as a basis for distinguishing between the effect of remarriage, where a change in the financial circumstances of the alimony recipient <em>ordinarily </em>has not been deemed necessary for its termination, and the effect of cohabitation, where proof of such a change has been deemed necessary. See <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 394, 441 A.2d 629 (1982) <em>(Shea, J., </em>concurring). Indeed, the legislature, in recognition of the fact that parties living together have no legal obligation to support one another financially, enacted \u00a7 46b-86 (b) specifically to allow courts to modify alimony obligations only when the financial needs of the recipient have been altered as a result of the cohabitation. See also 20 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1977 Sess., p. 2793.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Notably, however, there is nothing in <em>Cary </em>or its progeny that provides for modification of alimony in the event of remarriage in contravention of express terms of a dissolution decree. Nor in fact is there anything in that decision that would preclude a court, under appropriate circumstances, from ordering in the dissolution judgment that alimony will not terminate upon remarriage; indeed, \u00a7 46b-86 expressly provides the authority for such an action. See <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Balasic, </em>46 Conn. App. 327, 330-31, 699 A.2d 1036 (1997) (The court pointed to language in \u00a7 46b-86 [a] providing that modification may be made under certain conditions \u201c[ujnless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification\u201d and reasoned: \u201cThis statute clearly permits a trial court to make periodic awards of alimony nonmodifiable. ... It is well established by our case law that the trial court, as a part of its right to award nonmodifiable alimony and its equitable powers, has the legal authority to order alimony that does not terminate even in the event of remarriage or cohabitation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>[Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]), appeal dismissed, 245 Conn. 148, 710 A.2d 770 (1998); <em>Vandal </em>v. <em>Vandal, </em>31 Conn. App. 561, 565-66, 626 A.2d 784 (1993) (\u201cSince the court has the statutory right to award nonmodifiable alimony and the equitable power to meet the ends of justice\u2014in this case, by ordering that alimony not be modifiable even if the plaintiff remarries or cohabits\u2014we cannot hold this order to be improper as a matter of law. . . . The court\u2019s findings as to the defendant\u2019s financial inability at this time, because of his significant personal debt, to pay alimony in the amount to which the plaintiff is rightfully entitled are clear and sufficient to support the award . . . .\u201d). In other words, to the extent that <em>Cary </em>can be read as establishing a legal presumption in favor of terminating alimony upon remarriage, it is only a default presumption that exists to the extent that such a result does not conflict with the terms of the dissolution decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Indeed, a claim similar to the one advanced by the plaintiff herein was made but was rejected by the court in <em>Pulvermacher </em>v. <em>Pulvermacher, </em>166 Conn. 380, 383, 349 A.2d 836 (1974). In moving to modify the judgment with respect to the periodic payments to the plaintiff, the defendant in that case offered no evidence and made no claim of changed circumstances other than the plaintiffs remarriage. Id. Because, however, the agreement that was incorporated into the decree expressly stated that the payments were to continue independent of the defendant\u2019s remarriage,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>concluded that the trial court had determined properly that the decree bound the defendant to make the specified alimony payments. Id., 384-85. The court, therefore, rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the presumption under <em>Cary </em>that financial obligations are altered by virtue of remarriage controlled irrespective of the language in the decree. Id., 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Significantly, in the present case, the provision regarding duration of alimony does not provide that alimony shall terminate upon remarriage; rather, it expressly provides that it shall terminate only upon the death of either party or by a date certain. Contrast <em>Rosato </em>v. <em>Rosato, </em>255 Conn. 412, 414 n.2, 766 A.2d 429 (2001) (\u201cthe plaintiff pay the defendant alimony in the sum of $175 per week for a period of five years, with the alimony to terminate on the event of the defendant\u2019s death, remarriage or cohabitation\u201d); <em>Lawler </em>v. <em>Lawler, </em>212 Conn. 117, 118-19 n.1, 561 A.2d 128 (1989) (\u201c[t]he alimony shall terminate earlier, upon the death of either party or the remarriage of the defendant\u201d). Rather than provide that remarriage would furnish the basis for terminating the alimony, the dissolution decree in the present case provides that \u201c[pjursuant to ... \u00a7 46b-86 (b), husband\u2019s alimony obligation may be modifiable upon wife\u2019s remarriage or cohabitation.\u201d See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The plaintiff contends that, \u201c[d] espite this wording ... \u00a7 46b-86 (b) only addresses modifications upon cohabitation and establishes the conditions necessary for modification when there is cohabitation. \u201d Therefore, he contends that, notwithstanding the provision of the dissolution decree, the real intent of the parties was for \u00a7 46b-86 (b) to apply only in the case of cohabitation. In other words, the plaintiff suggests that we read the modification provision to allow the plaintiffs alimony obligation to be modifiable upon the defendant\u2019s remarriage or cohabitation pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86 (b), rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>than as the provision actually is written.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We decline his invitation in the absence of a compelling reason to disregard the clear and unequivocal language set forth in the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, as incorporated into the judgment of dissolution. There is nothing inherently improper about requiring the plaintiff under the facts of this case, as the party with the alimony obligation, to demonstrate that the remarriage of the defendant had a financial impact that should warrant a modification in his alimony obligation, especially when the statutes and our case law recognize that alimony may be awarded in addition to or in lieu of allocating other marital assets. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 (a). Although there is legislative history suggesting that \u00a7 46b-86 (b) was enacted to address those instances in which a party receiving alimony attempts to avoid modification or termination of those benefits by cohabitating in lieu of remarrying; see 20 S. Proc., supra, p. 2793; that intent has no bearing on whether parties or the dissolution court can invoke the statute for a different purpose in an agreement or decree. In the present case, the parties\u2019 decision to use the standard set forth under the statute as a basis for determining whether alimony should be modified was reasonable and clearly expressed. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s decision was not improper as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\"> The terms of the judgment with respect to alimony are as follows: \u201c6.1 Amount.

Husband waives the right to seek or receive periodic alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">\u201c6.4 Modification. Husband shall not be entitled to receive a decrease in his alimony obligation unless he satisfactorily demonstrates to the court that he has suffered a substantial and significant decrease in income, such decrease was not due in any way to his voluntary change in lifestyle, career choice, place of residence or new responsibilities, and that he has taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>afBrmative steps and used his best efforts to maintain his income. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b), husband\u2019s alimony obligation may be modifiable upon wife\u2019s remarriage or cohabitation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Unless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification, the court may order either party to maintain life insurance for the other party or a minor child of the parties or any final order for the periodic payment of permanent alimony or support or an order for alimony or support pendente lite may at any time thereafter be continued, set aside, altered or modified by said court upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or upon a showing that the final order for child support substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, unless there was a specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate. ... No order for periodic payment of permanent alimony or support may be subject to retroactive modification, except that the court may order modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion for modification of an alimony or support order from the date of service of notice of such pending motion upon the opposing party pursuant to section 52-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u201c(b) In an action for divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment brought by a husband or wife, in which a final judgment has been entered providing for the payment of periodic alimony by one party to the other, the Superior Court may, in its discretion and upon notice and hearing, modify such judgment and suspend, reduce or terminate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>payment of periodic alimony upon a showing that the party receiving the periodic alimony is living with another person under circumstances which the court finds should result in the modification, suspension, reduction or termination of alimony because the living arrangemenl s cause such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b518-6\"> The defendant points to the following exchange between the plaintiffs counsel and the trial court:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Well, Your Honor, it is my position that in determining whether or not alimony should be terminated at this point, the court can look at the, the totality of the situation of the two parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u201cThe Court: Look at what they might be two or three years from now?
