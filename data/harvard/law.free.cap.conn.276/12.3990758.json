Cashman, the commissioner of labor (commissioner), brought an action pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-68<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 31-72<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against the town to collect unpaid wages on behalf of twenty-two town employees. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and after a hearing on both motions, the trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the town. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The town employs the twenty-two employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between the town and the employees\u2019 unions. The employees\u2019 responsibilities include keeping town roads and parking lots clean of snow. When the town needs employees to work in addition to their regular working schedules for snow removal purposes, a town official calls the employees by telephone to inform them and to ascertain their availability. Thereafter, the town official posts a schedule of job assignments at the designated arrival point and employees learn of their specific assignments when they \u201cpunch in\u201d at work. The town\u2019s practice has been to pay its employees from the time that they \u201cpunch in\u201d until the time that they complete their assignments, or for four hours of work, whichever is greater. The commissioner instituted this action seeking to collect $16,219.80 plus damages and reasonable fees allegedly due to the town employees for their time from the moment that they received calls asking them to report to work to the moment that they \u201cpunched in\u201d on site. He argued that the employees were \u201c \u2018notified of [their] assignment^]\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 31-76b<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when the town official called them. The town, in its motion for summary judgment, argued that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>employees were notified of their assignments when they punched in. The trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the town and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Our examination of the record and briefs and our consideration of the arguments of the parties persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The issues were resolved properly in the trial court\u2019s concise and well reasoned memorandum of decision. See <em>Cashman </em>v. <em>Tolland, </em>49 Conn. Sup. 354, 883 A.2d 24 (2005). Accordingly, we adopt it as a proper statement of the issues and the applicable law concerning those issues. See <em>In re Heather L., </em>274 Conn. 174, 178-79, 874 A.2d 796 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b35-10\"> The plaintiff, Shaun B. Cashman, the commissioner of labor (commissioner), clarified at oral argument that this action affected only those employees to whom the town gave little notice\u2014\u201can hour or two\u201d\u2014before they were expected to report, to work. The commissioner argued that these employees should be treated differently from those who received more advance, or what he termed \u201cpre-arranged\u201d notice, because the former did not have the opportunity to rearrange their affairs before reporting. The commissioner conceded that employees with greater advance notice need only be paid from the time that they actually reported to work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-68 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf any employee is paid by his employer less than the minimum fair wage or overtime wage to which he is entitled under sections 31-58, 31-59 and 31-60 ... he may recover, in a civil action, twice the full amount of such minimum wage less any amount actually paid to him by the employer, with costs and such reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as may be allowed by the court, and any agreement between him and his employer to work for less than such minimum fair wage or overtime wage shall be no defense to such action. The commissioner may collect the full amount of unpaid minimum fair wages or unpaid overtime wages to which an employee is entitled under said sections or order, as well as interest calculated in accordance with the provisions of section 31-265 from the date the wages should have been received, had they been paid in a timely manner.
