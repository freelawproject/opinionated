The named plaintiff, William Alexson, appealed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court confirming an arbitration award that resolved a dispute between himself and Bertha Alexson and multiple defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> over ownership interests in a parcel of land that is situated in Bethlehem and Woodbury. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly denied the Alexsons\u2019 application to vacate the award and granted the defendants\u2019 motion to confirm the award because: (1) neither the arbitrator nor the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 47-28; and (2) the arbitrator\u2019s award was void under General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because the arbitrator was partial, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>award was both incomplete and in manifest disregard of the law. We disagree with the plaintiffs claims and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. In November, 1999, the defendants brought an action to quiet title against the Alexsons seeking to determine the ownership interests in a 4.3 acre parcel of land that was located in Bethlehem and Woodbury. In September, 2002, the parties settled that action by entering into an arbitration agreement that appointed Attorney Franklin Pilicy to hear evidence and decide finally all issues in the case. Subsequently, by letter dated January 5, 2004, the parties amended the submission to include an adjacent 2.2 acre parcel of land. After hearing five days of testimony, receiving exhibits and walking the property, the arbitrator concluded in an award issued in May, 2004, that the defendants had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that they were the record title owners of the 4.3 acre parcel, and that the Alexsons did not prove by clear and positive proof that they had adversely possessed the 4.3 acre parcel. With respect to the 2.2 acre parcel, the arbitrator concluded that neither party had proven record title ownership, but that the Alexsons had demonstrated by clear and positive proof that they were the exclusive owners of that parcel by adverse possession. The arbitrator ordered the defendants to \u201ccause to be prepared a [m]ylar [m]ap suitable for recording on the land records of Bethlehem and Woodbury to clearly show the disputed land 4.3 [acre] parcel now owned by the [defendants] and the [2.2 acre parcel] now owned by the [Alexsons]. The [m]ap should contain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the caption for this case, reference the [agreement for [a]rbitration and this [arbitrator\u2019s award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Thereafter, the Alexsons filed an application to vacate the arbitration award. The defendants then objected to the application, and filed their own motion to confirm the award. At the hearing before the trial court, the Alexsons argued that the arbitrator had not been impartial. They also argued that the arbitrator had departed from the terms of the submission by dividing the property. The trial court rejected their claims of partiality as attempts to relitigate the merits of the case, and concluded that the award both conformed to the unrestricted submission and was not in manifest disregard of the law. Accordingly, the trial court denied the Alexsons\u2019 application to vacate the award and granted the defendants\u2019 motion to confirm the award, and rendered judgment accordingly. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">WHETHER THE PARTIES\u2019 FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH \u00a7 47-28 DEPRIVED THE ARBITRATOR AND THE TRIAL COURT OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">We begin with a threshold matter, namely, the plaintiffs claim that neither the arbitrator nor the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute because of the parties\u2019 failure to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 47-28 that require arbitration agreements and awards, in order to affect an interest in land, to be executed with the same formality as a deed, to be written under the hand and seal of the arbitrator, and to be recorded in the appropriate town clerk\u2019s office. The plaintiff contends that the agreement is a nullity and does not comply with \u00a7 47-28 because it was not executed with the formalities of a deed, and the arbitrator merely signed the award rather than executing it under hand and seal. The plaintiff also claims that the award improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>directed the filing of a Mylar map with the town clerk, rather than the award itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The defendants contend in response that compliance with \u00a7 47-28 is not subject matter jurisdictional with respect to the present case, but rather addresses the enforceability of the award against third parties. The defendants also argue that the signatures of the Alex-sons themselves were not necessary because they assented to the agreement through their participation in the process, and it was signed by their attorney. The defendants also contend that the plaintiff waived his claims with respect to the hand and seal requirements by not raising them in the trial court and inadequately briefing them on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">We note at the outset that the plaintiff failed to raise his \u00a7 47-28 claims before the trial court. Although this ordinarily would preclude us from reaching these claims, questions of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, including on appeal. See, e.g., <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>273 Conn. 434, 441-42, 870 A.2d 448 (2005); see also <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Meader, </em>208 Conn. 352, 364, 545 A.2d 553 (1988) (\u201c[t]he authority of the arbitrator is a subject matter jurisdiction issue, and as such it may be challenged at any time prior to a final court judgment\u201d). \u201c[B]ecause [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">In the present case, the plaintiffs contentions require us to determine whether compliance with \u00a7 47-28 implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the trial court that is asked to confirm the arbitrator\u2019s award. This poses \u201can issue of statutory construction over which our review is plenary. ... \u2018It is well settled that in construing statutes, [o]ur fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature\u2019 . . . and that \u2018[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Wallingford </em>v. <em>Werbiski, </em>274 Conn. 483, 489, 877 A.2d 749 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Starting, as we must, with the language of the statute, \u00a7 47-28 provides: \u201cNo award of arbitrators, made since May 20,1841, purporting to decide the title to real estate, shall be admissible as evidence thereof, unless the submission of the parties to such arbitration is executed, attested and acknowledged as deeds of lands, nor unless such award is in writing and under the hands and seals of the arbitrators; <em>and such submission and award shall not be effectual against any persons but the parlies to the same and their heirs, </em>unless recorded by the town clerk of the town where such estate is situated.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\u201cThe test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>269 Conn. 120, 134 n.19, 848 A.2d 451 (2004). The plaintiffs contention that the award is a nullity absent compliance with the statutory terms is a reasonable reading of the text of \u00a7 47-28, particularly given the arguably contradictory language in the two separate clauses of the statute. The language in \u00a7 47-28 referring to the enforceability of the award against the \u201cparties to the same and their heirs\u201d conceivably could apply only to the discrete situation of an <em>unrecorded </em>submission and award, and not save a submission or award not <em>executed </em>in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 47-5,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which governs the conveyance of lands. The defendants\u2019 reading of the statute, however, as having no impact on the subject matter jurisdiction of the arbitrator also is reasonable, particularly given the statute\u2019s textual distinction between the award merely as admissible evidence of the title to land, and its effectiveness against the parties to a land dispute. Accordingly, we conclude that this statute is ambiguous and, therefore, we may resort to extratextual evidence in determining its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">We next turn to an examination of the legislative genealogy and history of \u00a7 47-28. Section 47-28 has existed without substantive change since its original enactment in 1841 as chapter 31, \u00a7\u00a7 1 through 3 of the 1841 Public Acts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Unfortunately, there is no printed legislative history from that time in our state\u2019s history to provide a source of insight into the meaning of the statute. Accordingly, we construe \u00a7 47-28 in light of other public policy considerations, including the well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>defined public policies that favor arbitration as an alternate dispute mechanism, as well as the settlement of disputes. See, e.g., <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Gailno, </em>275 Conn. 290, 306, 880 A.2d 127 (2005) (\u201cour [p]ublic policy . . . favors and encourages the voluntary settlement of civil suits\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Nussbaum </em>v. <em>Kimberly Timbers, Ltd., </em>271 Conn. 65, 71, 856 A.2d 364 (2004) (\u201cConnecticut has adopted a clear public policy in favor of arbitrating disputes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Having considered \u00a7 47-28 in the context of the statutory schemes governing titles to land and arbitration, we conclude that \u00a7 47-28 is a recording statute, compliance with which is not a prerequisite to the subject matter jurisdiction of an arbitrator resolving a land title dispute. There is nothing in the language of the statute that indicates explicitly that it is <em>jurisdictional </em>in nature with respect to the parties to the dispute. Indeed, quite to the contrary, the statute explicitly provides that failure to record results in the submission and award remaining \u201ceffectual\u201d only as to \u201cthe parties to the same and their heirs . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-28. This is an indication that the statute\u2019s terms are not jurisdictional in nature as between the parties to the initial dispute, and that the failure to record or follow the directives of \u00a7 47-5 affects the award only as it relates to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Moreover, the existence of General Statutes \u00a7 47-36aa,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which provides a mechanism for curing certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>defects in instruments affecting interests in real property, including defective acknowledgments or a lack of attesting witnesses, strongly suggests that compliance with \u00a7 47-28 does not affect the subject matter jurisdiction of the arbitrator. That these defects are cured automatically by statute, in the absence of a timely filed action specifically challenging the validity of the instrument and a timely filed lis pendens, indicates that compliance is not subject matter jurisdictional.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Finally, our conclusion that failure to comply with \u00a7 47-48 does not deprive the arbitrator of subject matter jurisdiction with respect to the parties to the dispute is consistent with the well settled principle that an arbitrator derives his or her jurisdiction from the terms of the written submission and the mutual assent of the parties. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-408;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Bennett </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number><em>Meader, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 359, 363 (concluding that, under \u00a7 52-408, \u201conly written agreements to arbitrate are valid,\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is from the submission alone that the arbitrator receives his or her authority\u201d); <em>Sawmill Brook Racing Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Realty Advisors, Inc., </em>39 Conn. App. 444, 449, 664 A.2d 819 (1995) (\u201c[b]ecause the writing provision contained in . . . \u00a7 52-408 was completely satisfied, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction\u201d over application to confirm award); cf. <em>Nussbaum </em>v. <em>Kimberly Timbers, Ltd., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 75 (claim that construction contract is unenforceable because of failure to comply with statutory requirements was \u201cwithin the scope of the arbitration clause and must be decided initially by the arbitrator\u201d when arbitration clause itself \u201c[was] in writing, as required under ... \u00a7 52-408, and the plaintiffs do not allege that the agreement to arbitrate is void for reasons that involve the formation of that agreement, such as duress, misrepresentation, fraud or undue influence\u201d). Indeed, even if aparty has not signed the written arbitration clause, it nevertheless may be deemed to have consented to the arbitration because conduct that \u201cconstitute [s] an acceptance of the benefits of the contract to arbitrate . . . estops them from asserting a claim of lack of authority.\u201d <em>Sawmill Brook Racing Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Realty Advisors, Inc., </em>supra, 455 (concluding that arbitrator and trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over dispute when some parties signed agreement and other challenging parties evinced consent when they participated in lengthy arbitration proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In the present case, it cannot seriously be disputed that all parties agreed in writing to the arbitration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>their dispute by Pilicy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the plaintiff participated fully in the arbitration by submitting evidence and witnesses, never once questioning the arbitrator\u2019s authority over the dispute until this appeal. Accordingly, we are satisfied that, noncompliance with \u00a7 47-28 notwithstanding, the arbitrator and subsequently the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the land dispute in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">THE PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLAIMS UNDER \u00a7 52-418</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">We next address the plaintiffs claims with respect to the validity of the arbitration award under \u00a7 52-418. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the .trial court should have vacated the award because: (1) the arbitrator granted the Alexsons title by adverse possession of the 2.2 acre parcel in manifest disregard of the law; (2) it is incomplete because it failed to dispose of a tract of land that forms a passageway between the 2.2 acre parcel and the 4.3 acre parcel; and (3) the arbitrator was partial in violation of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (2). We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Before turning to the plaintiffs specific claims, we set forth \u201cthe well established principles that guide our analysis. Judicial review of arbitral decisions is narrowly confined. . . . When the parties agree to arbitration and establish the authority of the arbitrator through the terms of their submission, the extent of our judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement. . . . When the scope of the submission is unrestricted, the resulting award is not subject to de novo review even for errors of law so long as the award conforms to the submission. . . . Because we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">\u201cWhere the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the grounds that . . . the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous. Courts will not review the evidence nor, where the submission is unrestricted, will they review the arbitrators\u2019 decision of the legal questions involved. ... In other words, [ujnder an unrestricted submission, the arbitrators\u2019 decision is considered final and binding; thus the courts will not review the evidence considered by the arbitrators nor will they review the award for errors of law or fact. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">\u201cThe significance ... of a determination that an arbitration submission was unrestricted or restricted is not to determine what the arbitrators are obligated to do, but to determine the scope of judicial review of what they have done. Put another way, the submission tells the arbitrators what they are obligated to decide. The determination by a court of whether the submission was restricted or unrestricted tells the court what its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>scope of review is regarding the arbitrators\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">\u201cEven in the case of an unrestricted submission, we have . . . recognized three grounds for vacating an award: (1) the award rules on the constitutionality of a statute ... (2) the award violates clear public policy . . . [and] (3) the award contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418. . . . [Section] 52-418 (a) (4) provides that an arbitration award shall be vacated if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">\u201cIn our construction of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4), we have, as a general matter, looked to a comparison of the award with the submission to determine whether the arbitrators have exceeded their powers. . . . We have also recognized, however, that . . . [a]n award that manifests an egregious or patently irrational application of the law is an award that should be set aside pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) because the arbitrator has exceeded [his] powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>275 Conn. 72, 80-81, 881 A.2d 139 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">We begin with the plaintiffs claim that the award was made in manifest disregard of the law. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the arbitrator improperly disregarded the law of adverse possession when he concluded that the Alexsons had gained title to the 2.2 acre property, without first concluding that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>dants were the record owners of that land.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendants contend in response that the arbitrator\u2019s action was not an egregious or patently irrational application of the law governing adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">\u201cIn our construction of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4), we have, as a general matter, looked to a comparison of the award with the submission to determine whether the arbitrators have exceeded their powers. . . . We have also recognized, however, that an arbitrator\u2019s egregious misperformance of duty may warrant rejection of the resulting award. In <em>Darien Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>172 Conn. 434, 437-38, 374 A.2d 1081 (1977), we noted that [i]f the memorandum of an arbitrator revealed that he had reached his decision by consulting a ouija board, surely it should not suffice that the award conformed to the submission. . . . Other states have also recognized that an arbitrator\u2019s egregious misperformance of duty or patently irrational application of legal principles warrants review and rejection of the resulting award. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">\u201c[A]n award that manifests an egregious or patently irrational application of the law is an award that should be set aside pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) because the arbitrator has exceeded [his] powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made. We emphasize, however, that the manifest disregard of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>law ground for vacating an arbitration award is narrow and should be reserved for circumstances of an arbitrator\u2019s extraordinary lack of fidelity to established legal principles. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\u201cIn <em>Garrity </em>[v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 612 A.2d 742 (1992)], we adopted the test enunciated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in interpreting the federal equivalent of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). . . . The test consists of the following three elements, all of which must be satisfied in order for a court to vacate an arbitration award on the ground that the arbitration panel manifestly disregarded the law: (1) the error was obvious and capable of being readily and instantly perceived by the average person qualified to serve as an arbitrator; (2) the arbitration panel appreciated the existence of a clearly governing legal principle but decided to ignore it; and (3) the governing law alleged to have been ignored by the arbitration panel is well defined, explicit, and clearly applicable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>273 Conn. 746, 756-57, 873 A.2d 155 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">We conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s ruling determining that the Alexsons were the owners of the 2.2 acre parcel by the doctrine of adverse possession was not patently egregious or irrational, and therefore, not in manifest disregard of the law. It is undisputed that the arbitrator applied the correct statutory and case law principles governing adverse possession.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, the arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>tor noted, and the plaintiff does not contest, that the Alexsons were the only users of that land during all relevant time periods. The arbitrator\u2019s decision, therefore, was not irrational in view of the evidence before him and the governing legal principles.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim is, therefore, nothing more than a claim of technical legal error, which likely would be harmless even under a de novo analysis, let alone a proper basis for vacatur under the manifest disregard of the law doctrine. The trial court, therefore, properly denied the plaintiffs application to vacate the award on the ground of manifest disregard of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the arbitrator\u2019s failure to determine ownership of a passageway between the 2.2 acre and 4.3 acre parcels requires that the award be vacated under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4), because he \u201cso imperfectly executed\u201d his powers \u201cthat a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d The plaintiff argues that the award, therefore, failed to conform to the parties\u2019 final submission, which they contend included three distinct parcels. The defendants contend in response that the record is inadequate for review because this court does not have before it numerous relevant surveys, maps and other exhibits.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>The trial and reviewing courts review \u201cin effect, de novo\u201d a claim that an arbitration award does not conform to the submission.

Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 84. \u201c[T]hat standard best can be understood when viewed in the context of what the court is permitted to consider when making this determination and the exact nature of the inquiry presented. Our review is limited to a comparison of the award to the submission. Our inquiry generally is limited to a determination as to whether the parties have vested the arbitrators with the authority to decide the issue presented or to award the relief conferred. With respect to the latter, we have explained that, as long as the arbitrator\u2019s remedies were consistent with the agreement they were within the scope of the submission. ... In making this determination, the court may not engage in fact-finding by providing an independent interpretation of the contract, but simply is charged with determining if the arbitrators have ignored their obligation to interpret and to apply the contract as written.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Assuming that this issue was raised properly before the trial court,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we conclude on the basis of our independent review of the record that the award conformed to the parties\u2019 submission, which consisted of the original arbitration agreement and the January 5,2004 letter. These documents mention specifically only two parcels of land, namely, the 4.3 acre and 2.2 acre parcels, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>say nothing with respect to a third parcel. The award mentions only those two parcels, as well. Accordingly, inasmuch as the award conforms to the submission, we conclude that the trial court did not improperly decline to vacate the award on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the award should have been vacated pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (2), which provides that an award shall be vacated \u201cif there has been evident partiality or corruption on the part of any arbitrator . . . .\u201d The trial court rejected this claim, concluding that the evidence of partiality that had been proffered by the plaintiff was in fact evidence relating to the merits of the case, rather than evidence of a lack of impartiality by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">\u201cAn allegation that an arbitrator was biased, if supported by sufficient evidence, may warrant the vacation of the arbitration award. . . . The burden of proving bias or evident partiality pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (2) rests on the party making such a claim, and requires more than a showing of an appearance of bias. ... In construing \u00a7 52-418 (a) (2), this court concluded that evident partiality will be found where a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration. To put it in the vernacular, evident partiality exists where it reasonably looks as though a given arbitrator would tend to favor one of the parties.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vincent Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Application Systems, Inc., </em>16 Conn.

Specifically, the plaintiff relies on language stating that \u201c[tjhere is no doubt that since the passage of the act referred to such an award does not pass the title, and does not preclude the owner from claiming it.\u201d Id. Although the statute is relatively unchanged since that time; see footnote 6 of this opinion; <em>Parmelee </em>is of little help in the present case because the opinion does not specify the manner in which the parties did not comply with the statute in that case. Moreover, although <em>Parmelee </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 116, acknowledges the \u201cfavor\u201d given to arbitration that continues to this day, it predates, by more than 125 years, \u00a7 47-36aa, the validation statute, which was not enacted until 1999. See Public Acts 1999, No. 99-238, \u00a7 4. Thus, to (he extent that <em>Parmelee </em>stands for the proposition that compliance with \u00a7 47-28 is a prerequisite to the arbitrator\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction to a land dispute as between the parties, it is overruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-408 provides: \u201cAn agreement in any written contract, or in a separate writing executed by the parties to any written contract, to settle by arbitration any controversy thereafter arising out of such contract, or out of the failure or refusal to perform (he whole or any part thereof, or a written provision in the articles of association or bylaws of an association or corporation of which both parties are members to arbitrate any controversy which may arise between (hem in the future, or an agreement in writing between two or more persons to submit to arbitration any controversy existing between them at the time of the agreement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>submit, shall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable, except when there exists sufficient cause at law or in equity for the avoidance of written contracts generally.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\"> We note that the plaintiff places great import on the fact that the arbitration agreement, in addition to being unwitnessed, was not signed by the parties, but rather by their attorneys. This does not, however, mean that the parties did not assent to the arbitration proceedings because there is no indication that the plaintiffs attorney, who has continued to represent him since the original Waterbury proceeding, improperly exceeded his authority by signing the arbitration agreement on the plaintiffs behalf.

See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; <em>River Bend Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation &amp; Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>269 Conn. 57, 82-83, 848 A.2d 395 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\"> We note briefly that, although the arbitrator\u2019s discrete conclusion that the Alexsons had title to the 2.2 acre parcel by adverse possession was favorable to the plaintiff, we nevertheless have subject matter jurisdiction over this claim because the plaintiff is aggrieved by the judgment of the trial court confirming the arbitration award in its entirety. \u201cOrdinarily, a party that prevails in the trial court is not aggrieved, \u201d although, \u201c [a] prevailing party . . . can be aggrieved if the relief awarded to that party falls short of the relief sought.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>262 Conn. 107, 114, 809 A.2d 1114 (2002).

See footnote 13 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b637-9\"> We note that the defendants also argue that the plaintiff could have, but failed to, apply to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-419 (a) (1) for an order modifying the award with respect to its descriptions of the land at issue. They also rely on <em>Local 63, Textile Workers Union </em>v. <em>Cheney Bros., </em>141 Conn. 606, 109 A.2d 240 (1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 959, 75 S. Ct. 449, 99 L.

The plaintiff did mention the arbitrator\u2019s perceived failure to make an award with respect to the passageway at oral argument before the trial court. He did not, however, make this claim specifically in his written application to vacate the award, stating only that the arbitrator improperly failed \u201cto decide whether the [defendants\u2019] claim of title to the entire parcel is valid and instead award[ed] only aportion of the property and thus [failed] to properly execute and executed his powers ... in violation of [\u00a7 52-418 (a) (4)].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\"> As evidence of partiality by the arbitrator, the plaintiff states that the arbitrator improperly: (1) read certain boundaries in the deeds; (2) \u201cignored the fact that [the plaintiff] paid taxes on the land for over eighty years\u201d and the defendants \u201cnever paid taxes on the land\u201d; (3) \u201cignored the fact that [the plaintiff] farmed the land for over eighty years\u201d; and (4) \u201cignored the fact that [the plaintiff] threw the [defendants\u2019] real estate agent off the land, put barbed wire around the premises and he put \u2018No Trespassing\u2019 signs on the premises.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
