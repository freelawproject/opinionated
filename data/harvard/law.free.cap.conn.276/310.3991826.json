(Floorgraphics).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The plaintiff, a company in the in-store advertising and promotional products industry, brought this action alleging that Marquis, the plaintiffs former vice president of retail marketing for the north central region of the United States, breached his duty of loyalty to the plaintiff, converted the plaintiffs property and violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-251<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 52-570b<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by engaging in unauthorized access to, and misuse of, its computer system. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that Marquis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>prior to submitting his resignation, solicited one of its employees to work for his new employer, Floorgraphics, a business competitor of the plaintiff, and took copies of certain business related materials, some of which he had obtained by gaining access to computer files.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The trial court rejected the plaintiffs breach of loyalty claim, which was based on Marquis\u2019 removal of the materials from the plaintiffs premises and from the plaintiffs computer system and on the solicitation of one of the plaintiffs employees, because there was no evidence that Floorgraphics had, through Marquis\u2019 actions, acquired any secret information or that Marquis had disclosed any trade secret material to Floorgraphics and because the employee whom Marquis solicited did not leave the plaintiffs employ. The court also determined that, because the plaintiff, which had withdrawn any claims for injunctive relief, had not proved that it suffered an injury or loss, it was not a prevailing party under \u00a7 52-570b (e) and therefore was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees or costs under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the Appellate Court agreed that there was no breach of the duty of loyalty, holding that \u201cproof of a specific loss is an essential element in a cause of action for breach of the duty of loyalty owed by an employee to his employer.\u201d <em>News America Marketing In-Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>86 Conn. App. 527, 534, 862 A.2d 837 (2004). In so concluding, the Appellate Court rejected the plaintiffs claim that money the plaintiff had expended on an investigation for purposes of the present action constituted damages. Id., 536-37. The court also agreed with the trial court\u2019s analysis of the plaintiffs claim for costs and attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 52-570b, concluding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>plaintiff had failed to show that it was a person who had suffered injury, as required by \u00a7 52-570b (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id., 548-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Our examination of the record and briefs and our consideration of the arguments of the parties persuade us that the judgment of the Appellate Court should be affirmed on the certified issues. See id., 533-38, 546-49. Those issues were resolved properly in the Appellate Court\u2019s concise and well reasoned opinion. Because that opinion fully addresses all arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt it as a proper statement of the issues and the applicable law concerning those issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>263 Conn. 692, 697, 822 A.2d 238 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-10\"> We granted certification to appeal limited to the following issues: \u201c1.

App. 538-43; (2) because the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that it had suffered a loss, it also could not prevail on its claim for conversion and, therefore, was not entitled to treble damages under General Statutes \u00a7 52-564; see id., 543-46; and (3) the plaintiff was not entitled to nominal damages as to any of its claims, because for each of those claims, the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate the defendants\u2019 liability.
