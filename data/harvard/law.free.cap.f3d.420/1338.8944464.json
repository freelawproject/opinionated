Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), this Court lacks jurisdiction to review removal orders based on a conviction for a crime involving moral tur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>pitude. After review, we conclude that Sosa-Martinez\u2019s aggravated battery conviction, in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 784.045, is a crime of moral turpitude under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), and thus we dismiss Sosa-Martinez\u2019s petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">On July 19, 1995, Sosa-Martinez, a native and citizen of Honduras, was admitted into the United States at Miami, Florida, as a lawful permanent resident. On May 24, 1998, Sosa-Martinez, who was then nineteen years of age, was involved in a fight. During the fight, he stabbed the victim, a rival gang member, three times with a pocket knife. Sosa-Martinez was charged with attempted second degree murder. On March 29, 1999, he entered a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to a reduced charge of aggravated battery, in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 784.045.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">On May 8, 2001, the INS sent a Notice to Appear to Sosa-Martinez, charging him as being subject to removal, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within ten years of admission for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At his hearing on March 12, 2002, Sosa-Martinez admitted the allegations but denied that his aggravated battery conviction was a crime of moral turpitude. On this basis, Sosa-Martinez moved to terminate his removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-7\">On November 26, 2003, the IJ denied Sosa-Martinez\u2019s motion to terminate the removal proceedings, determined that Sosa-Martinez was an alien subject to removal because he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, and ordered that he be removed to Honduras. In denying Sosa-Martinez\u2019s motion to terminate, the IJ determined that Sosa-Martinez was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, and \u201cespecially in this case where ... [Sosa-Martinez] was convicted of a crime involving repeatedly stabbing a person with a knife evidencing a depraved mind regardless of human life as is incorporated in the statute in which he was convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-10\">Sosa-Martinez appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, arguing that the crime for which he was convicted was not one involving moral turpitude. On December 7, 2004, the BIA entered an order, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s decision. Sosa-Martinez petitions this Court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ABdu\">\n<em>A Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-12\">We first must determine whether we have jurisdiction to entertain Sosa-Martinez\u2019s petition. <em>Bahar v. Ashcroft, </em>264 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). Section 242(a)(2)(C) of the INA provides that this Court has no jurisdiction to review the final order of removal if Sosa-Martinez is removable by reason of having committed a crime involving moral turpitude for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). However, because judicial review is limited by statutory conditions, we retain jurisdiction to determine whether those conditions exist. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we must determine if Sosa-Martinez \u201cis (1) an alien; (2) who is removable; (3) based on having committed a disqualifying offense.\u201d <em>Moore v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 919, 923 (11th Cir.2001). Because Sosa-Martinez does not contest the fact that he is an alien, our review is limited to determining whether Sosa-Martinez\u2019s conviction for aggravated battery is a conviction for a crime involving moral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>turpitude. If we determine that aggravated battery is a crime of moral turpitude, \u201c\u00a7 242(a)(2)(C) strips us of jurisdiction to review the final order of removal.\u201d <em>Galindo-Del Valle v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>213 F.3d 594, 598 (11th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">\n<em>B. Florida\u2019s Aggravated Battery Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-6\">As noted earlier, Sosa-Martinez pled <em>nolo contendere </em>to aggravated battery in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 784.045. Section 784.045 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1367-7\">(l)(a) A person commits aggravated battery who, <em>in committing battery:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1367-8\">1. Intentionally or knowingly causes great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1367-9\">2. Uses a deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1367-10\">Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 784.045 (emphasis added). Thus, to be convicted of either prong of aggravated battery in Florida, a defendant necessarily must be found to have committed simple battery. <em>Arnold v. State, </em>514 So.2d 419, 421 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1987) (\u201cbattery is a necessarily included lesser offense of ... aggravated battery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-11\">Further, Florida\u2019s simple battery statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1367-12\">(l)(a) The offense of battery occurs when a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1367-13\">1. Actually and <em>intentionally </em>touches or strikes another person against the will of the other; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1367-14\">2. <em>Intentionally </em>causes bodily harm to another person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1367-15\">Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 784.03 (emphasis added). \u201cThe statutory elements of battery are: an actual and <em>intentional </em>touching or striking of another person against the will of the other person; or <em>intentionally </em>causing bodily harm to an individual.\u201d <em>Hamrick v. State, </em>648 So.2d 274, 276 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1995) (emphasis added). Thus, an aggravated battery conviction required that Sosa-Martinez:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1367-18\">(A) commit a simple battery by intentionally (1) touching or striking another person, or (2) causing bodily harm to another person, <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1367-19\">(B) that in committing that battery, he (1) caused great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement, or (2) used a deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1367-20\">\n<em>C. The Moral Turpitude Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-21\">INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)\u00a9 <em>provides </em>that a defendant who is convicted of a crime of moral turpitude is removable, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av2T\">Any alien who ... is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years (or 10 years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident status under section 1255\u00a9 of this title) after the date of admission, and ... is convicted of a crime for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed, is deportable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIE\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-22\">Although the term \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d is not defined by statute, courts have stated that it involves an \u201c \u2018act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellow men, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>420 F.2d 428, 431 (5th Cir.1970) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1160 (Rev. 4th ed.1957)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cWhether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>a crime involves the depravity or fraud necessary to be one of moral turpitude depends upon the inherent nature of the offense, as defined in the relevant statute, rather than the circumstances surrounding a defendant\u2019s particular conduct.\u201d <em>Itani v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 1213, 1215-16 (11th Cir.2002); <em>see also Garcia v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1222 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Rodriguez-Herrera v. INS, </em>52 F.3d 238, 239 (9th Cir.1995). This court has concluded that crimes involving moral turpitude include misprision of a felony, <em>Itani, </em>298 F.3d at 1216, and aggravated child abuse, <em>Garcia, </em>329 F.3d at 1222. Accordingly, we must determine whether an aggravated battery offense in Florida is a crime involving moral turpitude without reference to the facts underlying Sosa-Martinez\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">Whether aggravated battery involves moral turpitude is a question of first impression for this Court, but one that is easily answered in the affirmative. In Florida, aggravated battery includes, as necessary elements, that the perpetrator intentionally commit simple battery <em>and </em>in doing so either (1) cause great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement, or (2) use a deadly weapon. We readily conclude that any intentional battery that includes, as an element of the offense either (1) that it caused great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement, or (2) involved the use of a deadly weapon, constitutes a crime of moral turpitude.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-7\">Our conclusion is supported by the decisions of our sister circuits, involving laws similar to Florida\u2019s aggravated battery statute. <em>See Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 327 (4th Cir.2001) (concluding that assault with a dangerous weapon under District of Columbia law involves moral turpitude); <em>Pichardo v. INS, </em>104 F.3d 756, 760 (5th Cir.1997) (finding that aggravated assault pursuant to Pennsylvania\u2019s statute involves moral turpitude because conviction under the statute requires bodily injury and a minimum <em>mens rea </em>of recklessness); <em>Gonzales v. Barber, </em>207 F.2d 398, 400 (9th Cir.1953), <em>aff'd, </em>347 U.S. 637, 74 S.Ct. 822, 98 L.Ed. 1009 (1954) (concluding that assault with a deadly weapon is a crime that involves moral turpitude); <em>United States ex rel. Zaffarano v. Corsi, </em>63 F.2d 757, 758 (2d Cir.1933) (observing that assault with a dangerous weapon \u201cplainly involve[s] moral turpitude\u201d); <em>see also Matter of Medina, </em>15 I. &amp; N. Dec. 611, 613-14, 1976 WL 32319 (1976) (concluding that assault with a deadly weapon under Illinois law involves moral turpitude under any of Illinois law\u2019s three mental states \u2014 intent, knowledge, or recklessness).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-9\">Because Sosa-Martinez was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, committed within 10 years after his date of admission, and for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed, we dismiss Sosa-Martinez\u2019s petition for review for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>lack of jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-4\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1366-8\">. The INS did not charge Sosa-Martinez with being deportable as an alien who has committed an aggravated felony. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1367-16\">. This Court reviews questions of statutory interpretation <em>de novo, </em>but defers to the BIA\u2019s interpretation if it is reasonable. <em>Bahar, </em>264 F.3d at 1311. Where the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court \u201creviews the IJ's analysis as if it were the Board's.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1367-24\">. Decisions of the Fifth Circuit prior to October 1, 1981, have been adopted as binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit. <em>Bonner </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number><em>City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">. In <em>Garcia, </em>this Court held that the inherent nature of aggravated child abuse, in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 827.03 and 784.045, constitutes a crime of moral turpitude. <em>Garcia, </em>329 F.3d at 1222. Under Florida law, aggravated child abuse occurs in several ways, including when a person commits aggravated battery on a child. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 827.03(2)(a) providing that \" 'Aggravated child abuse' occurs when a person ... [c]ommits aggravated battery on a child\u201d). While aggravated battery on a child may be more depraved than aggravated battery on an adult, we have already concluded that a conviction for aggravated battery in Florida constitutes a crime of moral turpitude. However, because a child was involved in <em>Garcia, </em>we also analyze above why aggravated battery on any person is a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
