The policy contained the usual clause, \u201c that if the above vessel, upon a regular <em>survey, </em>should be thereby declared unseaworthy, by reason of her being <em>unsound </em>or <em>rotten, </em>or incapable of prosecuting her voyage, on account of her being unsound or rotten, then the assurers should not be bound,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A92S\">The ship having performed her outward voyage, set sail from <em>Riga, </em>with a cargo of hemp, on her homeward voyage, the 9th <em>October, </em>1810. During her voyage, she experienced very tempestuous weather, in the north sea, and sprung a leak, and still experiencing bad weather and heavy seas, and the leak increasing, with the advice of his officers and crew, the captain bore away for a port, and on the 12th <em>November </em>arrived at <em>Kinsale, </em>In <em>Ireland, </em>when the captain made a protest, and had the ship surr r r <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>veyed by two shipmasters and two carpenters. A copy of the <em>survey </em>made being shown to the captain, wrho was examined as \u00e1 witness, he said he was present when the survey was made, and that the facts stated in it were true. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then offered to read the copy of the <em>survey </em>in evidence, which was objected to by the defendants\u2019 counsel, first, because, it was a <em>copy </em>of the original survey: and, secondly, because the <em>survey </em>could not be read in evidence in chief, without its being proved by an examination of the surveyors. The judge overruled the objections, and the copy of the survey, dated the 16th <em>No vember, </em>1810, was read in evidence. The captain testified that the ship was repaired at <em>Kinsale, </em>and was then again surveyed, and a notarial copy of the second survey, dated 24th <em>December, </em>1810, was offered in evidence, the captain having testified to the truth of the facts contained in it; it was objected to on the same grounds as above stated, but was admitted and read in evidence. The captain further stated, that he sailed from <em>Kinsale </em>homeward, the 28th <em>De</em>cember, and on the <em>1st January, </em>1813, encountered a very heavy gale of wind, in which the ship received a stroke of the sea whichx injured her very much, in consequence of which she became very leaky, and high winds, &amp;c. continuing, on consultation, it was judged necessary again to make a port to refit; that he met a frigate and privateer, both of which advised him to abandon the vessel; but he arrived again at <em>Kinsale, </em>in 14 days after his departure. Two surveys were made on the ship, by persons appointed by the master; one on the 19th <em>January, </em>the other on the 15th <em>April, </em>at which the captain was present; and he testified to the truth of the facts contained in the original surveys, which were produced and read in evidence, though objected to by the defendants\u2019 counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-7\">The captain said, that the repairs of the ship would have cost more than 2,500 pounds <em>Irish sterling; </em>that he could not get carpenters who would repair her for that sum; that to make the necessary repairs, it would have been necessary to take off her sheathing, which alone would have cost 700 pounds sterling. The ship was condemned as unfit to be repaired, and sold at Kinsale. Other evidence was given as to the <em>seaworthiness </em>of the ship; and the judge charged the jury that the <em>surveys </em>did not, of themselves, form a defence, under the clause in the policy; and he left the question of seaworthiness to their decision, but directed them, that if they thought the vessel seaworthy, and that it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>alter the ucual de~uct~on of one th~rdI~ new for old, more than a moiety of her value to repair hers the plaintiffs would be enti~ fled to recover for a total loss; and that the plaintiffs were also m~titled to recover a partial toss~ arising from the repairs put on the ship at <em>Kinsale, </em>together with the general average produced by such loss. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs, for a total loss, and also for the <em>partial loss </em>and <em>general </em>average\u00ab</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-10\">A metion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-11\">Wells, for the defendants, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASX8\">1. That from the evidence. It ivas a clear case of unsea worthiness, arising from the vessel\u2019s being <em>unsound </em>and rotten, within the clause of the policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-12\">2. That the surveys were not evidence <em>in chief </em>on the part of the plaintiffs. They were not called for by the defendants. In <em>Hoff </em>v. <em>The Marine Insurance </em>Company,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the survey was regarded only as a necessary part of the <em>preliminary </em>proofs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-13\">3, That the plaintiffs cannot recover both for a <em>partial </em>and a <em>total </em>loss oh the same policy and for the same voyage. The defendants \u00a1have been paid a premium only for the amount subscribed; and they ought not to be held to pay more than the sum subscribed, or for a total loss; otherwise, the defendants would be made liable for a sum for which they have received no premium or consideration. The assurer undertakes to indemnify the assured no farther than to the amount of the sum subscribed to the policy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-14\">Hoffman and Colden, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcJ\">~ns~sted, that the defendanta having used the surveys in their defence, to show that the vessel was not seaworthy, the plaintiffs had a'righi to give them in evidence. By the decision in <em>Haff </em>v. <em>The Marine Insurance Com</em>pany, the plaintiff is bound to produce the surveys, as part of the preliminary proof; and he is equally bound to produce them at the trial. In <em>Neilson </em>v. <em>The Columbian, Insurance </em>Company,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Livingston, J. considered it as evincive of a want of good faith on the pari of the assured, that no survey was produced. A <em>survey </em>is a paper equally Important, and as <em>much </em>entitled to credits and to be received with the same degree of proof, as many other commercial documents. It is not pretended that a survey ought, ~f itse~f to be evidence. But it st~md~ on the same footing as bills of lading, lavoices, bills of parcels, bills of health, &amp;c.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> A bill of parcels with a receipt to it has been received, on proof of the ven~ do~'s handwriting, as sufficient evidence of propcrfy.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The rght of action for a partial loss accrues as soon as the loss happens. The expense of repairs is for the benefit of the in~ surer, and in order to prevent a total loss. A subsequent total loss is a distinct and independent ground of action. If the pIain1ifF~ cannot recover for both, they are not indemnified.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pAxJE\"> 4 <em>Johns. </em>Rep. 132.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"ADr\"> 2 <em>Caines Rep. </em>408.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"AveE\"> Marsh. on Ins. 709.

It is altogether an <em>ex parte </em>document. (3 <em>Johns. Cases, </em>46.) But the point need not have been raised in this case, for if the surveys be excluded, there was no evidence of a want of seaworthiness, and on the question of seaworthiness, as the testimony stands, the court do not think it would be proper to interfere with the finding of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The plaintiffs were likewise entitled to recover the partial loss, (in addition to a total loss,) arising from the repairs put on the vessel at <em>Kinsale, </em>in <em>November </em>and <em>December, </em>1810. As soon as these repairs were made, a right of action for those damages accrued; and to deny to the plaintiffs a right to recover them, would be denying them an indemnity. They were not connected with the subsequent total loss. They were a previous distinct loss. It was, at the time, a reparation in which the interest of the insurers was concerned, and as much for their benefit as for that of the assured. The motion on the part of the defendants to set aside the verdict is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
