It might have been only a trespass: and then it was but a <em>suspicion </em>of being <em>accessary. </em>Clearly the defendant was not indictable and punishable under the statute, for the prisoner was not committed under any distinct and certain charge of <em>felony. </em>The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
