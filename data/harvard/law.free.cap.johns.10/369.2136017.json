The plaint and declaration, in the court below, was for taking and detaining, by the defendant, 24 sheep &lt;\u00bb and 11 lambs, the property of the plaintiff. The defendant pleaded <em>non cepit </em>and three <em>avowries: </em>1. An avowry of the taking in his own right, and as bailiff of <em>James Hopkins, Thomas Hopkins, Job Cocks </em>and his wife, and <em>Mary Hopkins; </em>because, the close in which, &amp;c. was a close, &amp;c. and was the soil and freehold of the defendant and the said <em>James, Thomas, Job </em>and his wife, and <em>Mary, </em>of which they were seised as tenants in com- \u2019 <em>^ / </em>mon, &amp;c. And because the said sheep and lambs were then and there eating up the grass, &amp;c. and doing damage, and so being <em>damage-feasant, </em>he avowed the taking of them as a <em>distress </em>for such damage, See. with a verification, praying judgment and a return of the sheep and lambs, with his damages and costs, &amp;c. 2. An avowry in his own right, because the close in which, &amp;c. was a certain close, &amp;c. and that the defendant and the said <em>James, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>T!wn?as, and the others, were seised imfee, as tenants in common~ to wit, that the defendant was seised inf'ec of one undivided third part thereof, and the &amp;her~ of two undivided third parts thereof.; and that the said James and the others had demised the said two third parts, &amp;c. to the defendant, for one year, &amp;c. and that the said sheep and lambs entered the said close, Stc. and were <em>damagefeasant </em>in the said close, whereof he was so seised in fee and possessed, &amp;c. and that he took them, &amp;c. as a <em>distress </em>for such damage, &amp;c. with a verification, praying judgment and a return of the distress. 3. An <em>avowry </em>of the taking of the said sheep, &amp;c. because he was <em>lawfully possessed </em>of the said close, and the said sheep were <em>damage-feasant, Sec. </em>with a verification, &amp;c. praying judgment and a return, &amp;c.</summary>\n<court data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b396-3\">NEW YORK,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b396-4\">Oct. 1813.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-8\">The plaintiff <em>replied to </em>the first avowry: 1. That by reason of any thing in the said <em>first </em>avowry, See. the defendant ought not in <em>his own </em>right, nor as bailiff, <em>Stc. to </em>avow, &amp;c. because the defendant took the said sheep, Sec. of his <em>own </em>wrong, and without any just cause, &amp;c.; and this he prayed might be inquired of by the country, Sec. 2. Because, that after the taking :-f the said sheep, Seethe defendant afterwards drove them to a public pound, before he had made application to the <em>fence-viewers, </em>See. to ascertain and appraise the damage, Sec. and before the damages were ascertained and certified by the fence-viewers, with the fees, &amp;c. as by the \u201c act relative to the duties and privileges of towns\u201d he was required to do ; whereby the defendant was a trespasser from the \u00cdbeginning, &amp;c. whereupon he prayed judgment, &amp;c. 3. Because, &amp;c. that after the taking the said sheep and lambs, &amp;c. the defend-j* ant afterwards converted and disposed of the same to his own ] use, and thereby became a trespasser <em>ab initio, </em>wherefore he <em>$ </em>prayed judgment. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-10\">To the <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>avowries, the plaintiff, in like manner, in his replication, gave three several answers, as above stated in reply to the first avowry. To each of these <em>replications </em>there was a <em>general demurrer, </em>and joinder.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-15\">P. A. Jay, in support of the demurrers</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A96\">1. The plea of de injuria propria is bad in replevin, thougl~ it may be good in trespass. In Jones v. Kitchin,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Eyre, Ch. J. on the authority of Grogate's Case,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> held such a plea clearly bad0 The rule is so laid down by Sergeant Witliains,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> and by Ghitty.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>2. That the defendant impounded the sheep, before applying to the <em>fence-viewers </em>to have the damage assessed, being a mere <em>nonfeasance, </em>could not make him a trespasser <em>ab </em>initio.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIdh\">3. The plaintiff in <em>replevin </em>cannot make the defendant a trespasser <em>ah initio. </em>In none of the books can such a plea in replevin be found; though there may be such a plea in trespass. If the plaintiff means to take advantage of the wrong or misconduct of the defendant, so as to render him a trespasser <em>ab initio, </em>he ought to bring an action of trespass. If in the lapse of centuries, no such plea in <em>replevin </em>is to be found, it furnishes a strong argument against it. It is true <em>Chilly </em>says, \u201c it would seem that in the case of a distress <em>damage-feasant, </em>the plaintiff ought to plead in bar that the <em>avowant, </em>after making the distress, used the cattle, or otherwise became a trespasser <em>ab initio.\u201d </em>But he cites <em>Comyns\u2019 Digest, </em>(tit. <em>Pleader, </em>3 K. 20.) with a <em>quaere; </em>and the authority cited by <em>Comyns </em>from <em>Lutwyche, </em>(1423.) will be found to have been an action of trespass <em>vi et armis. '</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-5\">The action of <em>replevin </em>is very different from an action of <em>trespass; </em>1. <em>Replevin </em>is a proceeding <em>in rem; </em>2. Both parties in the action are <em>actors ; </em>3. It is founded on <em>right,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>whereas trespass is for a <em>wrong. </em>In replevin, the plaintiff does not recover vindictive damages; the <em>tort </em>is waived, and no damages are claimed on the ground of a <em>tort. </em>If the party making the distress has been guilty of an abuse which renders him a <em>tortfeasor, </em>or trespasser <em>ab </em>initio, the proper remedy is an action of <em>trespass </em>grounded upon the <em>tort.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-6\">Again, the count is bad in not stating the <em>place </em>where the sheep were taken, as well as the <em>lown.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-14\"><em>Wells, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At_6\">The <em>first </em>and <em>third </em>avowries are clearly bad. It is net enough to say that the close was the soil and freehold of the defendant and others, of which they were seised as tenants in common; but the defendant must say of what estate he was seised,<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> as in the second avowry. The third avowry stales no title whatever in the <em>avowa.nl, </em>but a mere possession, and in replevin yon cannot justify on possession alone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-16\">As to the replication <em>de injuria propria, &amp;c. </em>it may be bad on <em>special </em>demurrer; but on a general demurrer it is good. A defect of a traverse in matter of form only, is aided upon a general demurrer, and would be cured by a verdict.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The only question of any importance is, whether the plaintiff\u2019 cannot in replevin, as well as in trespass, avail himself of the acts-of the party which make him a trespasser <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj-g\">In <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Petrie,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court said that cattle taken <em>damagefeasant </em>could not be impounded, under the act, before the damage had been ascertained by the <em>fence-viewers.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-f5\">Again, in the third replication it is alleged that the defendant converted and disposed of the sheep, &amp;c. to his own use. Now, it will not be pretended but that both these acts, if replied in an action of trespass, would make the defendant a trespasser <em>ab initio. </em>The <em>wrong </em>is the same in replevin as in trespass, and the redress may as well be afforded in one action as in the other. In <em>Pang-burn </em>v. <em>Patridge,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was decided that <em>replevin </em>lies for any tortious or unlawful taking of goods. Then why make any distinction in the pleadings, in this respect, between <em>replevin </em>and <em>trespass ? </em>The reason equally applies to both. Why, then, send the party \u25a0 to another action in order to recover his damages. Both <em>Comyns\u2022 </em>and <em>Chitty </em>are of opinion that such a plea is good in <em>replevin </em>; and there is no authority against them. The court, then, in th\u00e9 absence of any express authority to show this to he a bad plea, will decide on the reason of the case, and support this replication.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-11\"> 1 Bos. &amp; Pull. 76.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b396-12\"> 3 Co 66. b</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b396-13\"> 2 Saund. 281. c. n.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"b396-14\"> 1 Chit.

The defendant avows the taking of the beasts <em>damage-feascmt. </em>He does this in three several avowries, and the last of them is clearly bad, because the avowant does not set forth his title, or allege the-estate of which he was seised. He avows only that he was <em>lawfully possessed </em>of the close, and this Was not enough by the rules of the common law; and as we have no statute altering the rule of pleading in this respect, the rule still prevails, and so it was declared by this court in <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>M\u2018Intosh. </em>(6 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>380.)</p>\n<p id=\"A-sz\">The general replication to the avowries, <em>de injuria sua, </em>&amp;c\u201e would have been bad on special demurrer, according to the cases of <em>Lyttle </em>v. <em>Lee and Ruggles, </em>(5 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>112.) and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Kitchin. </em>(1 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>76.) But the m\u00e9rits of this case do-not turn upon the technical objections to the last avowry, or to the general replication. The special replications disclose matter which, according to the cases of <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Petrie,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and of <em>Sackrider </em>v. <em>M\u2018Donald,</em><footnotemark><em>\u01c1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>fenders the avowant a trespasser <em>ab initioK </em>and entitles the plaintiff to his damages for the original taking<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The action of <em>replevin </em>is grounded on a tortious taking* and it sounds <em>in </em>damages like an action of trespass, to which it is extremely analogous if the sheriff has already made a return, and the plaintiff goes only for damages for the caption. It is a point assumed in many of the books, <em>(Com. Dig. </em>tit. Pleader, 3 K. 20. 1 <em>Chitt. Plead. </em>562.) and nowhere denied, that the plaintiff may plead in bar to the avowry that the avowant so abused the distress as <em>to </em>render himself a trespasser from the beginning. 'There is no reason why the general principle should not apply to this action as well as to trespass, that where a person acts under i an authority or license given by law, and abuses it, he shall be deemed a trespasser <em>ab initio^ </em>The party recovers his damages in this action as well as in trespass, and the law would be incon-' sisfent in holding, in the action of replevin, that the original taking was valid, notwithstanding any subsequent abuse, and awarding a return, and yet in the action of trespass, to punish the party for <em>the </em>first taking. There is no colour for such a distinction in <em>The Six </em>Carpenters\u2019 <em>Case, </em>(8 <em>Co. </em>146.) where all the law on the subject is fully discussed and clearly expounded. It is there declared, that if \u201c the owner who distreineth for <em>damage-feasant </em>doth work or kill the distress, the law will adjudge that he entered Sor that purpose, and because the act which doth demonstrate the same is a trespass, he shall be a trespasser <em>ab initio.\u201d </em>But the / court proceed to state and illustrate the cases in which the party is not to be adjudged a trespasser <em>ab initio ; </em>as if a man take cattle <em>damage-feasant, </em>and the other tender sufficient amends, and <em>he </em>refuses to deliver them back, if he sue a <em>replevin, he </em>shall recover damages only for the detention, and not for the taking, <em>for that was lawful. </em>The necessary inference from the language of the case is, that in the first instance put, the person taking and abusing the beasts would, on a <em>replevin, </em>be deemed a trespasser from the beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The plaintiff is, consequently, entitled <em>to </em>judgment upon <em>the </em>whole record, and to have his damages assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Judgment for the plaintiff</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b398-4\"> 2 <em>Johns.
