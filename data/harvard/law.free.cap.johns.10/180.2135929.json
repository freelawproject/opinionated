Sherman, </em>in the books of <em>Dox. </em>No time of credit was specified, but it xvas proved that his usual term of credit was 4 months. The plaintiffs are merchants of established reputation, doing business on a very large scale, at <em>Albany. Dox </em>is a merchant at <em>Geneva, </em>in the county of <em>Ontario, </em>and obtains almost all Ms goods on credit from the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-9\">The defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that the sale of the goods to <em>J. and G.

The motion was overruled, and a verdict taken for the plaintiffs, for 1,500 dollars, subject to the opinion of the court, on a case containing the above facts, with liberty to either party to turn the same into a special verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-10\"><em>A.

This was a case of a <em>surety, </em>who will not be held responsible beyond the strict letter of his engagement. He said that he relied on the very cases cited by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, and the doctrine of which was recognised by the court of errors, in the case of <em>fmdlow </em>v. <em>Stmonds,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Again, the P.

He had no concern in the engagement between the present parties. It was perfectly immaterial whether the plaintiffs delivered the goods themselves, or caused them to be delivered by another person, on their request. It was enough that the goods were, in fact, delivered to the defendant, pursuant to the letter of credit.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AiX\"> 2 <em>Caines Cases in Error, </em>1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b204-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AP2\">The contract was made with the plaintiffs that <em>they </em>were <em>to </em>supply the <em>Shermans </em>with the goods, and on the <em>best terms. </em>Instead of supplying the goods themselves, the plaintiffs desire <em>Dox, </em>a merchant at <em>Geneva, </em>to supply the goods, and express no doubt that he would do it on the most liberal terms. The terms of <em>Dox </em>might have been very different from those of the plaintiffs, especially, as the plaintiffs resided in <em>Albany, </em>and traded on a large scale, and <em>Dox </em>lived far in the interior of the country, and obtained his goods on credit from the plaintiffs. <em>Dox </em>might not have had the means, nor the capital, to supply the goods on as good terms as the plaintiffs. The terms exacted by <em>Dox </em>might have been such as to injure the <em>Shermans </em>in their business and credit, and have led to a failure; whereas the terms of the plaintiffs might have been such as to have enabled the <em>Shermans </em>to have met them, and have saved their credit. The defendant might not have been willing to have \u25a0been security for <em>the Shermans, </em>for goods purchased of <em>Dox ; </em>and it is sufficient for them that they made no such engagement. They were to be answerable for the goods to be furnished by the plaintiffs,- confiding in their ability and willingness to supply them on good terms. They made no engagement to be answerable for goods furnished by any other house; and, consequently, they are not answerable in this case. The case of <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Edge, (7 Term </em>Rep. 254.) is analogous, and the principles of it in point, though the circumstances were not, perhaps, so strong in favour of the surety. There was a promise;, in writing, directed to the trading house of <em>A., B. </em>.and <em>C., </em>to pay for goods to be furnished to <em>D., </em>and as the goods were furnished after <em>A., </em>one of the partners, had withdrawn from the partnership, the party, making the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>promise was held not liable.
