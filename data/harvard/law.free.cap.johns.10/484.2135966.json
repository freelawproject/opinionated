There is no need of the extraordinary remedy by <em>mandamus, </em>in so ordinary a case. It might as well be required in every case where <em>trover </em>would lie. <em>It </em>is nota <em>matter </em>of <em>public </em>concern, as in <em>the </em>case <em>of public </em>record* and documents; and there cannot be any necessity, or even a desire of possessing the identical shares in question. By recovering the market value of them, at the time of the demand, they can be replaced. This is not the case of a specific and favourite chattel, to which there might exist the <em>pretimn affectionis. </em>The case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>The Bank of England (Doug. </em>524.) is in point, and this remedy in that case was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
