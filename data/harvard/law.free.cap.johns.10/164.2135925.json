Rep. </em>163.) which related to , part of the same lot, but there is a material difference between the. two cases, as to the evidence of adverse possession, when <em>Bonnell </em>conveyed to <em>Goodyear ; </em>and it appears in this case to be made out so clearly as to be sufficient to destroy the operation of that deed..</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The point is, whether the defendant did not hold adversely to any existing right in <em>Bonnell, </em>on the 11th <em>September, </em>1807, when <em>Bonnell </em>conveyed to <em>Goodyear. \u2022 Parish </em>appears to have been the earliest occupant of the premises, and he entered without title or claim; but on the 1st <em>April, </em>1805, he accepted of an article of agreementfrom <em>Grover, </em>as attorney to <em>Thom, </em>to convey 25 acres of the lot by a warranty deed, and <em>Grover </em>had a letter of attorney from <em>Thorn, </em>dated in 1805, which recited that <em>Thorn </em>was seised in fee of the lot No. 72. and it authorized <em>Grover to </em>convey the same in fee ; and this power was recorded in the clerk\u2019s office of the county on the 17th of <em>October, </em>1806. <em>Thorn </em>conveyed part of the lot, including the premises, to <em>Edward Wheeler, </em>by deed dated the 29th of <em>March, </em>1805, and <em>Edward Wheeler, </em>by deed of the same date, conveyed the premises to the defendant. At the time, then, of the conveyance from <em>Bonnell to Goodyear, </em>the claim of <em>Thorn </em>to the premises by title in,fee, appeared by his letter of attorney then on record, and the defendant was in possession under a deed from <em>Thom.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">If this adverse poss\u00e9ssion was sufficient to destroy the effect of the deed to <em>Goodyear, </em>the plaintiff cannot recover under the demise of <em>Bonnell </em>himself; for his deed to the defendant and others, subsequent to that to <em>Goodyear, </em>is enough to estop him, and the \u25a0 case, in this respect, comes precisely within the decision of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Demont, </em>(9 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>55.) The defendant is, accordingly, entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">J udgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
