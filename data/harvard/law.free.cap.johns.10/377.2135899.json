A witness for the defendant testified, that he was acquainted with the lot of land granted to <em>M\u2018Pherson </em>41 years ago, and has ever since been in possession of the <em>west </em>half of the lot; that when he first took possession it was wild and uncultivated, and he found at the S. E. corner of the lot a stake and stones, from which proceeded\u2019west a line of old marked trees,; which he followed to the east bounds of <em>Munro\u2019s </em>patent, where he found the S. W. corner, and had always considered that line as the true division line between that lot and the adjoining lot on the <em>south, </em>called <em>John Provoost\u2019s </em>lot, and that he cleared and held possession on the <em>M\u2018Pherson </em>lot accordingly. <em>John McDonald, </em>deceased, the father of the lessor of the plaintiff, occupied and claimed to own the south lot (M'Pherson\u2019s) about 18 years ago, and always held to the said - <em>division </em>line, - and made a division fence on that line, which still.remains. <em>John M\u2018Donald </em>died in possession of the south lot, and. the lessor took possession of it, after his father\u2019s death, and has ever since continued in possession. On his cross-examination, the witness said that the division line described by him included the premises in question in the north lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-8\">Another witness for the defendant testified that in the year 1777, he -went into possession of the <em>Provoost </em>lot, and the year after took the <em>McPherson </em>lot on shares under one <em>jWish, </em>who held it under <em>Donald Fisher. </em>That he knew the line described by the other witness, and that the S. E. corner of the north lot was a stake and stones, from whence, on the same line, was built a division fence of about 60 rods, the residue being woods through, which the line run, designated by marked trees to the S. E. corner of the same lot described by the other witness, in <em>Munro\u2019s </em>east, bounds, to a tree marked on three sides. That <em>John MDonald, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u00bfhe autumn before <em>Burgoyne </em>came down, (1776,) said that the line described by the witness was the <em>true </em>division line; that <em>the </em>land was surveyed for the king\u2019s soldiers, and that he <em>(McDonald) </em>was with the surveyor. The lessor of the plaintiff had built a stone wall on part of the said division line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\">Another witness also testified that <em>John McDonald, </em>the lessor\u2019s father, told him that the line described by the two other witnesses, was the true division line between the <em>north </em>and <em>south </em>lots, and that he <em>(M </em>Donald) was with the king\u2019s surveyor when the line was run. The evidence as to the confessions of <em>McDonald </em>was objected to, but the objection was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\">Another witness testified that about 24 years ago he took possession of the east half of the north lot now in the defendant\u2019s possession, and including the premises in question, under title from <em>John Williams, </em>deceased, and after being in possession for about 5 years sold to one <em>Perry, </em>and that he knew the <em>division </em>line to be as described by the other witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">The defendant gave in evidence a deed dated 22d <em>June, </em>1784, from <em>Alexander Webster </em>and <em>David Hopkins, </em>commissioners of forfeitures for the eastern district, to the said <em>John Williams, </em>in fee, for the east half of the north lot, as forfeited to the state by the attainder of <em>Donald Fisher, </em>which deed was objected to, but was allowed by the judge to be read.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-7\">The plaintiff gave in evidence a certificate from the secretary of state, that he had made diligent search in the books of patents to reduced officers, from the year 1764 to 1775 inclusive, and that he had not discovered any patent recorded for a grant of land to Sergeant <em>John Provoost, </em>who, it appeared by an order of the council dated the 8th <em>February, </em>1764, was entitled to a grant of 2,000 acres of land as a bounty for military services.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-8\">The judge charged the jury that the declarations of <em>John 31\u2018Donald </em>were evidence of the fact that the south bounds of the <em>M\u2018Pherson </em>lot were run by government, &amp;e. And the jury found a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial; 1. Because the judge admitted evidence of the declarations of <em>John McDonald, </em>who was not in possession at the time he made them, and under whom the lessor of the plaintiff did not claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-11\">2. Because the charge of the judge and the verdict were against law and evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-12\">3. Because the lessor claims under the people of the state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>against whom there can be no adverse possession within the period of 40 years. '</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A3bb\"><em>Crary </em>and <em>Van Vechten, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGj\">They cited 1 Johns. <em>Rep. </em>156. 2 <em>Cruise\u2019s Dig. </em>558. 1 <em>Rev. Laws, </em>562. <em>Runn. on Eject. </em>59. <em>Cro. Elis. </em>331.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-8\"><em>Skinner </em>and <em>Z. R. Shepherd, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b406-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AFj\">The presumption is, that <em>John 31\u2018Donald </em>waa, in possession of the <em>Provoost </em>lot when he made the confessions which were given in evidence on the part of the defendant. He was in possession 18 years before the trial, occupying and claiming the lot as his own. How much earlier he took possession does not appear; and as nothing to the contrary appears, the jury would have been warranted to presume that he was in possession under a claim of title as early as 1776, when he admitted that \"he had been present with the surveyor who run out the line between that and the adjoining lot. His confessions were, therefore, admissible as to the original line, and he repeatedly said, that he was present when the line was run out by the king\u2019s surveyors, and the line set up by the defendant is the line he referred to. This <em>John M\u2018Do~ nald </em>died in possession, and the lessor of the plaintiff succeeded, as his son and heir, to the possession of the <em>Provoost </em>lot, and in which he has since continued. We are, then, to conclude that the father purchased the <em>Provoost </em>title at an early day, and from the fact of the order of the council, and the original survey by government in 1764, and the recognition o.f it in the patent to <em>M\u2018Kcnzie </em>in 1765, and the continual and undisturbed possession by the family of the lessor, a patent to <em>Provoost, </em>and a deed from him to the elder <em>M(Donald </em>might even have been presumed for the sake of quieting the possession. (3 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>118,) In the case of <em>The Mayor of Hull </em>v. <em>Horner, (Comp. </em>102.) Lord <em>Mansfield </em>held that a grant or charter from the crown, which ought to be by matter of record, might, under circumstances, be presumed, though within time of legal memory, The fact in such a case is presumed for the purpose, and from a principle of quieting the possession, and not because the court really think a grant has been made. The act of the legislature under which the lessor shows a legal title, without the aid of presumption, is nothing more than a release #r quitclaim from the people of this state for their remaining right' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>(if they had any) to the Provoost lot; and that statute never meant to vest in M'Donald greater rights than he would have had if the patent to Provoost had been on record.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The confessons of M'Donald are, then, conclusive upon the lessor of the plaintiff, and when we add to this that the <em>Provoost </em>and <em>M\u2018Pherson </em>lots have been held and occupied, for. 41 years previous to the trial, to the line set up by the defendant, and that the occupants on both sides, and especially the ancestor of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff himself, by his act in building a stone wall on that line, have recognised <em>that </em>as the true line, the opinion of the judge at the trial was correct, and that line ought not now to be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Motion on the part of the plaintiff to set aside the verdict denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
