The libel set forth in the declaration was as follows, <em>to wit, K </em>It is with unfeigned grief we inform our readers, that <em>Southwick, </em>the late editor of the <em>Albany Register, </em>has become insane; the progress of his malady has been observed for some time past; and, at length, much to the regret of his friends, and his adversaries, it has resulted in a confirmed lunacy. The friends of the unfortunate, we understand, have confined him to his former editorial closet, and have consigned the management of his paper to a needy <em>Irishman </em>who wears straw in his shoes. Although this deplorable event has been expected by many for some time, yet decisive evidence of the disease having arrived at its last stage did not \u25a0&amp;emdash;* exist until the 24th inst. when the <em>Albany Register </em>exhibited such-unequivocal proofs of the insanity of its editor, that the friends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>and creditors of the establishment, we are told, shut up the poor maniac, put him into a straight jacket, shaved his head, and confined him to bread and water.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-3\">The defendant pleaded not guilty, and gave notice that he would give in evidence at the trial, in bar of the action, \u201c that for a long time previous to the publication of the supposed libel mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s' declaration, there had been a contest between the plaintiff, as editor of the <em>Albany Register, </em>and the defendant, as editor of the <em>Ontario Messenger; </em>and that in the course of the . controversy the supposed libel was published as a part of a piece, in answer to a <em>proclamation </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s, contained in the <em>Albany Register, </em>of the 24th of <em>July, </em>1812, and that the whole of the said answer, from which the supposed libel is extracted, when taken together, is obviously ironical, importing no charge whatever against the plaintiff; it being a satirical comment upon the said proclamation of the plaintiff, which would defy the utmost gravity to remark upon it without a laugh.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-4\">It was averred in the declaration, that before and at the time of the printing and publishing the libel, the plaintiff was editor of the newspaper called tbe <em>Albany Register, </em>and also president of the <em>Mechanics\u2019 and Farmers\u2019 Bank </em>in the city of <em>Albany, </em>and did hold the office of printer to the state of <em>New-York.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-5\">At the trial, the plaintiff called a witness to prove, by parol, that the plaintiff held the office of printer to the state, and president of <em>the Mechanics\u2019 and Farmers\u2019 Bank. </em>The counsel for the defendant objected to the evidence, but it was admitted <em>by </em>the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-6\">The plaintiff called a witness who testified that he was a printer <em>by </em>occupation, and had been at the printing-office of the defendant, at <em>Canandaiqua, </em>the last winter; that he saw the paper called the <em>Ontario Messenger </em>printed there; and that he had no doubt that the defendant was the printer and publisher. He was not particularly acquainted with the paper, but believed it to be printed with the types used in tho office of the defendant. He was at <em>Canandaiqua </em>once only, and staid about a week. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected lo the reading of the <em>paper </em>produced on this evidence ; and, also, because <em>the </em>declaration described the paper containing the libel as <em>The Ontario Messenger, </em>and the one produced was headed <em>Ontario Messenger. </em>But the judge overruled these objections; and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel read the whole of the ar-\u00b0 tide from which the libel was extracted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The defendant\u2019s counsel then read from the <em>Albany Register </em>of the 24th of <em>July, </em>1812, apiece purporting to be <em>a proclama</em>flora.

The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for siz <em>hundred and forty dollars.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\">A motion was made to set aside the verdidt, and for a new trial? 1.

Parol proof that the defendant was state printer, and president of the <em>Mechanics\u2019 Bank, </em>was admissible. Those facts were only inducement, and introduced as collateral matter, and not as matter in issue; and the practice is not /to require such strict technical proof, as if they were facts in issue. It is every day\u2019s practice to give parol proof, in such cases, of matters of fact, susceptible, even, of proof of the most solemn kind. The proof of the publication, by the defendant, ivas, also, <em>prima facie, </em>sufficient. It went to prove that the defendant had a printing-office, and that the <em>Ontario Messenger </em>was printed there, and that the paper produced was of the type of that office; and it was printed in the name of the defendant. The witness who testified to this was a printer, and printers know a newspaper by the type, and can generally ascertain the source of a publication from that circumstance. .The criticism on the variance between the title of the paper produced, and the paper declared on, cannot prevail, for there was no variance; the article \u201c <em>the\u201d </em>maybe .considered as no part of the description of the title, but as merely introductory to it. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">The ground of the motion on account of excessiveness of damages equally fails. It was for the jury to determine how far the ridicule of the plaintiff was malevolent, and calculated to injure his feelings, or prejudice him in the eyes of the public. After the principles laid down on this question, in the case of <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Southwick, </em>(9 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>45.) there does not appear any reasonable ground for interference on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">The motion on the part of the defendant is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-15\">Motion denied,</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b472-17\"><em> </em>See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Few, </em>5 <em>Johns.
