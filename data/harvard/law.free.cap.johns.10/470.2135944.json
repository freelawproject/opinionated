The plaintiff proved that a constable t0ok and sold two stacks of hay belonging to the plaintiff, by vire \u25a0*\u00bb , , . . . _ , tue of a warrant issued by a justice ot the peace on the complaint of the defendant, a <em>pathmaster, </em>against the plaintiff; that the hay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>wa~ worth 36 dollars, and was sold by the constable, at auction, for 1 dollar and 62 cents. The plaintifF had been warned to work on the highway one day, which he did; and was afterwards warned to work another day. The plaintiff was not present on that day, but his son was there. Several witnesses were examined on bothtiides, and the justice gave judgment for the plaintiff for twenty-five dollars.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b497-8\"><em>Lush, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArY\">cited 1 <em>Johns.

(Sess. 24. c. 186. s. 11.) But the defendant was not answerable, in a private action, for any error of judgment in <em>the </em>execution of his trust, as an overseer of the highway. He is only responsible for any neglect or refusal, under the 11th section of the act, which subjects him, in such case, to a penalty. This seems to be the opinion of the court in the case of <em>Bouton </em>v. <em>Neilson. </em>(3 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>474.) Perhaps his proceedings might have been reviewed on a <em>certiorari, </em>and set aside if not well founded. But a private suit will not lie against an overseer of highways, for adjudging a party in default, and making his complaint. It will lie only in the cases provided in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">Judgment rever,sed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
