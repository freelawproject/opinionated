It is not sufficient that the <em>testamentary </em>or other general guardian is made a party. The infant must, therefore, name and apply for the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>in this case, or the court will appoint a guardian for him. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b512-16\"> See <em>Matter ef Stratton and </em>others, (1 <em>Johns.
