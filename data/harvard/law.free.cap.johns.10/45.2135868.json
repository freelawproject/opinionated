C. to A., and that this suit was brought in the name of A., merely to enable Ti. to obtain payment of such debt; and that at the time of the commencement of the suit, and long before, C. was indented to him, B., in a larger sum, &amp;c.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-16\">It was held, that the plea was bad, in not averring that the debt alleged to be due from C. to B., was contracted prior to the <em>assignment </em>to B.. for whose benefit the suit was brought.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-10\">THIS was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>for goods sold and delivered. The defendant pleaded, 1. <em>Non assumpsit; </em>2. That the goods mentioned in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration were law books, and that <em>Isaac Riley, </em>at the time, Sec. carried on the trade and business ^ of a bookseller, by the plaintiffs, under the firm, See. but in truth, for the account and profit of <em>Riley, </em>and that while <em>Riley </em>so carried on the trade, he, by the plaintiffs, under the firm, Sec. sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>and delivered the books to the defendant, &amp;c.\u00a1 And that <em>Riley,. </em>before the commencement of the suit, being indebted to <em>Thomas Fairchild, </em>by <em>Brannan, </em>one of the plaintiffs, as his agent, and as' acting attorney of the firm, &amp;c. <em>assigned </em>to <em>Fairchild </em>his account \u25a0 and demand, through the plaintiffs, under the said firm, against the defendant, in payment of a debt due from <em>Riley </em>to <em>Fairchild ; </em>and that the present suit was brought by <em>Fairchild, </em>in the name of the plaintiffs, for the purpose of enabling him'to satisfy his demand, or some portion thereof, against <em>Riley, </em>who is the person really and ultimately beneficially interested in this suit; and that at the time of the commencement' of this suit, <em>Riley </em>was indebted to the defendant, in the sum of 1,000 dollars, for work and labour, &amp;c. money lent, money paid, and money had and received, &amp;c. with a <em>verification.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-3\"><em>The </em>plaintiffs replied that <em>Riley </em>did not, by the plaintiffs, under ' the firm, &amp;c. or otherwise howsoever, sell and deliver to the defendant, the books, being the goods, &amp;c. in their declaration mentioned, in manner and form, &amp;c. and this they prayed might be inquired of by the country, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-4\">The defendant <em>demurred </em>specially to this replication, because it did not traverse, or confess and avoid the matters alleged in th\u00e9 defendant\u2019s second plea; and because the matter so replied by the plaintiffs is matter of evidence, and ought not to be \u2018pleaded, and that \u00f1o material issue could be taken on the plea, &amp;c. The plaintiffs joined in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-5\"><em>Caines, </em>in support of the demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjP\">He cited 1 <em>Term </em>Rep. 619. 3 <em>Johns.

He only says that, \u201c.at the time of the filing of the bill in' this suit, and long before,\u201d <em>Riley </em>was indebted to ' him; now <em>non constat, </em>but that <em>Riley\u2019s </em>debt was contracted long after the assignment, and if it was, then the demand so assigned ought not to be affected by it. <em>Fairchild </em>took from <em>Riley </em>the debt of the defendant, subject to all the equity then existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>against it, and to the mutual dealings then subsisting. Its force and security were not to be impaired by a subsequent dealing between <em>Riley </em>and the defendant. The plaintiffs are, accordingly, entitled to judgment upon the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
