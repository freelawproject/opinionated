The cause was tried at the <em>Nem-Torh </em>sittings, in <em>November </em>last, before Mr. Justice <em>Spencer. </em>To ^ prove a <em>nonce to tus </em>deiendam. ol the non-payment of the note, the plaintiff called the clerk of a notary, who stated that on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>25th <em>May </em>last, he called several times at the store of the maker of the note, to demand payment, but found it shut up, and no person there to pay the note; that the <em>Monday </em>following, being the 2fth <em>May, </em>he sent a written <em>notice, </em>in the usual form, to the <em>postoffice </em>in the city of <em>Ncru-York, </em>directed to the defendant, mentioning that the note had not been paid; No other notice of non-payment was given to the defendant. The witness knew that the defendant, at that time, lived at a place called <em>Kip\u2019s Bay, </em>on <em>New-York </em>island, and within three and a half miles of the old city-hall in <em>Wall-street. </em>It was the practice of the notary to put notices \"of non-payment of notes into the post-office, when the endorsers resided out on the island as far as the three mile stone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-3\">The defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that the plaintiff had not proved a sufficient notice of the non-payment of the note; but the judge overruled the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-4\">The defendant then called the <em>notary </em>of the <em>Merchants\u2019 </em>Bank, who testified that it was his practice always to give notice to endorsers, who were to be found within the city, however distant from the city-hall, by leaving the same at their places of residence in the usual way <em>\u00b0, </em>and that he had delivered such nstices to persons residing at <em>Kip\u2019s Bay, </em>and, among others, to the defendant, \u2022 whose place of residence was well known. The witness, on his cross-examination, said he knew of no usage or custom of the city of <em>New-York, </em>as to giving notice to endorsers. /. <em>Gelston, </em>a witness, stated that he was a neighbour of the defendant, whose residence at <em>Kip\u2019s Bay </em>was permanent and notorious; that the <em>letter-carriers </em>of the postoffice did not carry letters to persons residing at <em>Kip\u2019s </em>Bay; and that letters <em>left </em>at the postoffice' for persons residing there would not reach them, unless called for at the postoffice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel offered to prove that the maker of the note, at the time it became due, was a merchant, and was insolvent, and had assigned property to the defendant to secure him as endorser. This evidence was objected to, but admitted by the \u2019judge. Several witnesses were then examined as to the solvency of the maker of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\">The notary with whom the note was left, and who was the notary of the <em>Manhattan </em>Bank\u00bb also stated that it was his practice to deliver notices to endorsers of non-payment, at their places of residence, if within the <em>compact part </em>of the city; but if they resided beyond the compact pait of the city, he caused such notices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>to be put in the postoffice ; that he did not know, at the time, where the defendant lived, but if he had known, he did not think he should have given a personal notice to him, unless specially directed to do so. When endorsers resided at <em>Greenwich, </em>which is about two and a half miles from the city-hall, and their names were entered in the ciiy <em>directory, </em>it was his practice to give them personal notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-3\">Another notary testified that he always considered it as his duty to give persona] notice, or at their places of residence, to endorsors who resided in any part of the city, whether within or without the <em>compact parts </em>thereof, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-4\">Th e judge directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff, stating that he did so, with a view to have the points of law raised decided by the court, meaning to give no decided opinion upon them. The jury accordingly found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ANrV\">S. <em>Jones, </em>jun. for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXX\">contended that the notice in this ease ought to have been left at the defendant\u2019s house or place of residence. The rule as to notice is to be found in all the books which treat of the subject of bills and notes. The <em>only exception </em>is where the party resides in another town or city, in which case, <em>it </em>seems, that a notice put into the <em>postoffice </em>will be sufficient.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The endorser, when he puts his name on the paper, does it, under the implied claim of the benefit of the existing rules of law on the subject. There is no such rule as that stated by the notary who gave the pretended notice in this case. The law knows no distinction between one part of a city or town and ano\u00ab ther part. Again, a notice put in the postoffice could not reach fue defendant, as the <em>letter-carriers </em>do not carry letters to <em>Kip\u2019s Bay, </em>where the defendant resided. The letter, at least, ought tohave been directed to him at <em>Kip\u2019s Bay, </em>and not generally, <em>atNew-York&lt;, </em>The <em>postoffice </em>is only one of the means of transmitting a notice. It is allowed when the party\u2019s place of residence is unknown 5 <em>but </em>here the clerk of the notary knew that the defendant resided at <em>Kip\u2019s Bay.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-7\">As to the question of the insolvency of the maker, he said the excuse was applicable only in esses of bills of exchange. (He was stopped by the court.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>Baldwin, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHk\">insisted that it was unreasonable to require no-\u00abice to be sent to the farthest limits of the city of <em>New-York, </em>which were coextensive with the county, and included all the islands <em>in </em>the harbour; he admitted the general rule to be that where the parties reside in the same place, the notice must be personal, or left at the party\u2019s residence. But what is meant by <em>place? </em>Does it mean a certain collection of houses on a particular spot, or does if comprise the whole jurisdictional limits of a city or town <em>1 </em>If the defendant had lived just across the <em>Hudson, </em>in <em>Jersey, </em>or across the east river, at <em>Brooklyn, </em>which are within two miles of the city-hall, it is admitted that a notice through the postoffice would have been sufficient. The village of <em>Harlaem </em>is within the jurisdiction of the city of <em>New-York, </em>yet, in <em>common parlance, </em>if, is not called or understood to be part of the city of <em>NewYorlc. </em>Many cases might be put to show the great inconvenience of the rule contended for by the defendant\u2019s counsel. Rules in regard to commercial transactions should be equitable and reasonable, and founded in general convenience.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-4\">The evidence, as to the insolvency of the maker, was proper and sufficient 5 it went to show that the defendant had not sustained any injury from want of notice. The reason of the rule on this subject applies equally to endorsers of promissory notes, as to the drawer or endorsar of bills of exchange.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\"> The limits of the <em>city </em>nf <em>New-York </em>motarte <em>-Ulanhattan Islantl, </em>and are coex- . vshe with the <em>county \u00a1 </em>the island is about fourteen and a half nines in length, and \u25a0\u2022vm. ene and a half to.two \u00a1migo in width.

There was no post-office at <em>Kipss Bay, </em>where the defendant resided, and the penny-post or letter-carrier does not deliver letters at that distance. The holder of the note was bound to give personal notice, or to see that the notice reached the dwelling-house of the defendant, the place of whose residence must have been known to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">We are of opinion that a new trial ought to be awarded with costs to abide fop event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">New trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">END OCTOBER TERM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
