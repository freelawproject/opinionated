It was held that the note was deposited <em>non pledge, </em>and not as a mortgage, and that a tender by A. of the 200 dollars on or before the day the note fell due, was sufficient to entitle him to a return of the note; and on such tender, and refusal by B., A. might maintain <em>trover </em>for the note.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-14\">IN ERROR, from the court of common pleas of <em>Washington </em>1 _ \u00b0 county. <em>Walker </em>brought an action of <em>trover, </em>in the court below, <em>J </em>\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>against <em>M'Lean </em>and <em>Ferine, </em>for a <em>promissory note, </em>dated 2d of <em>\u00aecptember, </em>1808, made by <em>Asa </em>and <em>Truman Wilber, </em>by which they promised to deliver to the plaintiff 200 bushels of merchantable wheat, at <em>Utica, </em>on the 20th of <em>February, </em>1811, of the value of 200 dollars. Plea not guilty, with notice of special matter to be given in evidence at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-4\">The plaintiff gave in evidence articles of agreement, dated 4th of <em>February, </em>1809, between the plaintiff and defendants, by which the plaintiff \u201c delivered\u201d to the defendants the note mentioned in the declaration, and in which the wheat was valued at 200 dollars, and the plaintiff promised, if the wheat did not sell for 200 dollars, he would make up the deficiency to the defendants ; and the defendants thereby gave the plaintiff the power of redeeming the note, on his paying 186 dollars with 3 1-2 <em>per cent. </em>interest, any time within six months of the time when the said note became due; and if he did not redeem it in that time, he was to make up the amount of 200 dollars, in case the proceeds fell short of that sum. On the 18th of <em>February, </em>1811, two days before the note fell due, the plaintiff tendered 200 dollars to the defendants, and demanded the note, which they refused to deliver to him. At the time the note became due, the price of wheat in <em>Utica </em>was 1 dollar and 44 cents per bushel. It was admitted that at the time the money was tendered, and the note demanded, one of <em>the </em>defendants had gone to <em>Utica </em>with the note to receive payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-5\"><em>The </em>court below decided that the note was delivered as a <em>pledge, </em>and not as a <em>mortgage; </em>that the sum tendered by the plaintiff was sufficient, and the plaintiff had a right to redeem it, paying the 200 dollars, any time before the note became due; and that by the tender and refusal, the right to the note was vested in the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-6\">The defendants offered parol evidence to explain the intention of the parties, at the time of the agreement, that the contract was to become absolute after the time given for redemption had expired; and that the plaintiff afterwards acknowledged that the note had become absolute, and that he had received his pay for it; and that he should make double the amount of the property he had received for the note that he would, if he had waited until the note had become due.

This is <em>the </em>evident construction of the agreement. It was <em>delivered to </em>the party with a power of <em>redemption, </em>and as a security for a debt which, on the day of payment of the note, would amount to 200 dollars. The defendants below were, at all events, to be secured in the receipt of the 200 dollars on that day. Here was <em>no sale </em>of the note. The property in it was not intended to pass, until after the default. It was merely <em>deposited </em>with the party, and the <em>legal property </em>did not pass, as it does in the case of a mortgage. All that was said in <em>Cortelyou </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>(2 <em>Caines' Cases in Error, </em>200.) as to the distinction between a pledge or pawn, and a mortgage of goods, and as to the right of redemption attached to the former, is just and applicable to this case. There was no special and precise agreement, in this case, that the note should become the absolute property of <em>M\u2018Lean and Perine, </em>if not redeemed within six months before it fell due. A power of redemption was then allowed, and if not made, <em>Walker </em>was, at all events, to see that the note yielded 200 dollars. The sound construction of the agreement was the one adopted by the court below; and the tender of 200 dollars on or before the day that the note fell due, was sufficient and in time, and <em>Walker </em>was, consequently, entitled to his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The parol evidence was properly rejected, for there was no such ambiguity on the face of the instrument as to require or authorize it. The written agreement was not to be contradicted or explained away by parol proof, and it was the province of the court to interpret it. The only point more doubtful is, that the court rejected evidence of the acknowledgment of the party, after the time of redemption. But the acknowledgment that the note was then absolute, could not conclude or affect his rights under the agreement, as it was only his unadvised opinion, and one that he had a right to correct, with better advice, and which it appears that he afterwards did correct, by making the tender. His observation that he expected to make more money in another way, was' perfectly immaterial, and his confession that he had received his pay for the note, was either to be considered as contradicting the written agreement, and making the delivery ef the sale an absolute sale, or as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>~y that the amount for which it was deposIted had been received, and that amount was deducted from the verdict, as it was taken only for the excess in the rise of the wheat beyond the 200 dol1ar~.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
