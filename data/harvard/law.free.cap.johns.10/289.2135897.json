The special plea ought not to be encouraged, as every thing which goes to show that there has been no tort, may be given in evidence under the plea of not guilty, which is the proper plea in trover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-9\">Trover is an action arising eic <em>delicto, </em>or for a <em>tort.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The insolvent act of <em>April, </em>1811, (sess. 34. c. 123.) refers only to debts or <em>contracts, </em>express or implied. In <em>Strong </em>v. <em>White,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was expressly decided that the act did not extend to an imprisonment for <em>torts. </em>Even m <em>England, </em>under the bankrupt laws of that country, where the discharge is not limited in its effect, the courts have decided that it could not be pleaded to an action of <em>trover. </em>The <em>form </em>of the action is matter of substance, and courts will maintain the established distinctions between the different kinds \u00f3f actions. <footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-10\">Again, the plea is manifestly bad for duplicity. It states two distinct and independent points or grounds of defence: 1. That the goods were delivered to the defendant to be sold on commission ; 2. That the defendant has been discharged under the insolvent act.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-18\"><em>J. Strong, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL_b\">Though <em>the </em>general plea of not guilty is the most usual plea, yet the defendant, admitting the property iir the plaintiff, may plead any matter which justifies the conversion. Special pleas of justification in <em>trover </em>are frequently to be met with in <em>the </em>books. <footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-19\">A plea may contain several matters or distinct facts, which make but one defence. Duplicity is where distinct matters which. do not form a part of one defence are put in issue.<footnotemark>||</footnotemark> A single point may consist of several matters of <em>fact.</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-20\">The technical objection as to the form of the action, is not sufficient to prevent the discharge from being a bar. <em>Livingston, </em>J. in the case of flatten v. Speyer,<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020</footnotemark> disregards this technical difficulty, and puts it on the ground of the claim being susceptible of proof before the commissioners of bankrupt; and he lays it down, on the authority of the <em>English </em>decisions, that all claims may be proved which are not contingent, or which\" do not arise from such torts, as assault and battery, slander, trespass on land, in which the damages are arbitrary and depending on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>judgment and discretion of a jury. The case of <em>Strong </em>v. <em>White </em>arose on an action for a libel, and it is not denied that in such an action, or for a proper <em>tort, </em>the discharge cannot be pleaded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-4\">Precedents for pleas like the one in question, may be found in the books o.f entries.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pAUK\"> Chitty's Pl. 497, 498, 499.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-5\"> <em>Hambly </em>v. <em>Trott, Cowp, 371. </em>375. 1 <em>Burr. </em>Sl.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AQm\"> 9 <em>Johns.

The first special plea is double, and contains distinct and independent matter, <em>viz., </em>a sale of the goods by order of the plaintiff, and a discharge under the insolvent act. The plea is bad, on special demurrer, in another respect. It amounts to the general issue, and though the old books contain numerous precedents of special pleas in trover, they are deservedly discountenanced in modern times, as leading to unnecessary expense and troublesome prolixity. The defendant could avail himself, under the general issue, of the matter pleaded; and though a special plea in trover was admitted in the late case of <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Fox, (7 Term Rep. </em>391.) yet Lord <em>Kenyon, </em>who censured the plea, said it would have been bad on special demurrer. The last objection applies equally to both pleas, but the last plea is bad in substance, for it admits that the goods were consigned to the defendant to be sold for and on account of the plaintiff; and then, without stating any disposition of the goods, sets up the discharge under the insolvent act. The plea admits that the defendant took the goods as <em>factor </em>or <em>trustee </em>for the plaintiff, and such property does not pass by assignment under the insolvent act, nor will the discharge affect it. The defendant remains equally liable as trustee, since as before the discharge. <em>(Kips </em>v. <em>Bank of New-York, </em>10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>63.) The first plea, so far as it sets up the discharge, and the second plea of the discharge are equally bad, because, a discharge under the insolvent act is no bar to an action of trover, which is grounded upon a <em>tort </em>or a <em>wrongful </em>conversion of the plaintiff\u2019s property. The same rule applies to a case of bankruptcy in <em>England, </em>where it is no bar to an action of trover, though the conversion happen before the bankruptcy. <em>(Parker </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>6 <em>Term Rep. </em>695.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The plaintiff is, accordingly, entitled to judgment upon both the demurrers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
