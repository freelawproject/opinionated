The deputy went to the tavern with him, and after waiting until it was dark, <em>Gardner </em>said he must go to gaol, and requested the deputy to go home with him, in order that he might get his clothes and see his wife; and <em>Moses </em>and two others signed a written agreement, which was produced, by which they became responsible in case he should break, or escape from the deputy, while going to his house, provided he was not retaken by the deputy, or delivered at <em>Troy, </em>so as to be taken on <em>Monday. </em>The deputy having gone with <em>G. </em>to his house, a person there deposited one hundred dollars with the deputy, as security, in case <em>Gardner </em>should escape. <em>Gardner </em>then took his clothes, and went out of the house to go to gaol; and after going a short distance, about two rods, he said he could not go any farther, and there made his escape. On the <em>Monday </em>following the deputy saw <em>Gardner </em>again, in the village of <em>Troy, </em>and arrested him, and carried him to gaol.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-21\">The deputy, on his cross examination, testified that when he arrested <em>Gardner, Moses\u2019 </em>tavern was about two miles out of the way to gaol, and the house of <em>Gardner </em>one mile farther; that he staid at the tavern until it was dark, and when <em>Gardner </em>escaped it was so dark that he could not see a person at ten feet distance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-22\">That after <em>Gardner </em>escaped, the witness returned directly to his own house, without going back or pursuing him, and relied on his indemnity; that when he met <em>Gardner, </em>on <em>Monday, </em>it was unexpected ; and that he afterwards returned the 100 dollars he had received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-23\"><em>Gardner, </em>being called as a witness for the plaintiff, testified that he was arrested about three and a half miles from the tavern, and that the agreement between the deputy, and him and his sureties, was, that he might go home until the next <em>Monday, </em>on giving security and depositing one hundred dollars ; that he did not ask the. deputy to go home to get his clothes, &amp;c.; but the deputy went there to get the hundred dollars; and after the money was delivered to him, set out on his return home, and <em>Gardner </em>walked out of the house, about four rods, to have some conversation with him, when <em>the </em>deputy left him and took Ms horse and rode away, and, be, <em>Gardner, </em>returned to the house, and remained there publicly until <em>Monday. </em>Another witness testified that he signed the agreement, as security for <em>Gardner ; </em>that <em>Gardner </em>went out with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>deputy, without his hat, and returned in a few minutes ; and the witness did not understand that he was to go to gaol. Two other witnesses also testified, that they understood the agreement to be, &amp;at on giving the security and depositing the one hundred dollars, <em>Gardner </em>was to stay at home until <em>Monday.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AaS4\">The judge charged the jury, that going to the tavern, and from thence to <em>Gardner\u2019s </em>house with the prisoner, was not an <em>escape ; </em>and that the only question was, whether credit was to be given to the deputy or <em>Gardner ; </em>that if <em>Gardner </em>staid at home with the consent of the deputy-sheriff, it was an escape for which the defendant was liable, otherwise not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASa\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AHRz\"><em>J.

The act (sess. 24. c. 28. s. 18, 19, 20.) concerning sheriffs, <em>See. </em>requires every person taken in execution to be kept in prison in close and secure custody. Any indulgence granted by the sheriff to the prisoner, incompatible with his duty, or which may increase the chance or facility of the prisoner\u2019s escape, is, in law, an escape.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Sutton,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Chief Justice <em>Eyre </em>says, the effect of the process of execution is to'operate immediately, by the duress of imprisonment; and that cases might be put, where an officer, who should justify an indulgence, on the ground of the prisoner being always in his presence, the court would say it was an escape: as if the officer should wear the livery of the prisoner, and ride with him to a horserace, and he expressed a strong doubt, whether any distinction could be made between that case, and the laudable and compassionate one of accompanying the prisoner to his own house, for the purpose of obtaining the means of discharging the debt. In the same case, <em>Butter, </em>J. agreed, that in the instance put by the chief justice, of a sheriff\u2019s going with his prisoner to a horserace, it would be an escape; and he saw no distinction between that and one originating from more laudable motives.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQdZ\">It is laid down, that if a gaoler, on a <em>habeas corpus, </em>carry the prisoner round about a great way, for his accommodation, it was an escape.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsY\">There was no evidence of recaption on fresh pursuit.

A much greater relaxation, as to time, in the case of <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>(1 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull </em>24.) was not, merely on that account, considered an escape. There was no error in the charge of the judge; but as to the question of fact, whether there was not a consent on the part of the officer to the prisoner\u2019s escape that evening, the verdict appears to be decidedly against the weight of evidence, and ought to be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">New trial granted on payment of costs,-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
