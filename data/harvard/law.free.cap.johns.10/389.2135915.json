If they have the right, we shall not object to the amount of damages found by the jury. We contend,</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-12\">1. That the plaintiffs had no right to put the gate at the place where it stood, and that it was, therefore, a public nuisance, which the common council of the city of <em>Hudson </em>might order to be removed, and which the defendant himself might lawfully abate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-13\">By the act incorporating the company, the road is allowed to go from <em>Troy to </em>the city of <em>Hudson; </em>and no gate can be erected within <em>three miles </em>of either extremity of the road; now it appears from the limits of the city of <em>Hudson, </em>as defined by the act of its incorporation, that this gate was erected within three miles from its charter limits; and within three miles of the <em>compact parts </em>of the city, as defined by the map, confirmed by the act of 1807. <em>To </em>the city of <em>Hudson </em>must mean either to its boundary line, as defined by the charter, or to the compact parts of the city.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-14\">2. The right of the plaintiffs, if they have any, as well as their remedy, is given by the statute. Their right did not exist at common law.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The only remedy, then, to which the plaintiffs are entitled, is the one given by the statute, which, by the 10th section, is a penalty of 25 dollars, to be recovered in the name <em>Q[ </em>their treasurer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-16\">3. The gate in question intercepted and shut up a road within the corporation limits of the city of <em>Hudson, </em>the free use of which was reserved to the people of the state, by the charter of incorporation, and of which they cannot be deprived, except by an express act of the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-17\">4. The possession of the premises was in fact and of right in <em>Ackley </em>and <em>Miller, </em>to whom they had been pledged by the plaintiffs, and they, not the plaintiffs, were entitled to bring the action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Al4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>E. <em>Williams, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agfa\">insisted that by no just or fair construef10n 0f the act erecting the turnpike, could it be limited to the exterior bounds of the corporation of <em>Hudson; </em>it must be undergf00(] to authorize the plaintiffs to carry the road into the centre of the city. It does not follow that because the road ig to go <em>to </em>the city of <em>Hudson, </em>that it may not go <em>into </em>the city. But if it were otherwise, no individual, after the road had been sanctioned, had a right to pull down the gates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASDW\">No doubt the right and remedy in this case are both created by the statute; but as soon as the corporation was created, it had the same common law right as any individual, to seek a remedy for any invasion of its rights or injury to its property, by an action at common law. The penalty is only another remedy, and does not prevent the plaintiffs, where the penalty does not afford an adequate indemnify, from resorting to an action of trespass at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeK\"><em>In the </em>case of <em>The People </em>v. Pension,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it was decided that a turnpike gate might be so placed as <em>to </em>intercept an old highway, provided it was placed within the limits authorized by the act. And if the gate could not be so placed, it is manifest that the payment of toll might, in many instances, be evaded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-5\">Though the income or toll was pledged to <em>Ackley </em>and <em>Miller, </em>yet the road and the gate must be deemed as still in the possession of the plaintiffs;</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A2K7\"> 5 <em>Johns; Rep. 175. </em>1 Com.

The words are to receive a more reasonable interpretation, in reference to the subject matter, and the public object of the grant; which was to open a good road from <em>Troy </em>to the compact part of the city of Hudson. The words <em>usque ad </em>are sometimes to be taken inclusively, according to the subject matter. (1 <em>Stra. </em>179\u2014181.) Such must have been the universal understanding of the object, and of the words of the grant; and if there could otherwise have been any doubt on this point, it seems to be removed by the 10th section of the act. That section provides that no gate should be erected nearer than three miles from either extremity of the road, and yet allows a tollgate at or near the bridge to be erected over Major <em>Abraham\u2019s </em>creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>it was proved by one who had surveyed the road, that the gate in question stood more than three miles from the head of i1Iain-stre~t, leading down through the compact parts of the city of Hudson~ The gate was therefore lawfully erected~ and the pulling it dawn was a trespass. The old <em>Rensselaer </em>road had nothing to do with the question. The plaintiffs had a right to lay out a road from <em>Kinderhook </em>landing to <em>Hudson, </em>as near the east bank of the river <em>Hudson </em>as the nature of the ground would admit, and it was for the commissioners appointed by the governor to determine whether the road was executed according to the act. And when the road was made and completed according to law, the gates were to be erected; and so far as the gates, or any of them, interfered with travelling on the old <em>Rensselaer </em>road, so far the use of the latter was contracted by the grant to the plaintiffs. This was the opinion of the court in the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Denslow, </em>(1 Caines\u2019 <em>Rep. </em>177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The fact of the trespass was admitted; and the possession of the gate was, in judgment of law, in the plaintiffs, the rightful owners of it, notwithstanding the toll had been mortgaged. The mortgage was of the income, and not of the road. They were entitled to their action of trespass at common law, and the penalty given by ihe statute was only an additional remedy. An action of trespass always lies at common law for an invasion of private property. It was a matter actionable at common law. (2 <em>Inst. </em>199, 200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The plaintiffs are, accordingly, entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
