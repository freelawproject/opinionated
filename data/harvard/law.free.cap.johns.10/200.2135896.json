A <em>venire de novo </em>was awarded, returnable in this court, and the cause was accordingly tried at the last circuit, in <em>Otsego, </em>on the record remaining in this court, the <em>placitum </em>to which was as follows: \u201c Pleas in the court of the common pleas, held at the <em>village of Otsego, </em>in and for the county of <em>Otsego,\u201d Szc.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-13\"><em>N.

That as the statute<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> requires the court to be held at the <em>court-house, See. </em>it ought to have been so mentioned in the <em>placitum. </em>There can be no intendment in favour of the court below.

The record having been brought up by the writ of error, and the judgment below once reversed for a defect, the party cannot now, after a second verdict, allege another defect in that record, in order to arrest the judgment. But he contended that <em>the placitum </em>was sufficient under the statute.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-6\"><em> Laws, </em>vol. 1. p. 397.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> 2 <em>Wils. </em>382, 383. 6 <em>Mod. </em>224. 9 <em>Mod. </em>95. 5 Cranch, 85.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b222-15\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A-0\">This cause came up on a writ of error, from the <em>Otsego </em>common pleas, and this court reversed the judgment below and awarded a <em>venire denovo, </em>returnable in this court, and.upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>record remaining in this court the cause was tried at the Otsego drcuit. The defendant cannot now be allowed to sct up the de'~ fect of form in the placilurn to the record which came fromthe court below. It was not assigned for error upon the writ of error, and the party is now too k~te, after a new trial awarded ai~d had upon that record, to assign a second error in the record, unless it be, at least, an error in substance. The only error now alleged is a defect of form in the <em>placitum, </em>in which the court below is stated to have been held <em>at the village of Otsego, </em>omitting to say at the <em>court-house </em>in the same. Now the court know, from the public acts, that at the date of the <em>placitum, </em>there was no courthouse, <em>in esse, </em>in <em>Otsego </em>county, for the old one was pulled down and sold, and the new one erecting, but not finished. The courts of common pleas, during the interval between the loss of the old and the erection of the new court-house, were ambulatory, so far as that the judges when they met to hold court were authorized to sit in any convenient place fixed by law, and we know the place fixed by law was . in the <em>village of </em>Otsego\u201e By taking the trouble to examine the several statutes relative to that subject, it will appeal* that the <em>placitum </em>for <em>that </em>court of common pleas, and at that term, was sufficient, and the court was not, and could not be, held at the court-house. But the objection itself, independent of any such consideration, is but matter of form, and cured after verdict by the statute of amendments and jeofails, for a trial was awarded and had in this court upon this very record, with such a <em>placitum </em>as a part of it, After a trial here under our own jurisdiction, it would be intolerable to listen to such an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Motion in arrest of judgment denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
