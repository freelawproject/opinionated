Harris,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> as in point, to show <em>that Joshua </em>and <em>Ephraim </em>took only an estate for life.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-11\">Oakley, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2mX\">1. A conveyance may be presumed from the testator to his sons <em>Joshua </em>and <em>Ephraim, </em>about the time he conveyed the farm to his son David. It appears that they occupied Separate parts, erected buildings, and exercised acts of ownership; and the facts fully authorize the presumption of a deed to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-12\">2. But\" we contend that <em>Joshua </em>and <em>Ephraim </em>took an estate in fee under the will. In the construction of wills the intention is always to be carried into effect, if possible; and courts construe the words of the will liberally or strictly, in order to effectuate the intent, which is to be gathered from the whole will.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADIo\">The testator sets out with declaring his intention to dispose of liis whole estate. He devises to his wife, then gives a farm to his son <em>David, </em>and next to his sons <em>Joshua </em>and <em>Ephraim, </em>and gives legacies to his daughters, which Lord Mansfield\u2021 calls disinheriting legacies. The introductory clause, though it aids in the construction, will not, of itself, give a fee; but, taken in connexion with the subsequent devise, it is sufficient to show the intent of the testator to give a fee to <em>Joshua </em>and <em>Ephraim.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-14\">Again, they are to take a fee, because they are to pay legacies chargeable on the real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>the case turned on the meaning of the word <em>estate, </em>which was held to mean both roai and personal, and the court said it was contingent whether the devisee ever would be chargeable with the payment of the legacies. That decision must be taken with certain qualifications, It cannot apply where the legacies or debts are, by the express terms of the will, charged on the realty, only in case the <em>personalty </em>is deficient; nor where the contingency arising from such a general charge on the estate, is rebutted by the facts in the case, showing a deficiency of personal estate.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In <em>Jackson </em>v. Harris, the contingency implied from the word estate was not rebutted by the facts; for it appeared that the personal estate was sufficient, and that the debts and legacies were, in fact, paid out of it. If it is held that the charge is contingent merely because the personal estate is made liable in the first instance, that case cannot be reconciled with the <em>English </em>decisions.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-13\">The fact was proved that the personal estate was greatly deficient ; it was scarcely worth 100 dollars, and there were three legatees, entitled to 20 pounds each.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-14\">The parol evidence was admissible;J and the plaintiff ought not to object to it, for it came out on his own inquiry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-15\">3. Again, <em>Joshua </em>and <em>Ephraim </em>take a fee, because they are directed to pay the <em>debts </em>out of the real estate. The words are, \u201c the debts are to be paid out of my estate that I shall die seised of.\u201d The words <em>\u201c </em>seised of\u201d technically apply to the real estate only, and the testator had no other estate than that devised to hi\u00bb sons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-16\">Again, the devisees took the estate immediately on the death of the testator, subject to the payment of the debts. If so, it was an estate in fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-17\">It may, perhaps, be objected, that the charge is not on the person of the devisee, but only on the estate devised. The distinction is, whether the charge is to be paid out of the whole estat\u00e9 devised, or only out of the profits,- And if out of the whole estate, whether the devisee takes it immediately, subject to the payment of the debts, or after the payment of debts. And the <em>English </em>cases<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark> turn on the words \" after the payme'nt of debts.\u201d We think it clear that the devisees, in the present case, took the estate immediately; and they are to pay the debts out of the estate, no other person being able to do it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Tallmadge, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACQM\">said, that the heir at law was a favourite with courts, and would not he disinherited without clear and ex- , press words.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-4\">The introductory clause here will not carry a fee ;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and the other clause, \u201cthe debts to be paid out of the estate I die seised of,\u201d is to be taken in connexion with the preceding clause, where the testator directs his executors to pay the legacies out of the personal estate. It is merely a direction to the executor. The word <em>seised </em>means nothing more than <em>possessed. </em>If the debts and legacies were to be paid out of the personal estate, or by the executors, then no fee passed.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-5\">Where the charge is general on the estate, it is contingent. The devisee takes a fee only where the charge is on the devisee personally, or where the payment of the debts and legacies is the condition on which he is to take the estate.<footnotemark>||</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-6\">The legacies to the daughters are not to be regarded as disinheriting bequests, or sufficient to bar them as. heirs at law.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AeE\"> 8 <em>Johns, Rep. </em>141.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AKM\"> 3 <em>Wils. </em>142. <em>3 Burr. </em>1541 6 Johns.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aic\">delivered the opinion of the court. The lessors of the plaintiff claim as heirs at law of <em>Joshua Hamlin, </em>deceased, and the only question in the case is, whether his sons, <em>Joshua </em>and <em>Ephraim, </em>under whom the defendants hold, took, by virtue of his will, an estate in fee or for life. The' testator gave to his son <em>David </em>the farm he <em>(David) </em>then lived on, and he gave to his two sons, <em>Joshua </em>and <em>Ephraim, </em>the farm he, the testator, lived on, to be equally divided between them, and adds, \u201c the debts to be paid out of my estate that I shall die seised of.\u201d As there are no apt \u25a0words of limitation, the two. sons took only an estate for life, unless a fee is to be inferred by implication, by reason of the charge of the debts upon the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">The distinction which runs through the cases is, that where the charge is upon the <em>estate, </em>and there arc no words of limitation, the devisee takes only an estate for life; but where the charge is on the <em>person </em>of the devisee, in respect of the estate in his hands, he takes a fee, on the principle that he might otherwise be a loser. <em>(Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Maddern, </em>4 <em>East, </em>496. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Snelling, 5 East, </em>87. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Denn, 2 Bos, &amp; Pull. </em>247. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>5 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>343. <em>Colyer\u2019s Case, </em>6 <em>Co. </em>16.) When the charge is on <em>the person, </em>the devisee takes the estate, on condition of paying the charge, and if he die in the lifetime of the testator, the charge ceases; and if he refuse to accept ayd perform, the devise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>is void, and the heir may enter. In this case, the will merely ereated the charge upon the estate. There was no personal charge upon the devisees, and, consequently, the case is not within the reason of the rule for enlarging the estate into a fee, by reason of a charge. It may admit of some dispute what words will amount to a charge <em>on the person, </em>so as to render the devisee who accepts of the land, personally and at all events, liable for the debt or legacy charged, and the cases on this point are not altogether consistent. In <em>Dickens </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>(Cro. <em>Elis. </em>330.) <em>A. </em>devised all his lands and goods <em>after his debts and legacies paid ; </em>and in <em>Denn </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>(5 <em>Term, Rep. </em>558.) the devise was of all lands and goods, <em>afterpayment of his just debts, \u00bfte. </em>,and it was held, in both cases, that the devisee took only an estate for life; and though the latter decision was reversed in the exchequer-chamber, (3 <em>Anst. 781. 1 Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>558.) it was not upon the point of the nature - and effect of the charge. In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>(8 <em>Term Rep. 497.) </em>the devise was, that <em>after the debts being first paid out of the </em>personal, <em>mid if not sufficient, out of the real estate, </em>he devised, &amp;c. and the devisee was held to take only an estate for life. So in <em>Redoubt </em>v. <em>Redoubt, </em>(8 <em>Vin. 217, </em>pl. 18.) the devise was that 500Z, <em>be paid as soon as may be out of the aforesaid estate and premises ; </em>and in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>(5 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>343.) the words were, <em>I charge all my estate, both real and personal, </em>with the payment of the above legacies, and yet in neither case did the devisee take a fee for want of apt words of inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">These are instances of a charge upon the land and not upon the \u25a0 person. But the following cases may be cited to illustrate the other part of the rule. As in <em>Colyer's Case, </em>(6 <em>Co. </em>16.) the devise was <em>to A. he paying, &amp;c. </em>and in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>(8 <em>Term Rep. </em>1.) the words were, I give my house and furniture to <em>A. she paying, &amp;c. </em>and in <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Maddern, </em>(4 <em>East, </em>496.) the devise was, of all the rest, See. of lands, goods and chattels, &amp;c. to my executrix, &amp;c. <em>so that she pay, &amp;c. </em>and they were all held to be 'charges on the person, so as to carry a fee,, by reason of the charge. There are other cases of this kind, which have been held to carry a fee, though the words were not so strong. Thus in <em>Philips </em>v. <em>Hele, (Rep. in Ch. </em>v. 1. p. 101.) the words were, <em>all the rest of my goods and lands I give to A. to discharge </em>all things charged in my will; and in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>(3 <em>Term Rep. </em>356.) the devise was of all the lands, See. his <em>legacies and funeral expenses being thereout paid ; </em>and in Doe v. <em>Snelling, </em>(5 <em>East, </em>87.) the de\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>vise was of lands and goods, after'having <em>thereout </em>first paid debts and legacies, and in all these cases, the devisee was held to taire a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">It will be in vain, as must appear from this imperfect sketch of a few leading cases, to look for uniformity and harmony of decision in this branch of the law. The opinion of the court of C. B. <em>in Doe </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>(5 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>343.) very justly questions the application of the general principle in the two last cases above referred to, since the charge appeared very evidently to be upon the estate, and not personally upon the devisee. Cases may frequently mislead us, by their misapplication of principle, but it is our duty always to endeavour to recall and adhere to the principle, in opposition to any particular case. The reasoning of Sir <em>James Mansfield </em>is the most plain and logical of any in the modern cases on this point; and the case of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Clarke </em>is the most recent, and, perhaps, the most sound authority, and it is decisive to show that the charge in the present case was upon the land, and not upon the person of the devisees, and that they took only an estate for life. That case, as well as the case of <em>Redoubt </em>v. <em>Redoubt, </em>is in point on another ground, and shows that the devisees here took only for life. <em>Sir J. Mansfield says, there is </em>no case which , has decided that a general charge upon the <em>whole estate, </em>will give a fee to the devisee of only a <em>particular part </em>of that estate. In <em>Redoubt </em>v. <em>Redoubt, </em>and in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>the charge was general, and the devise in question only of a particular part of the estate, and the charge was held not to enlarge the estate to a fee. In the present case, also, the charge is upon the whole estate generally, and not specifically upon the farm devised to the two sons under whom the defendants hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">The case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(8 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>141.) is also in point. The charge there was general, and the devise to <em>Henry Harris </em>of a particular lot. The charge there was also on <em>the </em>estate, and not on the person, and the decision was undoubtedly correct upon the principles above laid down; though perhaps that decision would have rested better upon one or the other of those grounds, (for either is sufficient,) than upon the principle which was there assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">The lessors of the plaintiff are accordingly entitled to recover the proportion stated in the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
