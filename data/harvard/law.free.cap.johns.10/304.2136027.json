J. <em>Munroe </em>stated, that as counsel of <em>Shotwell, </em>he issued a <em>certiorari </em>to remove the proceedings -before the justice into this com-t; that on the 24th <em>April </em>last he called on the iustice, who <em>x </em>J 7 was sick, and who agreed to draw a return to the <em>certiorari, </em>and showed the counsel the record above stated, as a return which he was prepai'ing; and said, that he saw no <em>armed force; </em>that after the said complaint to him against <em>Shotwell, </em>he went to the messuage, &amp;c. and found <em>George Depeyster </em>and others at the place, engaged in removing the goods of <em>Samuel Briggs, </em>who occupied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>-file place, and who was absent; but his family was then in the house; that no force was used to obtain possession; that <em>Briggs </em>returned and said he would not deliver up possession, but used no force, an d the justice ordered him into custody; the justice saw no force, and no fine was imposed on <em>Briggs. </em>The justice consented that the counsel should draw a return according to the truth of the case, and the counsel made a memorandum to the return from the justice, stating that <em>Depeyster </em>and <em>Thompson </em>went to the house, before the justice, and began to remove the effects of <em>Briggs; </em>that <em>Briggs </em>returned and said he would not deliver up possession, , and was ordered into custody; and that this was the force, and none other. The justice died on the 30th <em>April, </em>without making a return.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-3\"><em>Briggs, </em>in his affidavit, stated that in <em>October, </em>1812, he was engaged by <em>Shotmell </em>to take charge of the dwelling-house and farm in question, formerly possessed by <em>B. F. Haskin, </em>and lately purchased by <em>Shotmell </em>at a sheriff\u2019s sale. <em>Briggs </em>and his family took possession of the house and farm, the 30th <em>October, </em>in behalf of <em>Shotmell, </em>who had cattle, &amp;c. on the farm; <em>Briggs </em>and his family remained in quiet possession until the 5th <em>February, </em>when he was expelled. He was arrested on that day, at the suit of <em>Depeyster, </em>for 3,000 dollars in trover, and went several miles to procure bail, (several persons offered having been refused,) and while he was gone, the ouster as above stated took place. On his return they were putting his furniture into the street, which he forbade, and the justice ordered <em>Depeyster </em>to take him into custody, <em>Briggs </em>delivered the keys of the house to the justice, arid <em>Depeyster </em>put <em>Briggs </em>into the street, who refused to hold the premises, as he was requested, under <em>Clason. Depeyster </em>and <em>Thompson </em>declared that they took possession for <em>Clason; </em>and one <em>Thomas Woods </em>was put into the house to keep possession for him. The justice, afterwards, told <em>Briggs </em>that the proceedings were illegal. No jury, sheriff, or'other officer was present. And <em>Briggs </em>denied that he ever held the place by force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\"><em>Shotmell </em>stated that he purchased the premises, at the sheriff\u2019s sale, on the 12lh <em>October, </em>1812, as the property of <em>Haskin. </em>That <em>George Depeyster </em>was the tenant of <em>Haskin; </em>that on the execution of the deed from the sheriff, <em>Depeyster </em>voluntarily gave up possession, and agreed, in writing, afterwards, to stay for one day, as tenant to <em>Shotmell. Depeyster moved </em>away on the 18th October, and on the 30th <em>October Briggs </em>was put in possession by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Shotwell, </em>and remained until turned out, on the 5th <em>February; </em>an\u00bf that the forcible possession then taken, was for <em>Isaac Clason, </em>who still remains in possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABZV\">Qn the 15th <em>May, </em>when the motion came on to be argued, numerous affidavits were offered against the motion; and it was agreed, by the counsel on both sides, that all the affidavits, for and against the motion, should be submitted to the court with the authorities and remarks of the counsel, in order that the court might have time to examine and decide thereon, at the next term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Am47\">Of the mass of facts contained in the affidavits, it is necessary, in reference to the opinion of the court, to add only the following : <em>Depeyster </em>deposed, that about the 15th <em>October, </em>1812, <em>Shotwell, </em>accompanied by another person, came to the house of <em>Depeyster, </em>at <em>Yonkers, </em>and stated that <em>Shotwell </em>had purchased the premises at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and asked <em>Depeyster </em>if he would immediately and peaceably leave them, to which <em>Depeyster </em>replied, that he would not leave them, until compelled by force, or due . course of law. <em>Shotwell </em>then declared his intention to turn him . out by force, and immediately took <em>Depeyster </em>by the shoulder and dragged him into the street; and that in that situation, on aqcount of his family, he entreated <em>Shotwell </em>to permit him to stay that night, which <em>Shotwell </em>consented to, only on condition that he would leave the premises peaceably the next day, and sign a paper to the effect, drawn up by <em>Shotwell, </em>which he signed, and left the premises the following day, See. That he apprehended personal violence from <em>Shotwell, </em>unless he left the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-9\">The affidavits of <em>Thomas Wood, </em>who assisted <em>Depeyster, </em>and of <em>Caleb Stacy, </em>who was tenant to <em>Clason, </em>stated that <em>Depeyster </em>and <em>Wood </em>went to the premises on the 5th <em>February </em>last, about one o\u2019clock P. M. there being only two female^ then in the house, and after explaining the object of their coming, they proceeded to remove the furniture into the street, and that most of it was removed before the justice came, which was two hours after. <em>Briggs </em>and his wife returned home about an hour after the justice came. The conduct of the justice was variously stated in the affidavits. <em>Stacy </em>said the justice was a silent spectator, and gave no direction. <em>Wood </em>stated that the justice advised , the parties how to proceed, and that there was an amicable conversation between them, and that <em>Briggs, </em>on being asked by the justice if he meant to leave the premises peaceably, said he \u201c did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>aot wish to fly in the face of the lawthat the justice requested the persons present, in the name of the people, to remove <em>Briggs </em>off the premises; that <em>Depeyster </em>took him by the arm, and they went laughing, together, into the street, and returned again, and the justice told <em>Depeyster </em>that he ought to give the keys to <em>Briggs </em>again, and take him by the arm and walk into the street, which was done, when <em>Briggs </em>voluntarily redelivered the keys to <em>Depeyster. Stacy </em>deposed that he occupied the farm-house, &amp;c. for near thirteen months, under <em>Clason, </em>pursuant to a written agreement or lease; that he took possession about the 12th <em>March, </em>1812, and has since resided there within a few yards of the house in which <em>Briggs </em>lived, and from which he was removed, both houses being on the same farm, and within the same yard; that he used the same pump, barn, &amp;c. with <em>Briggs, </em>and took care of the stock, and directed the labour and work done on the farm, pursuant to his agreement with <em>Clason.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-4\"><em>Haskin </em>stated that he had no title or interest in the premises, but that they belonged to <em>Clason, </em>who paid him a good and valuable consideration; but that at no time had he, <em>Haskin, </em>the fee-simple of the premises in dispute, but merely a temporary interest therein.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-5\"><em>Slosson </em>and <em>Wells, </em>in support of the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO5\">1.

Thompson, </em>show cause why the said <em>Gilbert Shotwell </em>and <em>Samuel Briggs, </em>or either ef them, should not be restored to the possession of a house and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>farm in <em>Yonkers, </em>in <em>Westchester </em>county, from which they or one 0f them was expelled on the 5th of last February.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ-N\">The motion is grounded upon affidavits, and several affidavits have also been produced in opposition to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Without going into the facts at large, as detailed in the affidavits, it is sufficient to state that <em>Briggs </em>was ousted by order of a justice, on the complaint of <em>George Depeyster </em>of a forcible entry and detainer. That a <em>certiorari </em>issued to the justice to return the proceedings, and that he died before a return was made. It is then a matter of necessity that the court should decide the case upon affidavits; and it appears from the books that proceedings under the statutes of forcible entry and detainer, have frequently been quashed in the K. B. for irregularity, and restitution of the party aggrieved awarded, and that too upon motion and affidavits. <em>(King </em>v. <em>Stacy, </em>1 <em>Sid. </em>287. <em>King </em>v. <em>Bengough, </em>3 <em>Salk. </em>170. <em>King </em>v. <em>Challenors, </em>1 <em>Sid. </em>156. <em>King </em>v. <em>Layton, </em>2 <em>Salk. </em>450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The proceeding of the justice was clearly irregular and void, in permitting restitution, upon his own view, without an inquisition by jury. When the justice acts upon his own view only, he can punish the party guilty of the force, by fine and imprisonment} but he cannot meddle with the possession without the intervention of a jury. This is the plain meaning of the second and third sections of our statute on this subject, when taken and compared together; <em>(Laws, </em>sess. 11. c. 6. p. 102, 103.) and the <em>English </em>decisions on the statutes, of which ours is a copy, are expressly and decidedly to this effect. <em>(King </em>v. <em>Challenors, </em>1 <em>Sid. </em>156. 1 <em>Vent. </em>308. 12 <em>Mod. </em>495. <em>Anon. </em>12 <em>Mod. </em>516. <em>King </em>v. <em>Brown.) </em>As far as we can collect from the imperfect notes of the proceeding, as made by the justice, and from the affidavits which go to supply their deficiency, no proceeding could have been more irregular and unwarranted. There was not even a fine imposed upon the party, and which alone has been deemed a fatal omission. <em>(King </em>v. <em>Elwell, Str. </em>794.) Nor, in fact, did there exist any thing like a forcible detainer, within the meaning of the law. The proceeding was lawless and violent. In quashing the proceeding, restitution is a matter of course. It is demanded in this case under the exercise of a sound discretion. We cannot investigate the title, upon affidavits. The only inquiry is as to the force, and the regularity and equity of the proceeding. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>1 <em>Caines' Rep. </em>125. <em>The People </em>v. <em>King, </em>2 Caines\u2019 <em>Rep. </em>98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u2022 Borne of the affidavits in opposition to the motion seem to conhder the ouster of <em>Briggs </em>and his family as done by private authority, and not by the sanction of the justice. But as the justice attended on the complaint of the party principally concerned in effecting the ouster, and considered himself as acting under the? authority of the statute, and the parties were sheltering themselves at the same time under his sanction, they cannot now be heard.to say it was an act of private trespass, aiid to be redressed by private action. The act was done under the colour of the authority of the magistrate, and the honour of the law is concerned in affording the injured party the prompt and effectual redress which the lav/ has provided for such cases, under the superintending authority of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">We are, therefore, of opinion that the motion be granted, and a writ of re-restitution awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b333-5\">Spencer, J. (dissenting.)</author>\n<p id=\"AE06\">We are applied to for a writ of re-restitution, to put the applicant in possession of a house, <em>Sec. </em>whereof <em>Samuel Briggs </em>was dispossessed on the 5th of <em>February </em>last.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">It appears that a <em>certiorari </em>has been issued to jEJ. <em>Williams, </em>a justice of the peace <em>o\u00ed Westchester </em>county, and that he died in <em>April </em>last, without having made any return. It appears also, that the justice delivered to Mr. <em>Munro </em>a paper to aid him in drawing up a return, which was intended for, and purports to be, a conviction of <em>Briggs </em>of a forcible detainer, but it sets no fine upon him, nor does it show that the justice ordered the possession of the house, See. to be delivered up; but from a memorandum made by Mr. <em>Munro, </em>on the paper, in the handwriting of the justice, and from his admissions to him, it appears, that on <em>Briggs\u2019s </em>refusal to deliver up possession, he was ordered into custody ; and Mr. <em>Munro </em>states that the justice informed him, that when the goods of <em>Briggs </em>had been removed from the premises,1 the justice then ordered him to be enlarged.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>(1 <em>Caines\u2019 Rep. </em>129.) this court recognised the decision in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Beebee and others, </em>that if the indictment be bad, re-restitution must follow <em>o\u00ed </em>course; and in the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>King, </em>(2 <em>Caines\u2019 Rep. </em>99.) the same principle was adopted. In the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>the <em>Chief Justice </em>observed, that \u201c from the general discretionary power this court has in these cases, they may set a restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>aside and award a re-restitution, whenever it shall appear that restitution hath been illegally awarded, either for insufficiency, or defect in the indictment, or other cause.\u201d Now, from the paper \u00bf\u00a1ejrverecL by the justice to Mr. <em>Munro, </em>or from any instructions given by the justice to him to prepare the return, we cannot presume that the justice ordered restitution; and admitting that the\u2019 conviction, if it be considered such, be quashed, a re-restitution would not be the consequence; the paper purports merely the conviction of <em>Briggs </em>of a forcible detainer; it neither sets a fine nor awards restitution. The complainant, then, has not been devested of his possession by any judicial proceeding of the magistrate. <em>Hawkins </em>(b. 1. c. 64. s. 65.) lays down the law with accuracy, and the cases he refers to bear him out, that \u201c neither can a defendant, in any case whatsoever, <em>ex rigore juris, </em>demand a restitution, either upon quashing the indictment, or a verdict for him on a traverse thereof, <em>See. </em>for a power of granting a restitution is vested in the K. B. only by an equitable construction of the general words of the statutes, and is not expressly given by those statutes, and is never made use of by that court, but when, upon consideration of the whole circumstances of the case, the defendant shall appear to have some right to the tenements, the possession whereof he lost by the restitution granted to the prosecutor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The complainant, <em>Shotwell, </em>obtained possession of the house, &amp;c. occupied by <em>George Depeyster, </em>in \u2022 <em>October </em>last, according to <em>Depeyster\u2019s </em>affidavit, by force, and according to his own, by fraud, provided <em>Depeyster </em>was <em>Isaac Clason\u2019s </em>tenant. <em>Shot-well\u2019s </em>right to claim the premises was derived from a sale of them under a judgment against <em>B. F. Haskin. Haskin </em>swears that he never had the fee of the farm in him, and that he had but a short and temporary interest therein, and that <em>Clason, </em>on the 6th of <em>February </em>last, and for several months previous, as he believed, had a good title to the same, <em>Clason </em>swears that he claims the fee of the farm, having purchased and paid therefor a full consideration; that <em>G. Depeyster </em>and <em>C. Stacy </em>were his tenants under <em>written leases, </em>and had been several months in quiet possession thereof, until about the 1 fth of <em>October </em>last, when <em>G. Shotwell </em>entered thereon, without his knowledge or consent; that <em>Stacy, </em>the co-occupant, remained in possession, as his tenant. <em>Caleb Stacy </em>swears he has occupied the farm, house and premises under <em>Isaac Clason </em>for better than 13 months past, accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>itig to written agreements; that he went on in <em>March, </em>1812, and has ever since resided in a house on the said farm, within a few yards of the house in which <em>Briggs </em>resided, both of which houses are in the same yard; and that he used, in common with Depey<em>ster, </em>before his expulsion, the same garden, pump, barn, cattle, and farming utensils, and that he took care of the stock of the premises, and that the principal work and labour xvas under his directions. <em>Lavinia Stacy </em>and <em>Silvanas Stacy </em>confirm all the facts stated by <em>Caleb Stacy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">With respect to the conduct of Justice <em>Williams, </em>on the 5th of <em>February, </em>there is great discordance in the affidavits for and against the motion. I think the weight of evidence is, that the justice illegally and unwarrantably lent his aid in inducing <em>Briggs </em>to surrender up the possession. But I am of opinion, that in the exercise of a sound and just discretion, we ought not to grant a re-restitution. The complainant himself, having originally become possessed by force or collusion with <em>Depeysler, Clason\u2019s </em>tenant, comes with an ill grace to ask a restoration; it is impossible. to say, were we inclined to interfere, how far, and to what he ought to be restored. I think, that inasmuch as the justice never judicially awarded a writ of possession, nor pretended expressly to restore <em>Depeysler </em>to his possession, that we have no right to grant a restitution; and if we had, this case is presented with such accompanying circumstances, as not to call forth the exercise of \u25a0the discretionary poxver with which we are armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Proceedings quashed an.d a xvrit of re-restitution awarded;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
