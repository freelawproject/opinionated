The oapias ad respondendum </em>was served only on <em>Jones </em>and <em>Kearney, </em>two of the defendants, and was returned <em>non est inventus, </em>as to the \u2019 _ other. The plaintiff declared against the two that were arrested, and the other defendant as returned not found. <em>Jerome </em>never appeared or pleaded. The cause was tried at the <em>Onondaga </em>circuit, in 1812, before Mr. Justice <em>Spencer. </em>It was proved that Je<em>tome </em>was jointly concerned in the trespass. The defendants J <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>offered <em>Jerome </em>as a witness, but he was objected to as incomp\u00a9tent, and rejected by the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Av\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, against the other two defendants, for 20 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-5\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict and for a new trial; and it was agreed that if the court should be of opinion that <em>Jerome </em>was a competent witness, the verdict should be set aside, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event of the suit; otherwise, the verdict was to stand.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-13\"><em>Birdsey </em>and <em>Gold, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0C\">contended that <em>Jerome </em>was a. competent witness. It being an action of trespass, he could not be called upon by the other defendants to contribute to the amount of damages which might be recovered. He was not, therefore, interested in the event of the cause. His being a joint trespasser did not render <em>him </em>incompetent.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And though made a nominal defendant, yet never having been arrested, he was not a party in the cause, and could not be affected by the verdict.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark>The rule laid down by <em>Buller</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is not now the law. The rule since established, by various decisions of the <em>English </em>courts, as well as in our own, is, that a person not having an interest in the event of the cause, may be a witness; all other objections go to his <em>credit </em>and not to his competency.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-14\">N. <em>Williams, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR4\">insisted that it was an established and well settled rule, that no party, or co-defendant, or co-trespasser, could be a witness in the cause.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark> On an indictment against joint trespassers, one of them cannot be admitted as a witness until he has been acquitted. Though not interested, as it regards the damages to be recovered, yet being a joint trespasser, <em>Jerome </em>must be considered as <em>particeps criminis.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\"> 8 <em>Johns.
