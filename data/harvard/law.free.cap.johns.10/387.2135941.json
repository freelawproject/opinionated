The cause was tried at the <em>Columbia </em>circuit, in <em>October, </em>1812, before Mr. Justice <em>Van Ness.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9j\">The plaintiff produced m evidence a receipt by the defendant 1 . , as tollows: Received ot <em>Daniel uunn </em>an article of agreement between <em>Barent Stryker </em>and <em>Alexander Boyd, </em>dated the 20th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>December, </em>1802, assigned to <em>Stephen Simmons, </em>to collect the money therein contained.\u201d Signed \u201c <em>Moses I. </em>Cantine.\u201d The defendant admitted that he collected, on the agreement specified m the receipt, in <em>August, </em>1810, the sum of 310 dollars. The defendant then moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that the suit ought to have been brought in the name of <em>Stephen Simmons; </em>but the judge overruled the motion. The defendant then proved that the plaintiff had said, in regard to the money collected on the agreement, that he acted as the agent of <em>Simmons, </em>and that the money belonged to <em>Simmons, </em>and that it was to be collected for hi* benefit. The defendant then offered to set off two promissory notes against <em>Simmons, </em>but the plaintiff objected to the set-off, on the <em>ground that </em>notice of it had not been given with the plea; and the judge rejected the set-off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-4\">The plaintiff then read in evidence a power of attorney from <em>Stephen Simmons </em>to him, constituting him, for divers good causes and considerations, his attorney, for him, <em>(Simmons,) </em>and <em>in his name, anci to his use, </em>to ask and demand, sue for, recover and receive of all and every person or persons all sums of money, debts, duties and demands whatsoever, which were due and owing or thereafter to become due and owing, to him the said <em>Stephen Sim</em>mons,\u201d <em>8rc. </em>being a general letter of attorney, in the common form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court on a case containing the facts above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AI-\"><em>Adams, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFHq\">contended that from the manifest intent of the parties, appearing from the receipt given by the defendant to the plaintiff, the contract was between the plaintiff and defendant, and the defendant was responsible to the plaintiff. Where a person has a beneficial interest, or possession coupled with an interest, he may bring a suit in his own name; and Lord <em>Loughborough </em>said, in the case of <em>Williams </em>v. Millington,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that it was not true that two persons could not bring separate actions for the same cause 5 f\u00b0r that a factor and owner might each have actions on a contract,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A8Y\">Van <em>Buren, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN8Z\">insisted that there was nothing in the terms of the receipt, which showed that the plaintiff was entitled to the money to be collected on the agreement, or had any beneficial inierest in it; on the contrary, it is stated to have been assigned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>\u25a0Simmons, </em>who must, therefore, have the interest. The power of attorney gives an authority to the plaintiff to collect money only In the name and to the use of Simmons. An attorney can do no act in his own name.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\"> l <em>H.

He was a mere attorney employed by <em>Simmons </em>to collect this debt; and there was no express promise by the defendant to pay the money collected to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The letter of attorney was revocable at pleasure; and the law will not raise any <em>assumpsit </em>to the plaintiff from the facts in this case. This is, by no means, so strong a case as that of <em>Pigott </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>(3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. 147.) </em>and yet in that case the agent was not permitted to sue in his own name. The defendant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Judgment for the defendant</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
