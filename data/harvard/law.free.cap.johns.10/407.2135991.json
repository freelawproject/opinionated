True, it is said in some of the books, that the husband may alone make a lease, or bring ejectment; and that the wiie may or may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Joined, in order to try the title to her lands ;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but regularly, the wife ought to be joined,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Under our laws a <em>feme, covert </em>may alienate her lands for her own support; but if the defence now set up is to prevail, she would be wholly prevented from exercising this right over her estate; and so far, at least, will her right be prejudiced.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-8\"><em>Cady, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajs\">The counsel for the plaintiff has argued as if 1 _ <em>\u201e </em>the <em>jeme coven </em>was the principal person interested m the action; but she is not a necessary party to the suit, and it is the right of the baron, or husband, which is tried. It is true, there is some old rule to be found requiring the wife to be joined; but that, like many other rules of law, has been changed. The husband may lease Ms wife\u2019s land, and is, therefore, competent to demise so as to bring an ejectment. If the name of the wife, then, is struck out as unnecessary, all the difficulty suggested is removed. The words of the 3d section of the act are general. It declares that the award of the commissioners shall, after two years from the making thereof, be \u201c binding and conclusive against all persons, except such as, conceiving themselves aggrieved, shall within two years file their <em>dissent, </em>and give notice thereof,\u201d See.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-23\">This is an attempt to bring the <em>husband, </em>who has an absolute control of the land during life, within the <em>proviso. </em>The wife, during the <em>coverture, </em>has no rights which can be prejudiced. They are suspended. It is said that a <em>feme covert </em>may assert her right during coverture, from analogy to. the case of an infant, who, it is said, may bring his action before he comes of age. But there is no analogy in the two cases. Her estate belongs to the husband during life or coverture, not to the wife, who has no estate during the life of her husband. But in the case of infants and persons <em>non compos, </em>they have their estates during infancy and insanity, and may prosecute by their guardians.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-24\">There are cases in which it is said, that the husband has not only an absolute control over the wife\u2019s estate, and may alienate it during his life ; but that the wife may, byhis acts, absolutely lose her estate. As if a <em>feme </em>copyholder marries, and the husband does not pay the rent, or commits waste, it is a forfeiture of the estate which will bind the wife after his death. <footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> And in some cases the <em>laches </em>of the husband may disinherit the wife forever. <footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-25\">It cannot be said that the wife, during the coverture, is prejudiced. -</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AEe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>Gold, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH7\">observed, that considering the tribunal erected by the statute to decide on these disputed titles, it was fortunate that the <em>proviso </em>was inserted; and it ought to be liberally construed. But on the construction contended for by the defendant\u2019s counsel, an estate of inheritance of a <em>feme covert </em>would be changed from a fee-simp!e\u2122 to a conditional fee; or be made to depend on the contingency of her surviving her husband, there being no <em>heirs </em>mentioned in the proviso. <em>Nemo est hceres viventis; </em>and if she dies before her husband, no person could claim it, as no <em>dissent </em>had been entered by the husband, or by any person in her behalf. Persons in reversion and remainder, however remote, are bound. If, then, her estate in fee, subject to the life estate of her husband, can be lost, by his neglect, on the contingency of her dying first, she must be considered as prejudiced. But she has, he contended, not only until her <em>discoverture </em>to assert her rights, but her rights shall not, under the provision of the statute, be prejudiced in the mean time.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-9\"> 2 <em>Saund. 121. b. n.

Thus it was decided in <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Villette, (2 Saund. </em>120.) that if an infant brought an action of <em>assumpsit </em>during his infancy, but after six years from the time the cause of action arose, and the defendant pleaded the statute of limitations, it would be a good replication, that when the cause of action arose, and when the suit was brought, the plaintiff was, and still is, an infant. The plaintiff may sue at any time within age, although the six years are elapsed. Upon the principle of that decision, the limitation in the# act relative to the <em>military bounty lands, </em>as to the time of bringing the action, cannot be set up against such of the lessors of the plaintiff as ar <em>e femes coverts, </em>and were such when the award was made; their reply would be the same as in the other case, that they were, and still are,/ernes <em>coverts; </em>and the statute provides (sess. 20 c. 51.) \u201c that nothing in the act contained, should extend or be construed to the prejudice of any person \u2022 under the age of twenty-one years, or <em>feme covert, See. </em>; if such person shall, within three years after coming to the age of twenty-one years, becoming <em>discovert, Sec. </em>make their dissent, and bring . their suit, and <em>prosecute </em>the same to effect as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>But the difficulty in the way of the recovery is, that here no <em>dissent </em>has been filed, either by the <em>femes coverts </em>or by their husbands.</p>\n<p id=\"AC6\">The filing of the dissent, within the period of limitation, seems to be requisite, by the act, to entitle the party to recover. It was so understood by the court, in the case of <em>Jackson, </em>ex dem. <em>Cornelius, </em>v. <em>M\u2018Kee. </em>(8 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>429.) The party against whom the award was made, was, by the terms of the act, to file his dissent and bring his suit within the period prescribed. The filing of the dissent is a condition precedent to the right of recovery. It was a necessary act, because the statute required it; and if a <em>feme covert </em>will bring the ejectment during her disability, she must comply with the condition upon which the action was granted; she must previously put her dissent upon record. This she may still do and recommence her suit. The plaintiff ought, therefore, to have been nonsuited at the trial, and the award was not, in any other sense, a bar to the action. The omission of the husband to file a dissent within the two years, was not a default affecting the wife, so as to bar her right of action, either during the coverture or subsequent to it. The default of the husband cannot work any prejudice to the wife\u2019s interest 5 for the act declares, that nothing in it should be construed to the prejudice of persons under disability. But upon the case as stated, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and the wife is necessarily turned round to a new action; and to entitle her to sustain it, she must, either by herself, or by her husband in her name and behalf, previously cause her dissent to the award to be duly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The motion on the part of the plaintiff to set aside the verdict is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
