The patent having issued, for a good consideration, it vested a title in the patentee named, which cannot be defeated by any evidence extrinsic, or <em>dehors </em>the patent. The ballot-book was not required, or authorized by any statute; and the minute in that book cannot be allowed to defeat or alter the patent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-9\">But admitting the evidence of the ballot-book, he contended, that there being a mistake in the Christian name, it vitiated the patent; and as nothing passed to <em>Daniel Hungerford, </em>it must enure to <em>David Hungerford, </em>who was entitled to bounty land.* And before any claim was made by the heirs of <em>Daniel Hunger-ford, </em>an actual settlement was made on the land in right of the daughter and heir of <em>David Hungerford, </em>and the defendant is to be considered as a purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-10\">Again, was it competent to the legislature to devest the interest of <em>David Hungerford ? </em>In <em>England </em>there are certain prescribed rules of proceeding in obtaining a private act of parliament, intended <em>io </em>guard against surprise, or mistake, which are not observed <em>here.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The act, in <em>the </em>present case, was more of a <em>judicial </em>than a Iegislative act.

Lord <em>Coke </em>is of \u00b0P\u2122on that a grant may be good, though there is a mistake in the Christian name. If, then, the evidence is admissible to show the person intended, and who is to take, there is an end to the controversy between the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-7\">As to compensation for the improvements made on the land, . the statute applies only to real and <em>bona fide </em>purchasers who may be supposed to be ignorant of the original source of the title.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azy4\">delivered the opinion of the court. The patent which issued in the name of <em>David Hungerford </em>was undoubtedly intended for the soldier, by the name of <em>Hungerford, </em>(then dead,) who belonged to <em>M\u2018Kean,s </em>company, in the first <em>Nerv-York </em>regiment. This intention is manifest from the balloting-bodk in the secretary\u2019s office, and from the premises, being a military lot and part of the lands set apart by law for the two regiments belonging to this state, and from the further fact that by the provision in the act of the 6th of <em>April, </em>1790, the lots were to be balloted for, and the patents to issue in pursuance thereof, and in the name of the original soldier. If <em>Daniel Hungerford </em>was the soldier who belonged to that company and regiment, and no person of the. name of <em>David Hungerford </em>was a soldier in that regiment, there must have been a misnomer in the Christian name of the patentee. I think the evidence taken at the trial establishes the mistake; and the question is, whether that evidence was admissible, and if so, what is the legal effect of it? Here is no ambiguity on the face of the patent, but it is a latent ambiguity, and, according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>to the </em>general rule, the parties may go into extrinsic evidence t\u00f3 ascertain the grantee, and clear up the mistake in the soldier\u2019s name. Parol evidence has been admitted, in the case of a will, to ascertain the person, when two were of the same name, or when there had been a mistake of the Christian name of the devisee. <em>(Cheyney\u2019s Case, 5 Co. </em>68. <em>Ulrich </em>v. Litchfield, 2 <em>Atk. </em>373. <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>1 Ves. jun. 266. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>6 <em>Term Rep. </em>671.) But with respect to deeds and grants, the old general rale seems to have been; that an omission, or mistake, of the Christian name of the grantee rendered the grant void. This was the opinion of the judges in the case of <em>Humble </em>v. <em>Glover; (Cro. Eliz, </em>328.) and it is stated by Lord <em>Baton, (Maxims$ </em>107.) that if one grant land to <em>I. $., </em>son and heir of <em>G, S., </em>and it be true that he is son and heir of <em>G. S, </em>but his name is Thomas\u00bf it is a void grant. Lord <em>Coke, </em>however, holds <em>(Co. Litt. </em>3. a.) that a grant may sometimes be good, though the grantee\u2019s name of baptism be mistaken. Thus, if lands be given to <em>Robert, </em>Earl of <em>Pembroke, </em>when his name is <em>Henry, </em>or to <em>George, </em>Bishop of <em>Norwich, </em>when his name is <em>John, </em>the grant is still good, because there can be but one of that name arid dignity. If, then, the patent in this case had designated the <em>Hungerford </em>intended, by specifying the regiment and company to which he belonged, at the lime of his death, it might have been good, as being equally susceptible of being reduced to certainty. But the patent adds no description, or demonstration to the name of the patentee. It is simply a patent of the lot to <em>David Hungerford ; </em>and according to the rule which has been mentioned, the heirs of <em>Daniel Hungerford </em>cannot take under that patent, because their ancestor is hot the patentee named. In all the cases which I have seen, where there was a misnomer, there was some description connected with the \u00f1am\u00e9; arid thefe was no other person who set up a title in competition, under the erroneous name; but here the defendant claims under one <em>David Hungerford, </em>and contends that he was the grantee, and a soldier in the line of this state, though the proof of the fact is extremely weak, and nti proof was offered that he was a soldier in <em>McKean\u2019s </em>company, in the first regiment, or that he belonged to either of the two regiments of infantry for the use of whom the military bounty lands were appropriated. The verdict is to be considered as establishing the fact that <em>Daniel </em>was the soldier who served, and must have been the sob dier intended,</p>\n<p id=\"Aqm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The grant, then, is either void by reason of the misnomer, of the parol proof supplies and corrects the mistake in the Christian of the soldier intended, and, in either case, the lessors of the plaintiff are entitled to recover. We do not go upon the ground that the act of the legislature could devest a right legally acquired under the patent. It could not. But the patent gave no title to the person under whom the defendant holds, because he was not the patentee. The ancestor of the lessors of the plaintiff is shown by the proof, and found by the verdict, to be the patentee intended; and if the mistake in his Christian name rendered the patent void, the title to the lot remained in the state until the act of the legislature, which is to be considered in the light of a legislative grant, and supplying the place of a patent in tiie ordinary form. The competency of the legislature to alienate their lands, by statute, is not to be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">2. The defendant does not come within the act of the 5th of <em>April, </em>1803, sess. 26. c. 88. entitling, in certain cases, the tenant in possession of the military lands to payment for his improvements. The defendant is a lessee under <em>Stanley, </em>who entered upon the lot claiming it in right of his wife, who was the heir of one <em>David Hungerford,. </em>Here was no entry and settlement under colour of purchase, but under colour of title by descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The motion for a new trial is accordingly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
