Because the rejoinder puts in issue, or attempts pU\u00a3 jjj issue} two separate, distinct and independent facts; 2. That the rejoinder is not issuable, &amp;c. The defendants joined in the demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-9\">G. W. <em>Strong </em>and <em>Wells, </em>in support of the demurrer,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUe\">contend\u00eded, that independent of the special causes of demurrer, the rejoinder was bad in substance, as the facts stated in it furnished no legal excuse, within the true intent and meaning of the condition of the bond. The condition of the bond is coextensive with the subject matter.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The plaintiffs might be as much injured by the mistakes of the clerk, as by his dishonesty or fraud. The object of the bond was to guard the plaintiffs against every .loss which might arise to them from the clerk, whether produced by his mistakes, dishonesty, or otherwise. The instrument is to be construed according to the true intent and meaning of the parties, which ought not to be defeated by a strict adherence to the exact words. <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac4\">But another excuse alleged is, that the plaintiffs gave time to the clerk; but this would not exonerate the sureties, unless the default of the clerk had been purposely concealed from them.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHO\">Again, the rejoinder is bad, as it puts in issue a part only of the deficiency stated in the replication. <footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> It is a departure from the plea of <em>non damnificatus, </em>for it admits a deficiency of 500 dollars.<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark> Again, it is bad for its duplicity, as there are distinct fact\u00bb Stated, requiring three distinct answers ; and the rejoinder is not <em>issuable, </em>for whether the deficiency arose from the mistake or dishonesty of .the clerk, can only be known from his intentions, and intention is not traversable.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-10\"><em>Anthon </em>and <em>Hoffman, </em>contra, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGU\">that the sureties could be made liable only for the dishonesty or corruption of the clerk. The instrument is to be construed according to the true meaning of the words, and is not to be extended beyond their just and obvious import. The <em>replication </em>is bad in assigning as a breach the not accounting and paying over the moneys received, when that might without any want of fidelity or honesty on the part of the clerk.<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020</footnotemark> It was taken, probably, from one of the forms used in the cases of <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>(8 <em>Term Rep. </em>459.) <em>Shum </em>v. <em>Farrington, </em>(1 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>460.) or 2 <em>Chitty\u2019s Pleading, </em>633, in which cases the conditions of the bonds were, to account for and pay over all moneys\u00bb ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The defendants did not undertake for the intellectual capacity of the clerk, but only for his moral honesty.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-4\">If the replication is good, so is the rejoinder.

The bond was, that he should <em>well and\u25a0 faithfully </em>perform his duties as first teller; and this evidently applied to his honesty, and not to his ability in his trust. A mere mistake in overpayment of a check can never be alleged as a breach of trust, for the.mistake may happen to a teller of the purest morals and the best capacity for business.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Judgment for the defendant, with leave, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
