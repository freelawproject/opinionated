The defendant, after praying <em>oyer </em>of the lease, pleaded <em>non estfactum, </em>as of <em>May </em>term, 1811. Continuances were entered on the roll, until <em>August </em>term, 1812, with an award of a <em>venire, </em>returnable, at the <em>Clinton </em>circuit, on the 29th of <em>June, </em>1812. The cause being called, and jury sworn, the following plea, <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>was put in by the defendant, and set forth in the <em>postea; </em>\u201cAnd the said <em>David Chapman, </em>by his attorney aforesaid, comes and saith that the said <em>Robert Adair Bell </em>ought not further to have or maintain his aforesaid action against the said <em>D. C., </em>because he saith that the said <em>R. A. B. </em>is an alien, bom in foreign parts, to wit, in Ireland, out of the allegiance of the state of <em>I\\ew~ York, </em>or of the <em>United States </em>of <em>America, </em>and within the aliogiance of a foreign sovereign, to wit, the King of <em>Great Britain </em>and <em>Ireland, </em>and that the said <em>R. A. B. </em>before and at the time of exhibiting his bill in this behalf, was, and now is, inhabiting and commorant in <em>Ireland, </em>under the government of the united kingdom of <em>Great Britain </em>and <em>Ireland </em>and their dependencies, and \\ e <em>7 </em>that after <em>the time </em>when the said instrument m writing, in the said declaration mentioned is supposed to have been made and delivered, and before the last continuance of the plea aforesaid, that is to say, after the first <em>Monday </em>of <em>May </em>last, from which day until the first <em>Monday </em>of <em>August </em>next, in the term of <em>August, </em>unless the justices, &amp;c. some or one of them, at a circuit court, to be held at the court-house, in the town of <em>Plattsburgh, </em>in and for the county of <em>Clinton, </em>should first come, on <em>Monday </em>the 29th of <em>June, </em>in the year 1812, the said action is continued, to wit, on the eighteenth day of <em>June </em>aforesaid, a public war has <em>been </em>commenced, and is now carried on between the king and government of the united kingdom of <em>Great Britain </em>and <em>Ireland </em>and their dependencies, and <em>the government of the United States </em>of <em>America; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>and that the said <em>R. A. B. </em>is an enemy of the said government of the <em>United States </em>of <em>America, </em>and adhering to the enemies thereof, at <em>Ireland </em>aforesaid, to wit, at the town of <em>Peru, </em>in the county \u00b0f <em>Clinton </em>aforesaid, and this the said <em>D. C. </em>is ready to verify: wherefore he prays judgment, if the said <em>R. A. B. </em>ought further to have or maintain his aforesaid action thereof against him,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cAnd hereupon the jurors, &amp;c. are altogether discharged from giving any verdict,\u201d &amp;c. 1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVQ\">To this plea the plaintiff <em>demurred, </em>and the defendant joined in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-6\"><em>Crary, </em>in support of the demurrer,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0nq\">cited 2 <em>Chitt.

There is no doubt that the plea is a valid one in the case of the alien\u2019s residence in the enemy\u2019s country, and the plea may be pleaded either in abatement or in bar, for the precedents are both ways. <em>(Rast. Ent. </em>tit. <em>Ejectment, 7. </em>tit. <em>Trespass per Alien, </em>1. <em>Cornn. Tab. </em>tit. <em>Abatement, 7. </em>tit. <em>Bar in Divers Actions, </em>87. <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 <em>Lutw. </em>34, 35. <em>West </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>2.) This plea conforms precisely to the opinion of the K. B. in <em>Le Bret </em>v. <em>Papillon, </em>(4 <em>East, </em>502.) in concluding in bar of the <em>further </em>maintenance of the suit. As the disability of the plaintiff is but temporary in its nature, (for a state of perpetual war is not to be presumed,) the good sense and logic of pleading would seem <em>to </em>be in favour of the plea concluding in abatement, when the cause of action is not void or extinguished. But whether the plea be in the one form or the other is, perhaps, not material, for the judgment thereon would not be a bar to a new action on the return of peace. A judgment is no bar to a new suit, unless it involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the merits of the controversy, or be founded on matter which <em>affords a permanent avoidance, or discharge. But hte present plea only bars the palintiff, in his character of alien enemy comrnorant abroad, </em>bom prosecuting the suit. It does not so much as touch the merits of the action. In a late case in chancery, <em>(Ex parts Boussmaker, </em>13 <em>Ves. </em>71.) Lord <em>Erskine </em>declared tint the alien\u2019s right of action, in such a case, was only suspended \u2022 by the war, and that if the contract was originally good, the remedy would revive on the return of peace. This was even the ancient doctrine, according to Lord <em>Coke, </em>who said <em>(Co. Litt. </em>129. b.) that <em>\u201d\u25a0 </em>true ii is an alien enemy shall maintain neither real nor personal action, <em>donee terns fuerinl communes, </em>that is, until both nations be in peace.\u201d It is also admitted by the best modem authorities, on the law of nations, that the plea of alien enemy is only a temporary bar to the recovery of private debts, and that the right of action returns with the return of peace. <em>(Bynk.
