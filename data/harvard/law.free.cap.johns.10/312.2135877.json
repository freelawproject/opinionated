The defendant objected to the <em>commissions, charges of shipment, and damages on bills, </em>charged in the account, stating that if he was liable at all, it could only be for the purchase of the cotton, according to the express terms of the guaranty. By consent, the jury took the account with them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-8\">The judge charged the jury that he inclined to the opinion that, the bills drawn by the plaintiff on the defendant, of the 30th <em>Ja - nuary, </em>1809, and the communications made at that time, did not create any liability on the part of the defendant. But without any express direction on that part of the case, he said, that in his opinion, the plaintiff was entitled to recover on the previous transactions and correspondence between the pjariies, and to recover the amount stated in the account of the plaintiff of the 10th <em>January, </em>1812, being 12,257 dollars and 28 cents, with the interest thereon, at the rate of 10 <em>per cent, per annum, </em>from the. 24ih <em>April, </em>1807.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AiHh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>A bill of exceptions was tendered to the judge.

When the argument was about to be opened on the part of the defendant, Pendleton, for the plaintiff, objected that the <em>bill of exceptions </em>had not been regularly taken; that the exceptions were not made until the jury had returned into court with their verdict, though before it was actually delivered. The exceptions, how ever,were not in fact reduced to writing during the sittings.

The two first were received by the plaintiff before the <em>Mac </em>arrived. The letter of the 13th <em>February </em>first introduces <em>Taber $\u2022 Son </em>to the plaintiff as correspondents, and from that period, the plaintiff acts under the <em>orders </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>of <em>Taber Sr Son </em>only.

Sharp, 1 <em>Salk. </em>288. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Ins. Co. of N.

From the 13th <em>February </em>to the 24th <em>July the </em>defendant sent but one letter to the plaintiff, and that one of no importance. He had wholly disappeared from the contract. The principals alone appear, and there is a long chain of correspondence between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Again, the plaintiff promises to keep the defendant duly ad\u00bb vised of all proceedings, yet he never did advise the defendant of the two bills in question, amounting to 10,000 dollars, drawn direct on <em>Taber &amp; Son. </em>By neglecting to keep the defendant advised of the bills, the plaintiff lost, according to the principles of commercial law, his right to have recourse to <em>Barker, </em>in case of the failure of <em>Taber \u00bf\u00a1- Son. </em>By this neglect, the plaintiff must be considered as having waived all right to call on the defendant.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b347-8\"><em>Pendleton, </em>contra, insisted,</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AEF2\">that there was an original, positive and substantive engagement on the part of the defendant, that all bills drawn by the plaintiff, on account of the <em>Mac, </em>should be paid, whether those bills were drawn on the defendant or on <em>Taber 8r Son. </em>The letter of the 13th <em>o\u00ed February, </em>1806, contains this contract, and if it was not revoked, or changed, by any new agreement between the parties, there can be no doubt of the liability of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Then, was there any such new agreement? The defence rests on the validity of the position, that there was a new agreement substituted in the place of the first engagement. All written documents relative to one subject matter, must be construed, together as one instrument. This was a mercantile transaction; and the whole correspondence between the parties is to be taken together as forming one contract; and where the latter part is in - consistent with, or contradictory to, the former, it must so far revoke or modify the preceding matter. Such transactions are usually carried on by letters, and this rule is, therefore, peculiarly applicable to them. Another principle of construction is also to be observed in relation to such contracts. They are to be so construed as to be rendered definite and certain. Certainty is of the highest importance in all commercial transactions, especially in matters of agency. Any ambiguity ought not to be turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>against the agent, but he should be held <em>to </em>a strict observance of instructions. To establish a departure from the original in- ' stractions, there should be either an express revocation of them, or a subsequent order, or act, inconsistent with such original instructions. Now, it is not pretended, in the present case, that there was any express revocation of the former instructions: nor is there any inconsistency or contradiction in saying, on the 9th of <em>January, </em>\u201c I will honour any bills on <em>Taber S' Son, </em>or me,\u201d and on the 13th of <em>February, </em>or 24th of <em>July, </em>\u201cthy bills on me for their account shall meet due honour.\u201d The defendant does not Say \u201c thy bills on me only,\u201d nor does he use any words negativing what was said in the first letter, as to bills on <em>Taber Sr Son. </em>The drawing of bills on <em>Taber Sr Son, </em>or on <em>Barker, </em>was merely for the sake of greater facility in negotiating a sale of bills,, s\u00f3 as to reimburse the plaintiff for his advances in the purchase of the cotton ordered. Suppose the plaintiff had neglected to execute the orders to purchase cotton, load and despatch the ship, because he could not sell bills on <em>Barker, </em>when he might have sold bills oa <em>Taber S' </em>Son; might not they or the defendant have justly objected to the plaintiff that he was not limited to drawing bills on <em>Barker </em>only, and have held him responsible for a neglect of orders, and a failure of the enterprise ?</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">It is said that the last orders are always to be observed. True. But there is nothing in the subsequent letters that revokes or varies the plan of the enterprise laid down in the first letter. If the letter of the 24th of <em>July </em>is to be considered as altering or revoking <em>the letter </em>of the 9th of <em>January, </em>then the next letter of the 26th of <em>September, </em>which is wholly silent as to any guaranty whatever, might be considered as revoking all former engagements.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Letters containing orders of this kind, wher\u00e9 an agent is concerned, are not to be subjected to nice criticism, but ought to be taken in their natural and plain sense. And if that alone is looked for, then, according to the internal and external evidence of the whole transaction between the parties, it is clear that the guaranty contained in the letter of. the 9th of <em>January, </em>was never revoked, <em>hut </em>was continued. Both <em>Taber Sr Soti </em>and the defendant were extremely solicitous that the <em>Mac </em>should be expedited, with all possible speed. Their orders for this purpose, and for the \u00a1purchase of 500 bales of cotton, were reiterated and urgent; they Sever could have intended, therefore, to diminish the chance ef <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the agent\u2019s procuring funds, by the sale of bills, especially when he frequently expressed the great difficulty of placing bills.</p>\n<p id=\"A5AE\">There is a fallacy in the argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel, in confounding orders and instructions given to govern the con-duet of an agent, with a contract of guaranty or suretyship. The defendant was a surety cr guaranty so far as regarded <em>Taber S' Son, </em>but in respect to the plaintiff, both <em>Taber S' Son </em>and the <em>defendant </em>were principals, and the plaintiff their agent,</p>\n<author id=\"b349-7\">Kent, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWF_\">delivered the opinion of the court. It is evident from every part of this case, that the defendant was merely an agent and surety for <em>Taber St Son, </em>and that the plaintiff, at the time of the creation of the debt in question, knew of this fact, and that the debt arose on their account, and for their benefit, and not on the account, or for the benefit, of the defendant. He is, therefore, not to be charged beyond his positive obligations by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The claim upon the defendant for the payment of the two bills of the 20th of <em>March, 1807, </em>is founded on his letter of the 9th of <em>January, </em>1806, in which he stated that the ship <em>Mac </em>was gone to <em>New Orleans, </em>in pursuit of freight, and that he wished her loaded on owners\u2019 account to 500 bales of cotton, and that for the payment of all shipments on owners\u2019 account, the bills of the plaintiff on <em>Taber St Son, </em>or on him, at 60 days\u2019 sight, would meet with due honour.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">If there had been no other letter than this, and the plaintiff had acted upon it with reasonable diligence, the defendant would have been responsible for bills drawn upon <em>Taber S' Son. </em>But the defendant, in his letter of the 13th of <em>February, </em>1806, enclosed one to the plaintiff from <em>Taber 8' Son, </em>in which they assume the character of owners and principals in the transaction, and give directions accordingly, and instruct the plaintiff to draw on them, or on the defendant, or on the house of <em>Rathbone, Hughes S' </em>Duncan, at <em>Liverpool; </em>and the defendant, at the same time, instructs the plaintiff, that his bills <em>on him, </em>the defendant, for account of <em>Taber S' Son, </em>for the cotton they may order to be shipped, shall be duly honoured. The defendant writes again, to the same effect, by his letter of the 24th of <em>July, </em>1806. These letters were all received before the shipment was made, or the cotton purchased; and it was upon the credit of those letters, and in obedience to the instructions of <em>Taber S' Son, </em>and of their agent, as contained therein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>that the shipment was made. This appears evident from the plaintiff\u2019s letter to the defendant of the 26th of <em>September, </em>1806, and of the 22d of <em>January, </em>1807.</p>\n<p id=\"AFPn\">When <em>Taber Sc Son </em>were introduced to the plaintiff, as owners of the ship, and exclusively interested in the adventure, he immediately and steadily acknowledged them as such, and promised to obey their orders. This appears by his letters of the 27th of <em>March, </em>the 7th of <em>April, </em>and the 5th of <em>June, </em>1806, all of which were addressed to <em>Taber St Son. </em>And in all his subsequent correspondence he looks up to <em>Taber Sc Son </em>as his principals, on whose account, and under whose orders he acted, and the defendant was considered as an agent merely, who had assumed to pay the drafts on himself. This interference of <em>Taber St Son, </em>as principals, and this recognition of them as such by the plaintiff; this new and specified responsibility of the defendant, and the continued evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s assent to the new arrangement, and the creation of the debt in question, long after had taken place, appear to me to be sufficient to prove that the defendant was not holden beyond the terms of his letters of 13th <em>February </em>and 24th <em>July, </em>1806, and, consequently, that he was not bound to answer for any bills not drawn directly upon himself.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar24\">There was a variation, by the assent of all concerned, in the terms of the engagement contained in the letter of the 9th of <em>January, </em>1806, and it would be contrary not only to the understanding of the parties, but to the principles upon which the rights of a surety rest, to revive and apply to this case the antecedent engagement of the defendant. That engagement was made before <em>Taber Sc Son </em>had introduced themselves to the plaintiff, and under circumstances which afterwards ceased, to exist. It was modified and merged in the new contract, which arose in consequence of <em>Taber Sc Son </em>making themselves known, and taking a direct and controlling part in the business, as owners. They declare that the defendant was their agent, whose instructions the plaintiff was to follow, and they prescribe the mode of reimbursement, to which the defendant assents as far as depends upon him, The plaintiff also assumes these new propositions as the basis of his conduct, and of the credit he was to give. He acknowledges his obligations to <em>Taber S' Son </em>for their confidence; he promises to execute their orders and follow their instructions; he informs them why he shall, from time to \u2022time, elect one mode of reimbursement offered to him, in pre\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ference to the other, and why he shall prefer drawing on the defendant, because of his residence in <em>New-York; </em>but he reminds <em>Taber 8? Son </em>to see that his drafts on the defendant are duly honoured; and he sends them a note of his drafts on the defendant, and promises to keep them advised of his proceedings, and should continue to draw as opportunity offered. This he did so late as the 3d of <em>March, </em>1807. But on the 20th of that month he altered his mode of drawing, and drew the bills in question on <em>Taber 8r </em>Son, and gave no immediate advice thereof to the defendant. He was accordingly not bound to pay these bills, and the subsequent draft upon him so late as the 30th of <em>January, </em>1809, was clearly without any existing authority. The delay of nearly two years after drawing on <em>Taber </em># Son, was a waiver of the right to draw for the same debt on the defendant. It was the same, in effect, as giving a new and extended credit to <em>Taber &amp; Son; </em>and it would be destructive to mercantile confidence and safety, and especially to the interests of agents and correspondents, to allow of a valid resort to the surety after such a delay. It may well be presumed that he would in the mean time, be lulled, by a false confidence, that no such unsatisfied debt existed, and be ready to surrender up to his principal all his means of indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">It may appear to be reasonable that a resort to <em>Taber 8r Son0 </em>in the first instance, should not prejudice the claim of the plaintiff on the defendant, as it would appear to be for the benefit, and not to the injury of the defendant, that the first resort should be to his principals. But it is suEcient to observe that the contract was different, and that the surety is only to be held according to the sound interpretation <em>of the terms </em>of his contract. The parties must have had suEcient reasons, in their own view of the subject, for prescribing the mode on which the responsibility of the defendant was to depend; and it would be hazardous to say that there were no good reasons arising out of the complicated concerns of the trade in which the parties were engaged., for confining the defendant\u2019s engagement to the terms prescribed. Courts are not, indeed, to construe so literally the contract, even of a surety, as to defeat the spirit and sense of it; nor, on the other hand, are they to vary and extend the contract, because ' they do not perceive any inconvenience or reasonable objection to the modification assumed. It is suEcient for the surety to reply <em>non Ikec in fiedera veni* </em>There are many cases in which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>has been established that a surety is not held, if there be any vari~ atjon from the terms of his contract, however immaterial the variation niay appear to have been in the given case. (Myers v. Edge, 7 Term Rep. 254. Ludlows v. Simond, 2 Caines' Cases in Er<em>ror, 1. Walsh </em>v. <em>Bailie, </em>10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>180.) Here was an election given to the plaintiff. He was at liberty to draw on <em>Taber Sc Son, </em>or on their sureties at <em>New-York </em>or <em>Liverpool. </em>He elected, for a while, to draw on the defendant; and then he elects to draw on his principal, and gives no notice to the defendant of the drafts, or at least, no notice consistent with his former practice, or with mercantile promptitude and diligence. The defendant was, consequently, discharged by that election, and not holden for the payment of those bills, any more than he would have been holden, if the bills had been drawn on the house in <em>Liverpool.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The court are accordingly of opinion, that the verdict must be set aside, and a new trial awarded with costs to abide the event Of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Van Ness, J. dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
