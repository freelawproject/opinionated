That <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly, </em>or <em>Clason, </em>acting for both, received from <em>Sands, </em>or gome other person, 4,000 dollars, or some large sum of money, besides the <em>Washington </em>lots, in full of all demands <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>had against <em>Sands, </em>at the time of his bankruptcy. That the respondents proposed to <em>Clason </em>to give up what he had obtained from the estate and effects of the bankrupt, and prover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>his debt under the commission, which he refused to do. The bill prayed a discovery of what was due to <em>Clason </em>and Stanly, or <em>Clason, </em>from <em>Sands, </em>on what account, and how secured; what effects or property of <em>Sands </em>had come into the hands of <em>Clason, </em>in satisfaction of the said demand, and under what agreement or understanding it was conveyed or received; that satisfaction might be entered up on the above-mentioned judgment, and an injunction issue to restrain <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>from proceeding by execution on the judgment, until the further order, &amp;c. and for relief generally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-4\"><em>Stanly </em>residing out of the state, the bill, as against him, was taken pro <em>cortfesso, </em>for want of appearance, after a regular advertisement, to come in and answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-5\">The <em>answer </em>of <em>Clason, </em>put in on oath, admitted the bankruptcy of <em>Comfort Sands, </em>and the commission and proceedings thereon, and the several assignments, as stated in the bill; it also admitted the suit by <em>George Codwise, </em>jun. and others against <em>Sands, </em>the proceedings thereon, the decree of this court on the appeal, &amp;c, the judgment by <em>Nicholas Low </em>against <em>Sands, </em>and also against <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly, </em>as endorsers; and$e that satisfaction had been entered up on the last judgment as stated in the bill.\u201d The answer stated that the note on which the judgments were obtained was gratuitously endorsed by <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly, </em>for the accommodation of <em>Sands, </em>who failed to pay it; and that <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly,, </em>on the 1st <em>December, </em>1798, paid the amount of principal, interest, and costs of the judgment obtained against them, to <em>Low, </em>amounting to 5,866 dollars and 45 cents, and, that he by deed assigned, the judgment against <em>Sands </em>to <em>Clason, </em>with full power to levy the amount thereof by execution; and which judgment the appellant insisted was in full force. The answer also admitted that <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>recovered a judgment against <em>Sands, </em>as stated in the bill, but denied that the money paid to <em>Loro </em>was any part of the sum for which it was recovered. He admitted that <em>Sands </em>had stopped payment before, the judgments were obtained, and that the fact was known to <em>Clason </em>and Stanly. It stated, that, in <em>October, </em>1797, <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly, </em>solely for the accommodation of <em>Sands, </em>and without any consideration, endorsed three several promissory notes of <em>Sands, </em>amounting to 8,700 dollars, which were presented for payment, and afterwards taken up and paid by <em>Clason </em>and Stanly. That on one of the notes, being 3,200 dollars, <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>attached the property of <em>Samd.&amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>in <em>Georgetown ; </em>and that the judgment against <em>Sands, </em>in the sa\u00ab preme court, was on the other two notes.; and that the amount o\u00a3\u2019 the two judgments, and of the 3,200 dollars,, was due to <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly, </em>at the time Sands. became a bankrupt, and is now justly due to the appellant, and that he has not received, nor any other person for his use, from <em>Comfort Sands, </em>or front any person. on his. behalf, any lands, goods, moneys, debts, or any other- thing, in payment or discharge of the said judgments, and the said 3,200 dollars, or any part thereof, the whole of which still, remained due to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-7\">That some time previous, to the bankruptcy of <em>Sands, </em>and. while he was in prison for debt, a verbal agreement was made between him and the appellant, by which the appellant was to.be paid, what was due to him with interest, one half out of a debt due to. <em>Sands </em>from the <em>French </em>government,, and the other half in lots in the city of <em>Washington, </em>at their cost; the time of this agreement the appellant did not recollect, but it was before he. had, any knowledge of <em>Sands </em>having committed an act of bankruptcy. The amount of the debt was not then, fixed, but <em>Sands. </em>never disputed the amount of the said judgments, and the note for 3,200 dollars; that the lots in <em>Washington </em>were stated to be held in the name of one of the sons of <em>Sands, </em>and the <em>French </em>debt to be irt the name of <em>Joseph </em>Sands,another son;- and that in consequence qf this agreement, the appellant did not prove his debt under the commission, or appear as a creditor in the subsequent proceedings, i/nder it. That the. judgment of <em>Clason and Stanly </em>against <em>Sands </em>made part of the debt which was to be so paid by that agreement. That in <em>November, </em>1801, <em>Sands </em>gave or sent to the, appellant, a deed, from <em>Lewis Sands, </em>dated the 13th <em>November,. </em>1801, for 33 lots, in the city of <em>Washington, </em>the consideration, for which expressed in. the deed was. 6,833 dollars, and 34 cents, which deed the appellant supposed to. be in part performance of the agreement above mentioned. That the appellant did not, at that time, examine.the deed, or accept, or agr.ee to accept the same in. any.manner., or. for any purpose, other than the said, agreement, nor did he give any receipt for the deed, or for any part of his, debt on that or any other account. . That the appellant never received any money from. the. <em>French </em>debt, nor any- assignment of the same, or any part of. it, from <em>Comfort. Sands </em>or any other person ; and he believed that.it had been, otherwise, appropriated, so. that he could obtain, no benefit, from it. That the agreement to pay. lihe .said.debt had not been complied with by <em>Confort Sands, in. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>any part, and that the debt is still due. That the appellant has not sold, nor exercised any act of ownership over the lots in the city of Washington, as he did not, nor never has intended to considev them as payment of his debt, or any part of it, unless upon the fulfilment of the said agreement. The answer positively denied, in the most explicit manner, that the appellant had ever received 4,000 dollars, or any other sum, at any time from <em>Comfort </em>Sands, or any other person, which, with the addition of the <em>Washington </em>lots, was to be taken in Satisfaction and discharge of all sums and demands against Sands, or for any other purpose whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-8\">It is stated that the partnership between <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>was dissolved in 1802, and, by their agreement all the partnership property and effects were vested in the appellant solely, and <em>Stanly </em>was not to meddle therewith, and the appellant believed he had not received any of the partnership debts or effects. The appellant admitted that he declined the offer of the respondents to relinquish Ms <em>liens </em>and take a dividend of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, preferring to pursue his legal remedies on the said judgments; and offered to convey to the respondents the lots in <em>Washington </em>City, on their paying him 8,287 dollars and 34 c\u00e9nts, being the amount of his demands against Sands, not included in the two judgments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-9\">The respondents filed a replication to the answer of the appellant, and several witn esses were examined, and proofs taken on both sides; but the material part of the proofs being stated in the opinion of the court, it is unnecessary to detail them here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-10\">The cause having been heard, the chancellor, on the 19th October, 1811, pronounced his decree, that the judgment obtained by <em>Nicholas Low </em>against <em>Confort Sands, and </em>assigned to <em>Clason </em>of the 14th of <em>August, </em>1798, and the other judgment obtained by <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>against <em>Sands, </em>the 25 th of <em>January, </em>1799s Were to be demeed fully paid and satisfied, and that they ought not to remain, or be considered as. a <em>Ikm </em>on the estate of the bankrupt; and he, therefore, ordered and decreed that <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly, </em>or <em>Clason, </em>should forthwith, after being served with a copy of the decree, acknowledge and enter, or cause to be acknowledged and entered, of record, satisfactions of the said judgments respectively, and that the said <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>pay the \u00e9osts of the suit. From this decree <em>Clason </em>entered his appeal to this eourh</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AtK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Thei\u2019easons of this decree were thus delivered by</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-8\">The Chancellor.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayk\">From the pleadings and proofs in this cause, it appeared that the appellant, <em>Clason, </em>and <em>Stanly </em>claimed the satisfaction of two judgment debts, and one on simple contract, out of the bankrupt\u2019s estate. The right to one of the judgments, they deduced from its assignment by <em>Nicholas Low ; </em>the other from their own recovery against the bankrupt, <em>Comfort Sands.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-9\">The existence of these judgments was proved, and there was no controversy between the parties as to their former existence; but the appellant insisted that they were satisfied, to all equitable purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-10\">As far as respected the judgment of <em>Low, </em>the respondents insisted,</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-11\">1. That the payment by <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>of the same debt recovered against them, operated as a satisfaction of the judgment '* against <em>Comfort Sands.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-12\"><em>2. </em>As to the judgment of <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>against <em>Comfort Sands, </em>that the transactions of <em>Sands, </em>before his bankruptcy, put his real estate out of the reach of the judgments against him, and its having been regained by the creditors, who prosecuted at great hazard and expense, equity will not allow the respondents more than an equal share.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-13\"><em>3. </em>That the appellant, <em>Clason, </em>having accepted 4,000 dollars in -satisfaction of <em>the </em>debts due from <em>Comfort Sands </em>to him and- <em>Stanly, </em>he could not resort to the respondents, for the same purpose, upon discovering that his interest would be better promoted by having recourse to them, in consequence of the bill for avoiding the fraudulent conveyances of the bankrupt having been sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-14\">The solution of those points resolved itself, as far as respected the decision of this cause, into the last; for if that could be sustained, whatever might be the opinion of the court on the others, the result would be similar, and destroy the appellant\u2019s right of satisfaction; but the situation in which these transactions were presented, rendered it, perhaps, fit that the other points should receive attention, as if the facts which they were calculated to bring into view, had a direct tendency to satisfy part of the appellant\u2019s demands, it might conduce to the establishment of the last point, by showing that the 4,000 dollars alleged to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>deceived in full satisfaction, were not so incommensurate to the debts remaining unsatisfied, as they would appear to be, without those r, <em>J </em>rr auxiliary considerations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXbh\">1. The facts respecting <em>Low\u2019s </em>judgment are disclosed in the appellant, Clason\u2019s, answer; he alleges that he and <em>Stanly </em>endorsed the note on which that judgment was rendered, gratuitously; that on the 1st day of <em>December, </em>1798, the house of <em>Isaac Clason </em>&lt;\u00a7\u00b0 <em>Co. </em>paid the judgment, took a receipt of the attorney for the plaintiff therefor, and that thereupon <em>Low </em>assigned to him (the appellant Clason) the said judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-8\">This allegation is, therefore, only in the nature of a plea In bar at common law; it must be tested by the evidence adduced in support of it. <em>Joseph </em>Siansbury, a witness examined on the part, of the appellant, <em>Clason, </em>says, that <em>to the best of his knowledge and belief, the note </em>was given by <em>Sands for the </em>purchase of certain stock, described in his answer to the preceding interrogatory, and that <em>Isaac Clason &amp; Co. </em>were merely endorsers as sureties. <em>Samuel Hunter, </em>another of the appellant, <em>Clason\u2019s, </em>witnesses,, declares, that <em>Isaac Clason &amp; Co. </em>did endorse certain notes of <em>Sands </em>by way of sureties, and for Ms accommodation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-10\">The deposition of <em>Stansbury </em>declares the facts he stated, to <em>the best of his knowledge and belief, </em>without mentioning whence his knowledge was derived, or his belief deduced, or how much of his testimony is to be referred to his knowledge, and what part: to his belief. The established rale is, to detail the manner by which the witness acquired his knowledge, and to give the reasons of his belief, to induce the court to believe with him- <em>There </em>is no measure for a deposition of this nature. It must depend upon the degree of credulity of the witness, the estimate of which is not a task to be imposed on the court. This, therefore, was no&gt; evidence at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-11\">The deposition of <em>Samuel Hunter </em>goes to <em>certain notes, </em>without specification of dates, sums, or periods of payment, and can have no bearing on the points in controversy, having not the most remote reference to them, and is too vague and indefinite to establish or even corroborate any evidence of the facts which the appellant relied on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-12\">Another witness examined on the part of the appellant, was <em>Comfort Sands. </em>He deposed that the note given by him was for stock purchased, and that <em>Isaac Clason </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2022 <em>Co. </em>endorsed the same for his accommodation, and as his sureties; he was a party in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>original transaction; he stated the fact of the endorsement simply; he did not state whether any and what counter-securities were relied on by the appellant. His answer in the principal case, of which this case is only a branch, has been falsified. His acts have been deemed fraudulent in this court. He appears as a witness, on suspicious and questionable grounds, especially in a transaction connected with his bankruptcy; and I thought, all circumstances considered, his deposition, unsupported, could not be admitted as a <em>competent </em>ground for a decision on that point. If I was right, the doctrine of <em>sureties </em>had no application to this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-9\">The receipt and assignment bear date on the sam\u00e9 day. The receipt contains no specification of the persons who had satisfied the judgment; but after stating the title of the cause, declares the payment to be in full satisfaction of the debt and costs recovered in the cause of <em>Nicholas Loro </em>against the defendant; and therp was no evidence to show who paid the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-10\">2. As to the second point;</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-11\">The transactions of <em>Comfort Sands </em>were avoided, as far as respected the creditors w'ho were parties to the suit. As far as that avoidance might affect existing, though dormant <em>liens, </em>it kept them -where it found them. Its immediate legal effects could only touch the p\u00e1rties and the interests for which they contended. But if in the time intermediate the commencement of that suit and the decretal order, which declared those transactions fraudulent, <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>had been disposed to enforce their legal <em>liens, </em>there could have been no impediment to pursuing the same course which those creditors pursued, unless by their interference they embarrassed the cause prosecuted by the creditors generally* The suspension of the proceedings which took place to enforce certain judgments, after the decree of avoidance was pronounced, was intended merely to operate, until the rescued fund could be converted into money, be brought into court, and distributed according to the rights of the different claimants. This court gave it a different destination, by placing the whole under the control of the assignees, and thus defeated the course indicated. Relatively, however, it created no new rights, nor impaired those vested in the parties, as to the court of chancery. If the legal remedy did not afford a priority of satisfaction, and a resort, to chancery became necessary, its maxim, in cases of this kind, is <em>equality is equity,and </em>as far as <em>Clason mdStanly\u2019s </em>claims were just\u00bf they would be admitted to an equal participation of benefits with those of their more meritorious co-creditors in the general fund 5 but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>beyond that point, the powers of the court of chancery could not foe exerted, to destroy that equality, in favour of the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-4\">3. As to the third point;</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-5\">The agreement as stated was, that the appellant <em>Clason- </em>agreed <em>to </em>accept the debt due to the firm of <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly, </em>one half in <em>Washington </em>lots, and ihe other half in the <em>French </em>debt. The appellant <em>Clason, </em>in his answer, admitted the agreement; he admitted that the judgment claimed by him and <em>Stanly </em>against <em>Comfort Sands, </em>was part of the debt to be so paid, which was constituted by the two judgments and the note for 3,200 dollars. That on the 13th of <em>November, </em>1801, he received a deed for 33 lots in the city of <em>Washington, </em>as he suppesed, in part performance of that agreement, which was left in his hands ; that he did not examine the deed, nor agree to accept the same in any manner or for any other purpose, <em>than the agreement aforesaid. </em>He alleged that he had never received the <em>French </em>debt, or any assignment of it, and that the agreement had not been complied with. That he had not sold nor exercised any act of ownership over the <em>Washington </em>lots, as he did not, nor ever intended to, consider them as payment of his debt, or any part of it, unless after the fulfilment of the agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-11\">There was no evidence contradicting the appellant\u2019s allegation, that he never received the <em>French </em>debt or an assignment of it; hut he received the deed for the lands in 1801, <em>for no other purposes than for ihe agreement; </em>and, whatever his intention <em>may </em>have been, his tacitly retaining it for so long a period, though unexamined, will bind him as effectually as if he had, in the most explicit manner, approved of it. It required no new expression of his intent. He had agreed to receive satisfaction, partly in those lots and partly in the <em>French </em>debt, and he did not object to receive the deed, on account of its not having been accompanied by an assignment of the <em>French </em>debt. It must, therefore, be taken in satisfaction of a part of that debt. If so, this has an important bearing, on <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly\u2019s </em>debts, generally, as claimed by them against the effects of the bankrupt, for in the former part of the appellant <em>Clason\u2019s </em>answer, he denied that he had received the deed for the <em>Washington </em>lots, on account, in any other mode than the agreement set forth by him. As to those lots and the <em>French </em>debt# that agreement, he insisted, was not, in part, complied with, by the delivery of the deed for the <em>Washington </em>lots; in conformity to which construction, (if he had received the 4,000 dollars, or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>other sum in satisfaction, as, according to his answer, the Wash<em>ington </em>lots were not so received,) after stating that they were not hdcen, he adds, <em>or agreed to be in full satisfaction ; </em>here the word <em>taken </em>would have altered the meaning of the sentence, <em>for if they </em>j(a\u00ed\u00bf <em>no\u00bf been agreed to be taken </em>in full satisfaction, il would, in a great measure,have removed the uncertainty, for the agreement <em>to be </em>in full satisfaction, must be supposed to intend the actual acceptance, and not depending on a promise to take effect in future; and having airear dy declared that the <em>Washington </em>lots were not received in satisfaction,' he could on that ground allege that they had not been <em>agreed to be in full satisfaction. </em>The answer may be true to all common intents, though extremely evasive, and so exceptionable, as to the manner, that the defendant ought not to be permitted to avail himself of an experiment so palpably devised to elude the justice of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-7\">When a defendant so answers, though it might have formed a subject for exception, he must do it at much hazard; for in giving a construction to an answer, as the allegation of the defendant, in defence and affirmance of his right, deliberately interposed so as to guard his interests, the legal presumption must ever be, that he has made his case as full and available to himself as the truth would admit. Here, therefore, was so far from being an express denial, that the answer exhibited only a dexterous evasion, by which <em>the </em>respondents were <em>left to </em>support their case, not from any discovery made by the appellant, but by evidence solely.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-8\">If this is a true exposition of the answer, then the deposition of <em>George Knox, </em>a witness on the part of the respondents, stands nnimpeached and uncontroverted ; he positively swears that the appellant, <em>Clason, </em>told him he had got 4,000 dollars for his debt, and <em>let Sands </em>out of gaol; that he expected no more-; and to evince the sincerity of his declaration, the witness declared, that the appellant, <em>Clason, </em>spoke of <em>Sands </em>in opprobrious terms, and advised the witness to settle a debt he had against him in the same way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-9\">I did not think the 1,000 dollars spoken of by <em>Joseph Winter, </em>as referrible to this transaction. It merely showed, that at \u2022 another time, a money transaction, to that amount, existed between <em>Sands </em>and the appellant <em>Clason, </em>but there was nothing in it which can give it a reference to the composition spoken of by Knox\u00bb There was evidence that the copartnership between <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>was long since dissolved; and the bill having been taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>ffo confesso </em>against <em>Stanly, </em>which entitled the respondents to a decree against him, and the proceedings against the appellant, <em>Clason, </em>concluding to the same point, it was useless to trace what might have been the effect of a different state of things.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqjg\">Upon the whole, T was of opinion that the debts due from <em>Comfort Sands </em>to <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>were to be held as satisfied, and that they ought to be decreed to enter satisfaction of record \u00f3f the judgment described in the bill.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-9\"><em>Pendleton </em>and <em>T.

He states the agreement between, him and <em>Sands </em>; and he denies that he accepted or received the deed for the <em>Washington lots, </em>in satisfaction of any part of the agreement. An accord and satisfaction must not only be an agreement to accept, but an actual acceptance in satisfaction; now, the deed was received on certain conditions which were never performed, and the answer denies that the appellant ever took possession of, or exercised acts of ownership over, the lots in <em>Washington. </em>The agreement was one and entire, and the appellant was not bound to accept a performance of a part, unless the whole was executed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-10\">The appellant has a judgment, and stands on his legal rights, and the respondents must show that they have fully executed the agree-meat before they can ask for equity. They stand in the place of <em>Sands, </em>and he clearly could not support such a claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-11\">The conveyance of the 13th of <em>November, </em>1801, was void under the bankrupt law, for <em>Sands </em>had then no estate. The complainants\u2019 bill may be read as evidence against him in equity, though it cannot be in a court of law.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-12\">The act of bankruptcy was in <em>March, </em>1801, and the assignment of his estate was made the 18 th of <em>July, </em>1801. <em>Lewis Sands </em>was a <em>trustee. </em>It was a trust for <em>C. Sands,, </em>and void; and the deed being void, any offer to confirm it was useless, for it was incapable of confirmation. The allegation in the bill as to the 4,000 dollars is wholly denied in the answer, and is not supported by witnesses.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-13\">Again, the appellant stands here in the\" character of a <em>surety, </em>and having paid the debt of his principal, he may call on the ereditor, who may be compelled,, in a court of equity, to assign <em>to</em>iiim every security held by the creditor, and to help the surety is-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>recover against the principal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The appellant, as <em>surety, </em>has-.pakl above <em>15,000 </em>dollars for <em>Sands, </em>and a court of equity will give, him the benefit of every <em>lien </em>or security against <em>Sands.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-25\">That the bill has been taken <em>pro confesso </em>against <em>S.tanly </em>cannot affect the appellant. If one partner is abroad, and does not answer, the other will not lose his right.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-26\">Though <em>interest </em>rests in the discretion of a court, yet the ap-. pellant is justly entitled to interest from the time the injunction was, issued.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-27\"><em>Riggs </em>and <em>Hoffman, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap0\">The <em>petition </em>presented by the. appellant below, and the proceedings on if, cannot be taken into view. It was dismissed with costs. There can be no appeal from that order. It is not before this court. And it- does not appear, except as stated in the petition, that L. <em>Sands </em>was a trustee, or when he became invested with the title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-28\">The ancient, doctrine of the <em>English </em>law, as to. accord and sa? tisfaction, has been overruled even in courts of law <footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> and it never did apply where the money or compensation came from a third person, but only where the payment was made by the party himself. The cases which have been cited on the part of the appellant, show that the assignment df the security to the surety who pays the money, raises merely an equity, but gives, him no remedy . at law.<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark> This is not a legal security, but a mere equity; and there is a difference between equitable and legal-securities.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> Had there been an action at law brought on the judgment, there must have been a verdict for the defendant, for the judgment was satisfied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-29\">There is no proof to support the allegation, in the answer that the note of 3,200 dollars was not given ip evidence at. the trial at law, Or that it did not enter into the consideration of the jury in giving their verdict. In fact, it. is stated, that that, note was put ip suit, and property attached on. it in <em>Georgetown, </em>and-it does not appear whether or not the note was satisfied there. It must, therefore, be taken by the court, that the note has been paid or extinguished. The party must aver and prove that all. the notes were not given in evidence, otherwise, under the general averment in the declaration, and a general verdict, they will all.be deemed bound by the judgment, j-<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020</footnotemark>. The appellant cannot retain his. judgment in this case, and at the same time hold property; undeg. an attachment on the same note, <em>in Georgetown. </em>Where a vendos.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>takes a distinct and independent security for the purchase-money, his equitable <em>lien </em>on the estate sold is gone.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-4\">The appellant arid <em>Stanly, </em>as partners, must be deemed jointly \u00e1nd equally interested in the judgment assigned as security to the appellant, who must be considered as a trustee to <em>Stanly </em>for his half. A decree on a bill taken <em>pro confesso </em>is as effectual as a judgment by default at law. Such a decree cannot be impeached collaterally ; the only remedy is by a bill of review.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> <em>Stanly\u2019s </em>rights are concluded by suffering the bill to be taken pro <em>confesso, </em>and \u00bfgainst him the respondents are entitled to a decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-5\">Again, the answer of the appellant is evasive and contradictory, and one witness is sufficient against such an answer.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> He does</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-6\">hot deny that he ever examined the deed. If he did examine it, why not return it immediately ? Shall he be permitted to keep it for near seven years, and even to insist upon it indirectly, and yet be allowed to say that he never accepted it? Had the conveyance of the <em>Brooklyn </em>estate been adjudged valid, would he have given it up ? If he did accept the deed, either in whole or in part, his answer is <em>false; </em>and <em>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. Knox, </em>the witness, says <em>Sands </em>told him, after he was released from gaol, that he had given the appellant 4,000 dollars in settlement of the judgment; that the appellant, on being asked how much he got for his debt, answered, 4,000 dollars, and, after-wards, advised the witness, who was a creditor of <em>Sands, </em>to settle n ith him as he had done. <em>Winter, </em>another witness, confirms this statement. It is also corroborated by the fact, that <em>the </em>appellant did not prove his debt against <em>Sands, </em>and afterwards received the conveyance for the <em>Washington </em>lots.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-7\">The acceptance of the deed by the appellant was not conditional, and he never afterwards entered <em>into any </em>explanation on the subject with <em>Sands. </em>He must be concluded by the <em>considerations </em>as expressed in it. The court will be disposed to carry the sums of 4,000 dollars and 3,200 dollars to the credit of the judgment. The balance on the judgment only ought to be paid, <em>pari passu, </em>with the other creditors.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b565-16\">Yates, J.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"ASt\">was absent.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AJCf\"> <em>2 </em>Anstr. <em>420. </em>note. 1 Esp N.

If <em>Stanly </em>was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>sole defendant, or had distinct rights, I agree that his default la appearing and answering would have been an admission of the facts, cliarged in the bill. In <em>Davis </em>v. Davis, (2 <em>Aik. </em>21.) Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>says, with great-propriety, that the taking a bill <em>pro </em>cora<em>j\u2019gggg^ </em>jn equity, is analogous to taking the declaration for true, where the plea or answer of the defendant is insufficient. He was there, however, speaking of a sole defendant; and, I believe, not a case can be found in which it is insinuated, that where there are two defendants having a joint interest, and one appears and' answers, and disproves the plaintiff\u2019s case, that the plaintiff can have a decree against the other who had made default, and against whom the bill was taken <em>pro confesso. </em>It would be unreasonable to hold, that b\u00e9cause one of the defendants had made default, the plaintiff should have a decree even against him, when the court is satisfied, from the proofs offered by the other, that in fact the plaintiff is not entitled to a decree. Though I have not met with cases in equity to the point, yet pursuing the analogy between proceedings at law and in equity, we are not without very clear authority; for it is a well settled principle of law, that In actions upon contracts, the plea of one defendant enures to the benefit of all; for the contract being entire, the plaintiff must succeed upon it against all or none; and, therefore, if the plaintiff fails at the trial upon the plea of one defendant, he can-not ^ave judgment'against those who let judgment go by default.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASE\">It would require the most binding authorities to induce me to yield <em>my assent to </em>such a proposition as that set up by th\u00e9 respondents\u2019 counsel; and, indeed, the result would be extraordinary, for if one defendant entitled himself to a decree, where the interest is joint and inseparable, a decree must be made in his favour as to a moiety of the matter in issue, and against the other who made default for the other moiety; that is, the plaintiff would get one half of a decree, and the other defendant the other half. It cannot be so \u2022, we must consider C&amp;sora\u2019s defence as enuring to the benefit of <em>5'lardy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\">I now proceed to examine the merits of the case; and the first inquiry will be, whether <em>Ciason </em>has a right to avail himself of the judgment recovered by <em>Low </em>against <em>Sands ? </em>This will depend on the fact, whether <em>Ciason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>were sureties for <em>Sands </em>or not in that transaction. This fact admits of no doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Ciason, in his answer, avers the fact of suretyship, and he groves it* First, the endorsement of j&amp;mds\u2019s note by <em>Clastm </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>and <em>Stanly, </em>and the passing of that note by <em>Sands to Low, </em>is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the suretyship. This is proved by <em>Joseph Slansbury. </em>Secondly, <em>Sands </em>proves that <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>endorsed the note on which <em>Low\u2019s </em>judgment was rendered, as sureties, and for his accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"A614\">Now, though <em>Sands </em>has been guilty of a fraud, we are not to intend that he is perjured, nor will his executing fraudulent deeds have any <em>other </em>effect than to render him suspected, when he comes to swear in opposition to a more credible witness. But there is no proof at all, on the part of the respondents, impeaching the fact to which he deposes. It cannot, then, be doubted, upon any rules of evidence with which I am conversant, but that the fact is completely made out that <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>endorsed <em>Sands\u2019s </em>note as his sureties.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">That a surety who pays a debt for his principal, has a right to be put in the place of the creditor, and to avail himself of every mean the creditor had to enforce payment against the principal debtor, is a principle which I had supposed incontestable. The case of <em>Parsons and Cole </em>v. <em>Briddock </em>(2 Vern. 608.) has never been questioned. In that case, the plaintiffs were bound as sureties for Mr. <em>Briddock, </em>and had counter bonds. <em>Briddock0 </em>the principal, was afterwards arrested, and Dr. <em>Briddock </em>became his bail, and judgment was obtained against the hail. The plaintiffs being <em>sued on the </em>original <em>bond, were forced to pay the money, </em>and then brought their bill to have the judgment obtained against the bail assigned to them, to be reimbursed what they paid, and it was held, and so decreed, that the judgment against the bail should be assigned to the plaintiffs, in order to reimburse them what they had paid, with interest and costs. Lord <em>Eldon </em>speaks of this case as a strong one, but by no means with disapprobation. It is a much stronger one than the case before us; here <em>Low </em>had a judgment against <em>Sands, </em>the principal debtor; he had a judgment also against <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly, </em>the sureties. The sureties pay the latter judgment; <em>Low </em>then does, voluntarily, what equity would compel him to do ; he assigns the judgment he held against <em>Sands </em>to <em>Clason </em>alone. This is not like the c\u00e1se of a bond by two obligors, where one of them pays the debt, and then wants to sue at law, in the name of the obligee. At this day, such a suit \u2022would not entitle the obligor, who had paid the money, to any remedy which he could not have, in an ordinary suit in his own name, for money paid, laid out and advanced; but as to the bond, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>payment by one, on the very instrument, is a satisfaction o\u00a3 tiiai debt, and the other obligor may plead it. <em>Sands </em>could not plead the payment of the judgment against <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly, </em>as \u00e1 ' payment of the judgment against him. The respondents stand ill his place, and they can have no other or greater rights than <em>Sands </em>h\u00e1d. That assignees of a bankrupt are bound by an equitable or legal <em>lien, </em>although they had no notice of its existence, is a very clear principle; (1 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>420. 6 <em>Ves. </em>jun. 95. n. <em>a.) </em>for, as Sir <em>Williani Grant </em>observes, the assignment from the commissioners; by operation of law, passes thfc rights of \u00e1 bankrupt precisely in the same plight and condition as he possessed them. (9 Ves, jun. 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The doctrine contended for by the respondents\u2019 counsel, that the <em>lien created by Low\u2019s </em>judgment could not be extended and enforced in favour of <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly, </em>against <em>Sands\u2019s </em>assignees, fhfcy being third persons, and strangers to it, is not sound. Thejr \u00e1re not third persons, but are precisely in the place of <em>Sands ; </em>besides, and which is also \u00e1 sufficient answer to that objection, the <em>liefi </em>was not raised by the construction of equity, for it is a legal, not ah equitable <em>lien. Low\u2019s </em>judgment was assigned to <em>Clason </em>solely; he, therefore, solely succeeded to <em>Low\u2019s lien. Stanly </em>does not question that transaction ; <em>Clason, </em>therefore, must be deemed to have a distinct and separate right in that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AEky\">The points next td be -considered are, whether <em>Clason </em>accepted the deed for the <em>Washington </em>lots, in such \u00e1 manner as to conclude himself, and whether he has received 4,000 dollars in satisfaction of the other part of the agreement, and as a substitute for one half of the debt which was to have been paid out of \u00e1 debt due <em>Sands </em>from the <em>French </em>government.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">, There is no proof of the agreement or the acceptance of the deeds for the <em>Washington </em>lots, except <em>Clason\u2019s </em>answer. His answer is certainly evidence against him; and it is also, on these points, evidence for him, unless disproved by one witness, and circumstances corroborating the testimony of that witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">I can perceive nothing evasive in his answer upon these points; and should one part be susceptible of doubt and savour of ev\u00e1- \u25a0 ! sion, it would be incorrect to hold him down to that part, and disregard other parts of the answer which are full and explicit. <em>Ah </em>.answer, like any instrument, is to be construed by regarding it \u00e1s a whole, and by looking into the whole of it, and comparing one part with another. The mind of man is so ingenious, and the critic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>looks with such a microscopic eye, that unless courts give a fair construction to papers, by looking through them, no man can make an answer, if the case be a complex one, without being subjected to the charge of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">I am persuaded that, but for an oversight, his honour the chan-, cellor would not have considered the answer evasive as to the payment of the 4,000 dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The answer is full and explicit, that the conveyance for the <em>Washington </em>lots was left with the appellant, as he supposes, in part performance of the agreement; but he denies that he accepted, or agreed to accept, the same, in any manner, or for any Other purpose than the agreement, and that he gave no receipt for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Then3\u00a1 as I construe the answer, the deed was received by <em>Clason </em>in expectation of the fulfilment of the agreement and he has suffered it to remain in his custody as an inchoate transaction, as one step taken towards the performance of an entire contract\u00bb He has a right, therefore, to insist that it did not operate as a performance of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">I cannot conceive how the answer could be. more full than it is&gt; in denying the payment of the 4,000 dollars. <em>Clason </em>says that yeither he, nor any other person for him, hath received any estate or effects, real or personal, from <em>Sands, </em>or any other person, in satisfaction, or upon any agreement or understanding whatever, for or towards satisfaction of the moneys due him or any part thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\"><em>Georgs Knox </em>is the only witness relied on to disprove <em>Clason\u2019s </em>answer. He testifies not to any fact he has seen or witnessed, but to <em>Clason\u2019s </em>declarations; and it is certain that, in the case of <em>Only </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>(3 <em>Atk, </em>407.) the master of the rolls considered the declarations of the defendant as a circumstance corroborating a fact sworn to by a. witness, and not as direct proof against the answer. Mr. <em>Knox </em>was. called on to testify after the lapse of many years; and it is impossible to say (if we yield our assent t\u00a9 all he has testified, what <em>Clason </em>meant, when he said he had let out <em>Sands, </em>and had got four thousand dollars for his debt) to what debt he referred, or whether the 4,000 dollars was in money or the <em>Washington </em>lands. <em>Knox </em>is certainly incorrect that <em>Clason </em>told him he had obtained judgment for his debt amounting to <em>15,000 </em>or <em>16,000 </em>dollars. No such judgment appears, to. have, fxisted at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"APp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Giving to <em>Knox\u2019s </em>testimony the utmost effect, it is one witness against the positive denial of the appellant, and there are no circumstances corroborating that witness of any weight or force. Whether the rule so well and firmly settled is just or unjust, we, are not liberty to examine: <em>ita lex scripta est: </em>and in my opinion (be answer of <em>Clason </em>must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that there is no ground for relief to the respondents, as respects the judgments; and the respondents having so. framed their bill as not to require the appellant to make his election whether to keep the <em>Washington </em>lots or not, but have prayed only that an entry of satisfaction of the judgments may be decreed, they have failed altogether, and the bill ought <em>to </em>have been dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Lewis, Wilkins, Bishop, Carl, Haight, Rouse, Stearns, Tabor, Tayler, and Townsend, Senators? concurred in this, opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b570-7\">Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOm\">The respondents\u2019 bill in the court of chan-. tiery had for its object, generally, a discovery of what was due from <em>Comfort Sands, </em>the bankrupt, to the appellant, <em>Clason, </em>and what payments he had received, and what property he had in his hands, belonging to <em>Sands; </em>and it prays relief against certain judgments which <em>Clason </em>was about enforcing against the estate of <em>Sands.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The material and principal inquiry will be, whether the answer, \u00a9f <em>Clason </em>has been disproved, so as to warrant the decree which has been made against him. It is an undeniable rule in chancery that the answer to a bill for discovery, being under oath, must be taken as true, unless disproved by two witnesses, or by one witness and circumstances warranting a presumption against the truth of the answer. (2 <em>Atk. </em>19.) The respondents having thought fit to make the appellant a witness, they are bound by what he discloses, unless it is satisfactorily disproved. Where the answer and the testimony are at variance, it becomes a question of credibility. The answer is not to be discredited, or any presumption indulged against it, on account of its being the testimony of a party interested. He is. made a witness by his adversary, and it would be unjust to compel him to testify, and then consider his testimony unworthy of credit,, .because he is a party in the suit. This is not the light in which. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number><em>Cat </em>aiiswef is received in chancery. It is considered equal to the oath of one witness. And to warrant a decree against <em>the </em>answer, it ought to be satisfactorily disproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\">It will be necessary, in order to test the case before us by this K'ule, to look particularly at the discovery sought by the bill, and the answer given to it; for I apprehend, that with respect to many, and, indeed, most of the facts which have been considered material m this case, the answer stands uncontradicted, and, of course, must be taken as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The bill prays a discovery, first, as to what was due from Ct, <em>\u25a0Sands </em>to the appellant, on what account, and how secured; and, secondly, what effects or property of <em>Sands </em>had come to his hands in satisfaction of his dem\u00e1nds, and under what agreement or un - derstanding it was so conveyed, assigned, delivered or paid\u00bb In answer to the first inquiry, the appellant states his demand to consist of a judgment in favour of <em>Nicholas Low </em>against <em>Sands </em>for 5,812 dollars and 61 cents, and which had been duly assigned to him; a judgment in favour of <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>against <em>Sands </em>for 5,874 dollars and 6 cents; and, also, a promissory note for 3,200 dollars, which <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>had paid as endorsers for Sands\u00bb To the inquiry on what account the demands accrued, the answer states that they accrued by reason of his having become security for <em>Saiids. </em>These facts are uncontradicted, and we are not at liberty to reject them. What <em>the </em>legal effect and operation of the payment and satisfaction of the judgment which <em>Low </em>had recovered against <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly, </em>as endorsers for <em>Sands, would </em>be upon the judgment which <em>he </em>had against <em>Sands, </em>as <em>the </em>maker of the note, and which was assigned to <em>Clason, </em>will be noticed hereafter. With respect to the note for 3,200 dollars, the <em>prima, facie </em>presumption would be, that it was included in the judgment of <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>against <em>Sands, </em>as they had declared upon it. But this presumption may be rebutted by proof showing that It was not included. (6 <em>Term Rep. 607.) </em>And the answer furnishes this proof. It is a direct and proper reply to the inquiry made of the appellant, as to what was due from <em>Sands ; </em>and is explicit that it was not included in the judgment. As to the amount of the appellant\u2019s demand, and on what account it accrued, there is no variance between the answer and the proof, and it must be considered as established, that it consists of the two judgments, and the note which I have mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"AlO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The second branch of the discovery relates to the property received by <em>Clason, </em>and under what agreement it was received.</p>\n<p id=\"Aml\">To this inquiry the answer states explicitly that the appellant has not received, nor has any other person received for him, or to his.use, from <em>Comfort Sands, </em>nor from any other person, on his behalf, any of <em>Sands\u2019s </em>goods, moneys, debts, or any other thing, in payment and discharge of the said judgments, and the said 3,200 dollars, or of any part thereof, the whole of which amount, with the interest, is still justly due. This is as full and ample a negation of all payments as could possibly be made, and this general denial ought to be kept in view in the examination of the particular details of the answer; for the whole answer is to be taken together, and if any particular part is susceptible of a double meaning, or has the appearance of evasion, it ought to be so construed as <em>to </em>comport with <em>the </em>general denial. The detail is more the language of the draftsman, which the party may not be able to criticise, but the general denial is intelligible, and cannot but be understood by him; and, in this case, it is so broad and unqualified, that it must be taken for an absolute denial of the acceptance of the deed for the <em>Washington </em>lots, or the receipt of the 4,000 dollars as stated by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The answer of the appellant, as to the nature and terms of Ihe agreement between him and <em>Sands, </em>relative to the payment and satisfaction of his demands, is made evidence by the prayer in the bill for a discovery as to that agreement. And the answer states <em>the </em>agreement to have been, that the appellant was to be paid one half of his demand out of a debt due to <em>Sands </em>from the <em>French </em>government, and the other half in lots in the city of <em>Washington, </em>at the price originally paid for them by <em>Sands. </em>There is no evidence whatever tending to show that such were not the terms of the agreement. What is said in the answer as to the manner and circumstances under which the deed for the <em>Washington </em>lots was delivered, is drawn out by the inquiries in the bill. It states that the conveyance for these lots was left in the appellant\u2019s possession, as he supposes, in part performance of the agreement before mentioned, but that he did <em>not, at that time, </em>to the best of his remembrance and belief, even examine it, nor did he accept, or agree to accept, the same in any manner, or for any purpose, other than the agreement aforesaid. This answer has been treated as equivocal and evasive, because it says he did not, <em>at that </em>time, accept, or agree to accept, the deed, leaving it open to the infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>xince that he might hax7e done it at some other time. There might be some plausibility in this criticism, if this part of the answer was to be taken alone, and unconnected with other parts. But when he adds, that he did not, nor did he ever intend to accept or consider those lots as payment of his debt, or any part thereof, unless upon the terms of the agreement aforesaid, and upon the fulfilment thereof, it is impossible to mistake his meaning, or give any other reasonable construction to the answer, than that it amounts to a total denial of an absolute acceptance of the deed; but that it was left with him in part fulfilment of the agreement, which was to be completed and settled on the performance of the other part by <em>Sands. </em>This was, by no means, an unusual or extraordinary course of proceeding. <em>Clason </em>might, perhaps, have elected to consider this an absolute delivery, and binding upon <em>Sands; </em>but when he positively denies that he ever did accept it, or intend to accept it, as payment, to consider it an unconditional acceptance, would be forcing upon him a partial fulfilment of an entire agreement, in the face of established principles of law. And what evidence is there opposed to this positive denial of any acceptance of the deed? Nothing but the circumstances of the deed remaining in his possession, and his not proving his debt before the commissioners of bankruptcy. These are circumstances, however, of little weight, when we consider the situation in which <em>Clason </em>was placed. He had strong reasons to suspect that <em>Lewis Sands, </em>who had executed the deed to him, was a mere trustee for his father; and if so, the deed would be void, being given after the bankruptcy of <em>C. Sands. </em>Proceedings were about this time instituted in chancery by the creditors of <em>C. Sands, </em>to be relieved against certain fraudulent conveyances made by <em>C. Sands </em>to his sons; which, if effected, would let in the judgments held by the appellant against <em>Sands. </em>He had a right to lay by, waiting events, and not exhibit his claim to the commissioners. No acts of ownership have been exercised over the <em>Washington </em>lots; and to construe a mere silence into an acceptance of the deed would, under the circumstances in which the appellant was placed, be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">With respect to the 4,000 dollars charged in the bill to have been received by the appellant, in addition to the said lots, in full satisfaction of all claims and demands, the answer fully and positively denies the receipt of that sum, or any other sum, at imy time, in satisfaction or discharge of the appellant\u2019s demands, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>or on any other account, or for any other purpose whatever. 1 am unable to discover any ambiguity whatever in'this denial. It *s a full, complete, and unequivocal negation of the charge in the bill, and superadds the broad denial of the receipt of that sum, at any time, or on any account. In this particular, and in this only, jg the answer contradicted by any testimony. <em>Knox </em>swears that a few days after <em>Sands </em>was discharged from imprisonment, he met <em>Clason </em>and asked .him how much he had got for his debt against <em>Sands; </em>to which he answered 4,000 dollars. This proof is certainly contradictory to the answer. I see no ground upon which they can be reconciled. It is, however, only oath against oath, and the allegation in the bill stands without proof. This alone would be a sufficient answer. But I think there are some circumstances tending to show that <em>Knox </em>must be mistaken, if he means to be understood as saying, that <em>Clason </em>told him he had received that sum in cash. The bill charges the money to have been received in the year 1805; and the conversation spoken of by <em>Knox </em>must have been in 1801. <em>Knox </em>says <em>Clason </em>told him <em>Sands </em>was indebted to him 15,000 or 16,000 dollars, and that he had obtained judgment for the said debt. No such judgment appears as the foundation of the appellant\u2019s claim. And it is certainly worthy of notice that this is only proof of a confession made in a casual conversation, several years ago, liable to have been misunderstood, or to have <em>been </em>forgotten by lapse of time. <em>Sands </em>was himself a witness, and <em>the </em>respondents must have known from the answer, that it was necessary for them to support the allegation in the bill by more than one witness; the omission, therefore, to make the inquiry of <em>Sands, </em>if chargeable as neglect in either party, must rest on the respondents. I think, upon the whole, we may safely conclude that the facts- denied by the answer are as strong, if not stronger, than those affirmed by the deposition of <em>Knox, </em>which brings the case within the rule, that no decree can be made against the appellant upon such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"ARe\">The only remaining inquiry is, how far the respondents are entitled to the relief prayed for, as to an entry of satisfaction of these judgments. The judgment assigned by <em>Low </em>to the appellants must, I think, be considered unsatisfied, and as a legal <em>lien </em>on the property. Had the judgment against the endorsers been paid and discharged, without at the same time taking an assignment of the judgment against the principal, it might have operated as,a satisfaction of that judgment. But the appellant stands before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>court as a purchaser and assignee of the judgment, and the money paid by him was the consideration for the assignment. The judgments against the principal and the security are separate and distinct. I see no reason why the security may not purchase a judgment against the principal as well as any other person. None of the cases cited on the argument warrant a different conclusion; (2 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>231. 2 <em>Vern. </em>608.1 <em>Atk. </em>135. 2 <em>Ves. 172. 570.) </em>and a contrary doctrine would seem unreasonable and unjust. With respect to the other judgment, (assuming the answer of the appellant to be true,) there is no pretence of its having been satisfied. The two judgments are, therefore, in force, and entitled to priority of satisfaction. I think, however, that the appellant ought not to be allowed more than a moiety of these judgments\u00bb For it appears from his answer, that the consideration for the assignment of the one was paid by <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly. </em>And although the assignment was made to <em>Clason </em>alone, yet he must be deemed a trustee for <em>Stanly </em>as to a moiety ; the other judgment stands in the name of <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly. </em>They are, therefore, to be taken as joint owners of both judgments. And the bill having been taken <em>pro confesso </em>against <em>Stanly, </em>is an admission, on his part, of satisfaction so far as his interest is concerned. The answer or defence of <em>Clason </em>cannot enure to the benefit of <em>Stanly. </em>(1 <em>Caines\u2019 Cas. in Er. </em>121.) I have not met with any case in the books where a bill has been taken <em>pro confesso </em>against one only of several defendants. But in order <em>to </em>give the force and effect to this default, which is contemplated by the statute, the proceedings must, thereafter, be considered in the nature of separate suits, especially, where the nature of the controversy is such as to admit of distinct consideration, and separate relief. Where the defence set up goes to the essence and foundation of the claim made by the bill, and that is wholly destroyed by the party appearing, there may be some difficulty in enforcing the decree against the party who has suffered the bill to be taken <em>pro confesso. </em>But in the present case, we may consider <em>Clason </em>as attempting to enforce the collection of a debt due to himself and his copartner, when his copartner has acknowledged satisfaction as to his claim. If <em>Stanly </em>is to be considered jointly interested with <em>Clason, </em>it was no doubt competent to him to release or acknowledge satisfaction, so far as his interest is concerned, and his default as equivalent to such acknowledgment; and his rights are to be viewed in the same tight as if he had appeared and aijgwered, and confessed the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>stated in the bill. No injustice is done to <em>Clason; </em>a moiety is all he shows himself entitled to. If the sole and exclusive right to the partnership debts has been transferred to him, he ought to have shown it. This answer, it is true, states a dissolution of the partnership in 1803; and that by an agreement between him and <em>Stanly </em>all the property, debts and effects of the copartnership became vested in him solely. The dissolution of the partnership is proved, but there is no evidence of the agreement in relation to the partnership concerns. The answer, in this respect, is not evidence. It does not form a part of the discovery sought by the bill; and if the appellant claimed the sole right to these judgments, he should have proved the agreement set up in his answer. The testimony on this point is insufficient. The witnesses only state that it was generally understood that <em>Clason </em>was the principal partner of the firm, and that the funds were furnished by him, and that he had the principal, if not the sole direction of the business, after the dissolution. This testimony is too vague and uncertain, either to establish the terms of the partnership, or the transfer of the partnership property to the appellant. As the facts now appear before us, <em>Clason </em>and <em>Stanly </em>are equally interested in these judgments, and the appellant is only en titled to receive satisfaction for a moiety of them. No interest, however, ought to be allowed. The appellant relies on his legal lien, and was about enforcing payment by execution, under which he could not have recovered interest. The judgments were upon promissory notes. And at law, no interest subsequent to the judgment can be recovered under the execution, unless the judgment is upon a penalty., The same rule has been recognised in chancery. The question - of interest rests, perhaps, in the sound discretion of the court, and I should be inclined not to allow it on these judgments, 'because the interest is not a legal <em>lien </em>on the land; and as it is this <em>lien </em>on which the appellant rests, he ought to be satisfied with what he would have recovered had he proceeded under his executions. (6 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>284. 2 <em>Ves. </em>jun. 157. 162.)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">With respect to the deed for the <em>Washington </em>lots, I should rather incline to leave it untouched by the present determination. It is not made necessary, by the state of the case, to decide upon it. The bill in the court of chancery does not seek for any relief against this deed. It has been drawn in question only by the allegation of its having been accepted in satisfaction of the appellant\u2019s demand, but which the respondents have failed, to establish. The' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>appellant may have an equitable <em>lien </em>on these lots, for the payment of the note of 3,200 dollars, and his other small account, and which ought to be taken into consideration, if the present decree is to extend to that deed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqp\">I am, accordingly, of opinion, that the appellant is entitled only to a moiety of the two judgments, and that satisfaction thereof ought to be entered, on his receiving that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Kent, Ch.
