The defendant pleaded <em>not guilty, </em>with <em>notice </em>of a special justification. The cause was tried at the <em>Albany </em>circuit, in <em>April, </em>1813,before Mr. Justice <em>Yates.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-5\">The plaintiff proved, that in the autumn of 1812, the defendant apprehended the plaintiff in <em>Albany, </em>as a <em>deserter, </em>by virtue of an advertisement, and took the plaintiff to <em>Troy, </em>where he was delivered to the sheriff who confined him in gaol for two or three days, when he was brought before the recorder of <em>Albany, </em>on a <em>habeas corpus, </em>and discharged. The plaintiff at the time of his apprehension by the defendant, was under the age of 18 years. Two witnesses testified that on the day Captain <em>Oliver Lyon's </em>company, to which the plaintiff belonged, was marched to the northward, the mother of the plaintiff applied to the captain, and objected to the plaintiff\u2019s going on account of his being under age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-6\">The defendant proved by <em>Oliver Lyon, </em>that he was a captain in the 55th regiment of the <em>militia </em>of this state; and, under orders from the governor and commander in chief, marched with his company, on the 19th of <em>September, </em>1812, <em>to Plattsburgh, </em>where he arrived the 23d of the same month. The plaintiff was a <em>private </em>in his company until the 30th of <em>September, </em>when he deserted, and never afterwards returned. The company, on its arrival at <em>Plattsburgh, </em>was placed under the command of Colonel <em>Vosburgh, </em>who, on the 1st of <em>October, </em>issued an <em>advertisement </em>stating the <em>desertion </em>of the plaintiff and others, and offering rewards for their apprehension. This advertisement Captain <em>Lyon </em>sent to the defendant, requesting him to apprehend the plaintiff The witness denied that he had the conversation with the mother of the plaintiff as stated by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-7\">The defendant offered in evidence the <em>general orders </em>of the commander in chief, which were objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, on the ground that the defendant had not shown a request to the governor on the part of the President of the <em>United States; </em>but the objection was overruled by the judge, and the general orders read in evidence. The <em>advertisement </em>for the apprehension of the plaintiff and others was also read in evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AsB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>Thomas Bennet, </em>a witness for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGze\">testified, that hss was a Pr^\u2019ate \u2122 Captain <em>Lyon's </em>company, and it being inconvenient \u00a3or him to go on this tour of duty, the plaintiff, who came <em>Troy, </em>and expressed a willingness to go, agreed with the witness to go as his <em>substitute </em>for <em>thirty dollars </em>and a suit of uniform clothes; and Captain <em>Lyon </em>agreed to accept the plaintiff as a <em>substitute. </em>The plaintiff said his parents were willing that he should go; and on the morning the company marched the plaintiff\u2019s mother claimed his pay, and the witness advanced 20 dollars, and gave the plaintiff the suit of uniform clothes, and also gave his note for 10 dollars, payable to the plaintiff\u2019s father, which note was afterwards endorsed to one <em>Keeling, to </em>whom the witness paid it; that on the evening of the day the company marched, the father of the plaintiff said to the witness that he hoped his son would make a good soldier. Another witness testified that on the day Captain <em>Lyon's </em>company marched from <em>Troy, </em>he asked the plaintiff\u2019s father if he was willing that his son should go, and the father answered that \u201c his son was his own master, and might do as he had a mind.\u201d Other witnesses also testified to the assent of the father to the plaintiff\u2019s going, if he got his pay. This evidence the defendant\u2019s counsel insisted was a complete and conclusive bar to the action, and requested that the judge would so decide; but the judge charged the jury that the evidence given on the part of the defendant was not sufficient to bar the action; that if the plaintiff had been of a proper age it would have been a good defence ; but that the whole transaction was illegal on account of the plaintiff\u2019s infancy; that the plaintiff had a right to leave the company when he pleased; and any attempt to restrain him was illegal. The jury, under this direction, found a verdict for the plaintiff for thirty-five dollars. A <em>bill of exceptions </em>was tendered by the defendant\u2019s counsel to the opinion of the judge.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-4\"><em>J. Russell, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzMi\">contended that the plaintiff, having voluntarily enlisted, with the consent of his father, as a substitute, might be coerced to perform military duty. Though the militia laws declare that persons between the age of 18 and 45 years, shall be liable to military duty, and be enrolled in the militia, yet it nowhere prohibits persons under the age of 18 years from voluntarily entering and serving in the militia. No person can be compelled actually to perform military service, but may make his election \u2022 to enter, or pay a <em>fine </em>not exceeding one year\u2019s pay. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>When <em>entered, </em>and in service, the plaintiff was subject to the artic\u00edes of war. If a person, in consequence of his own voluntary act, sustains an injury, no action lies. <em>Volenti non fit </em>injuria.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-8\"><em>Foot </em>and <em>Paine, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As4\">A father has no power or authority over his son to compel him to enter the army or navy, or to perform any service that may endanger his life: nor can he, for the same reason, compel him to perform such a service for another person. This is not that kind of service to which a son may be bound with the assent of his father. The consent of the father, therefore, in this case, was idle and nugatory. The case, then, rests wholly on the contract made by the plaintiff, and as he was under age, his contract was voidable. He does not stand on the same ground as a person liable by law to perform military service. Here is a contract between the minor and the government, and the government stands in the same situation as any other person, in regard to a contract with a minor. Such a contract cannot be enforced. Again, the defendant was not an officer of the militia, and was bound to show a sufficient authority to apprehend the plaintiff. The order of the President of the <em>United Stales </em>ought to have been shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-10\">The officers in the army have no authority or discretion to take substitutes under 18 years of age; otherwise we might have an army of beardless boys.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b481-11\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A13N\">The decision of the judge was correct. An infant under 18 years of age is not liable to be enrolled in the militia. His agreement to serve as a substitute was not a contract binding upon him, and having renounced it and quitted the service, he could not be lawfully compelled to return. It would be against the settled principles of law to hold an infant to any contract or engagement not specially provided for by statute, or not made on account of necessaries. The militia service is not a duty required of an infant under 18, and if he is <em>not </em>bound by his contract he is not bound at all; for there was no binding act of the father in the case. The father had no authority to bind; nor did he, in fact, do it, in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">The motion by the defendant to set aside the verdict must, therefore, be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
