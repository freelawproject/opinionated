He proved that he ^ possession of the premises for seven or eight years, and had paid an annual rent to <em>Benjamin Birdsall, </em>who, during ^e same time, paid rent annually for the premises to the lessors of thfe plaintiff. The plaintiff'produced the following notice which had been served on <em>Birdsall </em>the 1st of <em>June, </em>1810, but who did not occupy any part of the premises. \u201c Mr. <em>Benjamin Birdsall, </em>Sir, I hereby give you notice to quit and deliver up to me the premises which you hold of mine, situated in the town of <em>Grainger, </em>in the county of <em>Columbia, </em>being the farm which is commonly known as the <em>Allen </em>farm, having once been in possession of <em>Isaac Allen, </em>and now occupied by <em>Daniel Baker, </em>on the first of <em>January </em>next, provided your tenancy commenced on the 1st <em>January, </em>otherwise, that you quit the possession at the expiration of the current year of your tenancy. <em>John S. </em>Livingston.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the sufficiency of this notice, but the judge overruled the objection, and, by his direction, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with leave to the defendant to move to set it aside, and a nonsuit to be entered, in case the court should be of opinion that the notice to quit was not sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">' A motion was made to set aside the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-12\"><em>Van Buren, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2vK\">contended, that the notice to quit ought to have been given to the defendant, who was the tenant in possession.

No rent was paid by <em>Baker </em>to <em>Livingston, </em>nor was there any privity between them. The cases cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel are those of a lessee and his assigns. The lessor, in the present case, has done no act whatever which could be considered as an admission of the defendant as his tenant,</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-11\">1 <em>Com.

So long as <em>Birdsall </em>paid him the rent, and he had not recognised any sub-lessee as tenant, he was not bound to look beyond <em>Birdsall, </em>nor to inquire whether the person in .actual possession was a tenant or servant to <em>Birdsall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The motion by the defendant to set aside the verdict is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
