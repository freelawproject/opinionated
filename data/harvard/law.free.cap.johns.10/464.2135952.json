The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>and <em>non actio accrevit infra sex annos. </em>The plaintiff replied that w'hen the cause of action accrued, the defendant was out of the state, <em>to wit, </em>at <em>Demorara, </em>and there resided until his return to this state, and the defendant brought his action within six years after such return of the defendant to this state; to this replication the defendant rejoined, and took issue thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Amlk\">** was proved, at the trial, that in <em>March, </em>1804, the defendant hired of the witness a farm at <em>New Rochelle, </em>in <em>West Chester </em>, . _ county, of which he took possession and occupied about two years, and the witness understood that the defendant had the preced3ng winter come to this country, with his family, from <em>Detnarara, </em>with intent to reside here. The witness, on his cross examination, said he had heard of the defendant\u2019s being in <em>West ^iesler </em>013 a visit in 1802 or 1803, but did not see him until he hired the farm in 1804. Another witness testified that both parties formerly resided in <em>Demorara ; </em>that it was about 8 years since the defendant returned ; that he saw him about two years before, about the year 1802, when he was here without his family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-12\">On the part of the defendant it was proved-that the defendant was here in <em>Mayj </em>1793, and staid about three months. Both parties came from <em>Demorara </em>to <em>New-Yark </em>in the same vessel. The defendant returned, but the plaintiff has resided here ever since. In 1802 the defendant again came here, and resided from <em>August </em>to <em>December, </em>having left his family in <em>Demorara, </em>and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>staid two days at the plaintiff\u2019s house. That in the autumn of $ 803, he returned here with his family, since which time he has continued to reside here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-3\">The suit was commenced the 9th <em>May, </em>1809. A verdict was 3alcen for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court on the ease above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-4\"><em>P. W. Radcliff, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AguM\">contended that the defendant\u2019s coming to this state in 1793 and 1802, in the manner stated in the case, was not such a \u201c return into this state\u201d as is contemplated by the proviso to the 5th section of the act, (sess. 24. c. 183.) and that the statute did not, therefore, begin to run against the plain-3 tiff\u2019s demand, until the defendant came to reside here, in Avgust3 1803. The return, within the meaning of the act, is not a secret casual, or temporary coming within the state, and by one who resided abroad. The only reasonable and convenient rule is, that the statute shall begin to run from the time the party returns with intent to reside,within the state. It is true, that the plaintiff knew the defendant was here in the summer of 1802, and might have arrested him. The defendant has the advantage of a strong case in point of fact, on which the court will settle the rule on principles of convenience and policy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-5\"><em>Wells, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A5H\">was; stopped by the court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b491-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AzW\">This is a clear case. The defendant was in the state in 1793 and in 1802, with the knowledge of the plaintiff, and in his company, and might have been arrested at the pleasure of the plaintiff. Either of those instances was 65 a return into this state,\u201d within the <em>proviso </em>to the 5th section of the statute of limitations, and sufficient to cause the statute to commence running against the plaintiff\u2019s demand. The word <em>return </em>applies as well to persons coming from abroad, where they had resided, as to citizens of this state going abroad for a temporary purpose, and then returning. <em>(Ruggles </em>v. <em>Keeler, </em>3 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>267.) The coming from abroad must not be clandestine, and with an intent to defraud the creditor by setting the statute in operation and then departing. It must be so public, and under such circumstances, as to give the creditor an opportunity, by the use of ordinary diligence and due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>m~ai~, of arresting the debtor. All that was done in this cas~ and the defendant is, accordingly, entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Judgment for the defendant. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\"> See <em>White v.
