Thomas Boalick, husband of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>fendant in trust for the sole and separate use of Theodora Boalick for life, and after her death in trust for the heirs of her body. The defendant became indebted to the plaintiff in 1903, and judgment was entered against the defendant in that year. The property was levied upon and the defendant took a rule to set aside the inquisition on the ground that she had only a life estate in the property. The court, however, found that she had an undivided one-third interest in it as the heir at law of her father, apart from the interest which she had under the deed. The court accordingly discharged the rule to set aside the inquisition. Subsequently the defendant took a rule to show cause why 1300 of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate should not be paid to. her by the sheriff. The plaintiff in the execution filed an answer denying the defendant\u2019s right to the exemption on the ground that she had attempted to conceal her property and defraud the plaintiff in her right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-4\">The court made absolute the rule for the debtor\u2019s exemption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court making absolute the rule for the debtor\u2019s exemption.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-6\"><em>C.

L. 533. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>The property levied on was real estate, and the appraisers determined against a division of it. Thereupon after the sale the defendant obtained a rule on the sheriff to pay to her the amount of the exemption allowed by the statute. The plaintiff filed an answer contesting her right to exemption on the ground that she had denied that she had any right, title or interest in the property levied on and that she had endeavored to cheat her creditors. The answer also set forth the title of the defendant to the property sold by the sheriff. No testimony was taken, and the case was disposed of by the court on the petition for the rule and answer. The regularity of the appraisement is not questioned, and the only matter for consideration. is whether the defendant has lost her right of exemption. It was the duty of the sheriff after notice from the debtor to cause the real estate to be appraised as provided by the third and fourth sections of the exemption act unless an express waiver or some other act of the defendant Was brought to his notice which clearly deprived the defendant of the right of exemption. The plaintiff might have moved to set aside the appraisement for the alleged reason that she had attempted to conceal her property and obstruct the collection of the debt which is an appropriate practice in such cases: Williamson v. Krumbhaar, 132 Pa. 455; but she chose rather to meet the question on the defendant\u2019s rule. In either proceeding the burden was on the plaintiff to show that exemption ought not to be allowed. If testimony were needed in support of any allegation made in denial of the defendant\u2019s right it was the duty of the plaintiff to produce it. There was nothing before the court which would have justified a decree against the defendant\u2019s claim. If we consider the plaintiff\u2019s case as supported by evidence, however, the act alleged was not fraudulent. The defendant\u2019s deed was a matter of record when the plaintiff\u2019s debt was created, and the latter had constructive notice at least of the character of the title. The contention of the defendant that the property was not subject to a levy because she was a cestui que trust merely was a question of law on which the judgment of the court was asked and given. But this was in no sense a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>concealment of her property, nor a fraud on the plaintiff. The benevolent provision of the exemption act is not to be withheld except for clear and substantial reasons shown to exist by him who would deny to a debtor its benefits, and such reasons have not been presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The decree is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
