The legislature cannot enlarge the jurisdiction of a constitutional court ; <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Kenfield, </em>57 Cal. 550; or vest in another court that jurisdiction which the Constitution has placed in one designated therein. <em>Zander </em>v. Coe, 5 Cal. 230; <em>Appeal of S. O. </em>Houghton, 42 Cal. 35; <em>Will of </em>Bowen, 34 Cal. 682; <em>Willis </em>v. Farley, 24 Cal. 490; <em>Wilson </em>v. Roach, 4 Cal. 362 ; <em>Rosenberg </em>v. Frank, 58 Cal. 387.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-5\">The Constitution has vested jurisdiction over partition proceeding's in the District Court as a court of equity by virtue of the grant of jurisdiction \u201c in all cases in equity \u201d where the remedy is sought in equity; and as a, court of law, under the jurisdiction given of all cases at law which involve the. title or possession of,real property.; where the remedy is sought in partition proceedings at law. This jurisdiction is thus vested because partition proceedings under the settled principles of our jurisprudence, in the light of which the Constitution speaks, are proceedings in equity or at law, and are cases in equity or at law according as the one forum or the other is sought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-6\">Actions at law for partition existed <em>at the common lavo </em>in the case of Parceners prior to the reign of Henry VIII, and in that reign the right to a writ of partition was given to tenants in common. 1 Washburn Eeal Prop. c. 13, \u00a7 7 ; 1 Spence Eq.

It could not be vested by the legislature, either as a concurrent or an exclusive jurisdiction in another court, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>authority to that effect was given expressly or by necessary implication by the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-5\">\u2019 The grant of probate jurisdiction is in these words: \u201c The county judges shall also hold in their several counties Probate Court, and perform such \u25a0 duties as probate judges as .may be prescribed by law.\u201d If partition jurisdiction is or may be vested in the Probate Court, it must be either because the last clause, \u201c as may be prescribed by law,\u201d empowers the legislature to impress a jurisdiction properly at law or in equity Avith a probate character, and thereupon vest it' in the Probate Court, or, in other words, to vest in the Probate Court other than strictly probate jurisdiction; or because probate jurisdiction, either as received from the English laAv or. as remodelled in America, includes a limited partition jurisdiction as a part and incident thereof. Neither position is tenable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-6\">In <em>Rosenberg </em>v. Frank, 58 Cal. 402, the court said: <em>\u201c </em>It seems from the above [Art. YI, \u00a7 8, Cal. Const.] that the legislature may make the jurisdiction of the probate judge or court what it pleases, within the limits of that jurisdiction which is understood as usually pertaining to Probate Courts. But the position that it ,can, under this power, take away from the District Courts any of the equity jurisdiction conferred on them by the Constitution, is manifestly untenable.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-7\">Similar clauses have been construed as not empowering the legislature to extend the powers of a Probate Court beyond the proper and established bounds of the established probate jurisdiction, as known to American and English jurisprudence. <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Higley, </em>20 Wall. 373; <em>Cast </em>v.

The construction is rational.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-9\">The conclusion is irresistible from the foregoing considerations, that \u00a7 8 of Ai\u2019t. YI authorizes the legislature to confer on the Probate Court <em>probate powers and jurisdiction </em>and those only. Unless the poAver to partition among heirs is a probate power, and the jurisdiction over partition proceedings is a part of the probate jurisdiction recognized in the Anglo-American jurisprudence, the provisions of. the statute and code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>for partition by the Probate Court were void, and the partition proceedings, under which the defendant in this action claims, were <em>coram non judice </em>and absolutely void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-5\">Partition is not a part of the probate jurisdiction derived from England and exercised in America lay Probate or Surrogate Courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-6\">The Probate' and Surrogate Courts in America are the lineal successors of the ecclesiastical courts of Great Britain. <em>Payne's </em>Will, 4_T. B. Mon. 423.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-7\">Our state constitutions recognize three civil jurisdictions, derived from the jurisprudence of England: law, equity and probate, and distribute them to the several tribunals. To the limits of these several jurisdictions, as exercised by the several judicatories of England, our courts look for the boundaries of the judications deposited by our organic laws in the several state courts. The jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts was exercised, with certain exceptions immaterial for the purpose of this head, over the personal estate only. Toller\u2019s Executors, 67, 80. The mere distribution or declaration of the rights of the next of kin to the undisposed-of residue in the case of intestacy, and the enforcement of the surrender by the administrator, an officer of the court, to the kin of that residue, was the extent of the power exercised by the ecclesiastical courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-8\">The partition of that residue was left to the voluntary action of the kin, or to their coerced action in obedience to the decree of- a court of law or equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-9\">Although there is a seeming appropriateness in the exercise of a limited power of partition by the Probate Court, and although on a superficial view, such a power appears to be analogous to, and a legitimate extension of the process of distribution, yet neither position is true. The inappropriateness of the exercise of such a power becomes more apparent when the incongruous and alien nature of that portion of the activity' of a Probate Court has been demonstrated and illustrated. Partition is not analogous to and is not a legitimate extension of the process of distribution. This proposition is based upon' the distinction between partition and probate proceedings in natures, object and operation. This distinction is twofold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>1. Briefly stated, the object of administration is not to enforce a remedial right, or to transfer property. Its exclusive purpose and operation is to manage the estate as in receivership for the payment of debts and to announce authoritatively a legal succession.. No proceeding of the former description properly belongs to administration. Partition involves an enforcement by the judicial decree of a remedial right and the motion of property rights <em>inter vivos.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-5\">2. Administration has exclusively to do with rights which spring from the succession, <em>i.e., </em>out of the fact and process of inheritance. When the Probate Court deals with other rights, it departs from its legitimate conventional and customary sphere, and overleaps the boundaries of its jurisdiction. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-6\">This character of the probate jurisdiction runs through the entire Anglo-American j urisprudence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-7\">The jurisdiction is a jurisdiction of management over an undisputed fund in the custody of the court for administration purposes, \u2014 to wit, for the payment of debts and for the support of the family during administration. The moment activities diverging from this narrow thread of function are required, the domain of a diverse jurisdiction, not a jurisdiction of management but a remedial jurisdiction, must be entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-8\">The Probate Court can appoint an executor or administrator, and direct him, by successive orders extending to' the close of the administration, to collect assets, to sell property, to pay debts, to apply so much pf the funds in his -hands as shall be necessary to defray funeral expenses and to support the family and to protect the fund, and finally direct him to deliver so much of the funds as shall be necessary in satisfaction of legacies and to surrender the residue to the heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-9\">All activities outside this narrow channel, bounded in the beginning by the death and at the end by the distribution, and laterally by the limits of management, belong to law or equity. And the test of the new province, and of the externality from :the terminal or lateral boundaries of the probate jurisdiction, is the question whether-those activities involve adversary litigation involving remedial rights and issuing in judgments enforcing such rights by the transfer of property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The proceedings in a Probate Court, preceding distribution, are not in any particular adversary proceedings, involving the assertion of a remedial right, and issuing in a judgment accomplishing a transfer of property rights. The decree of distribution is equally devoid of that character. It neither gives, creates, nor transfers any rights of property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-5\">The proceedings resulting in the decree, are in the nature of an inquisition to ascertain who are the persons upon whom the law has cast the succession and to what interests. The decree, when pronounced, is simply declaratory. It announces what rights were given at the death by the law, and to whom: It is a declaration which concludes all parties to the proceeding. But it does not purport, and in theory of law does not create or transfer any rights. If in practice it thus operates, it is in consequence of error in the exercise of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-6\">Partition, on the contrary, is essentially an adversary proceeding in which a remedial right to the transfer of property is asserted, and a proceeding issuing in a judgment amoving or transferring that property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-7\">Where partition by judicial proceedings is had between two tenants in common, an interchange of property rights is accomplished by the judgment. The right of possession to one moiety of the lands by metes and bounds is. divested from one tenant and transferred to the other. He is compelled to accept, as a substitute, the right of possession theretofore belonging to the other tenant to the moiety by metes and bounds assigned to him. The property of which he is divested is the title and right of possession of a tract of land awarded to the other, together with the incident rights, the right of entry, the right of user, the right to maintain trespass, etc. The proceeding is strictly analogous to a proceeding in equity, to compel the specific performance of a contract to exchange land. The contract of exchange being established, the law gives a remedial right to each party to the reciprocal exchange of the titles and rights of possession of the respective parcels of land. The judgment <em>ex projprio vigore </em>(under the laws of some States), or as executed, accomplishes the transfer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-8\">In partition, the fact of the tenancy being established, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>law gives a remedial right to the reciprocal exchange of the right of possession with the incident rights, to several distinct, moieties of the entire tract and of the title to undivided moieties of such moieties. The judgment accomplishes the change.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-5\">But there are two matters of law which establish beyond possible question or cavil, that in partition, property consisting both of title and right of possession is and must be transferred by the judgment in possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-6\">(1) This results from the fact that at common law partition could not be accomplished without the transfer of an estate by the voluntary act of the parties. And the judicial proceeding is a compulsory transfer by and through the judgment of a court, substituted for the voluntary process by the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-7\">(2) That partition involves the transfer of an estate or property is evidenced by the theory and foundation of the proceeding in equity to compel the specific performance of a parol partition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-8\">The statute of frauds is satisfied by the part performance accomplished by the actual severance of possession. Equity will treat each tenant as possessed of the legal title to one-half of his allotment and of the equitable title to the other half of the same, and will compel a conveyance by the cotenant. This proceeds exclusively on the theory that each tenant in common can have a title to one-half only, of any specified parcel of the whole tract, and can only acquire the other half through the medium of a conveyance. Freeman Cotenantry and Partition, \u00a7 402 and cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-9\">Administration has exclusively to do with rights which spring out of the fact of succession. When it deals with other rights, it departs from its legitimate, conventional and customary sphere.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-10\">. Partition deals with a remedial right springing -out of the mature of the property and attaching thereto under a law other than that of succession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-11\">, The exercise of a power of partition by the Probate Court is in no sense appropriate. It is an incongruous and alien activity as established by the foregoing discussion. It is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>inappropriate by reason of tbe inadequate powers of that court. The Probate Court can only partition the legal in-, terest cast. It can determine no other title. It cannot adjust, as can equity, the equities between the parties; making provisions for liens and incumbrances and variant values in different parcels of the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-5\">The Probate Court exercises, under our law, more extensive \u25a0 powers in the administration of estates than did the ecclesiastical courts of England. For instance; American courts, under statute authority, take jurisdiction of wills of real estate, and in all cases, whether of testacy Or intestacy, land is assets to be administered upon. Yet no such powers were exercised by the ecclesiastical courts. .American courts render .decrees of distribution in cases of testacy as well as of intestacy, yet the ecclesiastical courts could render no such decree except in case of intestacy. The American Probate Courts exercise also, by authority of statute, more enlarged powers in the direction and control of executors and administrators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-6\">In none of these cases is more done by the legislature than to grant to a tribunal, whose powers ar\u00bf strictly dependent upon statute, more extended powers within its legitimate do-. main. So long as the powers granted consist in nothing more than powers over its officers and the estate in its custody for administration, or in powers to announce judicially the course of succession, the bounds of its legitimate jurisdiction are not passed. The moment the court is given power to entertain proceedings to enforce remedial rights, and to render judgments amoving, or, when executed, accomplishing the amotion of property, that moment the boundaries of its jurisdiction are passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-7\">Wherever partition powers are or have been exercised by Probate Courts, in the United States, it has been by express authority of statute and as an alien power in the Probate Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-8\">Had a limited partition power been generally exercised by Probate Courts in the United States, as an incident of distribution in the absence of statutory authorization, this fact might warrant the inference, that in the opinion of the bench and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>bar of America, such power belonged to the immemorial probate jurisdiction. But where the power is exclusively statutory and so recognized wherever exercised, the fact of its exercise has no tendency to establish that it is a legitimate part of probate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-4\">The power exercised by Probate Courts to partition, wherever it exists is based on statute.

Of course, if the court has jurisdiction of the proceedings and the persons, whether it be a court of inferior or general jurisdiction, the decision of the Probate Court is conclusive except on appeal. The cases cited on behalf of the defendant in error all proceed on the assumption that the Probate Court had jurisdiction in the States in question, and the presumption was correct. In this case and in California the contention is that the Probate Court had no jurisdiction; that the proceedings were absolutely void and not merely voidable; and it is an elementary principle that such proceedings are nullities and subject to collateral as well as direct attack.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>In the absence of a constitutional distribution of jurisdictions, and in the absence of an express or necessarily implied prohibition, it is beyond doubt, that the legislature can vest a particular jurisdiction in any court it may appoint. For the purpose, therefore, of determining the constitutionality of the California statute, a distinction must be taken between the decisions of those States where such constitutional distributions of jurisdictions and prohibitions exist and of those States where they do not. The legislation, practice, and decisions of the latter must be laid aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-3\">It is argued that the statute simply brings into this State the practice .and usage in the matter of partition by Probate Courts which generally prevail in other States. It is urged by inference that the constitution, in providing probate jurisdiction in the Probate Court, contemplated that jurisdiction, not in its purity and simplicity as derived from. Great Britain, but as amplified in America. It is supposed that the jurisdiction in question has been remodelled in America by the practice of the States,-and partition power incorporated into it, and that the state constitution speaks with reference to that American probate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-4\">But to adopt such a principle is to violate all the rules of construction to enable the significance of constitutional provisions to vary with variable custom, and to enable a judicial remodel-ling, according to the whim of the times, of our constitutions, destructive of the rigidity and integrity of our constitutional framework of government. It is not true that there is an American probate jurisdiction different in essential quality and nature from that of the courts of administration of England.

It is contended that its control over the estate ceased when it approved the final settlement, and, by a decree of distribution, defined the nature and-extent of the interests of the heirs in the remaining estate of the decedent. A partition severing the unity of' possession among the heirs, and investing each with a right, as against the others, to the exclusive possession and ownership of distinct parts of the. estate, could not, it is insisted, have been constitutionally effected by proceedings in a Probate Court. These questions have received the most careful consideration, as well because of their intrinsic importance, as because their determination by this court, as we are informed by counsel, may seriously affect the title to large bodies of land in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Tracing the course of legislation in California in reference to the jurisdiction and powers of the Probate Courts of that State, we find that the first statute upon the subject is that of April 22, 1850, entitled \u201c An Act to regulate the Settlement of the Estates of Deceased Persons.\u201d Stat. California, 1850-53, c. 129, p. 377. Another statute was passed May 1, 1851, having a similar title, and covering the same subject. Compiled Laws California 1850, c. 120, pp. 377 to 423. The provisions of these statutes relating to proceedings in the Probate Courts' for the filial settlement, distribution, and partition of estates were continued, without material change, and the powers of those courts enlarged, by the Code of Civil Procedure. The sections of the code bearing upon the question of the jurisdiction and powers of those courts are too numerous to be incorporated in this opinion. It is sufficient to say that upon a careful examination of them, we are of opinion that it was the intention of the legislature to invest Probate Courts with authority, in connection with, and as ancillary or supplementary to, the settlement and distribution of estates, to make partition of real property \u2014 where the title of the deceased owner and the heirship of the parties are undisputed \u2014 so as to invest each heir with a separate title to the particular-part or parts allotted to him by the decree of partition. No other interpretation is consistent With the words of the Gode. \u00a7\u00a7 1581,1634, 1665, 1666, 1668, 1675, 1676 to 1686, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Does the state constitution prohibit -the partition of real estate by proceedings in a Probate Court ?

Const, of 1849, amended in 1862, Art. Y\u00cd, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9. The Supreme Court is invested with appellate jurisdiction in all cases in equity; in all cases at law involving the title or possession of real estate, or the legality of any tax, impost, assessment, toll or municipal fine, or in which the demand, exclusive of interest, or the value of the property in controversy, amounts to three hundred dollars; in all cases arising in the Probate Courts; and in all criminal cases amounting to felony, on questions of law. It also has \u201cpower to issue writs of mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, and <em>habeas </em>corpus, and also all writs necessary or proper to the complete exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The constitution of 1849 provided that the District Courts \u201c shall have original jurisdiction in law and equity in all civil cases where the amount in dispute exceeds two hundred dollars, exclusive of interest. In all criminal cases not otherwise provided for, and in all issues, .of fact joined in the Probate Courts, their jurisdiction shall be unlimited.\u201d Const. 1849, Art. YI, \u00a7 6. But in 1862 the constitution was amended, and in lieu of that section the following was substituted: \u201c The District. Courts shall have original jurisdiction in all cases in equity; also, in all cases at law which involve the title or possession of real property, or the legality of any tax, impost, assessment, toll, or municipal fine, and in all other cases in which the demand, exclusive of interest or the . value of the property in controversy, amounts to three hundred dollars; and also in all criminal cases n'ot otherwise provided for. The District Courts -and-their, judges shall have power to issue writs of <em>habeas </em>corpus, on petition by or on .behalf of any person held in actual custody, in their respective districts.\u201d Const. \u00cd862, Art. YI, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u25a0 The constitution of 1849, also, provided for the election of a county judge in each organized county, who \u201cshall'hold the County Court, and perf orm the -duties of surrogate or probate judge,\u201d and, with two justices of the'peace, \u201c shall hold Courts of Sessions, with such criminal jurisdiction as the legislature fehall prescribe; and he shall perform-such other .duties as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>shall be required by law.\u201d It was further provided that <em>\u201c </em>the County Courts shall have such jurisdiction in cases arising in justices\u2019 courts, and in special cases, as the legislature may prescribe, but shall have no original civil jurisdiction except in such special cases.\u201d Const. 1849, Art. YI, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9. But by the amendments of 1862 the powers and jurisdiction of County Courts were greatly enlarged, as will be seen from-the following section adopted in lieu of those just cited: \u201c Section 8. The County Courts shall have original jurisdiction of actions of forcible entry and detainer, of proceedings in insolvency, of actions to prevent or abate a nuisance, and of all such special cases and proceedings as are not otherwise provided for; and also such criminal jurisdiction as the legislature may prescribe ; they shall also have appellate jurisdiction in all cases arising in courts held by justices of. the peace and recorders, and in such inferior courts as may be established in pursuano\u00e9 of section one of this article, in their respective counties. The county judges shall also hold in their several counties Probate Courts, and perform such duties as probate, judges as may be \u2022 prescribed by law. The county courts and their judges shall also have power to issue writs of <em>habeas </em>corpus, on petition by or on behalf of any person in actual custody in their respective cpunties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The argument in behalf of the plaintiffs, briefly stated, is, that the legislature bould not confer upon County Courts jurisdiction of suits or matters of which original jurisdiction' is given by the constitution to District Courts; that whether a proceeding for partition be regarded as a case in equity, or a case at law involving the title or possession of real property, it is within the original, and, therefore, exclusive jurisdiction of a District Court; and that the provision..requiring county judges to hold \u201c Probate Courts,\u201d \u201c and perform such duties as probate judges as may be prescribed by law,\u201d did not authorize the legislature to invest Probate Courts with \u2022jurisdiction, concurrent with District Courts, in cases of which the latter were, by express words, given original jurisdiction. It must be confessed that some support for this position is found in the general language employed in <em>Zander </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>California, 230, <em>People </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>9 California, 85, and <em>Caulfield v. </em>Stevens, 28 California, 118. In <em>Zander </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>the court proceeded upon the ground that' the legislature could not confer on one court the functions and powers which had been conferred by the constitution upon another court. In <em>People </em>v. Fowler, 9 California, 85 \u2014 where the question was as to the constitutionality of a statute giving an appeal to the Court of Sessions from a judgment in a criminal case tried in a justice\u2019s court \u2014 the court, referring to <em>Zander </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>and previous cases, said: \u201c The rule of construction established by these decisions is this : That when certain powers are, in <em>form affirmatively, </em>bestowed upon certain courts, they are still <em>exolusi/ve, </em>unless there be some exception specified in the constitution itself, or the power to prescribe the cases to which the jurisdiction should extend be expressly given to the legislature. For example : there is affirmatively conferred upon the' District Courts certain original jurisdiction in civil cases, and ' there is no specified exception stated, and no power expressly given to the legislature either to limit or increase this jurisdiction ; therefore it is, as to the class of cases enumerated, <em>exclusive.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"AF3\">In <em>Caulfield </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>28 California, 118, the court declared to be unconstitutional an act empowering justices of \u2022 the peace to try actions- for forcible entry, or forcible or unlawful detainer. Its validity was attempted to be maintained under the general grant to the- legislature of power to fix by law the \u201c powers, duties, and -responsibilities \u201d of justices of the peace. Const. 1862, Art. VI, \u00a7 9. But the court held that the subject\" of forcible entries and of forcible and unlawful detainers was expressly committed by the-constitution to County Courts, and that the act there in question was unconstitutional. Whether the court had in. view the rule of constitutional construction announced in <em>Zander </em>v. <em>Coe </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>it is impossible to say; for no reference is made to either case. As pointed out in <em>Courtwright </em>v. <em>Bear River &amp;c. Mining Co., </em>30. California, 573, the decision in <em>Caulfield </em>v. <em>Stevens </em>went beyond what was necessary to be decided; it might have been rested entirely upon the ground that the constitution in terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>invested County Courts, declared to be courts of record, with original jurisdiction of actions of forcible entry and detainer, and the authority of the legislature to fix by -law the powers, duties, and responsibilities of justices of the peace was burdened with the condition that \u201c such powers shall not, in any case, trench upon the jurisdiction of the ' several courts of record.\u201d Section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Prior to <em>Caulfield </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>there were two decisions in the state court which seem to rest upon a different rule of constitutional construction, <em>Estate of De Castro </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>18 California, 96, and <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>26 California, 372, 382. The first one was a suit for partition. It was brought in a Probate Court under \u00a7 264 of the Probate Act of 1851, (Compiled Laws of California, 1850-3, p. 415,) providing that \u201cpartition of the real estate may be made as provided in this chapter, although some of the original heirs or devisees may have conveyed their shares to other persons, and such shares shall be assigned to the person holding the same, in the same manner as they otherwise should have been to such heirs or devisees.\u201d That section \u2014 the words \u201cor distribution\u201d being added after \u201cpartition,\u201d and \u201clegatees'\u201d after \u201cheirs\u201d \u2014 is incorporated into the Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 1678. In that case the point was made that the Probate Court had no jurisdiction, because the petitioners were not heirs or devisees, and, therefore, not entitled to sue in the form adopted. But the jurisdiction of the Probate Court was sustained, on the ground that the statute placed alienees upon the same footing as the original heirs or devisees. While the authority of the Probate Court was not assailed upon the ground now asser|ed \u2014-namely, that the court could not, under-the Constitution, entertain jurisdiction of a suit for partition \u2014 that question-was necessarily involved in the case; and the decree, which, was affirmed, should have been reversed, if it be true that the jurisdiction of the Probate Court, in cases of partition, could not be made concurrent with that of the District Courts. In <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>the question was as to the jurisdiction of District Courts, under the State Constitution as amende'd in 1862, in cases of mandamus. It was contended that the. Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Court alone could issue a writ of mandamus, because upon that court had been conferred, in terms, power \u201c <em>to </em>issue writs of mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, and habeas corpus, and also all writs necessary or proper to the complete exercise of its appellate jurisdiction,\u201d while no such power was expressly, conferred upon the District Courts. It was decided that although the Supreme Court had been invested, in terms, with original jurisdiction in cases of mandamus, the District Courts had the same power, in respect to that species of remedy, by virtue of the general grant to them of jurisdiction in all civil cases in equity and in certain specifiechcases/at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">But the dullest discussion as to the general question is to be found in <em>Courtwrigth </em>v. <em>Bear River, &amp;c. Mining Co., </em>above cited. The principal point .there was, whether a District' Court could take jurisdiction of an action in equity to. abate \u201da nuisance. The latter court .held that it could not, for the reason that original jurisdiction of an action to prevent or abate a-nuisance is expressly granted to County Courts. Art. VI, \u00a7 8. But it was adjudged by the Supreme Court of the State that .the jurisdiction of County' Courts of such actions^, Avas only concurrent Avith <em>thp/t </em>of District Courts \u2014 the lat\u00e9r having original jurisdiction of suits to abate nuisances under the general grant to them of jurisdiction in cases in equity. It was held, that while the Constitution expressly provides that the powers conferred upon justices of the peace \u201cshall not. in any case trench upon the jurisdiction of the several courts of record\u201d \u2014 thereby indicating that the jurisdiction conferred upon the several courts of record ..should be exclusive as against justices of the peace \u2014 rno analogous provision was made as between the courts of record; and that, consequently, the Constitution did not forbid the Legislature from investing eourts of record of the - same order and grade with equal authority over any given cause or subject-matter of .litigation. The court, also, said that \u201c the cases are numerous which stand opposed to or are inconsistent with the idea of the complete distribution by the Constitution of judicial power among the several courts, and of their exclusiAre jurisdiction' of all the subject-matters committed to them.\u201d \u2022 \u201c There are many mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ters,\u201d it observed, by way of illustration, \u201c that we need not pause to specify, that would usually and properly pertain to the court exercising probate powers, as involved in the settlement of the estates of deceased. persons,- that may form the subject-matters of suits in equity and be properly litigated \u00a1 iri the District Court.\u201d It referred to <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Ames </em>as sustain^' ing the theory of concurrent jurisdiction, and pronounced that doctrine to be correct. It further said that the <em>dietum </em>in <em>Caulfield </em>v. <em>Stevens </em>must yield to the decision in <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Ames.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The doctrine of this case, upon the question of the concur-' rent jurisdiction of District and Probate Courts of actions in equity to abate nuisances, was reaffirmed in <em>Yolo County </em>v. <em>City of </em>Sacramento, 36 California, 193, 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The latest decision in the state court, to which our attention is called, which bears directly on the question of jurisdiction^ is <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>58 California, 387, 402. In that case will be found some material qualification of the general language used in previous cases. That was a suit in equity, brought by executors in a District Court, for the purpose of obtaining a construction of a will. It was suggested that the' Probate Court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the cause, and that its jurisdiction was, for that reason, exclusive. The court, adhering to the rule announced in the <em>P\u00f3urtmright </em>case, held the authority of the District Court to be ample and plenary, under the grant to it of original jurisdiction in cases in equity. After stating that the jurisdiction of Probate Courts is not defined in the Constitution, and referring to the provision that county. judges shall \u201c perform such duties as probate judges as may be prescribed by law,\u201d the court said.: \u201cIt seems from the above that the legislature may make the. jurisdiction of the probate judge or court what it pleases,, within the limits of that jurisdiction which is understood as \u2022usually pertaining to Probate Courts.\u201d As late as <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>De Couts, </em>70 California, 361, 371, the court said:-\u201cBoth Burroughs and Seamens are estopped by the decree of parti\u25a0tion in probate from setting up title derived from Soto adverse to that of their co-tenants .under the same title\u201d \u2014citing.Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>of-Civil Procedure, \u00a7 1908 ; Freeman on Cotenancy and Partition, \u00a7 530-32; and Freeman on Judgments, \u00a7 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Whether it is to be fairly deduced from the broad language in previous decisions, that the legislature may confer upon Probate Courts concurrent jurisdiction as to every matter embraced within the grant of original jurisdiction to the District Courts, is a question which need not be now decided. It is-only necessary-to accept the decision in <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>as furnishing the constitutional test for determining the extent of' the jurisdiction with which the Probate Courts of California may be endowed. The question, therefore, is, whether, after the final settlement of the accounts of a personal representative, and after a decree of distribution, defining the undivided interests of heirs in real estate in the hands of such representative \u2014 neither the title of the d\u00e9cedent nor the fact of heirship being disputed \u2014 the partition of such estate among the heirs, so as to invest them, separately, with the-exclusive possession and ownership, as against co-heirs, of distinct parcels of such realty, is - a subject-matter which may be committed to Probate Courts according to the jurisdiction usually pertaining to those tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We lay aside, as not open to dispute, the proposition that there is a difference between distribution and partition. And \u2022we are satisfied that that' difference was in the mind of -the legislature when it passed the original Probate Act, as well as- when the Code of Civil Procedure was adopted. As' correctly observed by counsel, distribution neither gives a new title to property, nor transfers a distinct right in the estate of the deceased owner, but is simply declaratory as to the persons upon whom the law casts the succession, and the extent of their respective interests; while partition, in most, if not in all, of its aspects, is an~adversary proceeding, in which- a remedial right to the transfer of property is asserted, and resulting in a decree which, either <em>ex proprio vigore </em>or as executed, accomplishes such transfer. But this difference is not sufficient in itself,' to solve the inquiry as to whether partition is sofar alien to the probate system, as recognized by the Constitution of California, that the power to make it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>not be conferred upon Probate Courts; for, according to the .doctrine of <em>Rosenberg </em>v. Frank, those tribunals may exercise whatever powers the legislature may, in its discretion, confer upon them, within the limits of such jurisdiction as usually, pertains to Probate. Courts. If, at the time the Constitution of California was. adopted, the partition, by Probate Courts, among the heirs of a decedent, of undivided real estate, was unknown in the jurisprudence of this country, there would be ground, under the doctrine of <em>Rosenberg </em>v. Fro/nk, to contend that no such jurisdiction could be conferred upon Probate Courts in that, State. . But such is not the case. In a large number of the States, as the citations by counsel of statutes and decisions show, Probate Courts were, and are, inv\u00e9sted with power to make partition, among heirs or.devise\u00e9s, of estates coming within their cognizance for settlement and distribution. 1 Washburn\u2019s Beal Property, 718, Bk. I, c. 13, \u00a7 7: Freeman\u2019s Cotenancy and Partition, \u00a7 550, 2d ed. The significance of this fact is not materially weakened by the circumstance that, generally, where the power of partition is or has been exercised in this country by Probate Courts, it has been by express authority of statutes which were not forbidden by constitutional provisions. The existence of such statutes, in many of the States, precludes the idea, so strongly pressed by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, that, when the Constitution of California was adopted, partition Avas foreign to the probate system, as administered in this counfry. Such legislation, we-suppose, has its origin in the belief that it is convenient, if not deshabite, for all concerned in the estate of a decedent, that the same court, which supervises the final settlement of the accounts of a personal representative, and ascertains and declares the interests of heirs in such estate as may remain after the demands of creditors are satisfied, should have the power to make partition. We are not prepared to Say that this belief is not well grounded. The connection between the administration, settlement, distribution, and partition of an estate is such, that the power to make partition may be justly regarded as ancillary to the power to distribute such estate, and, therefore, not alien to the probate system as it has long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>existed and now exists in many States. For the reasons stated, and in view, of the recent decisions of the highest court of California, we do not feel at liberty to hold that the legislature -could not constitutionally invest Probate Courts with jurisdiction to make partition of an undiyided estate among the heirs at law of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">, It is proper, in this connection, to say that there is nothing-in <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Higley, </em>20 Wall. 375, 382, upon which the plaintiffs rely,, to show that partition is foreign to the probate system, as administered in this country. The decision there was, that, in view of the organic act of Utah, which did not define the jurisdiction of - the Probate Courts, and in view of- the distribution by that act of judicial power among the various courts of that Territory, the jurisdiction of Probate Courts must be determined with reference to the .general nature and character of the latter tribunals as recognized in our system of .jurisprudence. An act of the territorial legislature, giving. ^Probate Courts \u201coriginal jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, and -as well in chancery as at common law, when not prohibited by legislative enactment,\u201d was, therefore, held to bp unconstitutional. So far from the doctrines of that case mili-, tating against the decision of the. Supreme Court of California in <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>it was said in <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Higley </em>to be the almost uniform rule among the people who make' the common law of England the -basis of their jurisprudence, to have a distinct tribunal for the establishment of wills and the admiilistration of the estates of men dying either with - or without wills- \u2014 which tribunals are \u201cvariously called Prerogative Courts, Probate Courts, Surrogate Courts, Orphans\u2019 Courts, &amp;c.;\u201d and that .to these functions \u201chave occasionally -been added the guardianship of infants, and control of their property, the allotment of dower, and perhaps other powers related more or-less to the same general subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u25a0 It remains to consider .whether the decree of partition is void upon grounds other- than those- relating to the constitutionality of the statute under which the. Probate Court proceeded. The Circuit Court of the United States had no jurisdiction to set aside that-decree, merely upon the ground of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>error, nor could it refuse to give it full effect, unless the Probate Court was without jurisdiction of the case. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>10 Wall. 308, 315; <em>Cunn </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>94 U.

And in determining the question of. jurisdiction, it must be remembered that Probate Courts of California have had for many years the rank of courts of general jurisdiction, and, as said in <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>De Couts, </em>70 California, 361, 372, their proceedings, \u201cwithin the jurisdiction conferred upon them by the law, are to be construed in the same manner and with the like intendments as the proceedings of courts of general jurisdiction, and their judgments have like force and effect as judgments of the District Courts.\u201d' Probate Courts being, then, courts of superior jurisdiction, in respect to the settlement, distribution, and partition of estates \u25a0 coming within their cognizance, the recitals in the decree of partition unless contradicted by the record, will be presumed to be correct, and every intendment will be indulged jn its. support. ' <em>Settlemier </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>97 U. S. 444, 449; <em>Cheely </em>v. <em>Clayton, </em>110 U. S. 701, 708. With these preliminary observa^, tions as to the effect to be given to the decree and its recitals, where the decree is attacked in a collateral suit, we proceed to examine such of the objections to its validity as we deem of sufficient importance' to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">1. It is contended that the administratrix, as such, had no interest in the partition of the decedent\u2019s estate, and could not, in that capacity, initiate proceedings th\u00e9refor. Too much stress is laid upon the circumstance that the petition in the Probate Court was signed by Mrs. Hawes, as \u201c administratrix.\u201d The petition seeks something more than a final settlement of her accounts, and a declaration of the interests of the heirs in the undistributed estate. It embraces also her claim as widow and heir, to a share in the estate remaining after the payment of debts and charges, and contains a distinct prayer that parti-. tion be had between herself and the children. It shows, as do the orders preceding the decree of partition, that she sought, a settlement of her accounts as administratrix, and a final adjudication of her rights as heir at law in the estate ro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>maining in her hands. If it would have been better practice to have made partition the subject of a suit entirely separate from the proceeding'for settlement and distribution, the blending of final settlement, distribution, and partition in the same petition, or in one suit, did not defeat the jurisdiction of the court or render its decree of partition void.- The record shows that the question of partition Avas not considered or determined in the Probate Court until after it had made'its decree of final settlement and distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">2. It is contended that proper notice was not given to the minor children of the proceedings in the Probate Court. This point is not sustained ,by the record of those proceedings. The.decree of distribution recites, that it appeared to the satisfaction of the court that due and sufficient notice of the time and place of hearing the petition had been duly given, as required by law, prior to the day set for hearing, and that the attorney appointed by the court to represent the minor children appeared at the hearing. It is also shoAvn that this attorney Avas present at every step of the proceedings for partition. The decree for partition recites that it appeared to the satisfaction of the court that the commissioner appointed to make partition \u201cgave notice to all parties interested, in all respects as prescribed by the statute in such cases.\u201d These recitals are not contradicted by anything in the record, unless it be that representation of the minor children in the proceedings for settlement, distribution, and partition, by an attorney appointed by the .court, rather than by a guardian <em>.ad </em>litem, was wholly inadequate to bring them into court. It is to be remembered that the Civil Code expressly provides, that notice of proceedings for partition may be \u201c either personally or by public notice, as the Probate Court may direct,\u201d \u00a7 1676; and if the account presented by the personal representative be one for final settlement, and the estate be ready for distribution, \u201c on confirmation of the final account, distribution, and partition of the estate to all entitled thereto, may be immediately had, without further notice or proceedings.\u201d \u00a7 1634. It should also be observed that if the recitals, in the decrees of distribution and partition, of due notice, be open to. dispute in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>this collateral proceeding, it does not appear that the publica- \u25a0 tion was not made, in all respects, as required by the order of court, and by the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u2022 In this connection it is insisted that the particular mode adopted in publishing notice of the proceedings for settlement, distribution, and partition, was not sufficient, in law, to give the court jurisdiction as to the children. This position is not tenable. The order to show cause why there should not be a final settlement and distribution, followed by a partition, according to the rights of the parties, was very full and explicit; and it was served in one of the modes by which, under the local law, jurisdiction could be acquired. The mode adopted was by publication for \u201c four successive weeks in such newspaper in the county as the court or judge shall direct.\u201d \u00a7 1539. <em>Pearson </em>v. Pearson, 46 California, 609, 635. The failure to repeat, in the order, the names of the minor children \u2014 what-' ever force that objection might have had upon a direct appeal from the decree of partition \u2014 is not a matter affecting the-jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter and' the parties ; for, the petition, and the order appointing an attorney to represent the minors, contained the names in full of all interested in the proceedings for settlement, distribution, and partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">3. It is, however, insisted that the defence for the minor children \u2014 who are not shown to have had, at the time, any general or special guardian in the county or State \u2014 could only have been conducted by a guardian, and that the appearance in their behalf by an attorney, appointed by the court to represent them, did not bring them into court. This position is based upon \u00a7\u00a7 372 and 373 of the Code of Civil Procedure. But those sections, in our opinion, have reference, to civil actions as distinguished from \u201cspecial proceedings.\u201d Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 20 to 23; 372-3. A suit for partition, in a Probate Court, is a special proceeding, <em>Waterman </em>v. Lawrence, 19 California, 210, 218; and the section which controls the determination of this question is \u00a7 1718, part of Title XI, relating' to \u201cProceedings in Probate Courts.\u201d That section, among other things, provides that \u201c at or before the' hearing of peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tions and \u25a0 contests for the probate of wills; for letters- testam\u00e9ntary or of administration; for sales of real estate and confirmations thereof; settlements, partitions, and distributions of estates; setting apart homesteads; and all other proceedings where all the parties interested in the estate are required to be notified' thereof, the court must appoint some competent attorney at law to represent, in all such proceedings, the devisees, -legatees, heirs, or creditors of the decedent, who are minors and have no general guardian in the county, or who are non-residents of the State; and may, if he deem it necessary, appoint an attorney to represent those interested, who though they are neither such minors or non-residents, are unrepresented. The order must specify the names of the parties for whom the attorney is appointed, who is thereby authorized to represent such parties in .all such proceedings had subsequent to. his appointment. The appearance of the attorney is 'sufficient proof of the service of the notice on the parties he is appointed to represent.\u201d \u00a5e have not been able to find any .provision .requiring the appointment of guardians <em>ad litem </em>in probate proceedings. . \"Without considering whether the failure to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for minors, where the statute requires it to be done, would vitiate the decree, and make it open- to attack collaterally, it is sufficient to say that the appointment of an attorney to represent the children in the Probate. Court was authorized by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AP7\">These-.views are in conformity with the recent decision in <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Superior Court of San Joaquin </em>County, decided April 21, 1888, and not yet reported. One of the questions there was as to the validity of certain proceedings for the probate of a will, in which minor heirs were represented by an attorney, appointed by.the court, and not by a guardian <em>ad litem. </em>Reliance was placed upon the section of the Civil Code, \u00a7 372, part of the title \u201cParties to-Civil Actions,\u201d which provides that \u201c when an infant is a party he must appear by his general guardian, if he has one; and if not,- by a guardian who may be appointed by the court, in which the action is prosecuted, or by a judge thereof, or a county judge.\u201d. It was held that probate proceedings were not civil actions within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the meaning of that title. The court said, \u201c The thing which a guardian <em>ad litem </em>is appointed to do' is, to \u2018represent\u2019 the infant in the action or proceeding, Code Civil Procedure \u00a7 372, by which we understand that he is to conduct and control the proceedings on behalf of the infant. Now the attorney for minors in probate proceedings is to \u2018represent\u2019 the minor, Code Civil Procedure \u00a7 1718, and so far as he is concerned, to conduct and control the proceedings; so that if the general provisions apply it would be possible- to have two representatives of the minor in the same contest, neither of whom would be subordinate to the other. We do not think that such a result could have been intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">There are no other questions in the case which we deem it necessary to discuss. We find no error in the judgment below,-- and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-6\">Me.
