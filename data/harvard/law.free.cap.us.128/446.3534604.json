On the 4th of October, 1884, he addressed a communication to the city council, referring to the fact that the contract between him and the city \u201cfor twenty-thr\u00e9e electric lights for street purposes\u201d would expire on the 1st of November, and asking prompt -action as.to whether it would be renewed by the city, or whether additional lights would be taken. He further said in his communication: \u201c Having incurred very heavy expense' in bringing extra machinery here, and having to pay a heavy rental for the additional dynamo required for the city purposes, it becomes absolutely necessary that your decision should be rendered as early as possible, so. that in the event of your declension to renew the contract I may be able to take down, pack and deliver the machinery at Cleveland, Ohio, within the time stipulated with the parent company of the Brush Electric Association.\u201d On the '6th of October, 1884, that communication ivas referred by the city council to the gas committee; and, on the 3d of. November, 1884, the recommendation of the committee, \u201c that the contract with Poliak <em>&amp; </em>Co. to furnish the city with twenty-three electric lights be renewed for one year,\u201d was adopted by the council. At a; subsequent meeting of that body, held January 19, 1885, it was resolved that, \u201crenewing the contract for the electric light, the mayor is authorized and instructed to make the contract with the Brush Electric Light and Power Company.\u201d Of that company Poliak was president, and seemed to have exclusive control and direction of its business, including the property and machinery connected therewith. It was in proof that the dynamo and machinery sued for in this action were received by the defendant and used by him in performing his contract; that, at the time of the trial below, they were in use; at the works of the last-named corporation, which had furnished the electric light during the existence of the contract between the city and Poliak; and that the city continued after November 1,1884, to make monthly payments to the, defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>It was also in proof that there were about eighty, miles of streets and more than one hundred' different streets within the corporate limits of Montgomery, and that only a small portion of the city was ever lighted by the Brush electric light; that Commerce street and Dexter avenue were the only thoroughfares or streets that were thus lighted continuously all the way from end to end; that only twenty-three electric lights or lamps in all were or ever had been used or employed in the city for street lighting purposes; that the remainder of the lights not used on Commerce street and Dexter avenue were employed on parts of certain streets and were confined within a narrow compass, mainly in the business centre of the city; that no greater number of lights or lamps were employed or contracted for, at any time, in the city for street lighting purposes than were used in the year 1884 up to the 1st of November of that year; that the area or territory covered with these lights had not in a.ny manner been enlarged; and that there were a great variety of electric lights other than the Brush electric light serviceable for lighting streets, and in use in various cities of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-4\">It was further proven by a witness that the legislature of \u25a0Alabama convened in Montgomery on the 11th of November,-1884, remaining in session before its recess, during the balance of that month and a part of the succeeding month; that in the. absence of any contract between the city and the defendant after the 1st day of November, 1884, the mayor of the city made a temporary arrangement with the defendant to furnish the Brush electric light to the city for the purpose of keeping the portion of the city above described lighted during the balance of the month of November and the month of December, 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">This was in substance all the proof in the cause.

Justice Hablan</author>\n<p id=\"AzA\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">He stated the case as above reported, and continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">1. The special pleas contained nothing of which the defendant could not have availed himself under his plea, of the gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>eral issue. If the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to any of the special pleas, it was an error without\u2019 injury, and, therefore, not constituting a ground of reversal. Code of Alabama, 1886, \u00a7 2675; <em>Kannady </em>v. Lambert, 37 Alabama, 57, 59. .</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\">. 2, It was not, error to allow the written agreement between the parties to be read in evidence without proof of its execution. The .Code of Alabama provides that \u201cevery written 'instrument, the foundation of the suit; purporting to be signed by the defendant, his partner, agent, or attorney in fact, must, be received in evidence without proof of the execution, unless' the, execution thereof is denied by plea, verified by affidavit.\u201d \u00a7 2770'. There was no, such plea in this case. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">3. By the terms of the agreement between the. parties, the defendant was. to pay a certain amount to the plaintiff,'by a named day, for the machinery,,dial and lamps, provided the city council,of Montgomery concluded \u201cto adopt the Brush, electric light for the-future lighting of the streets\u201d of that city, after the expiration of the contract which Poliak- - <em>&amp; </em>Company then,had with the-city.- The main question in the case is, whether the contingency just stated happened prior to January 1, 1885; if so, the contract between the parties , became one of absolute sale, and bound the defendant to pay on that day the specified card rates for the property.</p>\n<p id=\"ASS\">The defendant insists that the agreement, construed in the' light of the circumstances attending its execution, contemplated something more than the adoption by, the city council of the Brush electric light for the limited territory covered by the contract which Poliak &amp; Co. then had/with the city; and that the parties made their agreement with reference to an enlargement, after the expiration of that contract, of the area in the city to be lighted with the Brush electric light. \"We do not assent to this construction. The agreement was made in view of the fact that the city was then using, under the contract with Poliak <em>&amp; </em>Co., only twenty-three of the Brush electric lights. The machine, dial and lamps furnished by the defendant were used, and presumably were needed, in order that Poliak <em>&amp; </em>Co. might perform that contract. He was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>pay only certain rental therefor in case the city council concluded \u201cnot to <em>contmue </em>lighting the streets of Montgomery with the Brush electric light after the expiration of the present contract with said Poliak <em>&amp; Go.\u201d </em>and if the council concluded otherwise, then the machine, dial and lamps were to be returned to the defendant, fully repaired and in good working order, by January 1, 1885. These provisions clearly show that the lighting; of the streets after November 1, 1884, with the Brush electric light, under an arrangement for that purpose with the city council, even to the limited extent provided for by the contract with Poliak &amp; Co., was, within the meaning of the parties, such an adaption of that light by the city as bound the plaintiff to purchase the machine, dial and lamps in question and pay therefor,, by January 1, 1885, the sum of $6180. It could not have been their intention to make the permanent adoption of the Brush electric light, for an indefinite period .for <em>all </em>the streets of the city, or for a larger territory than that stipulated for in the contract with Poliak <em>&amp; </em>Co., a condition precedent to the defendant\u2019s obligation to buy the property at the aggregate price fixed. The communication of Poliak to the city council, under date of October 4, 1884, supports this conclusion. He distinctly says that if the then existing' contract was not renewed, he was under a duty by his agreement with the defendant to take down, pack and \u2022 deliver the machinery at Cleveland, Ohio; implying that if his contract was renewed no such duty would rest upon him. And that the contingency happened upon which the defendant became bound to purchase the property outright at the price above named, appears from the fact that the contract of Poliak <em>&amp; </em>Co. was'renewed. That renewal is shown by the action of the city council on the 3d of November, 1884. Its action in response to the written communication of Poliak, under date of October 4, and its monthly payments thereafter to him, operated as an effective renewal of his contract with the city, although such renewal was not evidenced by a written contract covering a fixed period of time. <em>City Council of Montgomery </em>v. <em>Montgomery Water </em>Works, <em>77 </em>Alabama, 248, 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">4. It is also contended that the plaintiff was not entitled tc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>recover, except upon averment or proof that it had transferred or offered to transfer to the defendant the shares of stock held by it and by the Brush Electric Company of \u2022 Cleveland, Ohio, in the Brush Electric Light and- Power Company of Montgomery. This cannot be, unless, as insisted,-his promise to pay, in the contingency named in the third article of the agreement of November 13, 1883, the suih of $6180, was in consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s promise'to transfer, or have, transferred to him, the above shares. In support of this position' the case of <em>Bank of Columbia </em>v. Hagner, 1 Pet. 455, 465, is cited. . It was there said that the inclination of -the courts strongly favors, as obviously just, that construction of contracts which makes the covenants or promises of the par ties dependent rather than independent. After observing that the. seller ought not to be compelled to part with his property, .without receiving the consideration, nor the.purchaser to part with his money without an equivalent in return, the court said: \u201cHence, in such cases,.if either a vendor or a vendee wish to compel the other to fulfil his contract, he must make his part of the agreement precedent, and cannot proceed' against-tjie other without an actual performance of the agreement on his part, -or a tender or refusal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Atq\">But it is clear, as said in Philadelphia, <em>Wilmington &amp; Baltimore Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>13 How. 307, 339, that covenants are to be \u2022 considered dependent or independent, according to the intention of the parties, to be deduced from the whole instrument. It is manifest that the covenant of the plaintiff in. relation to the transfer of stock in the Brush Electric Light and Power Company is wholly independent of the agreement in' relation to the machine, dial and lamps in question. ' The consideration for such transfer, and for' the settlement and satisfaction of all claims due by Poliak &amp; Co. and; by the Brush Electric Light and Power Company to the plaintiff, was the payment by Poliak of a certain amount, part in. cash on the execution of the agreement of November 13, 1883, and the balance on the 1st of January, 1884. On the other: hand, the consideration for Poliak\u2019s agreement to' pay, in a certain contingency, a specified sum for the machine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>dial and lamps, was his becoming the absolute owner of those articles, upon the happening of that contingency. The cost of the articles was fixed by the agreement at a certain' aggregate sum, without reference to the transfer of the above-mentioned stock. There is nothing whatever in the contract indicating that the payment for the machine, dial and lamps was to depend, in any degree, upon the transfer of the stock, or \"that tne transfer of the stock was to depend uppn the adoption of the Brush Electric Light by the city. The covenants were wholly independent; and, therefore, it was not essential, to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, that it should allege or prove that its agreement to transfer, or have transferred, to the defendant, the above-described stock, had been performed. That may be. the subject of a separate suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">As the court below correctly interpreted the agreement between the parties, and as the evidence showed that the contingency happened which entitled the plaintiff to recover the sum specified.in the agreement as the value of the property, the direction to' the jury to find for the plaintiff was right. <em>Goodlet </em>v. <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville </em>Railroad, 122 U.
