Indeed,' it is conceded by counsel for the. t\u00edoniplainants, that this contract was perfectly valid as against the world, but it is insisted that, assuming the proof to establish the insolvency of Hume in 1874. and thenceforward, the-premiums paid in that and the subsequent years on this policy belonged in equity' to the creditors, and that they were; entitled to a decree therefor as well as for the amount of; the \u2022 Maryland and Connecticut policies and \u25a0 the premiums paid thereon..- , - \u25a0 V</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">It is not denied that the contract of the Maryland Insurance' Company was direbtlv between that company and Mrs. Hump, and this is, in. our judgment, true of .that of the Connecticut Mutual, while the Hartford company\u2019s certificates were payable to her, if living. (.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Mr. Hume having been insolvent' at the time the insurance, was effected, and.having paid the premiums himself, it,is argued'that these policies were within the' provisions of 1.3 Elizabeth, c. 5, and inure to the benefit of his creditors as equivalent to transfers of property with intent to hinder, delay and defraud. The'object of the statute .of Elizab\u00e9th was'to \u2022 prevent debtors- from .dealing with their property in any way-\u2022to the prejudice, of - their .creditors-; biit dealing' with that-i <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>which creditors, irrespective of such dealing, could not have touched, is within neither the letter nor the spirit of the statute. In the view of the law, credit is extended in reliance upon the evidence of the ability of the debtor to pay, and in confidence that his possessions will not be diminished to the prejudice 6f those who trust him. This reliance is disappointed, and this confidence abused, if he.divests himself of his property by giving it away after he has obtained credit. And where a person has taken out policies of insurance upon his . life for the- benefit of his estate, it has been frequently held that, as against creditors, his assignment, when insolvent, of such policies, to or for the benefit of wife and childreh, or either, constitutes a fraudulent transfer of assets within the statute, and this, even though the debtor may have had no deliberate intention of depriving his creditors of a fund to which they were entitled, because his act has in point of fact withdrawn such a fund from them, and dealt with, it by way of bounty. <em>Freeman </em>v. Pope, L. R. 9 Eq. 206; <em>S. C. </em>L. R. 5 Ch. 538. The rule stands upon precisely the same ground as any other disposition of his property by the debtor. The defect of the disposition is that it removes the property of the debtor out of the reach of his creditors. <em>Cornish </em>v. Clark, L. R. 14 Eq. 184, 1S9.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">But the rule applies only to that which the debtor could have-made available for payment of his debts. Eor instance,the exercise of a general power of appointment might be fraudulent and void under the statute, but not the exercise of a limited or exclusive power, because, in the latter. case, the debtor, never had any interest in the,;property himself which could have been available to a creditor,lor, by which he could' have obtained credit. May on Fraudulent Conveyances, 33. It is true that creditors can obtain relief in respect t\u00f3 a fraudulent conveyance where the grantor cannot, but that relief only restores the subjection of the debtor\u2019s property to the payment of his indebtedness as it existed prior to the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">A person' has an insurable interest in, his own life for the benefit of his estate. The contract affords no compensation to him, but to his representatives. So the creditor has an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>surable interest in the debtor\u2019s life, and can protect himself accordingly, if he so chooses. Marine and fire insurance is-considered as strictly an indemnity ; but while this is not so as to life insurance, which is simply a contract, so far as -the company is concerned, to pay a certain sum of money upon the occurrence of an event which is sure at some time to happen, in consideration of the payment, of the premiums as stipulated, nevertheless the contract is also, a contract of indemnity. If the creditor insures the life .of his debtor he is thereby indemnified against the loss of his debt by the death of the debtor before <em>payment; </em>yet, if the creditor keeps up the premiums, and his debt is paid before the debtor\u2019s death, he may still recover upon the contract, which was valid when made,</p>\n<p id=\"A5Z\">. and which the insurance company is bound to pay according to its terms; but if the debtor obtains the insurance on the insurable Interest of the creditor, and pays the premiums himself, and the debt is extinguished before the insurance falls in, then the proceeds would go to the estate of the debtor. <em>Knox </em>v. Turner, L. R. 9 Eq. 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u25a0 The wife and children have an insurable interest in the life of the husband and father, and if insurance thereon be taken out by him and he pays the premiums and survives them, it might be reasonably claimed in the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, that the policy would inure to-his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In <em>Continental Life Ins. Co. </em>v. Palmer, 42 Conn. 60, 64, the wife insured the life of the husband, the amount insured to be payable to her if she survived him, if not, to her children. \u2019 The wife and one son died prior to the husband, the son leaving a son surviving. The court held that under the provisions of the statute of that State, the policy being made payable 'to the wife and children, the children immediately took such a vested interest in the policy, that the grandson was entitled to his father\u2019s share, the wife having died before the husband, but \u00edhat in the absence of the statute \u201c it would have been a fund in the hands of his- representatives for the benefit of creditors, provided The premiums had been paid by him.\u201d So ,in the case of <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>Estate, <em>Hay\u2019s and Kerr\u2019s Appeal, </em>85 Penn. St. 202, A: insured his life in favor of his wife, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>died intestate in his lifetime, leaving an only child.- A. died \u25a0 intestate and insolvent, the child surviving, and the court held that the proceeds of the policy belonged to the wife\u2019s estate, and, under the intestate laws, was to be distributed share and share .alike between her child and her husband\u2019s estate, notwithstanding under a prior statute, life insurance taken out for the wife -vested in her free from the claims of the husband\u2019s creditors. But if the wife had survived she would have taken the entire proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">We think it cannot be doubted that in the instance of contracts of insurance with a wife or children, or both, upon their insurable interest in the life of the husband or father, the' latter, while- they are living, can exercise no power of disposition. over the same without their consent, nor has he any interest therein of which he can avail himself, nor upon his death have his personal representatives or his creditors any interest in the proceeds of such contracts' which belong to the beneficiaries to whom they are\u2018payable.</p>\n<p id=\"ALF\">It is indeed the general rule that a policy, and the money to become due under it, belong, the moment it is issued, to the person or persons named in it as the beneficiary or beneficiaries, and that there is no power in the person procuring the insurance by any act of his, by deed or by will, to transfer to any other person the interest of the person named. Bliss on Life Insurance, 2d ed. p. 5.17; <em>Glanz </em>v. <em>Gloeckler, </em>10 Appellate Court Illinois, 484, per McAllister, J.; <em>S. C. </em>104 Illinois, 573; <em>Wilburn </em>v. <em>Wilburn, </em>83 Indiana, 55; <em>Ricker </em>v. <em>Charter Oak Ins. Co., </em>27 Minnesota, 193 ; <em>Charter Oak Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brant, </em>47 Missouri, 419; <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>99 Mass. 154; <em>Knickerbocker Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Weitz, </em>99 Mass. 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">This must ordinarily be \u2018 so where the contract is directly with the beneficiary; in respect to policies running to the person insured, but payable to another having a direct pecuniary interest in the life, insured ; and where the proceeds are made to inure by positive statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">' Mrs. Hume Was confessedly \u00e1 contracting party to the \u25a0 Maryland policy; and as tp. the Connecticut contracts, the statute of the State where they were made and to be per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>formed, explicitly provided that a policy for the benefit of a married woman shall inure to her separate use or that of her children, but if the annual premium exceed three hundred dollars, the amount of such excess shall inure to the benefit of the creditors of the person paying the premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The rights and benefits given by the laws of Connecticut in this regard are as much part of these contracts as if incorporated therein, not only because they are to be taken as if entered into there, but because there was the place of performance, and the stipulation of the parties was made with reference to the laws of that place.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">And if this be so as between Hume and the Connecticut companies, then he could not have at any time disposed of these policies without the consent of the beneficiary. Nor is there anything to the contrary in the statutes or general public policy of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">It may very well be that a transfer by an insolvent of a Connecticut policy, payable to himself or his personal representatives, would be held invalid in that District, even though valid under the laws of Connecticut, if the laws of the District were opposed to the latter, because the positive: laws of the domicil and the forum must prevail; but there is no such conflict of laws in this case in respect to the power of disposition by a person procuring insurance payable to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The obvious distinction between the transfer of a policy taken out by a person upon his insurable interest in his own life, and payable to himself or his legal representatives, and the obtaining of a policy by a person upon the insurable interest of his wife and children; -and payable to them, has been repeatedly recognized by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Thus in <em>Elliott's Appeal, </em>50 Penn. St. 75, 83, where the' policies were issued in the name of the husband, and payable to himself or his personal representatives, and while he was insolvent were by him transferred - to trustees for his, wife\u2019s benefit, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, while holding such transfers void as against creditors, say :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\"><em>\u201cWe </em>are to be'understood in thus deciding this-case that we do not mean to extend it to policies effected without fraud \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>directly and on their face for the benefit of the wife, and payable to her; such policies are not fraudulent as to creditors, and are not touched by this decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In the use of the words \u201c without fraud,\u201d the cpurt evidently means actual fraud participated in by all parties,\u2019 and not fraud inferred from the mere fact of insolvency; and, at all events, in <em>McCutcheon's Appeal, </em>99 Penn. St. 133, 137, the court say, referring to Elliott\u2019s appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa4\"><em>\u201c </em>The policies in that case were effected in the name of the husband, and by him transferred to a trustee for his wife at a time when he was totally insolvent. They were held to be valuable choses in action, the property of the assured, liable to the payment of his debts, and hence their voluntary assignment operated in fraud of creditors, and was void as against them under the statute of 13th Elizabeth.- Here, however, \u25a0the policy was effected in the name of the wife, and in point of fact w\u00e1s given under an agreement for the surrender of a previous policy for the same amount also issued in the wife\u2019s name. . . . The question of good faith or fraud only arises in the latter case; that is, when the title of the beneficiary arises by assignment. When it exists by force of an original issue in the name, or for the benefit of the beneficiary, the title is good, notwithstanding the claims of creditors. . . . There is no anomaly in this, nor any conflict with the letter or spirit of the statute of Elizabeth, because in .such cases' the policy would be at no time the property \u00f3f the assured, and hence no question of fraud in its transfer could arise as to his creditors. It is only in case of the assignment of a policy that <em>once belonged </em>to. the assured that the question of fraud can arise under this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">. And see <em>JEtna National Bank </em>v. <em>United States Life Ins. Go., </em>24 Fed. Hep. 770; <em>Pence </em>v. <em>Makepeace, </em>65 Indiana, 374; <em>Succession of Hearing, </em>26 La. Ann. 326; <em>Stigler\u2019s EEr </em>v. <em>Stigler,' </em>77 Virginia, 163; <em>Thompson </em>-v. <em>Cimdiff, </em>11 Bush, 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Conceding, then, in the case in hand, that Hume, paid the premiums out of-his own money, when insolvent, yet, as Mrs. Hume and the children survived him, and the contracts covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>their insurable interest, it is difficult to see upon what ground the creditors, or the administrators as representing them, can take away from these. dependent ones that which was expressly secured to them in the event of the death of their-natural supporter. The interest insured was neither the debt- or\u2019s nor his creditors\u2019. The contracts were not payable to the debtor, or his representatives, or his creditors. No fraud on the part of the wife, or the children, or the insurance company is pretended. In no sense was' there any gift or transfer of the debtor\u2019s property, unless the amounts paid as premiums are to be held to constitute such gift or transfer. This seems to have been the view of the court below; for the decree awarded to1 the complainants the premiums paid to' the Virginia company from 1874 to 1881, inclusive, and to the other companies from the date of the respective policies, amounting, with interest to January 4, 1883, to the sum of $2896.10, which sum was directed to be paid to ITume\u2019s administrators out of the money which had been paid into court by the Maryland and-Connecticut Mutual companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">\u25a0But, even though Hume paid this money out of his own funds when insolvent, and if such payment were within the statute of Elizabeth, this would not give the creditors any Interest in the proceeds .of the policies, which belonged to the beneficiaries for the reasons already stated. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Were the creditors, then, entitled to recover the premiums?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">These premiums were paid by Hume to the insurance companies, and to recover from them would require proof that the latter participated in the alleged fraudulent intent, which is not claimed. Cases might be imagined of the payment of large premiums, out of all reasonable proportion to the known or reputed financial condition of the person paying, and under circumstances of grave suspicion,which might justify the inference of fraud on creditors in the withdrawal of such an-amount from the debtor\u2019s resources; but no element of that .sort exists here. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The premiums form no part of the proceeds of the policies, and cannot be deducted therefrom on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Mrs. Hume is not shown to have known of or suspected her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>h us hand\u2019s insolvency, and if the payments were made at her instance, or with her knowledge and assent, or if, without her knowledge, she afterwards ratified the act, and claimed the benefit, as she might rightfully do, <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Amer. Ins. </em>Co., 46 N. Y. 674, and as she does (and the same remarks apply to the children), then has she thereby received money which <em>ex (Bquo et bono </em>she ought to return to her husband\u2019s creditors, and can the decree against her be sustained on that ground ?</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">If in some cases payments of pi\u2019emiums might be treated as gifts inhibited by the statute of Elizabeth, can they be so. treated here <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">It is assuhied by complainants that the money paid was derived from Hume himself, and it is therefore argued that to that extent his means for payment of debts were impaired. That the payments contributed in any appreciable way to Hume\u2019s insolvency, is not contended. So far as premiums w\u00e9re paid in 1880 and 1881, (the payments prior to those years having been the annual sum of $196.18 on the Virginia policy,) we are satisfied\u2019from the evidence that Hume received from Mrs. Pickrell, his wife\u2019s mother, for the benefit of Mrs. Hume and her family, an amount of money largely in excess of these payments,' after deducting, what was returned to Mrs. Pickrell,. and that in paying the premiums upon procuring the policies in the Maryland and the Connecticut Mutual, Hume was appropriating to that purpose a part of the money which he considered he thus held in trust, and we think that, as between Hume\u2019s creditors and Mrs. Hume, the money placed' in Hume\u2019s hands for his wife\u2019s benefit, is under the evidence, equitably as much to :be accounted for to her by Hume, and so by them, as is the money paid on her account to be .accounted for by her to him or them. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\"><em>We </em>do not, however, dwell particularly upon this, nor pause to discuss the bearing of the laws of the States of the insurance companies upon this matter of the payment of premiums by the debtor himself, so far as they may differ from .the rule-which may prevail in. the District of Columbia, in the absence of specific statutory enactment upon that subject, because <em>we </em>prefer to'place our decision upon broader grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>In \u2018all purely voluntary conveyances it is the .fraudulent intent of the donor which vitiates. If actually insolvent, he is held to knowledge of his condition; and if the necessary consequence of his act is to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, within- the statute, the presumption of the fraudulent intent is irrebuttable and conclusive, and inquiry into1 his motives is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">But the circumstances of each particular case should be considered, as in <em>Partridge </em>v. Gopp, 1 Eden, 163, 168; <em>S. C. </em>Ambler, 596, 599, where the Lord Keeper, while holding that debts must be paid before gifts are made, and debtors must be just before they are generous, admitted that \u201c the fraudulent inteint is to be collected from the magnitude and value of the gift.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Where fraud is to be imputed, or the imputation of fraud .repelled, by an examination into the circumstances under which a gift is made to those towards whom the donor is under natural obligation, the test is said, in <em>Hiff </em>v. Hanna, 2-Bland, 33, to be the pecuniary ability of the donor.at that time to withdraw the amount'of the donation from his, estate without the least hazard to his creditors, .or in any material degree-lessening their then prospects of payment; and in considering the sufficiency' of the debtor\u2019s property for the pay-. ment of debts, the probable, immediate, unavoidable, and reasonable demands for the support of- the-family of the donor should be taken into the account, and deducted, having in mind also the nature of his business and his\" necessary expenses. <em>Emerson </em>v. Bemis, 69 Illinois, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"AfWI\">This argument in the interest of creditors concedes that the debtor'may rightfully preserve his family from' suffering and want. It seems to us that the same public policy which justifies this, and recognizes the support of wife and children as a positive obligation in la&gt;v as well as morals,' should be ext'end\u00e9d to protect, them from destitution after the debtor\u2019s death, by permitting him, not to accumulate a fund as a permanent provision, but, to devote a moderate portion of his earnings, to keep'on foot a-security for support already, or.which could thereby be\u2019 lawfully, obtained, at least to the extent of requir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>ing that, under such circumstances, the fraudulent intent of both parties to the transaction should be made out.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">' And inasmuch as there is no evidence from which such intent on the part of Mrs. Hume or the insurance companies could be inferred, in our judgment none of these premiums can be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">' <em>The'decree is affirmed, except so far as it directs the payment to the administrators of the premiums in question a/nd. interest, and, as to that; is reversed, and the cause remanded,' to tlie court helo'to, with directions to proceed in conformity with this opinion.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
