Or, in other words, it is argued that \u00a7 100, being a. section of the city charter, was saved from repeal by the. Penal Code by \u00a7 725 of the latter, and was not repealed until by the subsequent law known as the City Consolidation Act, which took effect March 1,1883, and was even then continued in force as \u00a7 58 of the Consolidation Act, which is identical with said \u00a7 100; and that at all events the measure of punishment from December 1st, 1882, to March 1st, 1883, is that prescribed by '\u00a7 100 of the old charter and repeated in \u00a7 58 of the new.'</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">And it is insisted that \u00a7 72 of the Penal Code, with the force and effect given - it by \u00a7 2143 of the Consolidation Act, under the decisions of the New York Court of Appeals, is <em>ex post facto, </em>and therefore void, in that thereby the maximum punishment by imprisonment of the crime of bribery committed before as well as after the Consolidation Act went into effect was changed from two to ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In <em>The People </em>v. <em>O'Neill, </em>109 N. Y. 251, 261, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Jaehne, </em>103 N. Y. 182, it was held by- the Court of Appeals that \u00a7 100 of chapter 335. of the-Act of 1873 was not within the saving clause of \u00a7 725 of the Penal Code, but on the contrary, was repealed by that Code as soon as it-went into operation, December 1st, 1882, and that \u00a7 58 of the Consolidation Act, which is but a transcript of said \u00a7 100, was not kept 'in force by said\u2019 \u00a7 725, and was superseded by \u00a7 72 of the Penal Code, which latter section was prospective merely, and could only operate upon the crime of bribery committed by a member of the common coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>oil after the Penal Code took effect. . Accepting- the conclusions of the highest court of the State \u00f3f New York as to the operation of the acts in question in substituting, under \u00a7 72, .a longer term of imprisonment for that which had theretofore existed, it is clear that \u00a7 72 governed' future cases only; but, even if taken in connection with all the other statutory provisions referred to, it could be construed as <em>also </em>retroactive, as it was admitted upon the argument that the crime, upon conviction of which the petitioner was sentenced to the imprisonment he is now undergoing, was charged to have been committed in 1884, long after the Penal -Code and the Consolidation Act went into effect, we perceive no reason for the discharge of the prisoner upon, the ground that \u00a7 72 might \u2022be held invalid in respect to a crime committed between December 1st, 1882, and-April 1st, 1883, if drawn in question in a proper case. The rule upon this subject, which we consider applicable, is that \u201c a legislative act may be entirely valid as to some classes of cases and clearly void as to others. A general law for the punishment of offences, which should endeavor to reach by its retroactive operation acts before committed,- as well as to' prescribe a rule of conduct for the citizen in futurej would be void so far as it\u2019 was retrospective; but such invalidity would not affect the operation of the law in regard to the cases which were within the legislative control.\u201d -Cooley, Const. Lim., 5th ed., 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The order of the Circuit Court refusing the writ's was right, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Affirmed..</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ABj\"> Section 72- of the Penal Code reads as follows: \u201c A judicial officer, a person who executes any of the functions of a public office not designated .in'Titles six and seven of this Code, or a person employed by or acting for the State, or for any public officer in the business of the State, who asks, receives, or agrees to receive a bribe, or any money, property, or value of any kind, or any promise or agreement therefor, upon any agreement or understanding that his vote, opinion, judgment, action, decision, or other. official proceeding shall be influenced thereby, or that he will do or omit any act or proceeding, or in any way neglect or violate any official duty, is punishable by imprisonment for not more than ten years or by a fine of not more than five thousand dollars or both.
