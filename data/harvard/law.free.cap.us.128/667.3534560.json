For want of equity. 2d. For multifariousness, in embracing two separate and distinct causes of action, one to enforce specific performance of a contract, the other for the infringement of a patent. 3d. Because, as appeared by the allegations of the bill, the patent was absolutely void, and no suit could be maintained; either to compel its transfer, or for infringement thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b689-6\">The Circuit Court sustained the demurrer, for the third reason, and dismissed the bill. 33 Fed.

Seward </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-8\">[The brief of counsel discussed the whole case. On the point on which the case turns in the opinion, it was in substance as follows:]</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-9\">ITazel ton\u2019s agreement was not that he would assign a valid patent, or an invalid patent, but that he would assign \u201cany and all patents I may hereafter obtain from the United States or the Dominion of Canada\u201d for the designated improvement, leaving it to the law thereafter to say whether such patent was or was not maintainable. If such an agreement be,, as the authorities show that it is, a valid one and one capable', of being enforced in equity, then it ought not to be permitted to Ilazelton, when a suit is brought against him to enforce it, to assert that though he did obtain the patent, he was not the inventor, and therefore that the patent is void, and therefore, also, that he ought not to be compelled to assign it; and yet this is precisely the purport of the demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-10\">It is true that the bill alleges that Hazelton was the inventor. The demurrer admits this fact, <em>Pullman Palace Car Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>v. <em>Missouri, </em>115 U. S. 587, 596; and therefore Hazelton says that \u201c because I adroit the fact by demurrer, the allegation, coupled with the admission, proves that the patent is invalid, and therefore I have a right to retain it and manufacture and sell under it, and cannot be compelled to transfer it to the plaintiff.\u201d This ought not' to be \u2022 the law. <em>Nemo egs suo delioto meliorem sua/rn conditionem f acere potest.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-5\">The agreement between the parties having been intelligently made for the purpose of conveying to the plaintiff the sole and exclusive legal title to the designated improvements, ought not to be susceptible of evasion by permitting Hazelton to say, \u201cI have defrauded the Government, and left the plaintiff remediless.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-6\">But the patent in question is on its face valid, and in the name of Hazelton is .outstanding and in use by him. He can and does use it for the purpose of depriving the plaintiff of the market which he would otherwise find by supplying such market with a boiler which Hazelton says is patented, and for which he exhibits letters patent of the United States, which, on their face, are valid, and which cannot be attacked in any collateral action such as is the present suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-7\">In the case of <em>Mahn v. Harwood, </em>112 U. S. 354, Mr. Justice Miller said: <em>\u201c </em>The doctrine is well established that a grant by the Government within its lawful authority, evidenced by a patent under its seal and the signature of the Executive, cannot be impeached collaterally. It must be recognized as valid in all courts, when it is introduced as evidence of the right which it confers, and can only be avoided by a direct proceeding by way of <em>scire facias, </em>or bill in chancery, to set aside the grant for.some of the reasons which made its original issue a wrongful act.\u201d p. 365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-8\">This is not a suit to determine anything as to the validity of the patent. It is not a suit to enforce a patent, but to compel the performance of an agreement to convey one. The judicial \u2022 inquiry therefore is, was there such an agreement and has the defendant the patent ? If this is answered in the affirmative, then equity directs the conveyance and awards the <em>ad interim </em>profits. Whether the patent is or is not void<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>able upon some statutory ground is a collateral question, pure and simple, and as such it is not properly to be investigated, as it most certainly cannot be effectively decided in a suit to compel the transfer of the patent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-5\">It is believed that the case of <em>Ambler </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>20 Wall. 546, is both a precedent and an authority for this position of the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b691-6\"><em>Mr. L. L. Bond </em>and <em>Mr. E. A. West </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b691-7\">Mr. Justice Gray,</author>\n<p id=\"AtDF\">after stating the case as above reported, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">The case, as stated in the bill and admitted by the demurrer, is shortly this: The defendant agreed in writing to assign to the plaintiff any - patents that he might obtain for improvements in steam boilers. He did invent such an improvement, and, with intent to evade his agreement and to defraud the plaintiff, procured a patent for this invention to be obtained upon the application under oath of a third person as the inventor, and to be issued to him as assignee of that person, and has made -profits by manufacturing and selling boilers embodying the improvement so patented. The plaintiff seeks by bill in equity to compel the defendant to assign the patent to him, and to account for the profits received under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">A court of chancery cannot decree specific performance of an agreement to convey property which has no existence, or to which the defendant has no title, ' A bill by vendee against vendor for specific performance, which does not show any title in the defendant, is bad on demurrer. And if it appears, by the bill or otherwise, that the want of title (even if caused by the defendant\u2019s own act, as by his conveyance to a <em>bona fide' </em>purchaser) was known to the plaintiff at the time of beginning the suit, the bill will not be retained for assessment of damages, but must be dismissed, and the plaintiff left to his remedy at law. <em>Columbine </em>v. Chichester, 2 Phillips, 27; <em>S. C. </em>1 Coop. Temp. Cottenham, 295 ; <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>L. R. 2 Ch. 77; <em>Kempshall </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>5 Johns. Ch. 193; <em>Morss </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>v. <em>Elmendorf, </em>11 Paige, 277; <em>Milkman </em>v. Ordway, 106 Mass. 232, 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">\u25a0 The patent law makes it essential - to the validity of a patent, that it shall be granted on the application, supported by the oath, of the original and first inventor, (or of his executor or administrator,) whether the patent is issued to him or to his assignee. A patent which is not supported by the oath of the inventor, but applied for by one who is not the inventor, is unauthorized by law, and void, and, whether taken out in the name of the applicant or of any assignee of his, confers no rights as against the public. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 4886, 4888, 4892, 4895, 4896, 4920.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The patent issued by the Commissioner to the defendant as assignee of Goulding is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence that Goulding was the inventor of the improvement patented; and the presumption of its validity in this respect is rebutted and overthrown by the distinct allegation in the bill, admitted by the demurrer, that the' defendant, and not Goulding, was the inventor. This fact is not brought into the case by any answer or plea of the defendant, but it is asserted by the plaintiff himself as a ground for maintaining his bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">As the patent, upon the plaintiff\u2019s own showing, conferred no title or right upon the defendant, a court of equity will not order him to assign it to the plaintiff \u2014 not only because that would be to decree a conveyance of property in which the defendant has, and can confer, no title; but also because its only possible value or use to the plaintiff would be to enable him to impose ' upon the public by asserting rights under a void patent. <em>Post </em>v. Marsh, 16 Ch. D. 395; <em>Oldham, </em>v. James, 14 Irish Ch. 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The bill cannot be maintained for an account of profits received by the defendant from the use of this patent, because a decree for profits can only proceed upon the ground that the plaintiff is at least the equitable owner of the patent,, and there can be neither legal nor equitable ownership of a void patent. The same reason is a sufficient answer to the suggestion of the plaintiff that the bill may be maintained as a bill to remove a cloud upon his title in this patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>In <em>Ambler </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>20 Wall. 546, cited by tbe plaintiff, the suit was based upon articles of partnership between Ambler and Whipple, by which it was agreed that all patents obtained by either partner should be owned by both in equal shares. The bill alleged that the two jointly had obtained a patent for a joint invention, and that another patent, after-wards obtained by Whipple upon the application of a third person, embodied the same invention with only a colorable variation. Neither of the patents was in the record, and the questions now presented were not suggested by counsel or. considered by the court, but the decree for the plaintiff pro-' ceeded upon independent grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The result is, that the present bill cannot be maintained, and that the plaintiff must be left'to any remedy that he may have to recover damages in an action at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b693-6\">The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Bradley dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
