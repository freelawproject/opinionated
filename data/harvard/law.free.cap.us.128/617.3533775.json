It sets up that a printed copy of volume 32 was not deposited until more than three months after publication. It avers that but a small amount of original matter was prepared by Mr. Freeman for any of the volumes 32 to 46, and that but few statements of Cases were prepared, by him, and those few were drawn by him from the opinions of the court in the cases reported. It denies that he prepared any tables of cases cited for any of those volumes, and denies that he so arranged the decisions and matter: contained in the volumes as to make the volumes convenient and of value to the persons using them. It avers that all matters contained in the volumes are. public and common property, forming part of the law of the State of Illinois, and as such not susceptible of copyright, or in any manner literary property, in which a private citizen can have a monopoly under the act of Congress regulating the subject of copyright; that whatever labor, literary or otherwise, was done upon the volumes by Mr. Freeman, was done in' his official capacity as reporter of \u2022the decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois, a public office then existing under and by virtue of the laws of that State, and to which Mr. Freeman had been duly appointed; and that .all labor, literary-or otherwise, by Mr. Freeman, in his capacity as official -reporter, upon the volumes, was public and common property, not susceptible of copyright or of private literary ownership. \" - '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-6\">The answer admits that the defendants had negotiations with the plaintiff concerning the .purchase of his interest.in volumes 39 to 46, consisting of the,stereotype plates and printed stock of those volumes;: that, in such negotiations, the -plaintiff proposed to sell his copyrights in volumes 32 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>46, but- no price or value was ever attached by either party to such copyrights, and they were always treated as a mere incident to the proposed sale, and all offers made and received on either hand were made with reference to such stereotype plates and printed stock, and\u2019 it was understood by all parties, that, if such sale were consummated, the copyrights should be \u201c thrown in,\u201d without additional charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-5\">The answer also admits, that, in republishing volumes 32 to 38 the defendants have used the opinions of the Supreme Court of Illinois as published by the plaintiff; but avers that they have corrected errors. in names, citations, and other matters therein, and denies that they have prepared the books from those of the plaintiff, or used the work of the plaintiff, except in\u2019 so far as plaintiff\u2019s books are free to the use of any and all persons, or have copied his title-pages, or have used his paging, or have copied his tables of cases cited 'or reported, or the stipulations, errors assigned, or instructions given. It avers that the statements of cases and syllabuses in the volumes as republished by the defendants are wholly original and entirely different from and unlike those of the plaintiff, except in the few instances where there is fin apparent resemblance, owing to the fact that those of the defendants have been drawn from the opinions of the court, and those of the plaintiff in the same cases appear to have been drawn from the same source; and that the volumes so republished by the defendants contain large amounts of new, original, and valuable matter, prepared expressly for those volumes, and not contained in any of the volumes of the plaintiff. It admits that the defendants have under consideration the rqpublication of volumes 39 to 46. It also avers, that, for many years before the filing of the bill, the plaintiff had abandoned volumes 32 . to 38; that his stereotype plates and stock of those volumes were destroyed in October, 1871, and none of them were ever reproduced by him until about July or August, 1877, when he reprinted volumes 37 and 38; that, prior thereto, he had for many years repeatedly announced that he should never reproduce those volumes; that, more than a year before the filing of the bill, the defendants noti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>fied the plaintiff of their intention to republish volumes 32 to 38, and frequently thereafter notified him of such intention,- and publicly announced the same by advertisement^ and-from time. to time, as such republication progressed, during the spring and summer of 1877, notified him of the progress of the work, and, as the volumes appeared from time to time during the spring and summer of 1877, the plaintiff was constantly apprised thereof, and at divers times during that, year, and before, the' defendants received various propositions from the plaintiff for an exchange of .volumes 32 to 38, so being republished, for volumes 39 to 46, which the plaintiff had for sale; that the plaintiff, down to the filing of the bill, never objected to such republication, but always appeared to acquiesce therein, and encouraged the defendants to proceed therewith, and, from his \u2022 conduct during such \u25a0 period, the defendants always believed, down to the filing of the bill,, that such republication was being done with bis acquiescence and consent; and that the plaintiff, by bis conduct, is, estopped from receiving, the relief asked. .The answer also denies all the material allegations of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-4\">Ewell and Denslow each put in an answer, disclaiming all \u25a0interest in the publication of any volumes of the reports by Callaghan &amp; Co., and all interest in such volumes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-5\">Issue was joined and proofs were taken, and,, on the 10th.of!

The decree awarded a perpetual injunction, against all'-of the defendants from further publishing or selling, or'transferring or removing any of said books, and ordered a- reference to &amp; master, Henry \"W.

The decree also gave'leave to the plaintiff to file a supplemental bill, based on the fact that, since the filing of the original bill, Callaghan <em>&amp; </em>Co. had proceeded to publish and sell copies of the books described in the bill as volumes 39 and 41 to 46.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-5\">The decision of the Circuit Court is reported in 10 Bissell, 139, and 5 Fed.

Mr. Freeman, in the preparation of his reports, was not an author within the meaning of this Constitutional provision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-10\">It was decided by this court in <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>8 Pet. 591, and is now universally conceded, that the opinions of -the judges are public property, and not the subject of copyright by the reporter. This necessarily results from the relation sustained by the judges toward the people, they being public officers employed and paid to render a purely public service. The result of the labors of the judges is, therefore, the property of the people by whom and for whom they are employed; and if any such element of' literary property attaches to their labors as to render them susceptible of copyright, the people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>alone , are entitled to such copyright. In like manner the-reporter being a public servant or agent, the product,of his' labor is likewise the property of the people; and if copyrighted\" at all, it can only be done in the name of, and for the benefit-of the people.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-4\">The case of <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>Peters </em>has been supposed to recognize the right of an official reporter to literary property in his work. \"Whether the court in <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>Peters </em>intended to decide that Mr. Wheaton was entitled to a copyright in. his reports, is not easily determined. The opinion itself contains no allusion to this point; and the case was remanded to determine whether there had been a compliance with the statutory provisions requisite to a valid copyright, such as the publication of the notice required by the act of Congress of 1790, and the delivery of a copy of the book to the Secretary. of State. A dictum of Mr. Justice Story, (who was a member of the court when <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>Peters </em>was decided,) in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>1 Story, 11, may be cited as affording some ground for believing that the judgment in <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>Peters </em>was intended as a recognition of the reporter\u2019s right to a copyright! On the other hand, we have the contemporaneous testimony of Mr. Peters'himself, in the report of the case, that the court,\u2019 gave no opinion on the point, and did not consider it when the case was disposed of. 8 Pet. 618, <em>n. </em>See also <em>Heine </em>v. <em>Appleton, </em>4 Blatchford, 125. (</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-5\">There is a series of English decisions, having a strong bearing, by analogy, upon this question. \u25a0 The publication of the laws, as such, in. England has always been claimed as an attribute of sovereignty, and the exclusive right to publish them was formerly granted by letters patent from the crown. These patents were granted at an earl}7 date. In the <em>Company of Stationers </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>1 Mod. 256, decided in 1677, the court say: <em>\u201c </em>And particularly the sole printing of law books has been formerly granted in other reigns. . . . Queen Elizabeth, King James and King Charles the First granted such patents as these, and the law has great respect to common usage.\u201d The early English cases under these letters patent afford strong support for the position that the laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>are .not private property, and are not susceptible of private ownership, the right to their publication resting in the sovereign. See <em>The Stationers </em>v. <em>The Patentees about the printing of Rolls\u2019 Abridgment, </em>Carter, 89; <em>S. C. </em>Bac. A bridg. tit. Prerogative, F. 5 ; <em>Millar </em>v. Taylor, 4 Burrow, 2304, 2383; <em>Basket </em>v. <em>University of </em>Cambridge, 1 W. Bl. 105; <em>Manners v. Blaur 3 </em>Bligh (N. S.), 391.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajy\">Whether the theory of the royal prerogative, or of a private property in the crown be accepted, in either event the sole right of publication is recognized in the sovereign, and in either event the analogy is equally striking in the case at bar. If the right of publishing the laws in England pertained to the sovereign power, then <em>a fortiori </em>does it pertain to the sovereignty here; that is to the public, to the people, or to their government, and no element of private literary property can attach to such publications. And if, as in this case, appellants as private citizens are asserting the right to publish the laws of the State, the State alone can complain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIqU\">It is true that while publishing volumes 32 to 46 the reporter received no direct salary from the State. Under provisions of law, the State purchased of him a large number of copies of those volumes at a price affording a large profit on each, which was equivalent to a salary. But it is confidently submitted that the nature of the reporter\u2019s functions, and the question of copyright in his reports, are wholly independent of the method by which he receives compensation for his services, or whether, indeed, he is compensated at all. Private citizens are frequently designated to the performance of public duties, without compensation, and in the performance of such duties they may, and do, .make written reports of their proceedings for the benefit of the State. It has never yet been asserted that such reports are the private literary property of the persons by whom they are made. The sole test in determining the-right of private dominion and ownership in literary productions is, whether the writer is engaged in a private enterprise, and therefore an author within the meaning of the Constitution, or whether he is engaged in a public service, which dedicates the result of his labors to the public.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The doctrine of exclusive literary ownership in law reports contended for by appellee is also' contrary to public policy. The decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois are part of the law of the land. The reports of those decisions by the official reporter are made by statute evidence of the law. They' are, therefore, publications of the laws of the State, in like \u25a0 manner as are the published statutes and acts of the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-5\">II. The appellee is not entitled to relief, because of noncompliance with the conditions of the act of February 3, 1831, 4 Stat. 436, which were in force when the original editions of volumes 32 to 46 were published. The second error assigned is based upon the entire failure of appellee' to prove any date of publication of any of the volmnes, the absence of any competent proof as to. the date of depositing any of the volumes with the clerk of the District Court, the failure to prove that the printed title was filed with the clerk in advance of publication, and the failure to prove the deposit of the printed volumes within three months after publication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-6\">The third assignment of error specially challenges the proof admitted by the Circuit Court, as to the date of the deposit of the printed volumes with the clerk. The only proof offered by appellee upon this point consists of a mere memorandum at the bottom of each of the clerk\u2019s certificates concerning the filing of the printed title. The memorandum as to the alleged deposit of volume 32 may be taken as a sample of them all. It appears at the bottom of the certificate, following the signature and official seal of the clerk, certifying the transcript of his record as to the filing of the printed title, and is in these words: \u201cWork deposited Jany. 17, 1866, \u00a5m. H. Bradley, Clk.\u201d There is no certificate by the clerk that the book was deposited on that or any other day, and indeed, under the act \u25a0 of Congress of 1831, such a certificate by the clerk would have been wholly gratuitous, and would have afforded no competent proof as to the fact in question. The memorandum is not. attested by the official seal of the clerk, nor was any proof offered as to the genuineness of the signature purporting to be that of the clerk. Even if this signature had been proven to be that of the clerk, the memorandum would still have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>incompetent, being at the most a mere letter or written statement by the clerk, with no opportunity afforded to appellants for cross-examination. To the introduction of these memoranda we objected, upon the ground that they constituted no part of the clerk\u2019s certificates, but were merely anonymous statements, without proof as to when, or by whom they were made', and that they were, therefore, wholly incompetent to show the date of the deposit of the volumes. Our objection was, overruled, and exception was duly taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-4\">\u25a0 The fofirth and fifth assignments of error relate to the-refusal of the Circuit Court to admit the testimony offered by appellants as to the date of the publication of these volumes, showing conclusively that, as to them, appellee failed to comply with the conditions of the act of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-5\">,. The sixth assignment of error pertains to the relief granted as to volumes 35 and 36. By the clerk\u2019s certificate, offered by appellee as to volume 35, it appears that the printed title was deposited with the clerk of the District Court, January 28, 1867. The act of Congress then in force, like the present statute, required a notice of the entry of the copyright to be printed, either on the title-page of the volume, when published, or on the succeeding page. The printed notice, which appears on the back of the title-page of volume 35 of the original edition as published, purports to show its entry in the 'year 1866, being in the following words: \u201cEntered according to' act of Congress in the year 1866.\u201d There is, therefore, a variance of. a year in the filing of the title, as shown by the clerk\u2019s cei\u2019tificate, and in the announcement of the fact, as shown in the printed notice on the reverse of the 'title-page. As to volume 36, the clerk\u2019s certificate shows that the printed title was filed by E. B. Myers and Chandler, while the printed notice on the reverse of the title-page of the volume as published purports to show that the entry was made by E. B. Myers alone. These departures from a compliance with the requirements of the statute are fatal. The uniform current of authority, both English and American, is that the conditions imposed by the statute are indispensable to the creation of a copyright, and that a strict performance of these condi- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>. tions is absolutely necessary to the existence of any literary property in the published work, and of any right of action for an infringement. <em>Wheaton </em>v.

This theory no longer prevails in the courts, and the author must look only to the statute for his protection, and must show a strict compliance with all its requirements. Tested by ordinary rules of property, and by ordinary standards of right and wrong, the \u201cnatural property theory\u201d is well founded and should receive the sanction of the courts. It was so held in the great case of <em>Millar </em>v. Taylor, 4 Burrow, 2303, in 1769, and the opinion of Lord Mansfield in that case remains as a most masterly exposition of the natural right of the author to his literary product, independent of the statute of Anne. But in the case of <em>Donaldsons </em>v. Bechet, 4 Burrow, 2408, decided in 1774, the House of Lords overruled the doctrine of <em>Millar </em>v. Taylor, five of the law lords being of the opinion that the statute of Anne did not deprive the author of his common law right, while six held that the common law right, after publication, was taken away by the statute, and that the author must look to the statute alone for protection. It is a well-known historical fact that Lord Mansfield refrained from voting upon the question in the House of Lords from motives of delicacy, and that his vote, if given, would have left the law lords equally divided upon this question, thereby affirming the doctrine of <em>Millar </em>v. <em>Taylor. </em>Upon this slender margin, therefore, the doctrine was established by the House of Lords, that, the natural property right of the author, after publication, is wholly lost, and that he must look to the statute alone for protection. This doctrine has ever since remained unshaken in England, and it received the express sanction of this court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>and has ever since been followed in this country. We are, therefore, no longer dealing with abstract questions of literary property, or with any ethical considerations as to the dominion of the author over the product of his own brain. We are merely dealing with questions of statutory construction, which have long since been determined by the highest judicial tribunals of England and America. And because of the absolute failure of appellee to prove such compliance with the conditions prescribed by the act of 1831, the decree should be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-4\">. III. Appellee wholly failed to prove \"title to any. of -the volumes, as averred in his bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-5\">'\u25a0 IY. The-decree should be reversed, because of appellee\u2019s acquiescence in the publication of the volumes, and because of his laches in seeking relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACH\">In view of the entir\u00e9 course of conduct on the part of Myers, embracing not merely a tacit acquiescence in the Callaghans\u2019 publication, but affirmative aid and active encouragement, until they had embarked a large amount of capital in \u2022 their enterprise; and in view of his unpardonable and unaccountable laches and delay for a period of many months before invoking the aid of the court, it is submitted that he is estopped by his own conduct from the relief sought by his bill, and that the decree should be reversed. And in support of this proposition, the attention of the court is directed to the following authorities: <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>3 Myl. &amp; Cr. 711; <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>13 Law Times (N. S.), 746; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>3 Beavan, 133; <em>Tinsley </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>1 Hem. <em>&amp; </em>Mil. 747; <em>Rundell </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>Jacobs, 311; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Epley, </em>31 Penn.

The appellants\u2019 volumes did not infringe the copyrights of the original editions. The evidence shows that- the syllabuses were prepared from the opinions by independent work. As regards the statements of fact preceding the. opinions of the court, in the Callaghan edition, it is to be observed, first, that in very many cases they are wholly omitted, for the reason stated by Mr.. Ewell, that the. opinions of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>frequently state the facts with sufficient clearness. In other cases,-where any use has been made of Freeman\u2019s statements of fact by appellants\u2019 editors, they have simply abridged them, presenting the result in a clearer and more condensed form. And the doctrine is well established that an abridgment is not a piracy. <em>Hawkesworth </em>v. Newberry, Lofft, 775 ; <em>Gyles </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>2 Atk. 141; <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Aikin, </em>17 Ves. 422; <em>Folsom, </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>2 Story, 100, 107; <em>Story's Ex\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Holcombe, </em>4 McLean, 306; <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>2 Wall. Jr. 547.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-5\">But it will be insisted by appellee that-we have inf ringed, his pretended copyrights by taking the opinions of the judges from his volumes, instead of from the records of the court. It is sufficient to say that there can be no copyright in the labors of the judges. <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>Peters, 8 </em>Pet. 591; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>1 Story, 11.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-6\">If it be claimed that the appellee is entitled to the exclusive right to the arrangement of each of his volumes, to the division of opinions into separate volumes, to the arrangement of the decisions as accompanied with the Head-notes, etc., and to the arrangement of the pages of his volume, we answer that such an arrangement is as old as the system of law-reporting, and that a claim of literary property in it is idle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-7\">As regards the division of the cases into volumes, and the order in which the cases follow each other in the several volumes, the most casual inspection of the Freeman edition discloses an entire absence of method in such division and arrangement, plainly-demonstrating that chance, and chance only, governed in selecting the cases for the different volumes, as well as in determining their relative position in the several volumes. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-8\">The paging of the .Freeman, .edition is equally wanting in-any element of literary property, originality or exclusive ownership. Ever since the invention of printing, books have been paged in numerical order, and appellee might with equal propriety claim an exclusive property in the system of. Arabic numerals as in the paging of his books. Moreover, the printed paging is. merely the mechanical labor of the printer, and is never performed by the author or publisher.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>The claim of copyright in the title to the Freeman volumes may be dismissed, with two suggestions: (1) Ve have not copied the title of the Freeman edition. An examination of the title-pages of each of appellants\u2019 volumes will show that they are totally different from those of the corresponding Freeman volumes. (2) The title of a published work is not the subject of copyright, being a mere appendage or description which is not within the meaning of the act of Congress. <em>Jollie </em>v.

Appellants were compelled to make discovery in aid of the forfeiture sought by appellee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-6\">By a uniform current of authority, English, and American, the doctrine is too firmly established to be longer challenged, that equity will never compel a discovery in aid of penalties or forfeitures, unless the right to such penalties or forfeitures is waived by the person seeking the discovery.

The damages were excessive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-8\">(1) The, court erred in disallowing credit for stereotyping. It is not the province of the court upon an accounting of this nature to reduce the legitimate expenditures incurred by appellants in producing their volumes to the lowest possible point, or to exclude any reasonable and proper elements of expenditure which entered into the production of their books. The true scope of the inquiry is, what reasonable expenses were incurred by appellants in the production of their volumes, in accordance with the usages and customs of the trade in th\u00e9 art of book-making as then existing. Their books being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>produced in the usual manner customary in such publications, and in the same general style and appearance as other law reports, all legitimate expenditures incurred in such production should be allowed. If the cost of stereotyping is to be excluded, the court may, with equal propriety, reduce the cost of paper and binding, since a much cheaper article of paper and cheaper binding could have been employed, and still have rendered the books marketable. The true test, therefore, in measuring the expenditures which should be \u00e1llowed to appellants as the cost of producing their volumes, is such reasonable expenditure as was customary and usual in the production of like publications during the period in controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-5\">(2) Appellants\u2019 salaries should have been allowed as part of the expense of conducting their business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-6\">It is not disputed that the services of appellants were rendered ; that they conduced to the success of their business and to the large sale of these books; that without such services, other and equally competent men must have been employed to do the same work, and it is also undisputed in the entire record, save only in the report of Mr. Bennett, that no profits were ever divided by the firm. The case is therefore brought directly within the doctrine of the <em>Rubber Company </em>v. <em>Good</em>year, 9 Wall. 788, the only distinction being that- in that case the salaries allowed were paid to the managing officers of an infringing corporation, instead of to the members of a partnership, as here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-7\">(3) There was error as to the number of copies sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-8\">(4) There was error as to the selling price of the volumes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-9\">(5) The court erred in distributing the cost of production over the volumes sold and unsold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-10\">(6) There were no net receipts or profits on \u2018sales of volumes 39 to 46.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-11\">(7) The court erred in refusing credit to appellants for editorial work on their volumes. Hundreds of cases, as originally reported by Mr. Freeman, contain no statement of facts, or argument of counsel, the opinion being simply prefaced with the statement that the facts are stated in the opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>The corresponding cases in the Callaghan edition, as edited by Mr. Denslow, contain elaborate statements of facts, and copious abstracts of the arguments of counsel. Elaborate foot-notes are also added with references to other cases in Illinois and elsewhere upon the topic under consideration in the given case. All this work, it is conceded, was original and inde- . pendent labor on the part of Mr. Denslow. It was not copied from the Freeman edition, and it is not in that edition. The editorial work thus put upon these volumes includes the proofreading, which is itself an important item, and as necessary to the production of the manufactured product as are composition, press work or binding. The proofs of a volume of law reports must be read by a skilful lawyer with some experience in work of this nature, or the result will be a bungling and unmarketable production, in fact a mere comedy of errors. And every objection which, is urged against the allowance of the cost of editorial work and proof-reading may be urged with equal and even greater propriety against the mere mechanical labor of composition, press work and binding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-4\">(8) As to the 156 copies of resales, the appellants were not chargeable for them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-5\">When we have once paid the penalty of the original transgression, by the accounting for the first sales, the volumes so sold are, by virtue of such accounting, freed from the monopoly of appellee\u2019s alleged copyright, and become common property. The decree for the accounting, in other words, operates precisely as a license to sell upon a fixed royalty. The recovery for the original sales satisfies the monopoly claimed by appellee under the act of Congress, and forever frees the volumes from any further claim upon his part. The decree fixing damages for the original sales puts us precisely in, the attitude of purchasers of -the volumes in question. They then become our absolute property, to be sold and resold for all time to come. When, therefore, appellants account for the original sales of their edition, repurchase the volumes in the market, and sell them at second-hand, or when they purchase from appellee copies of his own edition, or purchase them at second-hand from other parties, and sell them to their customers, the vol-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Times are, by the accounting in the one case and by the purchase in the other, freed from the monopoly of the copyright, and may be sold and resold without further liability. <em>Perrigo </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>13 Blatchford, 359; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>17 Wall. 453.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-5\">Nor is it any answer to say that a resale by appellants of second-hand copies of their edition is as injurious to appellee as the original sale, because it supplies a demand that would otherwise be supplied by him. This argument, if well founded, would, apply with equal force to resales by appellants or by other persons, of second-hand copies of Myers\u2019 own volumes.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b665-6\"><em>Mr. George W. Kretsinger </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b665-7\">Mb. Justice Blatchford,</author>\n<p id=\"A6D\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The volumes- of law reports of which the plaintiff claims a' copyright are in the usual form of such works. Each volume consists of a title-page, of a statement of the entry of copyright, of a list of the judges composing the court, of a table of the cases reported in the volume, in alphabetical order, of a head-note or syllabus to each opinion, with the names of the' respective counsel, and their arguments in some cases, and a statement of facts, sometimes embodied in the opinion and sometimes preceding it, and of an index, arranged alphabetically, and consisting substantially of a reproduction of the head-notes. Of this matter, all but the opinions of the court and what is contained in those opinions is the work of the reporter and the result of intellectual labor on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">The broad proposition is contended for by the defendants, that these law reports are public property, and are not susceptible of private ownership, and cannot be the subject of copyright under the legislation of Congress. It is urged that Mr. Freeman, the reporter, was a public officer, whose office was created by chapter 29 of the Bevised Statutes of Illinois of 1845, which enacted as follows, in regard to the Supreme Court and the reporter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u201c Sec. 20. The court shall appoint some person learned in the law to minute down and make report of all the principal matters, drawn out at length, with the opinion of the court, ,in all such cases as may be tried before the said court; and the said reporter shall have a right to use the original written opinion after it shall have been recorded by the clerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">\u201cSeo. 21. The reporter, before entering upon his duties, shall be sworn by some one of the justices of the Supreme Court faithfully to perform the duties of his said office. He may, for misconduct in office, neglect of duty, incompetency, or other cause shown, to be entered of record, be removed from office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201cSec. 22. It shall be the duty of the reporter to deliver to the Secretary of State, as soon as convenient after- publication, such number of copies of the respective volumes of the reports of said court as may be necessary to enable the said secretary to distribute the same in the manner provided in the- following section, together with one hundred copies in addition, to be deposited in the secretary\u2019s office for the use of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Section 23 provided for the distribution of the volumes by the Secretary of State, and \u00a7 24 provided, that, upon the delivery of the requisite number of any volume, the Secretary of State should deliver to the reporter a certificate specifying the number of copies which had been so delivered, and that such certificate should entitle the reporter to a warrant drawn by the auditor of public accounts upon the treasury for an amount, for those volumes, at the price for which the books should be sold to individuals, provided the price should not exceed the ordinary price of law books of the same description, to be determined by the auditor, treasurer and Secretary of State. These statutory provisions were amended in 1863, by making the term of office of the reporter six' years, and in 1865 it was enacted that the price of the volumes to be delivered' to the Secretary of State should be $6 each. The reporter was given a salary, by law, in 1877, of $6000 a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">. It is further contended, that Mr. Freeman, in preparing the official edition of the reports, was not an author, within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>the meaning of the act of Congress, and that, it was not intended by that act that he should assert a monopoly in the result of his official labors.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">But, although there can be no copyright in the opinions of the judges, or in the work done by them in their official capacity as judges, <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Manchester, ante, </em>244, yet there is no ground of public policy on which a reporter who prepares a volume of law reports, of the character of those in this case, can, in the absence of a prohibitory statute, be debarred from obtaining a copyright for the volume, which will covqp the matter which is the result of his intellectual labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In the present case there was no legislation of the State of Illinois which forbade the obtaining of such a copyright by Mr. Fr\u00e9einan, or which directed that the proprietary right which would exist in him should pass to the State of Illinois, or that the copyright should be taken out for or in the name of the State, as the assignee of\u2019 such proprietary right. Even though a reporter may be a sworn public officer, appointed by the authority of the government which creates the court of which he is made the reporter, and even though he may be paid a fixed salary for his labors, yet, in the absence of any inhibition forbidding him to take a copyright for that which is the lawful subject of copyright in him, or reserving a copyright to the government as the assignee of his work, he is not deprived of the privilege of taking out a copyright, which would otherwise exist. There is, in such case, a tacit assent by the government to Iris exercising such privilege. The universal practical construction has been that such right exists, unless it is affirmatively forbidden or taken away ; and the right has been exercised by numerous reporters, officially appointed, made sworn public officers, and paid a salary under the governments both of States and of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">This question was, it is true, not directly adjudged in <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>8 Pet. 591. In that case the owners of the copyrights' of Wheaton\u2019s Reports of the Supreme Court of the United States brought a suit in equity against Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Peters for publishing and selling a volume of his Condensed Reports of the Supreme Court. The bill was dismissed by th\u00e9 Circuit Court. On an appeal by the plaintiffs to this court one of the points urged by the defendants was,- that reports of the decisions of this court, published by a reporter .appointed under the authority of an act of Congress, were not within the provisions of the law for the protection of copyrights. This court held (i) that the plaintiffs could assert no'common law right to the exclusive privilege of publishing, but must sustain such right, if at all, under the legislation of Congress; (2) that under such legislation there must have been, in order to secure the copyright, a compliance with the provisions of the statute in regard to the publication in a newspaper of a copy of the record of the title of the book, and. in regard to the d\u00e9livery of a copy of it, after publication, to the Secretary of State. The court remanded th\u00bf cas\u00e9 to the Circuit Court for a trial by a jury, as to whether there had. been a compliance with the above-named requisites of the act of Congress.-' In a note by Mr. Peters, at page 618 off the report of the case, he stat\u00e9s that he has been informed that the court did not consider the point whether reports of the decisions of the court, published by a reporter appointed under the authority of an act of Congress, were within the provisions of the law for the protection of copyrights.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">When the suit was brought, Mr. Wheaton had published thp twelve volumes of his copyrighted reports. The allegation of the bill was, that the volume complained of, published by-Mr. Peters, contained, all the reports of cases found in the first volume of' Wheaton\u2019s Reports. It appears from the report of the case, and the record in it, that Mr. Wheaton had published his first volume in 1816, and his twelfth volume in 1827. From March 3d, 1817, for three years,- the reporter had a salary of $1000 a year, and the same salary from May 15th, 1820, to March 3d, 1826, and for three years from February 22d, 1827. The' decree of this court, providing for-a trial by a jury, (p. 698,) covered the entire twelve volumes of Wheaton\u2019s Reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">If this court had been of opinion that there could not haye <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>been \u00e1 lawful copyright in the volumes of Wheaton\u2019s Eeports, it would have been useless to send the case back to the Circuit Court for an inquiry whether the conditions precedent to the obtaining of a lawful copyright, under the act of Congress, had been complied with, especially in view of the fact that \u2022 the opinion of the court concludes (p. 668) with this statement: \u201c It may be proper to remark .that the court are unanimously of opinion that no reporter has or can have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by this court; and that the judges thereof cannot confer on any reporter any such right.\u201d Therefore, the only matter in Wheaton\u2019s Eeports which could have been the subject of the. copyrights in regard to which the jury trial was directed, was the matter not embracing the written opinions of the court, namely, the title-page, table of cases, head-notes, statement's of facts, arguments of counsel, and index. Such work of the reporter, which may be -the lawful subject of copyright, comprehends also the order of arrangement of the cases, the division of the reports into volumes, the numbering and paging of the volumes, the table of the cases cited in the opinidns, (where such table is made,) and the subdivision of the index into appropriate, condensed titles,involving the distribution of the subjects of the various head-notes, and cross-references, where such exist. A publication of the mere opinions of the court, in a volume, without more, would be comparatively valueless to any one.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The case of <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>Peters </em>was decided at January term, 1834. In <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>1 Story, 11, in 1839, Mr. Justice Story, in speaking of the question as to how far a person was at liberty to extract the substance of copyrighted law reports, says, p. 20: <em>\u201c </em>In the case of <em>Wheaton v. Peters, </em>8 Peters\u2019 R. 591, the same subject was considered very much at large. It was not doubted by the court that Mr. Peters\u2019 Condensed Eeports would have been an infringement of Mri Wheaton\u2019s copyright, supposing that copyright properly secured under the act, if the opinions of the court had been or could be the proper subject of the private copyright by Mr. Wheaton. But it was held, that the opinions of the court, being published under the authority of Congress, were not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>propei\u2019 subject of private copyright. But it was as little doubted by the court, that Mr. Wheaton had a copyright in his own marginal notes, and in the arguments of counsel as prepared and arranged in his work. The cause went back to the Circuit Court for the purpose of further inquiries as to the fact, whether the requisites of the act of Congress had been complied with, or not, by Mr. Wheaton. This would have been wholly useless and nugatory, unless Mr. Wheaton\u2019s marginal notes and abstracts of arguments could have been the subject of a copyright; (for that was the work which could be the subject of a copyright;) so that if Mr. Peters had violated that right, Mr. Wheaton was entitled to redress.\u201d This seems to us to be a proper view of the decision in <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>Peters; </em>and that decision is as applicable where a reporter receives a compensation or salary from the government, as where he does not, in the absence of any restriction against his obtaining a copyright.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In the present case, although Mr. Freeman, during the period of his preparation of volumes 32 to 46, received no direct salary from the State, it is contended by the defendants that he received from the State compensation for his services, through the purchase by it, under a statute, of copies of his volume at a stated price of $6 per copy for 553 copies of each volume, and that this was substantially the payment of a salary to him by the State. But, as stated before, in the view we take of the case, the question of a salary or no salary has no bearing upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The general proposition that the reporter of a volume of law reports can obtain a copyright for it as an author, and that such copyright will cover the parts of the book of which he is the author, although he has no exclusive right in the judicial opinions published, is supported by authority. Curtis on Copyright, 131, 132; <em>Butterworth </em>v. Robinson, 5 Ves. 709; <em>Cary </em>v. Longman, 1 East, 358, and note, 362; <em>Mawman </em>v.

B. 491; <em>Jarrold </em>v. <em>Houlston, </em>3 Kay <em>&amp; </em>Johns. 708, 719, 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>It is further contended by the defendants, that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief in respect to volumes 32 to 46, because he did not comply with the conditions of the statute -concerning copyrights. Those volumes were all of them published while the act of Congress of February 3, 1831, c. 16, 4 Stat. 436, was in force. The 4th section of that act provided that no person should be entitled to the benefit of the act, unless he should, before publication, deposit a printed copy of the title of the book intended.to be copyrighted in the clerk\u2019s office of the District Court of the district wherein the author or proprietor should reside. The section also required, that the clerk should record such title forthwith, in a book, in words prescribed in the section, giving a copy of the title, under the seal of the court, to the author on proprietor, whenever he should require .the same. It also provided, that the author or proprietor should, within three months from the publication of the book, deliver or cause to be delivered a copy of the same-to the clerk of the District Court, and -that it should be the duty of the clerk, at'.least once in every year, to transmit a certified list of all such records of copyright, including the titles so recorded, and the dates of record, and also all the copies of books deposited in his office, to the Secretary of State, to be deposited in his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Although, under \u00a7 6 of the same act, the exclusive right to the copyright vests upon the recording of the title of the book, and runs for the prescribed period from that date, and although the right of action for infringement, under \u00a7 6, also accrues at that time, yet it is quite clear, that, under \u00a7 4, in respect at least to suits brought after three months from the publication of the book, it must be shown, as a' condition precedent to the right to maintain the suit, that a dopy of the book was delivered to the clerk of the District Court within three' months from the publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Section 5 of the same act provides, that no person shall be entitled to the benefit of the act, unless he shall give information of copyright being secured, by causing to be inserted in the published copies, on the title-page of the book or the page immediately following, the words: \u201cEntered -according to act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>of Congress, in the year-, by A. B., in the clerk\u2019s office of the District Court of-.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Undoubtedly, the three conditions prescribed by the statute, namely, the.deposit before publication of the printed copy of the title of the book, the giving of information of the copyright by the insertion of the notice on the title-page or the next page, and the depositing of a copy of the book within 'three months after the publication, are conditions precedent to the perfection of the copyright. <em>Wheaton </em>v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591; <em>Merrell </em>v. <em>Tice, </em>104 U. S. 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">It is contended by the defendants that the plaintiff has not proved the date of the publication of any of the volumes in question; that the only proof he has offered is in the form of certificates by the clerk of the District Court, showing the dates of the filing of the printed titles of the volumes; and that he has failed to show whether such filing preceded or followed the publication of the volumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The record shows\" that the plaintiff, in respect of volumes 32 to 46, offered in evidence fifteen certificates made by William H. Bradley, clerk of the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois, each of which was in the following form, except as to the number of the volume, and its.contents, and except that, as to volumes 39 to 43, the name \u201cEugene B. Myers,\u201d and as to volumes 44 to 46, the name \u201c E. B. Myers,\u201d was substituted for the names \u201c E. B.

The certificate to the copy of the title bears date in each case, .the same day as the deposit of the title. In each case, the memorandum of the deposit of the work was in the same form as that in regard to volume 32, with the necessary change of date, except that in regard to volumes 35, 36, 12, 13, and 11, the memorandum was, \u201cWork deposited in my office,\u201d with the date. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\"><em>When </em>the certificates were offered in evidence, the defend-' ants objected to the introduction of that portion of each of the papers, at the bottom thereof, which purported to show the date when the volume was deposited, on the ground that the same constituted no part of the certificate, but was a mere' anonymous statement; that it did not appear when or by whom the same was made; and that the evidence was incom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>petent to show the date of the deposit. The objection was overruled by the court, and the defendants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">They also objected to the introduction of the paper pertaining to volume 34, on the ground that, even if the memorandum at the bottom of the paper was competent evidence of the date when the volume was deposited, the deposit was made at the same time with the deposit of the printed title-page, namely, October 23, 1866; that it did not appear that the title-page was filed in advance of the publication and the work deposited after publication; and that the paper was, therefore, incompetent as evidence. The objection was overruled by. the court, and the defendants excepted to such ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The defendants also objected to the introduction of the paper as to volume 35, for the reason that it purported to show that the title of the volume was deposited on the 28th of January, 1867, while the printed notice on the back of the title-page of that volume stated that the copyright was entered \u201c in the year 1866; \u201d and that, because of such variance, the paper was incompetent as evidence. The objection was overruled by the court, and the defendants \u2022 excepted to the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">These various objections are now urged by the .defendants, and it is contended that the memorandum of the date of the deposit of the work, written on the certificate, and purporting to be signed by the clerk, is not. in the form of a certificate by the clerk of the fact and the date of the deposit of the book, and is not competent proof of such fact or date, and is not attested by the official seal of the clerk; and that no proof was offered as to the genuineness of the signature purporting to be that of the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The statute makes no provision for the keeping by the clerk of a record of the-deposit of the book with him after publication. The memorandum of the deposit of the book, signed in each case by the clerk, appears to have been written, in each case, on the certified copy, furnished to the proprietor, by the clerk, of the record of the deposit of the title of the book. The two things were thus connected together by the act of the officer whose duty it was to receive both the deposit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>of the title and the deposit of the book. The. paper amounts to a sufficient certificate by him of the fact and the date of the deposit of the book. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, which it was open to the defendants to introduce, it must be presumed that the deposit of the title was made in each case before publication, and, also, that in every instance where the work purports to have been deposited within three months after the date of the deposit of the title, it was deposited within three months after publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">So, also, in the case of volume 34, it must be equally presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the deposit of the title was made before publication, and that the deposit of the work, though made on the same day with the deposit of the title; was not made prior to publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In the case of volume 32, however, although it is to be presumed that the title was deposited before publication, yet, as the work was deposited five months and five days after the deposit of the title, it cannot be presumed that such deposit of the work was , made within three months after publication. The evidence therefore fails as to volume 32; but it is sufficient, <em>prima facie, </em>as to all the other volumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Section 4 of the act of 1831 requires the clerk to give a copy of the title as deposited and recorded, under the seal of the court, to the author or proprietor who deposits it whenever he shall require the same. Necessarily, such copy is sufficient <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the deposit of the title. Such a copy was given in regard to each of the volumes in question here. On each of these papers the memorandum of the fact and of the date of' the deposit of the work, signed by the clerk, was written. The clerk was the officer required to receive the deposit of the work. He was not required to keep a record of such deposit; and he was required to transmit the works so deposited, to theA Secretary of State, at least once a year. The memorandum in the present case of the fact and date of the deposit, purporting to be signed by the clerk, must be regarded as a sufficient <em>prima facie </em>certificate of such deposit, and as competent evidence of the fact and of the date, without further proof of the signature of the clerk, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>being on the same paper with his signature as clerk to the certificate of the copy of the record of the deposit of the title, and it being open to the defendants to show that his signature to the memorandum was not genuine..</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We do not think the present case is governed by the decision in <em>Merrell </em>v. <em>Tice, </em>104 U. S. 557. In that case the librarian of .Congress liad given a certificate to a copy of the record of the deposit of the title of the book. On that paper was written a memorandum in these words: \u201c Two copies of the above publication deposited\u201d on a date given. This memorandum was not signed by the librarian of Congress. This court held; the memorandum not to be competent as proof of the deposit of the two copies of the book, on the ground that it was not a certificate of that fact. We are of opinion that the memorandum in the present case, purporting to be signed by the same clerk, is substantially a certificate of the fact and date of the .deposit of the work, written by him on the same paper with the other'Certificate; and that it is not open to the objection which obtained in the case of <em>Merrell </em>v. <em>Tice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The defendants offered in evidence certificates made by <em>the </em>auditor of public accounts and by the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois, showing that, on the 2d of October, 1865,' Mr. Freeman delivered to the Secretary of State, for the use of the State, 553 copies' of volume 32, required by law to be furnished by the reporter, and, on the 23d of October, 1866, 553 copies of volume 34. The introduction of this evidence was objected to by the plaintiff, on the ground that the papers constituted no evidence of the-publication of either of the volumes, and were incompetent. The objection was sustained by the court, and the defendants excepted to the ruling. The exclusion of these papers\" is assigned as error. The papers also show the payment by the State, for each set of the copies, at the rate of $6 per volume. As the delivery of the copies of volume 32 to the Secretary of State, for the use of the State, took place on the 2d of October, 1865, and the work was not deposited in the clerk\u2019s office until the 17th of January, 1866,' it is contended that such delivery of the copies to the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>was a publication of the volume, and that the deposit of it did not take place until three months and fifteen days after publication. We think this assignment of error must prevail; that the evidence offered was competent; that the delivery of the copies for the use of the State was a publication of the volume ; that the deposit of the work was not made in time; and that the copyright of volume 32 therefore fails. But we do not think the .same objection is tenable as to volume 34, although the 553 copies of that volume were delivered on October 23, 1866, and the title and the work were both of them deposited on that day. It must be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the deposit of the title preceded the publication, and that the delivery of the copies to the Secretary of State preceded the deposit of the work in the clerk\u2019s office. Where the three things are prescribed, by the statute to be done in consecutive order, and all three appear to have been done on the same day, it will be presumed that the statute was complied with, leaving <em>the prima facie </em>evidence open to be rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In regard to volume 35, the title was deposited January 28, 1867, and the notice printed in the volume purports to show that the copyright was entered in 1866. The statute required that each copy of the book should have inserted in it a statement of the year the copyright was entered. It is sufficient to say, in answer to this objection, that the variance must be regarded as immaterial, inasmuch as the statement that the title was recorded in an earlier year than the actual year, being conclusive on the person taking the copyright, could cause no injury to any other person or to the public, because the copyright would expire in twenty-eight years from the expiration of the year stated in the notice in the book, and not in twenty-eight years from the time of the recording of the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">In regard to volume 36, it is objected that the certificate of the clerk shows that the printed title was deposited by \u201cE. B. Myers &amp; Chandler,\u201d and that the printed notice of the entry of copyright^jn the volume as published purports to show that the copyright was entered by E. B. Myers alone. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>We think that, under the circumstances of the case, as the printed notice contained the name of E. B. Myers, die variance-was immaterial, and that the statute was substantially complied with, particularly as it is not shown that the defendants were misled by the variance or induced to do or omit anything because of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">It is also urged by the defendants that the court erred in finding the title to the volumes to be in the plaintiff, because he failed to prove any written assignment or transfer to him from Mr. Freeman as to any of the volumes, or from Chandler as to his alleged interest -in volumes 32 to 38, or to prove any means through which he derived title\u2019 to any of the volumes. By section 4 of the act of 1831. the proprietor of a book, as well as its author, could obtain a copyright, and provision was made, in the form of record given in-\"that, section, for a claim by the depositor of the title of the book as its proprietor, and for the deposit of the copy of the book \"by the proprietor. While, after the obtaining of a copyright, a written assignment may be necessary \u25a0 to convey title to it, or a written license to give a right to reproduce copies of the copyrighted book, we perceive no reason why Myers or Myers <em>&amp; </em>Chandler could not become the owners by parol\" transfer of whatever-right Mr. Freeman, prior to the taking of the copyright, had to convey. While the work was in manuscript no \u25a0 written transfer of such manuscript from Mr. Freeman was-necessary, because the copyright had not yet been taken. Moreover, the defendants, in all their transactions with the plaintiff, recognized his title to the copyrights of volumes 32 <em>to </em>38, as to which the titles had been deposited by E. B. Myers &amp; Chandler, and parol evidence that the plaintiff owned the copyrights of volumes 32 to 46, at the time the infringements were committed, was introduced without objection, and was sufficient <em>prima facie </em>evidence until rebutted. If the defendants had objected to this parol evidence the production \u2018of the written assignment from Chandler, set up in the bill, could have been required.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">It is also objected that the plaintiff acquiesced in, consented to, and ratified the publication of the volumes by the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ants, and was guilty of laches in bringing his suit. The.evb . dence on this subject is voluminous, and it would not be profitable, either for the purposes of this case or as a guide for any other case, to discuss it at length.' We are of opinion that neither of these defences is established; that the plaintiff did not consent to the republication of the volumes by the. defendants; that he never abandoned his copyrights, or consented to surrender them without consideration, or gave the defendants cause to understand that he did so or would do so; that he never acquiesced in any infringement of his copyrights by the defendants; and that he was not guilty of lach.es in seeking relief. The defendants recognized his copyrights in volumes 32 to 38, by offering to purchase them, and thebe was considerable negotiation on that subject. This fact .is inconsistent with consent and abandonment, and the other evidence in the case is inconsistent with any abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">It is also contended by the defendants, that each of'the volumes as published by them was a new and independent work, not copied from that of the plaintiff, but prepared by the original labor, of the editors employed by the defendants. While it is admitted that volumes 32 to 38,* as published by the defendants, w-ere, with the exception of the foot-notes, \u25a0prepared entirely from the plaintiff\u2019s volumes, it is contended that volumes 39 and 41 to 46 were, with the exceptions of the opinions of the judges, prepared from the records and files of the.Supreme Court of Illinois. The evidence on the subject of infringement is very full and minute. It is impossible for us to discuss it at length, and we must content ourselves with stating, as a' general result, that we concur in the views stated by Judge Drummond, in his decision in the Circuit Court, in \u2022regard to volumes.32 to 38. He says, (10 Bissell, 139, 147:)' \u201cIn considering the question of infringement of the copyright -by the defendants, it must be borne in mind what is the character of the work. They are reports of the decisions of \"the Supreme Court of this State, to which no one can have, a \u2022copyright; but he may have to the head-notes and statements of each case, and of the arguments of counsel. \u2022 These head-notes and statements which have been made are in themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>an abridgment; the one of the opinions of the court, consisting of the principles of law decided, and the other an abstract of the facts and of the arguments. It should also be stated that the volumes of the defendants, as edited by those employed by them, are very much condensed, as compared with Mr. Freeman\u2019s reports, and yet the paging of the \u2022 volumes is substantially the same throughout, so that the cases in the corresponding volumes appear on the same page. The list of cases which precedes each report is the same. The defendants Ewell and Den slow, who were employed by. the other defendants to annotate these decisions or reports, both state, upon examinatioh, that their work was independent' of that of Mr;Freeman; but it appears from the evidence that all the volumes of Mr. Freeman were used in thus editing or annotating; and although it may have been their intention to make an independent work, it is apparent, from a comparison of the Freeman volumes, and those of the defendants, that the former were used throughout -by the . editors employed by the defendants. It is true that in each volume, perhaps in the majority of cases, there is the appearance of independent labor performed by them, without regard to the volumes of Mr. Freeman; but yet in every volume it is also apparent that Mr. Freeman\u2019s volumes were used; in some instances words and sentences copied without change, in others, changed only in form; and the conclusion is irresistible, that for a large portion of the work performed in behalf of the defendants, the editors did not resort to original sources of information, but obtained that information from the volumes of Mr. Freeman. Undoubtedly, it was competent for an.editor to take the opinions of the Supreme Court,, and possibly from the volumes of Mr. Freeman, and make an independent work; but it is always attended with great risk for a person to sit down, and,' with the copyrighted volume of law reports before him, undertake to make an independent report of a case. It is not difficult to do this, going to the original sources of information, to the decisions of the court, the briefs of counsel, the records on file in the clerk\u2019s office, without regard to the regular volumes of reports: Any one who ha,s tried it can easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>understand the difference between the head-notes of two persons, equally good lawyers, and equally critical in the examination of an opinion, where they are made up independent of each, other; and, bearing in mind this fact, it seems to be beyond controversy, that although in many, and perhaps most instances, there is a very considerable difference between the head-notes of the defendants\u2019 volumes and those of the' plaintiff, the latter have been freely used in the preparation of the former. I conclude, therefore, that the defendants have, in the preparation of those volumes, from 32 to 38 inclusive, of the Illinois Reports, used the volumes.of the plaintiff so as to interfere with his copyright.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">So, also, we concur with the conclusions of Judge Drummond in regard to volumes 39 to 16. He says, (20 Fed. Rep. 411:) \u201c The present inquiry is limited to what is alleged to be an infringement by the defendants of volumes 39 to 16, inclusive, of Mr. Freeman\u2019s Illinois Reports. Yolume 40 seems never to have been regularly published like the other volumes, although the evidence of the infringement of the plaintiff\u2019s copyright in that volume is perhaps stronger than that applicable to any of the other volumes named. Upon comparing parts of each of the volumes, those of the complainant and of the defendants, one with the other, I think there can be no doubt that in some respects, in each case, the Freeman volume has been used by the defendants in the head-notes, the statements of facts, and the arguments of counsel. That is, there are certain unmistakable indicia, that in every volume prepared by the defendants they have not confined themselves solely to the original sources of information, namely, the opinions of the judges, the records, and the arguments of counsel.\u201d He also says, (p. 412:) \u201c The fact appears to be, and indeed it is not a subject of controversy, that in arranging the order of cases, and in the paging of the different volumes, the Freeman edition has been followed by the defendants ; but, while this is so, I should not feel inclined, merely on that account and independent of other matters to give a decree to the plaintiff, although it js claimed that the arrangement of the cases and the' paging of the volumes are protected by a copyright, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Undoubtedly, in some cases, where are involved labor, talent, judgment, the classification and disposition of subjects in a book entitle it to a copyright. But the arrangement of law cases and the paging of the book may depend simply on the will of the printer, of the reporter, or publisher, or the order in which the cases have been decided, or upon other accidental circumstances. Here the object on the part of the defendants seems to have been that there should not be confusion in the references and examination of cases ; but the arrangement oteases and the paging of the volumes is a labor inconsiderable in' itself, and I regard it, not as an independent matter, but in connection with other similiarities existing between the two editions, when I say, taking the whole together, the Freeman volumes have been used in editing and publishing the defendants\u2019 volumes.\u201d It may be added, that one of the most significant evidences of infringement exists frequently in the defendants\u2019 volumes, namely, the copying of errors made by-Mr. Freeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The next objection urged is, that the defendants were compelled to produce their books and papers on the accounting before the master, the plaintiff having sought a forfeiture of the copies of volumes <em>32 </em>to <em>38; </em>and that the defendants were thereby compelled to produce evidence against themselves, in aid of such forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The original bill prays for a decree that all of the copies published by the defendants of volumes 32 to 38 be forfeited to the plaintiff, and that the defendants be required to deliver the same to him. 'The supplemental bill contains no such prayer in regard to volumes 39 and 41 to 46, but contains a prayer for general relief. The cross-bill and-the answer to it show that'Myers brought an action of replevin against Callaghan &amp; Co., to recover as forfeited the copies of the infringing volumes 32 to '38. The final decree shows that the cross-suit was not brought to a hearing with the original suit, On the contrary, the final decree reserves for consideration and determination, on the hearing of the cross-bill, the rights of the parties thereunder, and their rights in respect to the action of replevin to recover possession of the unsold copies of vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>umes 32 to 38. Although, under the provisions of the interlocutory decree in respect to volumes 32 to 38, the defendants were required to produce their account-books and papers before the master, and were examined in regard to them, yet the final decree did not award any forfeiture, and so no injury has resulted to the defendants, by reason of such provision of the interlocutory decree, or by reason of any action thereunder. Irrespective of this, it. is determined by the case of <em>Stevens </em>v. Gladding, 17 How. 447, that the penalties given by \u00a7 7 of the copyright act of 1831 cannot be enforced in a suit in equity. The provision of the interlocutory decree for an examination of the defendants in regard to the subject of inquiry, and for the production by them of their account-books and papers, is the usual provision in an interlocutory decree in a suit in equity' for the infringement of a copyright. As the forfeiture of the volumes could not be obtained by this suit, although prayed for. in the billj the evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We now come to the question of damages. It is contended that the Circuit Court erred in disallowing to the defendants a credit for stereotyping volumes 32 to 46. Both of the masters refused to allow credit for the cost of stereotyping. Stereotyping Was not a necessary incident of printing and. publishing, as type-setting was. It was resorted to by the defendants to enable them the more successfully and profitably to infringe, by dispensing with the necessity of resetting the type for every new edition, and thus \u2022 reducing the cost of multiplying copies in the future. \u25a0 The stereotype plates were made without the consent of the plaintiff, and if credit is allowed for them the plaintiff is compelled to buy and pay for them, when they are useless to him, and when he has stereotyped for himself volumes 32 to 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">It is also contended, that both of the masters erred in disallowing a credit to the defendants for the amount paid to the different members of their firm for their services, in the way; of salaries, as a part of the expense of conducting their business, being the amount of about $12,000 a year during the period in controversy. These amounts were drawn by the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>defendants under the partnership agreement, as family and personal expenses. We do not think that the value of the time of an infringer, or the expense of the living of himself or his family, while he is engaged in violating the rights of the plaintiff, is to be allowed to him as a credit, and thus the plaintiff be compelled to pay the defendant for his time and expenses while engaged in infringing the copyright. If the defendants, instead of employing others to do the work, had chosen to do it themselves, they might as'well have made a charge, and claimed to have been credited for it, of so much a month or a year for their services in preparing the infringing volumes. <em>Elizabeth </em>v. <em>Pavement Co., </em>97 U. S. 126, 139. The case stands on a different footing from that of the salaries of the managing officers of a corporation, as in <em>Rubber Company </em>v. <em>Goodyear, </em>9 Wall. 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The defendants also object that the master, Mr. Bennett, should have found the number of volumes sold by the defendants to have been 103 less, and that the total number of bound volumes on hand found by him was erroneous, as also was the total number of volumes found by him to have been on hand unsold. The exceptions to the master\u2019s report in these respects substantially complain that the master found too many volumes to have been sold, by 103. . We do not perceive any error in the above particulars. The master, Mr. Bennett, rightfully excluded a credit for the cost of producing copies of the volumes- which the defendants did not sell. There were no profits from copies not sold, and, therefore, there could have been nothing to charge against such profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In' regard to the exceptions to the report of Mr. Bennett, that he found the average selling price of the defendants\u2019 volumes to be $4,464 each, instead of $4.34, and that he found their gross receipts from sales of the infringing volumes to have been $10,231.48, instead of $9459.37, wre are of opinion that the selling price found and the gross receipts found were not too high.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">We do not concur in the view of the defendants that there were no net receipts or profits on the sales of volumes 39 to 46, or in the view that the master, Mr. Bennett, erred in refusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>credit to the defendants for the amount paid by them for editorial work in preparing their volumes, or in the view that the Circuit Court erred in allowing the $340.70 as profits on the resales of the 156 volumes mentioned in the first'and second exceptions of the plaintiff to the report of the master, Mr. Bennett.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In regard to the 156 copies, they were volumes which had been already sold by the defendants, and which they purchased as second-hand books and resold. The master, had held that, as he had charged the defendants with the profits on the first sale of these volumes, the profits on their resale could not be charged against them. The Circuit Court .overruled this view and, as we think, properly. The sale of the volume originally prevented the purchase from the plaintiff of a lawful volume, and the sale of the same infringing volume a second time prevented the purchase from the plaintiff of another lawful volume. The plaintiff was thus twice injured by the acts of the defendants, and the sales of the second-hand volumes must be accounted for as if they were first sales. <em>Birdsell </em>v. Shaliol, 112 U. S. 485, 487, 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The Circuit Court held that the' master approximated as nearly as could be done to the true amount, in fixing the selling price at $4,464 per volume. We concur in this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In regard to the eighth exception of the defendants to the report of the master, Mr. Bennett, that he had credited the defendants, in their expense account, with only 12 per cent on their gross sales, instead of 17 per cent, the Circuit Court held that, as Mr. Bennett had allowed 12 per cent and Mr. Bishop had allowed 12\u00a7 per cent for such average expenses, and those conclusions were so nearly alike, the court would allow their findings in this regard to stand. We concur in this view, and also in the conclusion of the Circuit Court sustaining the findings of the two masters as to the average price per volume at which the defendants sold the volumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">In regard to the general question of the profits to be accounted for by the defendants, as to the volumes in question, the only proper rule to be adopted is to deduct from the selling price the actual and legitimate manufacturing cost. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>volume contains matter to which a copyright could not properly'extend, incorporated with matter proper to be covered by a copyright, the two necessarily going together when the volume is sold, as a unit, and it being impossible to separate the profits on the one from the profits'on the other, and the lawful matter being useless without the unlawful, it is the defendants who are responsible for having blended the lawful \u2022 with the unlawful, and they must abide the consequences, on the same principle that he who has wrongfully produced- a confusion of goods must alone suffer. As was said by Lord Eldon, in <em>Mawman </em>v. <em>Tegg, </em>2 Russell, 385, 391: \u201cIf the parts which have been copied cannot be separated from those which are original, without destroying the use and value of the original m\u00e1tter, he who has made an improper use of that which did not belong to him' must suffer the consequences of so doing. If a man mixes what belongs to him with what belongs to me, and the mixture be forbidden by the law, he must again separate them, and. he must bear all the mischief and loss which the separation may occasion. .If an individual chooses in any work to mix my literary matter with his own, he must be restrained from publishing the literary matter which belongs to me; and if the parts of the work cannot be separated, and if by that means the injunction, which restrained the publication of my literary matter, prevents also the publication of his own literary matter, he has only himself to blame.\u201d The present is one of those cases in which the value of the book depends on its completeness and. integrity. It is sold as a book, not as the fragments of a book. In such a case, as the profits result from the sale of. the book as a whole, the owner of the copyright will be entitled to recover the entire profits on the sale of the book, if he elects that remedy. <em>Elizabeth </em>v. <em>Pavement Co., </em>97 U. S. 126, 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In considering the exceptions of the defendants to the masters\u2019 reports in matters of fact, questioning the accuracy of their conclusions in respect to the amount of the defendants\u2019 profits, we have observed the rule recognized and affirmed in <em>Tilghman </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>125 U. S. 136, 149, that, in dealing with such exceptions, \u201cthe conclusions of the master, depending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>upon the weighing of conflicting testimony, have every reasonable presumption in their favor, and are not to be set aside or modified unless there clearly appears to have been error or mistake on his part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">On the whole case we are of opinion that the final decree was- correct, except in respect of volume 32. The amount of damages reported by the master, Mr. Bishop, as to that volume, and allowed by the final decree as part of the $6986.05, was $926.66. That sum is disallowed and must be deducted. The other items of recovery in the decree were proper. The injunction as to volume 32 must be vacated, and the appellee will recover his costs of this, court.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\"><em>The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed as to volume </em>32 <em>and is affirmed in all other respects; and the case is remanded to that </em>court, <em>with a direction to correct the decree in the panticula/rs,above </em>indicated, <em>and to- take suchfwrther proceedings as may be according to law and not inconsistent with this opinion.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
