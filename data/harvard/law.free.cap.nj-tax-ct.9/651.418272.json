The taxing district appeals that portion of the judgment which reduced the 1983 added assessment. The taxpayer cross-appeals from that portion of the judgment which set the 1984 assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">We affirm for essentially those reasons set forth in Judge Lasser\u2019s reported opinion. We conclude Judge Lasser properly applied appropriate principles of law and that his findings and conclusions are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965). Moreover, we find to be clearly without merit taxpayer\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>tention that Judge Lasser\u2019s decision violates the New Jersey Constitution requirement that all property be assessed according to the same standard of value.
