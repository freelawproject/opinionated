The defendant was sixteen years old at the time he was arrested and charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The defendant was on probation for a conviction of larceny in the third degree at the time he committed the underlying crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 18, 2008, when he was eighteen years old, the defendant, with the assistance of counsel, entered into a plea agreement with the state. The defendant agreed to plead guilty under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the crime of accessory to manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-55a and 53a-8 in exchange for a sentence of eighteen years incarceration. On March 11, 2009, the court sentenced the defendant in accordance with the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 15, 2015, the defendant filed an amended motion to correct an illegal sentence, wherein he claimed that the sentencing court did not take into consideration his age at the time he committed the offense and therefore violated his eighth amendment right against cruel and\n   unusual punishment. He also claimed that, pursuant to No. 15-84, \u00a7 2, of the 2015 Public Acts (P.A. 15-84),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court retroactively must review the sentence to determine his parole eligibility. The defendant argued that P.A. 15-84,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   permit him to have a new sentencing hearing. The trial court concluded that the sentencing court was not required to consider the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors when sentencing the defendant because the sentence he received was not the equivalent of life in prison without the possibility of parole, and the sentencing court had no authority to resentence the defendant's future parole under P.A. 15-84. The court therefore dismissed the motion to correct an illegal sentence. The defendant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly dismissed his motion to correct an illegal sentence by failing to apply\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   retroactively and by failing to apply P.A. 15-84 so as to grant him a new sentencing hearing. The defendant's claims are controlled by our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488735\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/345/\">\n    323 Conn. 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488735\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/345/\">\n    151 A.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). \"Following the enactment of P.A. 15-84 ... the defendant is now eligible for parole and can no longer claim that he is serving a sentence of life imprisonment, or its equivalent, without parole. The eighth amendment, as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , does not prohibit a court from imposing a sentence of life imprisonment\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   the opportunity for parole for a juvenile homicide offender, nor does it require the court to consider the mitigating factors of youth before imposing such a sentence.

We therefore conclude that the court properly dismissed the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    The defendant claims that the court abused its discretion by dismissing his motion to correct.
