For 120 years, Vermont has recognized that the unsightliness of a thing, without more, does not render it a nuisance under the law. See\n   <em>\n    Woodstock Burial Ground Ass'n v. Hager\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4456316\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/68/488/\">\n    68 Vt. 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20A.%20431\">\n    35 A. 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1896). These consolidated cases require us to revisit whether Vermont law recognizes a cause of action for private nuisance based solely on aesthetic considerations. Appellants, a group of landowners from New Haven, appeal from the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendants, two solar energy companies. The landowners filed suit after their neighbors leased property to the solar companies for the purpose of constructing commercial solar arrays. According to the landowners, the solar arrays constitute a private nuisance because they have negatively affected the surrounding area's rural aesthetic, causing properties in their vicinity to lose value. The trial court consolidated the cases and, noting that this Court's precedent in\n   <em>\n    Hager\n   </em>\n   bars nuisance actions based purely on aesthetics, granted summary judgment to the solar companies. We uphold Vermont's long-standing rule barring private nuisance actions based upon aesthetic disapproval alone. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2.

Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no disputed material facts and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . There are no disputed material facts here. The sole question on appeal is whether Vermont law recognizes a private nuisance cause of action for alleged interference with property resting solely upon aesthetic considerations. Landowners argue the superior court erred in granting summary judgment for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. Landowners' primary argument is that \"[t]he ordinary comfort of human existence, as conceived in today's society, requires application of well-established nuisance law to claims based on aesthetics.\" According to landowners, Vermont's existing private nuisance law is broad enough to apply to aesthetic harm, and landowners argue that our only precedent to address this question,\n   <em>\n    Hager\n   </em>\n   , is \"no longer good law\" because it was decided\n   in 1896 and society has since come to recognize \"the importance of scenic resources in today's economy.\" Citing\n   <em>\n    Coty v. Ramsey Assocs.,\n   </em>\n   landowners argue that this Court \"foreshadowed the application of private nuisance law to claims based solely on aesthetics\" and invite us to join what we described in 1988 as \"a trend\" in other states towards acknowledging such aesthetic nuisance claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4783557\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/149/451/#p458\">\n    149 Vt. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 458,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4783557\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/149/451/#p458\">\n    546 A.2d 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 202 (1988). Additionally, landowners argue that aesthetic \"injury to the sensibilities and ordinary comfort\" of the average person is cognizable as nuisance and compensable by reference to diminution in property value. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. \"The law of private nuisance springs from the general principle that it is the duty of every person to make a reasonable use of his own property so as to occasion no unnecessary damage or annoyance to his neighbor.\"\n   <em>\n    Pestey v.

A substantial interference requires some showing that a plaintiff has suffered\n   harm to \"the actual present use of land\" or to \"interests in having the present use value of the land unimpaired by changes in its\n   <em>\n    physical\n   </em>\n   condition.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 821D cmt. b (emphasis added). A landowner's interest \"in freedom from annoyance and discomfort in the use of land is to be distinguished from the interest in freedom from emotional distress. The latter is purely an interest of personality and receives limited legal protection,\" since emotional distress is not an interference with the use or enjoyment of land.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . For example, there is a difference between, on the one hand, a complaint that solar panels are casting reflections and thereby interfering with a neighbor's ability to sleep or watch television and, on the other hand, the landowners' complaint in this case-that the solar panels are unattractive. The former involves a potential interference with the use or enjoyment of property, while the latter involves emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. Additionally, a complaint based solely on aesthetic disapproval cannot be measured using the unreasonableness standard that underpins nuisance law. This is because unlike traditional bases for nuisance claims-noise, light, vibration, odor-which can be quantified, the propriety of one neighbor's aesthetic preferences cannot be quantified because those preferences are inherently subjective.

The appellants find the solar panels unsightly, but other equally reasonable people may find them attractive. And while the landowners may be frustrated by the appearance of solar arrays adjacent to their property, \"they surely can see the converse mischief (and infringement) on a homeowner's property rights if homeowners could prevent their neighbors from construction deemed unattractive.\"\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"120880\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/76/521/#p534\">\n    76 Cal.App.4th at 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20491\">\n    90 Cal.Rptr.2d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Rankin v.

We believe the majority rule to be sound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10. Landowners' second argument is that they should be entitled to recover because the solar panels have allegedly caused their property value to fall. At the outset, landowners conceded at oral argument that they were not pursuing a claim that diminution in value in itself was sufficient to constitute a nuisance, but rather that the diminution in value should be considered only as a measure of damages for a nuisance otherwise proven. A concession at oral argument is binding, and the Court will treat a conceded argument as having been waived. See\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

Nevertheless, we briefly address the issue of diminution in property value alone as constituting nuisance to clarify the scope of private nuisance in Vermont in light of our decisions in\n   <em>\n    Hager\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

In\n   <em>\n    Uni-First\n   </em>\n   , a group of homeowners in Williamstown sought damages after state inspectors discovered that a chemical solvent from a drycleaner had entered the town's drinking water and fear of contamination caused a decline in property values.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2405063\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/229/\">\n    151 Vt. at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2405063\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/229/\">\n    558 A.2d at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal, this Court held that homeowners could sustain a private nuisance cause of action based on \"a public perception of widespread contamination\" that resulted in diminished property values.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 233-34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2405063\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/229/\">\n    558 A.2d at 963-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Landowners urge us to interpret\n   <em>\n    Uni-First\n   </em>\n   as permitting recovery in nuisance \"based on diminished property values caused by an adverse public perception, regardless of [the] accuracy\" of that perception. That reading of\n   <em>\n    Uni-First\n   </em>\n   , however, is too broad.\n   <em>\n    Uni-First\n   </em>\n   represents a narrow category of private nuisance claims involving chemical contamination that threatens to or in fact causes an unreasonable interference.

In\n   <em>\n    Uni-First\n   </em>\n   , the harm was not diminished property value but the \"actual and substantial\" threat of contamination, and the proper measure for damages was the diminution in value.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2405063\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/229/\">\n    151 Vt. at 233-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2405063\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/151/229/\">\n    558 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   963-64 ; see also\n   <em>\n    John Larkin, Inc. v.

In other words, a decrease in property value does not mean there has been an interference with that property's use, a requisite for a nuisance claim.

Additionally, a claim of nuisance based solely upon diminution in property value invites speculation, as \"[p]roperty values are affected by many factors; a decrease in market value does not mean there is a nuisance, any more than an increase means there is not.\"\n   <em>\n    Schneider Nat'l Carriers, Inc. v.

And such a rule of law would be one-sided: a plaintiff alleging\n   diminished property value because of activities on a neighbor's land-such as construction of an oddly-shaped house-would have a claim for damages, but a neighbor whose activities resulted in an increase in the property owner's value-such as construction of a palatial estate-would have no claim for contribution for the activity that increased property value. As with aesthetic concerns, allowing a cause of action in nuisance any time an activity on a neighbor's land has a negative impact on another's property value would likely lead to neighborly discord in the form of claims for damages by neighbors alleging neighboring activities have made their property less valuable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14. For the foregoing reasons, we reaffirm the rule from\n   <em>\n    Hager\n   </em>\n   that private nuisance law in Vermont does not encompass a cause of action for aesthetic harm alone, and the trial court therefore did not err as a matter of law when it granted the solar companies' motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    States that have addressed whether to recognize aesthetic nuisance have, broadly speaking, taken one of three approaches: bar aesthetic nuisance suits; recognize aesthetic nuisance only when the complained-of harm includes an element of traditional nuisance, such as noise, odor, light disruption from windmills, or a physical invasion; or recognize aesthetic nuisance. The majority of states to answer the question have declined to recognize aesthetic nuisance at all. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Yaffe v. City of Ft.

A handful of states have taken the approach of recognizing aesthetic nuisance only when the alleged aesthetic interference is accompanied by traditional elements of nuisance. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Leaf River Forest Prods., Inc. v. Ferguson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7451587\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/662/648/\">\n     662 So.2d 648\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Miss. 1995) ;\n    <em>\n     Burch v.

An even smaller number of states recognize aesthetic nuisance, and most of those states do so only in areas that are zoned for residential use. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Hay v. Stevens\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123482\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/16/\">\n     271 Or. 16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123482\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/16/\">\n     530 P.2d 37\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 39 (1975). Moreover, actions taken out of spite are different from traditional nuisance analysis. As we observed in\n    <em>\n     Coty\n    </em>\n    , \"the great majority of jurisdictions have held that where a defendant has acted solely out of malice or spite, such conduct is indefensible on social utility grounds, and nuisance liability attaches.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4783557\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/149/451/#p458\">\n     149 Vt. at 458\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4783557\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/149/451/#p458\">\n     546 A.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    202 (citing Prosser,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 89, at 598-99). Here, however, the landowners have not argued that the solar panels at issue were constructed out of spite or malice, and as such we need not address the role of aesthetics in the context of a spite case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
