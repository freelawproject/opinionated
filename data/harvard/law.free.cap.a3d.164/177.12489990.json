Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the State cannot relitigate an issue of fact that has been decided in a defendant's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case requires us to determine whether a plea of\n   <em>\n    autrefois acquit\n   </em>\n   or the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars a trial court from imposing at resentencing an enhanced sentence based on a prior conviction for a crime of violence after the trial court has previously imposed an enhanced sentence based on the same prior conviction, and an appellate court vacated the enhanced sentence due to insufficient evidence of the prior conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (\"the circuit court\"), a jury found Theodore Scott (\"Scott\"), Petitioner, guilty of, among other crimes, attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon. The State contended that Scott was subject to Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.) (\"CR\") \u00a7 14-101(d), which provided for an enhanced sentence for a defendant who was convicted of a third crime of violence\n   after having been convicted of two crimes of violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At sentencing, the prosecutor offered certified copies of two prior convictions pertaining to Scott, a first-degree assault in Maryland and an aggravated assault in the District of Columbia, as well as the statement of charges for the aggravated assault. The circuit court found that Scott had two prior convictions for crimes of violence, and imposed an enhanced sentence of twenty-five years of imprisonment, without the possibility of parole, for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon. The circuit court imposed a sentence of ten years of imprisonment, with all but five years suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation, for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, consecutive to the sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, and a sentence of ten years of imprisonment, with all but five years suspended, for conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon, consecutive to the other two sentences.\n   The Court of Special Appeals vacated the twenty-five-year sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon and remanded for resentencing, concluding that the evidence was insufficient to support the circuit court's determination that the conviction for aggravated assault in the District of Columbia constituted a conviction for a crime of violence under CR \u00a7 14-101(a). The Court of Special Appeals did not vacate the sentences for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon, which the circuit court had imposed consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On remand, the State sought to have the circuit court reimpose the enhanced sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon. Scott opposed the State's attempt to seek an enhanced sentence, contending that the imposition of such a sentence would violate the prohibition on\n   double jeopardy. At the resentencing proceeding, the circuit court admitted into evidence a transcript of Scott's guilty plea for aggravated assault in the District of Columbia, and again found that Scott had two prior convictions for crimes of violence. The circuit court again sentenced Scott to twenty-five years of imprisonment for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Scott's counsel requested that the circuit court make the new sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon concurrent with the two existing sentences. The circuit court responded that it lacked the discretion to do so. As such, the circuit court reimposed the enhanced sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, with the sentences for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon remaining ordered to be served consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before us, Scott contends that the circuit court violated the principles of\n   <em>\n    autrefois acquit\n   </em>\n   and collateral estoppel by readjudicating the issue of whether he had the requisite prior convictions for an enhanced sentence. Additionally, Scott argues that the circuit court erred in concluding that it lacked the discretion to impose the new sentence for attempted\n   robbery with a dangerous weapon to be concurrent with the two existing sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   An examination of the Supreme Court's and this Court's case law leads to the conclusion that, where an appellate court determines that the evidence was insufficient to establish a requisite prior conviction as a basis for an enhanced sentence and vacates the enhanced sentence, the appellate court's determination does not preclude a trial court from determining at resentencing that the same prior conviction satisfies the requirement for an enhanced sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We hold that: (I) where an appellate court vacates an enhanced sentence due to insufficient evidence of a requisite prior conviction, neither the plea of\n   <em>\n    autrefois acquit\n   </em>\n   nor the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars a trial court from imposing an enhanced sentence at resentencing based on the same prior conviction; and (II) where an appellate court vacates a sentence to which another sentence has been ordered to be consecutive and remands for resentencing without vacating the consecutive sentence, the trial court may not make the new sentence concurrent with the non-vacated consecutive sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Charges and Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The State charged Scott with attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, attempted robbery, first- and second-degree assault, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, wearing or carrying a handgun, and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At trial, as a witness for the State, Detective Stephen Johnson of the Prince George's County Police Department testified that, on December 23, 2011, at approximately 8 p.m., he and another detective began surveilling the 7-Eleven at 2310 Varnum Street in Mount Rainier from an unmarked police vehicle in an adjacent parking lot. Shortly after 2 a.m. on December 24, 2011, two men walked to the side of the 7-\n   Eleven, spoke to each other, and pulled ski masks over their heads. The taller of the two men pulled out a silver handgun, and the shorter man pulled out a black handgun. The men ran to the front of the 7-Eleven and pulled on the front door handles, but the front door was locked. The men pointed the handguns at the employees inside the 7-Eleven, but the employees did not unlock the front door.\n   The shorter man ran toward the back of the 7-Eleven, and the taller man ran through the parking lot, turned onto Russell Avenue, and got into the front passenger seat of a vehicle whose engine was running. The detectives and other law enforcement officers chased the vehicle until it ultimately crashed in the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Detective Johnson provided a description of the shorter man to another detective. Later, Detective Johnson learned that a patrol unit had stopped someone who matched the shorter man's description at 2208 Queens Chapel Road, which is on the street that is directly behind the 7-Eleven. At trial, Detective Johnson identified Scott as the shorter man who had attempted to enter the 7-Eleven with a black handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A jury found Scott guilty of all charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Original Sentencing Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After trial, but before the sentencing proceeding, the State filed a Notice of Enhanced Penalty (Crime of Violence), contending that Scott was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty-five years of imprisonment, without the possibility of parole, under CR \u00a7 14-101(d). According to the State, Scott had been convicted of two prior crimes of violence: first-degree assault in Maryland, and aggravated assault in the District of Columbia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District of Columbia conviction resulted from a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Scott filed a motion to strike the notice of enhanced penalties, contending that the conviction for aggravated assault in the District of Columbia did not constitute a conviction for a crime of violence under CR \u00a7 14-101(a). Specifically, Scott argued that the elements of aggravated assault under District of Columbia law were not the same as the elements of first-degree assault under Maryland law. Scott pointed out that, although first-degree assault is identified as a crime of violence under CR \u00a7 14-101(a)(19), CR \u00a7 14-101(a) does not include aggravated assault in its list of crimes of violence. Additionally, Scott maintained that CR \u00a7 14-101(a) does not provide that a conviction in another jurisdiction is to be considered a qualifying conviction if it is based on conduct that would have been a crime of violence if the defendant had committed it in Maryland. Scott did not dispute that he had been convicted of a separate first-degree assault offense in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the sentencing proceeding, after the State offered certified copies of Scott's prior convictions, the circuit court continued the sentencing proceeding to engage in additional research. When the sentencing proceeding resumed, the prosecutor argued that, contrary to Scott's position, a conviction in another jurisdiction is a qualifying prior conviction under CR \u00a7 14-101(d) if the conviction is based on conduct that would have been a crime of violence if the defendant had committed it in Maryland. To establish that the conviction for aggravated assault in the District of Columbia was based on conduct that would have been first-degree assault if Scott had committed the offense in Maryland, the\n   prosecutor advised that the statement of charges from the District of Columbia indicated that Scott had stomped on a person's head until the person lost consciousness. The prosecutor argued\n   that, by stomping a person into unconsciousness, Scott had caused serious physical injury, and engaged in conduct that would have been first-degree assault if it had occurred in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The circuit court determined that the conviction for aggravated assault in the District of Columbia constituted a conviction for a crime of violence under CR \u00a7 14-101(d). The circuit court sentenced Scott to: twenty-five years of imprisonment, without the possibility of parole, for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon; ten years of imprisonment, with all but five years suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation, for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, consecutive to the sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon; and ten years of imprisonment, with all but five years suspended, for conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon, consecutive to the other two sentences. The circuit court merged the remaining convictions for sentencing purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    First Opinion of the Court of Special Appeals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Scott noted an appeal. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions, but vacated the sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon and remanded for resentencing. The Court of Special Appeals held that the State had failed to prove that the conviction for aggravated assault in the District of Columbia constituted a conviction for a crime of violence under CR \u00a7 14-101(d). The Court of Special Appeals concluded that the statement of charges for the aggravated assault did not constitute proof of the conduct that was the basis for the conviction because the facts given in support of the guilty plea may have been different from the facts in the statement of charges. The Court of Special Appeals determined that a remand for resentencing was warranted, relying on Maryland Rule 8-604(d)(2), which states: \"In a criminal case, if the appellate court reverses the judgment for error in the sentence or sentencing proceeding, the Court shall remand the case for resentencing.\" The Court of Special Appeals's mandate stated, in pertinent\n   part: \"SENTENCE ON COUNT 1 [ (ATTEMPTED ROBBERY WITH A DANGEROUS WEAPON) ] VACATED AND THE CASE IS REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING. ALL JUDGMENTS OTHERWISE AFFIRMED.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Resentencing Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On remand, in a letter to Scott's counsel that was filed with the circuit court, the prosecutor advised that the State again intended to request an enhanced sentence, and attached the transcript of Scott's guilty plea proceeding in the District of Columbia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Scott filed a Response to Notice of Enhanced Penalties, contending that the conviction for aggravated assault in the\n   District of Columbia did not constitute a conviction for a crime of violence under CR \u00a7 14-101(d) because the statement of facts at Scott's guilty plea proceeding did not establish that Scott intentionally caused injury to the victim. Scott also argued that the Double Jeopardy Clause and the prohibition on double jeopardy under the common law of Maryland barred the State from seeking an enhanced sentence on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the resentencing proceeding, the circuit court admitted into evidence the transcript of Scott's guilty plea proceeding in the District of Columbia, and determined that the conviction for aggravated assault was the equivalent of a conviction for first-degree assault under CR \u00a7 14-101(a),\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As to whether the enhanced sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon would be imposed consecutive to or\n   concurrent with the two existing sentences, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, just before you hear from [Scott], Counts 5 [ (use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence) ] and 7 [ (conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon) ] can't-those aren't here for re-sentencing, so those cannot be changed. I think that the only thing that you can sentence on is the [twenty-five] mandatory without parole[, which was for Count 1 (attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The reason I brought the Count 5 up was because that was, in fact, consecutive. We're not here to change that sentence. I just wanted to make sure that was on the record because those two counts-those two sentences that the Court issued remain the same, so the only thing that we're here for is the Count 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [SCOTT'S COUNSEL]: The Court is here sentencing-the Court can make Count 1 consecutive [to] or concurrent [with] the already existing sentences.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: But those sentences, Count 5 actually says-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: The problem is, is that I didn't make Count 1 consecutive to the other sentences. I made the gun charge [Count 5] consecutive. And so if I did have the discretion to make this concurrent, that would change, in effect, the sentence on the other counts, which are not before the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [SCOTT'S COUNSEL]: At the moment they're consecutive to a sentence that doesn't exist. So the Court does have the power to make Count 1, which you're sentencing on, concurrent [with] all other sentences which already exist in this case, and that's what we ask the Court to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Well, I disagree with you, [Scott's counsel], but I'll hear from [ ] Scott as to how he feels or what he wants to say at this point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [SCOTT'S COUNSEL]: Given the Court's rulings, the fact that the Court is ruling it has essentially no discretion in the sentence it's going to impose, [ ] Scott has nothing to add.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Following this exchange, the circuit court reimposed the original enhanced sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon-twenty-five years of imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The circuit court noted that the other \"sentence[s] remain[ed] the same.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Second Opinion of the Court of Special Appeals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Scott noted an appeal. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court's judgment, holding that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   when a mandatory enhanced sentence for a third crime of violence is vacated\n   on appeal because the evidence was legally insufficient to support a finding that one of the prior convictions was for a crime of violence, double jeopardy [does not] bar[ ] the State from introducing new evidence at resentencing on remand to show that the same prior conviction was for a crime of violence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Scott points out that, if the circuit court had found that the State failed to meet the burden of establishing a necessary prior conviction, the State would have been unable to note an appeal of that determination in an attempt to secure a new sentencing proceeding. Scott asserts that the holding of the Court of Special Appeals in this case essentially gives the State unlimited attempts to secure an enhanced sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Scott maintains that the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars the State from proving his prior conviction on remand because establishing the existence of a qualifying prior conviction involves a factual determination.

The State points out that the prohibition against double jeopardy applies where there has been an acquittal based on insufficient evidence, but does not apply where a reversal is based on an erroneous legal decision by a trial court.

This Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   has been superseded by the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause in\n   <em>\n    Almendarez-Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Monge\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   . Consistent with the longstanding principle of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   that authorizes overruling a case that has been superseded by significant changes in the law, we overrule\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   We decline Scott's invitation to extend the prohibition on double jeopardy under the common law of Maryland beyond the limits that the Supreme Court has placed on the Double Jeopardy Clause by holding that, after an appellate court vacates an enhanced sentence due to insufficient evidence of a qualifying prior conviction, the plea of\n   <em>\n    autrefois acquit\n   </em>\n   bars a trial court from receiving additional evidence of a qualifying prior conviction and reimposing an enhanced sentence. Instead, we adopt the Supreme Court's sound logic in\n   <em>\n    Almendarez-Torres\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Monge\n   </em>\n   -specifically, the principle that the prohibition on double jeopardy does not apply to the fact of a\n   qualifying prior conviction-as applicable to the prohibition on double jeopardy under the common law of Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Our holding does not vitiate the principle that, when seeking an enhanced sentence, the State must establish a requisite prior conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryant v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057093\" index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/653/#p671\">\n    436 Md. 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 671,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057093\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/653/#p671\">\n    84 A.3d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 136 (2014). The standard of proof by which the State must establish a requisite prior conviction is wholly independent of the issue of whether the prohibition on double jeopardy bars the State from attempting to establish a qualifying prior conviction under certain circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Applying our holding to this case's facts, we conclude that the plea of\n   <em>\n    autrefois acquit\n   </em>\n   did not bar the circuit court from receiving additional evidence of Scott's prior conviction for aggravated assault in the District of Columbia. At the original sentencing proceeding, the prosecutor introduced certified copies of Scott's prior convictions and a statement of charges for the aggravated assault. The circuit court found that Scott had two prior convictions for crimes of violence, and imposed an enhanced sentence under CR \u00a7 14-101(d). The Court of Special Appeals vacated the enhanced sentence, concluding that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the conviction for aggravated assault constituted a conviction for a crime of violence, and remanded for resentencing. As explained above, a determination by an appellate court that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of a qualifying prior conviction does not act as an acquittal, and does not bar the trial court from revisiting the matter of the qualifying prior conviction. It was entirely permissible for the circuit court, on remand, to admit into evidence a transcript of the guilty plea proceeding in the District of Columbia, and to determine that Scott was subject to an enhanced sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Like the plea of\n   <em>\n    autrefois acquit\n   </em>\n   , the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar a trial court from reimposing an enhanced sentence after an appellate court vacates an enhanced sentence due to insufficient evidence of a qualifying prior conviction. The doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of a factual issue where there has been a finding in the defendant's favor as to the factual issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apostoledes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2012684\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/323/456/#p463\">\n    323 Md. at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2012684\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/323/456/#p463\">\n    593 A.2d at 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply here because, at the original sentencing proceeding, the circuit court did not find in Scott's favor as to a factual issue. The Court of Special Appeals did not affirm a factual finding by the circuit court that Scott lacked the requisite prior convictions to be subject to an enhanced sentence; rather, that Court determined that the evidence was insufficient to support the circuit court's finding that Scott had the requisite prior convictions to be subject to an enhanced sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   We are unpersuaded by Scott's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Ashe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054849\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/436/#p444\">\n    397 U.S. at 439, 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054849\" index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/436/#p444\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the Supreme Court held that, where multiple people allegedly robbed multiple victims, and a jury acquitted a defendant of robbing one of the victims, the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred the government from attempting to prove, in a separate prosecution as to a different victim, that the defendant was one of the robbers. In\n   <em>\n    Ashe\n   </em>\n   , the acquittal rendered the doctrine of collateral estoppel applicable because the acquittal constituted a finding of fact in the defendant's favor as to whether he was indeed one of the robbers. By contrast, an appellate court's vacation of an enhanced sentence due to insufficient evidence of a qualifying prior conviction is not a finding of fact; as such,\n   the doctrine of collateral estoppel is inapplicable. Indeed, other than\n   <em>\n    Ashe\n   </em>\n   , Scott offers no case law supporting his contention that his resentencing is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and we know of none in which the Supreme Court or this Court has applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel in a noncapital sentencing proceeding to preclude resentencing by a trial court after an enhanced sentence is vacated for insufficient evidence.\n   For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and hold that the circuit court was not precluded from reimposing the enhanced sentence of twenty-five years of imprisonment without the possibility of parole for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon at resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Concurrent Sentences\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    The Parties' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Scott contends that the circuit court erred in concluding that it lacked the discretion to impose the new sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon concurrently with the existing sentences for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon. Scott argues that, on remand for resentencing, a trial court has the discretion to determine whether a new sentence will be imposed consecutively or concurrently with existing sentences that were not affected by the remand. Scott asserts that his argument is preserved for review because, in the circuit court, his counsel requested that the circuit court make the new sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon concurrent with the two existing sentences. Scott acknowledges that, in the Court of Special Appeals, he argued that the two existing sentences should have been concurrent with the new sentence for attempted robbery-not the other way around, as he argues in this Court. Scott asserts, however, that his argument in the Court of Special Appeals was consistent with his argument in the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The State responds that Scott's contention is not preserved for review because it differs from the argument that he raised in the Court of Special Appeals. The State contends that, in the circuit court, Scott argued that the new sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon should have been concurrent with the two existing sentences; and, in the Court of Special Appeals, Scott argued the opposite-that the two existing sentences should have been imposed to be concurrent with the new sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous\n   weapon. As to the merits, the State asserts that the circuit court was correct in refraining from resentencing Scott for the convictions other than attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, as the Court of Special Appeals remanded solely for resentencing for the offense of attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   An appellate court reviews without deference the issue of whether a trial court made a legal error in sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonilla v.

The circuit court sentenced Scott to twenty-five years of imprisonment, without the possibility of parole, for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon; ten years of imprisonment, with all but five years suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation, consecutive to\n   the sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence; and ten years of imprisonment, with all but five years suspended, consecutive to the other two sentences, for conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon. The Court of Special Appeals vacated the sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon and remanded for resentencing. The Court of Special Appeals's mandate stated in pertinent part: \"SENTENCE ON COUNT 1 [ (ATTEMPTED ROBBERY WITH A DANGEROUS WEAPON) ] VACATED AND THE CASE IS REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   At the resentencing proceeding, the circuit court observed that the existing\n   sentences for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon were not before it. Nonetheless, Scott's counsel contended that the two existing sentences were consecutive to a sentence that allegedly no longer existed, and requested that the circuit court make the new sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon concurrent with the two existing sentences. The circuit court responded that it lacked the discretion to do so, and added: \"I'll hear from [ ] Scott as to how he feels or what he wants to say at this point.\" Scott's counsel responded: \"Given the Court's rulings, the fact that the Court is ruling it has essentially no discretion in the sentence it's going to impose, [ ] Scott has nothing to add.\" The circuit court reimposed the original sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon-twenty-five years of imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The circuit court noted that the other two \"sentence[s] remain[ed] the same.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In the Court of Special Appeals, Scott contended that the circuit court erred in not making the two existing sentences concurrent with the new sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon. In finding the issue not to be preserved, the Court of Special Appeals noted that the circuit court expressly \"gave [Scott] the opportunity to allocute and present mitigating information [,]\" which, through counsel, Scott declined to do.\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487908,12171045\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/411/\">\n    230 Md.App. at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487908,12171045\" index=\"423\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/411/\">\n    148 A.3d at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that Scott had waived the argument that the circuit court had violated his right to allocution and to present mitigating evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487908,12171045\" index=\"424\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/411/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487908,12171045\" index=\"424\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/411/\">\n    at 444-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487908,12171045\" index=\"425\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/411/\">\n    148 A.3d at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Special Appeals also concluded that Scott had failed to preserve for appellate review his contention that the circuit court erred in not making the two existing sentences concurrent with the new sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon because, in the circuit court, Scott had advanced a different argument-namely, that the circuit court should have imposed the new sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon concurrently with the two existing sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487908,12171045\" index=\"426\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/411/\">\n    230 Md.App. at 445-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487908,12171045\" index=\"427\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/411/\">\n    148 A.3d at 92-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Although Scott's argument in the circuit court technically differed from his argument in the Court of Special Appeals, we find this circumstance to be a distinction without a difference. Regardless of which sentence or set of sentences that Scott argued should have been made concurrent with the other-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the new sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon allegedly should have been concurrent with the two existing sentences, or vice-versa-Scott sought to serve the sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon and the two existing\n   sentences at the same time;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Scott sought concurrent sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In this Court, Scott repeats the contention that he raised in the circuit court-namely, that the circuit court erred in not making the new sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous\n   weapon concurrent with the two existing sentences. As such, Scott preserved his contention in this Court for appellate review pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(a). In light of the circumstances that Scott's contention in this Court is identical to the one that he raised in the circuit court, and that Scott argued in favor of the same ultimate outcome in the Court of Special Appeals, we conclude that Scott's contention is preserved for this Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Turning to the merits, we conclude that, where an appellate court vacates a sentence to which another sentence is ordered to be served consecutively and remands for resentencing without vacating the consecutive sentence, the non-vacated consecutive sentence remains consecutive to the newly imposed sentence-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the trial court cannot make the new sentence concurrent with the non-vacated consecutive sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   In this case, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, and remanded for resentencing without vacating the sentences for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon. Scott did not challenge the validity of the latter two sentences. The Court of Special Appeals vacated only the first sentence-which was an enhanced sentence-due to insufficient evidence of Scott's prior convictions. As discussed above in Part I, the circuit court had the authority to admit additional evidence of Scott's prior convictions at the resentencing proceeding, and to reimpose the enhanced sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   We are not persuaded by Scott's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Twigg\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the circuit court had the authority to vacate the sentences that had not been challenged on appeal. To be sure, under\n   <em>\n    Twigg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n    447 Md. at 20-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n    133 A.3d at 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court of Special Appeals had the authority in this case to vacate all four sentences, and remand for resentencing as to all four sentences. However, the Court of Special Appeals did not do so. A critical difference between this case and\n   <em>\n    Twigg\n   </em>\n   is that, in the latter, the Court of Special Appeals vacated all of\n   the sentences-including the one that the defendant had not challenged-and remanded with express instructions to resentence the defendant as to all of the sentences. By contrast, here, the Court of Special Appeals vacated only the first sentence, and did not grant the circuit court the authority to resentence Scott as to the other two sentences on remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Without the sentences for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon having been vacated and remanded for resentencing, the\n   circuit court could not resentence Scott as to those two sentences on remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Scott raises a red herring in contending that, when the Court of Special Appeals vacated the sentence for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, the other two sentences became consecutive to a sentence that no longer existed. In this case, the circuit court did not violate case law prohibiting the imposition of a sentence consecutively to a sentence that does not exist. At the time of the original sentencing proceeding, the circuit court properly imposed sentences consecutively to an existing sentence. The sentences for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon were imposed consecutively\n   to a sentence that existed at the time of their imposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Although this Court has held that a trial court may not impose a sentence that is concurrent with, or consecutive to, a sentence that does not exist,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stouffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"976468\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/390/36/#p41\">\n    390 Md. at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"976468\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/390/36/#p41\">\n    887 A.2d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court has never held that an appellate court cannot vacate a sentence to which another sentence is consecutive and remand for resentencing with the non-vacated sentence remaining imposed consecutively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a rule would prevent an appellate court from vacating only a sentence that was not imposed properly where other sentences were imposed to be consecutive, and would necessarily require that the appellate court vacate all sentences-even the ones that have no defects-and remand for resentencing. Simply put,\n   <em>\n    Stouffer\n   </em>\n   and similar cases do not bar an appellate court from vacating solely a sentence to which a non-vacated sentence was ordered to be consecutive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   For these reasons, the circuit court did not err in declining to make the new sentence for attempted robbery with a\n   dangerous weapon concurrent with the existing sentences for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon.\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Here, in our view, the Court of Special Appeals determined only that Scott had waived the contention that the circuit court refused to consider allocution and mitigating evidence, and not that Scott had forfeited appellate review of the argument concerning concurrent sentences by failing to allocute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    We are unpersuaded by Scott's contention that\n    <em>\n     Twigg\n    </em>\n    vests a trial court with the discretion to resentence as to a sentence that an appellate court did not vacate.\n    <em>\n     Twigg\n    </em>\n    did not involve a trial court that resentenced as to a non-vacated sentence. To the contrary, in\n    <em>\n     Twigg\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"438\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n     447 Md. at 9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"439\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n     133 A.3d at 1130\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , it was the Court of Special Appeals that vacated the sentences and ordered resentencing. Whenever this Court mentioned the trial court's \"discretion,\" this Court was referring to the trial court's discretion to resentence as to a vacated sentence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"440\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"440\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n     at 5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 19 &amp; n.11, 30,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"441\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n     133 A.3d at 1128\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1136 &amp; n.11, 1142-43. Thus, under\n    <em>\n     Twigg\n    </em>\n    , an appellate court, not a trial court, has the discretion to vacate a sentence that the defendant did not challenge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    The circuit court's revisory power over the two sentences was governed by Maryland Rule 4-345 (Sentencing-Revisory Power of Court), but that Rule did not apply here. Maryland Rule 4-345(a) allows a court to correct an inherently illegal sentence, but there was no allegation that the two sentences were inherently illegal. Similarly, Maryland Rule 4-345(b) grants a court \"revisory power over a sentence in case of fraud, mistake, or irregularity[,]\" but there was no allegation of any such circumstance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Twigg\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"442\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n     447 Md. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    30 n.14,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"443\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n     133 A.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1143 n.14, in a footnote, we remarked:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n    The State does not seek to have vacated the sentences for incest and third degree sexual offense, for both of which [the defendant] received the maximum sentence. We do not intend this opinion to be read as precluding, in the appropriate case, vacation of all sentences originally imposed on those convictions and sentences left undisturbed on appeal, so as to provide the court maximum flexibility on remand to fashion a proper sentence that takes into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    Although the Court of Special Appeals vacated the sentences for child abuse, second-degree rape, third-degree sexual offense, and incest, on review, this Court vacated the sentence only for second-degree rape, and stated that, at the new sentencing hearing, \"the sentencing court has the discretion to resentence [the defendant] to a term of active incarceration on the child abuse conviction[,]\" the conviction with which the conviction for second-degree rape was to merge for sentencing purposes.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n     at 5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"445\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n     133 A.3d at 1128\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Our observation in the footnote in\n    <em>\n     Twigg\n    </em>\n    supports the conclusion that a bright-line rule requiring an appellate court to vacate all sentences where only one sentence is found to be deficient is not warranted. It is properly left to the discretion of the appellate court, based on the circumstances of the case, whether to vacate the deficient sentence alone or all sentences imposed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
