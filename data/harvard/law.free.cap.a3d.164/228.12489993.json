Today we review a case in which the trial court excluded the plaintiff's\n   expert witness-a ruling fatal to his claim. We consider whether it erred in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Respondent Michael Christian was born on February 12, 1990. From his birth until October 1992, he resided with his mother,\n   Nickolas Skinner (\"Nickolas\"), and grandmother, Betty Skinner (\"Betty\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 3605 Spaulding Avenue (\"Spaulding\") in Baltimore City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Christian and his mother then moved to 4946 Denmore Avenue (\"Denmore\") in October 1992, where they resided for almost a year. In September 1993, Christian and his mother moved back to Spaulding and lived there for another four years, until September 1997.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Christian's blood was tested eight times between November 1990 and October 1993. In April 1991, he exhibited an elevated free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (\"FEP\") level, which does not measure a child's blood lead level but is an initial screening test for lead exposure. From February 1992 to October 1993, Christian displayed elevated blood lead levels five times as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-13\"><strong>Date Taken</strong> <strong>Blood Lead Level</strong><sup>3</sup> <strong>Christian's</strong> <strong>Address</strong><sup>4</sup> February 20, 1992 9 \u03bcg/dL Spaulding February 18, 1993 10 \u03bcg/dL Denmore July 16, 1993 17 \u03bcg/dL Denmore September 2, 1993 12 \u03bcg/dL Denmore October 6, 1993 14 \u03bcg/dL Spaulding</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note:\n   </strong>\n   The preceding image contains the references for footnotes\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2011, Christian filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Petitioner Stewart Levitas, the owner of Spaulding when he lived there, alleging negligence and violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In February\n   2012, Arc Environmental, Inc. (\"Arc\") tested the interior and exterior of Spaulding for lead using x-ray fluorescence testing. Arc summarized its findings in a report for Christian (\"Arc Report\"). Thirty-one interior surfaces and five exterior surfaces tested positive for lead. The lead-positive interior surfaces included door jambs, baseboards, and window sills, casings, and sashes. Exterior window sashes, casings, and door jambs also tested positive for lead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During discovery, Christian designated Howard Klein, M.D., a pediatrician with experience treating lead-poisoned children, as an expert witness who would opine on the source of Christian's lead exposure-source causation-and his lead-caused injuries-medical causation. As to the source of Christian's lead exposure, Dr. Klein testified in his deposition that he was \"of the opinion that [Christian] was exposed to lead-\n   based paint\" at Spaulding. The basis for his opinion was: (1) the age of Spaulding-built in 1944; (2) the Arc Report; (3) a Maryland Department of the Environment (\"MDE\") certification reflecting that the property was not lead free; (4) a Department of Housing and Community Development (\"DHCD\") violation that detailed the poor condition of the property; (5) Christian's elevated FEP and blood lead levels while he was living at Spaulding and Denmore; (6) Betty's and Nickolas's deposition testimony that Spaulding was in disrepair while Christian lived there; (7) Nickolas's testimony that she saw Christian touch areas where paint was peeling around the windowsills at Spaulding; and (8) Nickolas's testimony that Christian stayed at Spaulding under the supervision of family members while she was at work during the day, both while they were living at Spaulding and while they were living at Denmore. Dr. Klein further testified that these facts establish that \"there was lead-based paint [at Spaulding].\" Finally, he acknowledged that Denmore was also a source of Christian's lead exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In his expert report on medical causation, Dr. Klein concluded \"within [a] reasonable degree of medical certainty\" that lead caused Christian's mental retardation, impaired cognition, and learning disabilities. He further opined in his deposition that as a result of Christian's exposure to lead, he lost 7.4 to 9.4 IQ points. Dr. Klein based his opinion on: (1) a neuropsychological evaluation of Christian by Barry Hurwitz, Ph.D.; (2) Christian's medical records; (3) Christian's Answers to Interrogatories; (4) information on Spaulding and Denmore; (5) Christian's Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\"DHMH\") lead testing records; (6) MDE records; (7) DHCD records; and (8) Christian's school records. To calculate Christian's IQ loss, he relied on the Lanphear study,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which found that children with certain average lifetime blood lead levels lost a specific number of IQ points. Dr. Klein\n   averaged Christian's blood lead levels and then determined his loss in IQ points based on the study's results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Levitas filed a motion to exclude Dr. Klein from testifying about source causation on the grounds that he lacked both the necessary qualifications and a sufficient factual basis for his opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Levitas also moved for summary judgment in his favor if Dr. Klein were excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 10, 2013, the Circuit Court held a hearing on Levitas's motion to exclude Dr. Klein. At the hearing, Levitas argued that Dr. Klein should be precluded from testifying about both source causation and medical causation. Ruling from the bench, the hearing judge excluded Dr. Klein's testimony on both of these topics. The court reasoned that Dr. Klein should be prevented from testifying about the source of Christian's lead exposure because \"he did not, or had very little ... information concerning other sources [of lead exposure].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also precluded Dr. Klein from testifying about the cause and extent of Christian's injuries because he was not qualified and his opinion lacked a sufficient factual basis under Maryland Rule 5-702. As to his qualifications, the court reasoned that Dr. Klein would not be able to explain the IQ test results to the jury because he does not use the test in his own practice. As to his factual basis, the court explained that Dr. Klein relied on information from Dr. Hurwitz and Christian's attorney in developing his opinion, rather than examining Christian himself, which was not sufficient. The Circuit Court declined to grant Levitas's motion for summary judgment, however, because the Arc Report was \"direct evidence\" of lead at Spaulding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 20, 2013, the Circuit Court entered a written order precluding Dr. Klein from offering expert opinions on \"source, IQ loss, alleged injuries due to lead, or other causation issues.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the purposes of appealing the Circuit Court's decision to exclude Dr. Klein, the parties agreed that without Dr. Klein's testimony, Christian could not make out a prima facie case of negligence because he could not establish medical causation. Therefore, the parties requested that the Circuit Court enter summary judgment in Levitas's favor to allow Christian to appeal the expert's exclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court granted the request, and Christian appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the first of two Court of Special Appeals opinions, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the Circuit Court's decision to exclude Dr. Klein. Christian appealed to this Court, and we, in a per curiam order, vacated the judgment and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Roy v.

But, firstly, the plaintiff must actually raise such a claim, and produce evidence in support of it as to the other alleged sources of lead exposure. And, secondly, as the Court of Special Appeals pointedly noted in\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v.

It is true that Dr. Klein was not a treating physician, and that he had not seen or questioned Mr. Christian or his family members directly. He stated in his deposition testimony that all of his opinions in the report that he prepared for trial were based upon records that he had received from Mr. Christian's counsel's office. Additionally,\n   Dr. Klein offered opinions in response to several hypothetical questions during that deposition.

The 2012 Arc Report that determined multiple interior locations of the Spaulding Property tested positive for lead was not direct evidence that lead-based paint was present during the period of time that Mr. Christian resided at that property. But, when combined with the fact that lead paint had been banned federally prior to Mr. Christian's period of residency at the Spaulding Property, it was strong circumstantial evidence that lead paint was present on the property during the relevant time period. Moreover, the evidence of Mr. Christian's elevated lead blood tests at the Spaulding Property, the Department of Housing and Community Development records describing the poor condition of the property, as well as interrogatory testimony of several of Mr. Christian's relatives that described poor condition of the property while Mr. Christian lived there and that he regularly stayed in the home during the daytime, while circumstantial, was more than \"scant\" evidence that Mr. Christian was exposed to lead while living at that property. Dr. Klein thus had sufficient data from which he could conclude that defects in the Spaulding Property's interior such as chipping and flaking paint exposed Mr. Christian to lead while residing at that property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   However, Dr. Klein did not explain the methodology he used to assess that data and reach his conclusion that Mr. Christian was exposed to lead at the Spaulding Property.

The Majority states that Dr. Klein did \"not ignore [ ]\" and \"considered\" information in the record as to the Denmore Property, referencing his report in which he stated that he considered \"[p]roperty information for 3605 Spaulding Avenue [and] 4946 Denmore Avenue.\" Majority Op. at 250 n.15, 249-50,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20A.3d%20237\">\n    164 A.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -38.

Rather, under this Court's precedent in\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   , he needed to put forth an adequate supply of data to show that it was exposure to lead at the Spaulding Property, and not the Denmore Property, that was the probable substantial cause of his harm from lead poisoning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   , 445 Md. at 47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366116\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/23/\">\n    124 A.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717067\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/430/648/\">\n    430 Md. at 663-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717067\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/430/648/\">\n    63 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Some\n   of the data on which Dr. Klein relied indicated a\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   that the Spaulding Property was a substantial factor cause of his elevated blood lead levels. Specifically, Mr. Christian had an elevated blood lead level of 9 [\u03bc]g/dL on February 20, 1992, when he was just over two years old, and, according to the testimony of his relatives, at that time, he had not \"yet lived anywhere else.\" See Majority Op. at 239, 249-50, 164 A.3d at 231-32, 237-38. However, there was also evidence that after Mr. Christian subsequently moved to reside at the Denmore Property in October 1992, his blood lead levels significantly increased while he resided at that property, first to 10 \u03bcg/dL in February 18, 1993 and then to 17 \u03bcg/dL on July 16, 1993.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 239, 164 A.3d at 231. The record thus indicates that Mr. Christian's blood lead levels rose both while he was residing at the Spaulding Property, and while he resided at the Denmore Property. But, Dr. Klein never identified the data on which he relied to conclude that it was the initial exposure at the Spaulding Property, and not what appears to be a subsequent exposure at the Denmore Property, that was the substantial cause of his harm from lead poisoning. Nor did he describe any methodology that he had used to reach that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Relying on the Court's suggestion in\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/\">\n    439 Md. at 537-38, 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/\">\n    96 A.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that a plaintiff may be able to show that a property was a source of lead exposure without excluding other reasonably probable sources of such exposure, the Majority holds that it \"is not the rule\" in Maryland that an expert as to source causation in a lead paint case must \"exclude other [reasonably probable] properties before\n   he can testify that the plaintiff was exposed to lead at the subject property.\" Majority Op. at 250, 164 A.3d at 238. The Majority is incorrect. As noted above, when this Court last considered expert testimony as to lead paint source causation in\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   , the Court recognized that\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   had suggested \"that a lead poisoning case may succeed grounded on suitable circumstantial evidence as to source,\" without needing to exclude other properties.\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   , 445 Md. at 47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366116\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/23/\">\n    124 A.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, the Court\n   <strong>\n    expressly held\n   </strong>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   that expert testimony must be held to a higher standard, holding that \"it is not enough for an\n   expert to conclude that a certain property is the source of [a] child's exposure to lead when other probable sources have not been eliminated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366116\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/23/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Majority today is, therefore, overturning an express holding of this Court, less than two years from the date that holding was issued, in direct contravention of the principle of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    DRD Pool Serv., Inc. v.

As to Dr. Klein's first opinion that Mr. Christian was exposed to lead-based paint at the Spaulding Property, while I agree there was adequate data in the record to support that opinion, Dr. Klein failed to explain the methodology he used to reach the opinion so that a trier-of-fact could properly assess it. And, as to his second opinion that Mr. Christian's exposure at the Spaulding Property was a substantial factor cause of his harm, Dr. Klein did not identify any data or methodology to show that the Spaulding Property was a more probable source of the harm than the Denmore Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Majority's holding that Dr. Klein was not required to exclude other probable sources of Mr. Christian's lead poisoning is contrary to this Court's prior holdings in\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   .
