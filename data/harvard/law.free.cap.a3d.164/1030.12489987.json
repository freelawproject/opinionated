Because we conclude that, on the record before the trial court, issues of material fact exist, we affirm and modify the judgment of the Appellate Division and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We glean the following facts from the record considered by the trial court, including Grande's deposition, certifications by Saint Clare's and its agents, various exhibits contained within each party's summary judgment motion, and associated statements of material facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Grande has been a practicing registered nurse (R.N.) since 1985. She was employed by Saint Clare's from approximately 2000 through July 2010. Beginning in about 2006, Grande worked in a hospital unit in which approximately half of the patients were stroke victims who required additional assistance with their daily living needs. Grande's regular duties involved maintaining charts, administering medication, and general patient care, including assisting patients with daily living activities such as washing, bathing, dressing, walking, repositioning patients in bed, and guarding\n   ambulant patients against falls. Thirty to forty percent of the patients in Grande's unit wore armbands and had signage placed outside their hospital rooms to alert staff that they were at an increased risk of falling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In August 2008, the hospital performed job system analyses for various nursing positions. The job analysis for R.N.s (Job Analysis) indicated the frequency with which job duties were to be performed and identified certain tasks as essential to the R.N. position regardless of how frequent their performance. The Job Analysis categorized occasional tasks as those performed \"1-33% of the day\" and frequent tasks as those performed \"34-66% of the day.\" Essential tasks were described as the \"[e]ssential function[s] of [the] job.\" One essential duty of an R.N. is to lift fifty pounds from waist to chest \"frequently.\" According to the certification of Heather Jordan, Saint Clare's human resources supervisor, the weightlifting requirements within the Job Analysis are identical for all R.N.-staffed units in the hospital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Beginning in 2007, prior to the Job Analysis, Grande suffered a series of work-\n   related injuries. The first occurred in March 2007, when she injured her left shoulder while repositioning a patient in bed. Grande was unable to continue working that day, immediately saw a doctor, and reported the incident to Saint Clare's. She had surgery on her shoulder in April, followed by physical therapy. Grande spent about three months recovering at home before returning to work on a full-time but \"light duty\" basis, which included chart administration, compliance review, and similar administrative tasks. Less than a month later, Grande returned to full duty, including patient care.\n   The second injury occurred in May 2008, when Grande felt pain in her right shoulder while repositioning a patient in bed. Grande reported the incident immediately to Saint Clare's and saw a doctor, who performed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The test found no injury, and Grande returned to full duty within two weeks. The record is unclear as to whether Grande's work was restricted following the May 2008 injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2008, Grande re-injured her left shoulder while lifting the legs of a 300-pound patient. As before, Grande immediately saw a doctor and reported the incident to her employer. Grande was unable to return immediately to work, underwent a second surgery on her left shoulder, and returned to full duty about six months after the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Grande sustained her final injury in February 2010 when she was alone in a room caring for an overweight patient who was moving from a stretcher to a bed. While Grande stood on the far side of the bed, the patient began to fall. Grande leapt onto the bed, grabbed the patient's shoulders from behind, and pulled the patient onto the bed and on top of herself. After doing so, Grande felt a sharp pain and believed she had re-injured her left shoulder, but an MRI revealed that she had injured her cervical spine. Grande underwent surgery and spent four months recovering and rehabilitating before returning to work. On her first day back, however, she left the hospital after just four hours because of residual pain. Two weeks later, Grande returned to full-time, light-duty work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In early July 2010, Grande's doctor cleared her to resume full-duty work. The hospital informed Grande that, before returning to full duty, she would have to undergo physical testing. Lori Briglio, the nurse case manager overseeing Grande's workers' compensation claim, instructed Grande to report to Kinematic Consultants, Inc. (KCI) for a functional capacity evaluation (FCE).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Grande complied and underwent the examination, which tested her ability to perform a variety of physical tasks, including turning her head, demonstrating mobility in her limbs, lifting objects from\n   different heights, turning in different directions, pushing and pulling, and carrying weights. The report documenting the evaluation (KCI Report) provided results in several categories and compared Grande's ability with her employer's requirements and with the standards set forth in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (D.O.T.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Report specified that Grande's job demanded that she perform tasks involving pushing, pulling, and lifting from waist to chest frequently (34-66% of the time), but that she was able to perform these functions only occasionally (1-33% of the time). Accordingly, the Report recommended maximum loads for Grande to bear, including that Grande frequently lift no more than sixteen pounds from waist to chest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The KCI Report also provided several conclusions about Grande's performance throughout the evaluation and her work abilities. The Report acknowledged that Grande had \"demonstrated maximum effort\" throughout the evaluation and confirmed that the documented results \"are considered to be valid.\" The Report noted that Grande's results \"may be compatible with mild residual functional issues, as per complaints and/or diagnosis,\" but concluded that \"[i]t is improbable that this will significantly affect job performance ability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Report also explained that Grande qualified to return to work on \"altered duty\" based on the Report's recommendations. Due to Grande's previous cervical surgery, the Report recommended that Grande be \"allowed changes in activities during periods of prolonged or repetitive\" neck movements. The Report also recommended that Grande \"seek appropriate assistance with\n   heavier physical activities such as patient transfers, guarding ambulatory patients or handling loads\" greater than fifty pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Overall, the KCI Report concluded that Grande\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   demonstrate[d] ability for Medium category work (occasional lift and work up to 50 lbs.) with the above noted job movement demand changes. She demonstrate [d] ability for administrative/supervisory duties, verbal instruction to patients/care givers, assisting physicians with examinations, assisting with wound care/dressing changes, dispensation of medications, pushing wheelchairs, assisting with moderate patient care, handling loads up to 50 lbs., etc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Shortly after the KCI Report was issued, Briglio contacted KCI via e-mail to clarify several aspects of the Report, including the portions of the job description that Grande could not fulfill and the accommodations she would require.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an addendum, KCI responded that Grande \"demonstrates ability for Medium category work (occasional lift and work up to 50 lbs.) with noted job movement demand changes\" and reiterated that Grande could return to work with certain accommodations. Nonetheless, the addendum concluded with the following disclaimer: \"Please note that determination for final return to work abilities for [Grande] is deferred to her treating physician, in this case, Joel H. Spielman, M.D.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 21, 2010, following the functional capacity evaluation, Dr. Spielman re-examined Grande. He provided her with a form that indicated she could return to work the next day with restrictions, \"per [the] FCE.\" Briglio, in turn, advised the hospital that Dr. Spielman \"agreed with the FCE report and advised that [Grande] should have permanent restrictions of lifting up to 50 lbs occasionally and that she\n   should transfer patient with assistance only.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The following day, Grande was summoned to a meeting with her supervisors, at which she was fired. Grande testified in her\n   deposition that she was told she had limitations that would prevent her from doing her job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After her termination, Grande again visited Dr. Spielman, who issued another return-to-work form on August 25, 2010, clearing Grande to return immediately to full-time, full-duty work with no limitations. Grande submitted the new work authorization to Saint Clare's, but Saint Clare's refused to rehire her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nearly a year after her discharge, Grande filed a two-count complaint against Saint Clare's, alleging violations of\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   10:5-4.1, a subsection of the LAD. The first count alleged that Saint Clare's unlawfully discriminated against Grande based on her disability, and the second count alleged unlawful discrimination based on a perceived disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Saint Clare's denied liability and, following discovery, filed a motion for summary judgment. In a certification supporting that motion, Saint Clare's human resources supervisor, Jordan, asserted that \"Grande was physically unable to perform an essential function of her job\" and expressed \"concern[ ] that Ms. Grande would be re-injured or that a patient would be injured if [Grande] returned to full duty.\" Jordan also certified that the decision to terminate Grande's employment was based on the findings in the KCI Report and the July 2010 recommendation of Grande's own physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Grande filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. She conceded that she had periods of disability due to work-related accidents but asserted that she surpassed the D.O.T. weight-lifting requirements for nurses in her field, as reflected on the KCI Report. Grande also alleged that the weight-lifting requirements specified in the KCI Report were \"fictitious\" because the standards were \"far higher\" than those required by the D.O.T. and \"ha[d] not been shown to have ever been adopted by Saint Clare's.\" She also contended that the hospital improperly interpreted the KCI Report's recommended lifting restrictions as actual limitations on her abilities, highlighting that she had, in fact, lifted ninety-two pounds from waist to shoulders during the evaluation, far above her employer's fifty-pound requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Saint Clare's, finding that Grande did not establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge because she \"failed to articulate whether she was performing (or was able to perform) her job at a level that met the employer's legitimate expectations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A divided Appellate Division panel reversed, vacating summary judgment and remanding because the record contained several material facts in dispute that could only be resolved by a jury. According to the majority, \"the motion court incorrectly resolved these materially disputed facts in\n   favor of [Saint Clare's] and rejected or minimized the importance of evidence a rational jury could find to support [Grande's] case of unlawful discrimination due to her perceived physical disability.\" The majority explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, plaintiff produced competent evidence, in the form of her treating physician's certification, stating she had been medically cleared to return to work without restrictions. Defendant has not rebutted that medical opinion with the opinion of another physician. Instead, defendant relies on the results of a \"functional capacity evaluation [FCE] test\" conducted by an alleged independent company retained by defendant's Department of Human Resources. KCI's report contains facially equivocal findings with respect to plaintiff's abilities to perform the core requirements of a nurse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The dissenting member of the panel emphasized that \"[t]he law should not place a hospital in a position of sacrificing employee and patient safety in order to avoid potential liability for discrimination\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   and that the hospital \"could sensibly rely on [Grande's] actual work history [and history of injuries] when it placed safety interests above [her] continued employment.\" The dissent also found no genuine factual disputes because \"at the time the hospital made its decision to terminate [Grande], her treating physician had stated she could return to work, but only with lifting restrictions\"-a recommendation which was modified \"only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the hospital had already terminated [Grande's] employment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Saint Clare's filed this appeal as of right pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   2:2-1(a)(2), limited to whether summary judgment was appropriately awarded to the hospital by the trial court on the facts in the record before it. We granted amicus curiae status to the New Jersey Association for Justice (NJAJ) and the National Employment Lawyers Association of New Jersey (NELA-NJ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Saint Clare's argues that the LAD, its implementing regulations, and New Jersey employment discrimination jurisprudence authorize Grande's termination. Saint Clare's concedes that Grande is disabled under the LAD but agrees with the trial court that she failed to establish a prima facie case because she could not prove she was performing her job to the hospital's legitimate expectations. Saint Clare's highlights that Grande was working light duty at the time of her discharge, and both the KCI Report and Grande's physician confirmed that she could return to her regular duties only with lifting restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Even if Grande established a prima facie case, Saint Clare's maintains, the termination of her employment was legal. The hospital cites various provisions of the LAD, including\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   10:5-5(q), -2.1, -4.1, and -29.1, which provide that an employer may terminate a disabled employee who, in the reasonable opinion of the employer, is unable to perform adequately her job duties. The hospital also relies on\n   <em>\n    N.J.A.C.\n   </em>\n   13:13-2.8, which allows an\n   employer to terminate a disabled employee if her continued employment \"would be hazardous to the safety or health of such individual, other employees, clients or customers.\" Saint Clare's maintains that its decision to discharge Grande was appropriate because, unlike the employer's improper reliance on a deficient medical report in\n   <em>\n    Jansen v. Food Circus Supermkts., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"290571\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/110/363/\">\n    110\n    <em>\n     N.J.\n    </em>\n    363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=541%20A.2d%20682\">\n    541\n    <em>\n     A.\n    </em>\n    2d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988), Saint Clare's decision was based on objective evidence-the functional capacity evaluation-as well as Grande's\n   own undisputed history of injuries on the job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Grande contends that Saint Clare's admission-that it fired her because of her perceived disability-is direct evidence of discrimination and, thus,\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   does not require her to prove a prima facie case. Instead, Grande maintains that the burden rests on Saint Clare's to assert an affirmative defense, which the hospital failed to do by competent medical or scientific evidence. Grande argues that because Saint Clare's failed to follow up with her treating doctor, there is no competent evidence that she was a risk to herself or patients or that she could not perform her job duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, Grande claims that certain factual issues remain in dispute, including (1) the applicability of Saint Clare's purported lifting requirements to R.N.s in Grande's position; (2) the number of injuries she sustained; (3) whether she would need assistance handling loads over fifty pounds; and (4) that she is likely to suffer future injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Amici NJAJ and NELA-NJ agree with both parties that\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   provides the controlling test on disability discrimination under the LAD. NJAJ asserts that Saint Clare's made the same error here as the employer in\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   -it improperly assumed that there was a probability of future injury without relying on an expert report linking Grande's perceived disability to a probability of substantial harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   NELA-NJ adds that because Grande presented direct evidence of discrimination, the only issue is \"whether Saint Clare's met its burden of proving 'it would have made the same decision even in the absence of the impermissible consideration' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bergen Commercial Bank v. Sisler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781253\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/157/188/#p209\">\n    157\n    <em>\n     N.J.\n    </em>\n    188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781253\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/157/188/#p209\">\n    723\n    <em>\n     A\n    </em>\n    .2d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) ). NELA-NJ also cautions that Saint Clare's should not be given \"carte blanche\" to decide what the essential functions of a particular job are, as this would allow an employer to \"invent unrealistic job requirements for the sole purpose of eliminating disabled people from consideration.\" It urges that the proper approach is to allow a fact-finder to weigh the employer's statements, the written job description, the work experience of current and former employees, and other factors, such as the D.O.T. standards, to determine whether the employer's criteria are realistic or designed to discriminate against a disabled person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Turning to the law relevant to the parties' arguments, the LAD prohibits an employer from terminating a disabled employee because of her disability unless the disability \"reasonably precludes the performance of the particular employment.\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   10:5-4.1. The law governing an action \"seeking redress for an alleged violation of the LAD\" depends upon whether the employee \" 'attempt[s] to prove employment discrimination by ... direct or circumstantial evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Nonetheless, Grande has produced no evidence of discriminatory\n   animus toward disabled employees. She alleges that the lifting standards identified in the KCI Report and the 2008 Job Analysis do not reflect the actual requirements of her job.

First, there is a dispute as to whether the lifting standards identified by the KCI Report as Saint Clare's requirements are actually the standards applicable to Grande's position. Saint Clare's 2008 Job Analysis indicates that R.N.s are required, as essential functions of their job, to lift fifty pounds from waist to chest frequently (34% to 66% of the day) and several other loads occasionally (1% to 33% of the day), including twenty-five pounds from floor to waist, ten pounds from chest to overhead, twenty pounds in a two-hand carry, and ten pounds in a one-hand carry. The Job Analysis does\n   not identify any activity that is performed at a frequency greater than 66% of the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The KCI Report, on the other hand, lists the following as the hospital's requirements: constantly (67% to 100% of the day) lift twenty pounds, frequently lift fifty pounds, and occasionally lift 100 pounds. The addendum to the KCI Report indicates that the Report's standards were based on a job description provided by the hospital but does not confirm whether that job description is the 2008 Job Analysis. The record is also silent as to why the KCI standards differ from those listed on the Job Analysis. Grande contends that the standards on neither the KCI Report nor the Job Analysis reflect what she actually does in her position. Thus, from the record before us, we cannot discern which tasks were essential to Grande's job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Second, there is a dispute as to whether the KCI Report conclusively establishes that Grande is unable to perform her job. The Report indicates that, in some categories, Grande's ability was below the hospital's standards. The Report also states, however, that while the results \"may be compatible with mild residual functional issues,\" \"[i]t is improbable that this will significantly affect job performance ability.\" The addendum to the report makes clear that \"determination for final return to work abilities ... is deferred to [Grande's] treating physician.\" Dr. Spielman had cleared Grande to return to full-time, full-duty work on July 8, 2010, four days before the FCE was performed. Although Dr. Spielman subsequently restricted Grande's work pursuant to the FCE, Grande disputes that such restrictions were permanent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The hospital claims that Dr. Spielman recommended permanent lifting restrictions; Grande alleges Dr. Spielman told her she could resume her regular duties; and the KCI Report does not\n   indicate whether its recommendations were permanent or temporary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   These factual disputes are material to the issue of whether Grande's disability precluded her from performing the essential functions of her job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Saint Clare's also maintains that Grande's history of injuring herself on the job sufficiently proved her inability to perform her job without posing a risk of harm to herself or others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   To assert this defense, Saint Clare's \"must establish with a reasonable degree of certainty that it reasonably arrived at the opinion that [Grande's] handicap presented a materially enhanced risk of substantial harm in the workplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"290571\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/110/363/\">\n    110\n    <em>\n     N.J.\n    </em>\n    at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=541%20A.2d%20682\">\n    541\n    <em>\n     A\n    </em>\n    .2d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The New Jersey Administrative Code explains the employer's burden as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Refusal to select a person with a disability may be lawful where it can be demonstrated\n   that the employment of that individual in a particular position\n   <em>\n    would be hazardous to the safety or health of such individual\n   </em>\n   , other employees, clients or customers\n   <em>\n    where hazard cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\n   </em>\n   Such a decision must be based upon an\n   <em>\n    objective standard supported by factual or scientifically validated evidence\n   </em>\n   , rather than on the basis of general assumptions that a particular disability would create a hazard to the safety or health of such individual, other employees, clients or customers. A \"hazard\" to the person with a disability is a materially enhanced risk of serious harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    N.J.A.C.\n   </em>\n   13:13-2.8(a)(2) (emphases added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Thus, the Administrative Code requires that an employer base its conclusion to terminate an employee on \"factual or scientifically validated evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=541%20A.2d%20682\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Here, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Grande, she sustained at least three disabling injuries for which she was required to be absent from work. After each of the first two injuries, however, she was cleared to return to work and did so. After the final injury, Grande's physician also cleared her to return to regular duty prior to her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   There is no indication in the record that plaintiff caused injury to the patients in the course of incurring her own injuries. Moreover, the KCI Report only recommends that Grande be assisted in attempting to lift more than fifty pounds, even though she was able to lift much heavier loads during testing. The Report says nothing about Grande's ability to otherwise perform her job without causing injury to patients or to herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Furthermore, there is no expert testimony that Grande's perceived susceptibility to injury posed a \"materially enhanced risk of serious harm\" to herself or her patients.\n   <em>\n    N.J.A.C.\n   </em>\n   13:13-2.8(a)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"290571\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/110/363/\">\n    110\n    <em>\n     N.J.\n    </em>\n    at 374-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=541%20A.2d%20682\">\n    541\n    <em>\n     A\n    </em>\n    .2d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude, therefore, that the evidence that Grande presented a risk of injury to herself or patients is inadequate to resolve conclusively this material issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In affirming the requirements set forth in\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   , we remain cognizant of the need for safe work environments. Our holding today is not intended to limit an employer's ability to promulgate safety standards or to require of its employees the physical ability to safely perform their duties.

I agree that those issues must be resolved by a jury, and therefore I concur in this judgment. That said,\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Zive\n   </em>\n   provide all the guidance necessary to understand the standards governing plaintiff's pretrial prima facie case, and plaintiff has met those standards. The majority differentiates this case from\n   <em>\n    Zive\n   </em>\n   , asserting that\n   <em>\n    Zive\n   </em>\n   did not address reasonable accommodation or an employee's extended absence from work prior to seeking return from a workers' compensation leave due to a work injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In my view, issues of reasonable accommodation or absenteeism due to disability have no business being compressed into plaintiff's pretrial prima facie case. Because plaintiff did not plead a failure to accommodate claim, reasonable accommodation was not at issue as part of plaintiff's pretrial case. As for absenteeism, Saint Clare's did not rely on plaintiff's absences as a reason for terminating her employment. Courts faced with disability discrimination claims should remain focused pretrial on the key question of whether there are triable issues of fact on which a jury could base a finding that an employer has unlawfully discriminated against an employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   insightfully instructed that if an employer wants to assert safety as its justification for terminating an employee, it must bear the burden of persuasion on that point. Although the context is different, the facts of this case are similar to the facts of\n   <em>\n    Jansen.\n   </em>\n   Like in\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   , in this case an employer has terminated an employee, admittedly on the basis of a physical disability. This case is also like\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   in that there has been no expert report produced for trial that clearly addresses the probability of future harm due to the asserted disability. Under\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the question to be addressed is whether Saint Clare's has established \"with a reasonable degree of certainty that it reasonably arrived at the opinion that the employee's handicap presented a materially enhanced risk of substantial harm in the workplace.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"290571\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/110/363/\">\n    110\n    <em>\n     N.J.\n    </em>\n    at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=541%20A.2d%20682\">\n    541\n    <em>\n     A\n    </em>\n    .2d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   , the elements of an employee's pretrial prima facie case to prove discriminatory intent are not the center of this dispute because Saint Clare's has admitted that it terminated Grande based on her disability. And, under\n   <em>\n    Zive\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff has adduced some proof that she was capable of performing her job. While Saint Clare's asserts that lifting is an essential function of plaintiff's job as a registered nurse and that plaintiff did not demonstrate during her KCI examination that she met the employer's lifting standards, those facts are heavily disputed. Consistent with the regulations implementing the LAD, Saint Clare's bears the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \"as a result of [plaintiff's] disability, [she] cannot perform the essential functions of the job even with reasonable accommodation.\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.A.C.\n   </em>\n   13:13-2.8 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   10:5-29.1 (requiring clear showing of employee's inability to perform job).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   To the extent that Saint Clare's is asserting a safety defense, it also bears the burden of proof on that defense. Plaintiff will be required to rebut Saint Clare's proofs on that defense before the factfinder, once the groundwork for a safety defense has been\n   established. She has already proffered evidence of her differing view of the facts about the job and her ability to perform it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   So, in this case, there are material factual disputes regarding whether plaintiff has demonstrated her objective ability to do the job-with or without reasonable accommodation, as the majority adds-according to legitimate job standards. Those factual issues to be resolved are distinct from the employer's claimed safety concerns. Still,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   10:5-29.1 requires that \"[u]nless it can be\n   <em>\n    clearly shown\n   </em>\n   that a person's disability would prevent [her] from performing a particular job, it is an unlawful employment practice to deny to an otherwise qualified person with a disability the opportunity to ... maintain employment\" (emphasis added). Thus, at trial, Saint Clare's must bear the burden as to whether its conclusion that plaintiff could not perform her job was reasonably arrived at, in addition to the burden as to its safety defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In other words, whether plaintiff's termination was \"justified by lawful considerations\" remains to be decided at trial. There has been no concession here by plaintiff that she cannot do the job. There is a dispute over the \"essential functions\" of the job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is a factual dispute over whether the KCI Report contains sufficient proof that plaintiff cannot perform essential lifting duties of the job, even assuming the asserted essential lifting requirements are legitimate. And, the factual questions about the disputed standards are complicated by the apparent lack of historical evidence that this employer subjected its nursing force to strength\n   testing either at the time of hiring or as a condition of continued employment. The standards, which plaintiff claims are newly asserted, are being applied to her after she is returning to work from a workers' compensation leave. Finally, the employer may still prove its safety defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   To the extent that the majority mentions absenteeism as an issue to be explored at trial, I must point out that absenteeism was not relied upon as a reason for plaintiff's termination and should not become a new reason to justify the adverse job action, particularly when the employee's absences were all due to legitimate job injuries for which the employer bears some responsibility under the social compact established under workers' compensation law. To use plaintiff's prior injuries as a rationale to terminate her, or to use them as a predictor of future inability to do the job, risks contravention of this state's public policy. And, as the Appellate Division majority underscored, probability, not mere possibility, is the test for reasonably predicting future safety issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   III\n   <strong>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In addition to the points discussed above, I am compelled to point out the following with respect to the future direction of this important area of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   First, numerous courts have been reflecting on the development of discrimination litigation and on steps to simplify proof obligations in these cases rather than add to them. In particular, disability discrimination claims have provoked such attention, likely because they frequently involve an exclusive focus on the asserted justifications for disparate treatment rather than an inquiry into employer motivation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In my view, this Court in\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   took initial steps in directing how such claims should be handled straightforwardly. It would be my preference for this Court to continue down that path.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Courts across the country have struggled to articulate the most appropriate standard for disability discrimination claims, which differ from other types of discrimination claims in that they often involve an admission by the defendant that a plaintiff's disability motivated a discriminatory action.

Whether a plaintiff attempts to prove discrimination with circumstantial evidence, direct evidence, or some combination of both, the summary judgment analysis should be crafted to address the core issue of causation. In the disability context, a number of subsidiary issues can complicate evaluation of a plaintiff's claim. Those issues include, but are not limited to: (1) the nature and extent of the plaintiff's disability, including the medical evidence relied upon by an employer to support an employment decision; (2) whether the employer considered available reasonable accommodations before making its decision; and (3) whether a particular accommodation would be reasonable or would pose an undue burden for the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In the federal context, courts assessing ADA claims have adopted various approaches to these issues but have not shoehorned all of them into the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework, even in cases where circumstantial proofs were at issue.

Here, the employer explicitly admits to treating an employee differently based on a disability or perceived disability.

By focusing the parties directly on the area of dispute and the obligation of the employer to bring the adverse action within the sphere of justifiable disparate treatment on the basis of disability, the\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   Court set forth a straightforward method of dealing with what was essentially direct evidence of disability discrimination. The\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   Court differentiated between the employer\n   who \"seeks to establish the reasonableness of the otherwise discriminatory act\" and one who \"advances a non-discriminatory reason for the employee's discharge.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"290571\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/110/363/\">\n    110\n    <em>\n     N.J.\n    </em>\n    at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=541%20A.2d%20682\">\n    541\n    <em>\n     A\n    </em>\n    .2d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As discussed above, disability discrimination claims may involve burden-shifting related to the employer's justification for terminating an employee or its obligation to make a reasonable accommodation; however, the shifting of burdens on those issues should not be confused with\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting as part of a plaintiff's initial showing of disparate treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Like all of the parties, including Saint Clare's, and the amici before the Court, I would recognize that this case involves direct evidence of discrimination rather than circumstantial evidence.

It is an employer's burden to show that essential functions of a job cannot be performed by a disabled employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   10:5-29.1 ;\n   <em>\n    N.J.A.C.\n   </em>\n   13:13-2.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   To recognize that plaintiff's claim rests on direct evidence is not to say that there are no factual disputes left to be resolved. Here there are several important factual disputes. Plaintiff says that her employer has concocted the asserted \"essential\" lifting functions of the job by which she is being measured. She says she is not\n   disabled and can do the job. She says that the testing by KCI showed that she can perform the necessary lifting associated with her job. And, finally, although she never requested accommodation and was never offered any accommodation by her employer, the employer failed to explain why it could not \"meet her needs,\" to the extent it perceived that she needed disability accommodation, even though there was no discussion with her or her doctor concerning those needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Jurisprudence on the ADA supports that disputes over what is an essential function of the job and whether an employee can perform the job notwithstanding a disability, or perceived disability, are for a jury to decide. They are not issues for the employer to decide unilaterally. One need only look to our own Circuit Court of Appeals to see that such factual issues compel a matter to proceed to trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deane v. Pocono Med.

The list of essential requirements for the job contains \"Lift and Carry Tasks,\" which list the amount of weight a nurse must be required to lift or carry. There is no mention of frequency and no mention that heavy lifting must be done regularly. The U.S. Department of Labor's Dictionary of Occupational Titles (D.O.T.), to which the KCI Report refers, lists nursing as a \"medium\" strength demand job, which requires the employee to occasionally lift fifty pounds and frequently lift twenty pounds. A point of disagreement between the parties arises from comparing Grande's actual job description and the D.O.T. standards for nursing (which both indicate that the strength demands are \"medium\") with the job standards that Saint Clare's told KCI to use for the FCE, the validity of which is challenged.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    The Third Circuit relied on Interpretive Guidance issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to clarify the definition of \"essential function.\"\n    <em>\n     Deane\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219310\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/138/\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219310\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/138/\">\n     ,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219310\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/138/\">\n     142\n     <em>\n      F.\n     </em>\n     3d at 148\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
