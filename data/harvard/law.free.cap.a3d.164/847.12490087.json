In his cross appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly resentenced him to a total effective sentence that exceeds his original sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the state and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following factual and procedural history informs our review. In 2008, the defendant pleaded guilty to two class B felonies, sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1) and assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59(a)(3). The court imposed the following agreed upon sentence: On the count of sexual assault in the first degree, the court sentenced the defendant to twenty years incarceration, execution suspended after fifteen years, with ten years of probation; on the count of assault in the first degree, the court sentenced the defendant to five years incarceration, execution suspended, with five years of probation, ordered to run consecutive to the other sentence. The total effective sentence, therefore, was\n   twenty-five years incarceration, execution suspended after fifteen years, with ten years of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Subsequently, the defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence, alleging that his sentence for sexual assault in the first degree was illegal because it included a period of probation rather than a period of special parole. In support of this claim, the defendant relied on\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Victor O.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775224\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/163/#p166\">\n    301 Conn. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166, 193,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20A.3d%20669\">\n    20 A.3d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12233861,12233874,12444595,12233888,12444591,12444592,12444593,12444599,12444594,12444596,12444597,12444598,12233783,12444600,12233784,12233786,12444603,12444604,12233789,12444602,12444601,12444605,12233793,12233798,12233804,12233811,12233819,12233828,12233838,12233849\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/1039/\">\n    565 U.S. 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12444546,12444593,12444594,12444595,12444596,12444597\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/132/583/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12444593,12444594,12444595,12444596,12444597,12444598,12444599,12444600\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/181/429/\">\n    181 L.Ed.2d 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   ), and \u00a7 53a-70(b)(3). The defendant argued that, for his sentence to comply legally with \u00a7 53a-70(b)(3), as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   , the trial court was required to do each of the following: (1) add a term of special parole to the sexual assault in the first degree conviction, (2) eliminate any term of probation, and (3) reduce his unsuspended term of incarceration by the length of the added term of special parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the hearing on the motion, the state argued that \u00a7 53a-70(b)(3) and\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   do not require the imposition of a period of special parole for a conviction of sexual assault in the first degree. The court, however, agreed with the defendant\n   and vacated the original sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the court resentenced the defendant to a term of fifteen years incarceration followed by five years of special parole. The court left intact the original sentence on the assault conviction of five years incarceration, execution suspended, with five years of probation, which was ordered to run concurrent with the sexual assault sentence. The new total effective sentence instituted by the court was twenty years incarceration, execution suspended after fifteen years, with five\n   years of special parole and five years of probation, ordered to run concurrent. Both parties appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal, the state claims that the trial court incorrectly determined that it was required to resentence the defendant to a period of special parole for his conviction of sexual assault in the first degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-70(b)(3). Although acknowledging that \"it is now clear that in cases involving class B felony sexual assault in the first degree, a period of special parole is not a required sentence component\"; see\n   <em>\n    Victor O. II\n   </em>\n   , supra, 320 Conn. at 239,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20940\">\n    128 A.3d 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jason B.\n   </em>\n   , supra, 320 Conn. at 259,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20937\">\n    128 A.3d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the defendant argues, nonetheless, that we should not give retroactive effect to the Supreme Court decisions in\n   <em>\n    Victor O. II\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jason B.\n   </em>\n   because they amounted to a change in the law and he had relied on the law as it existed at the time he filed his motion. We conclude that this case is controlled by our decision today in the companion case of\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490086\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/837/\">\n    173 Conn.App. 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490086\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/837/\">\n    164 A.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202368444\">\n    2017 WL 2368444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), in which we fully addressed the retrospective applicability of\n   <em>\n    Victor O.

Therefore, the trial court improperly granted the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to reinstate the defendant's original sentence and to deny his motion to correct an illegal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Although the parties initially filed separate appeals, this court ordered that the appeals be combined and be treated as cross appeals.
