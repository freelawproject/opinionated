We conclude that the court did not find with adequate specificity that the plaintiff's actions were entirely without color. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment awarding the defendant $87,548.11 in attorney's fees and remand the matter for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before we discuss the facts, as found by the court in its oral decision, and the procedural history of this case, we highlight the manner in which the trial court made its factual findings and our concern that the procedures utilized by the court have made more difficult our appellate review of the plaintiff's claims. On January 20, 2015, the defendant filed her motion for attorney's fees and costs on the ground that the plaintiff's application for custody was brought without color and in bad faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   During a July 23, 2015 hearing on the motion, the court ordered each party to file proposed findings of fact \"because it's becoming clear to the court that it needs to make findings of fact in order to get to the end two questions [set forth in\n   <em>\n    Maris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458934\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/834/#p845\">\n    269 Conn. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20A.2d%20133\">\n    850 A.2d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) ] as to whether or not this case or any part of this case was either frivolous\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   in bad faith.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) Each\n   party filed\n   proposed findings of fact on September 10, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the plaintiff subsequently filed an objection to the defendant's proposed findings of fact relative to her motion for attorney's fees on December 7, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 8, 2015, the court held another hearing on the motion, at which time it informed the parties of the following: \"I-if not in total part, I find the defendant's facts to be credible. And I find the plaintiff's proposed findings and opposition to defendant's facts to be more like testimony that the court found at different intervals was not at all credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"So I thought to myself, I am-I have already spent four years on this case and I have absolutely no intention of studying this case anymore and writing out what I consider to be findings of fact separate such that the decision will reiterate what's already in the file, what's already on all the transcripts, and what's already in the proposed findings of fact. I'm not going to do that. What I thought that the sanest way to be was to take the defendant's proposed findings of fact and I want to address every single one on the record today. I think it's a clean way to do things, and I want to attack-I want to attack every single one of those facts as facts, not proffers on the part of the plaintiff, not what you think the evidence is-is credible; but, to the extent that we can adhere to what's on the transcript, what's in the files, I want to find and articulate those facts as we find them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court then proceeded to go through the first twenty-eight paragraphs of the defendant's proposed findings of fact, intermittently pausing to ask both parties, albeit with a focus on the plaintiff's counsel, to confirm or deny the proposed finding in question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   No\n   matter how the plaintiff's counsel responded, that is, whether he agreed with the proposed finding, disagreed with the proposed finding, or expressed that he would \"leave [the proposed finding] to the defendant's proof,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court immediately found each\n   of the first twenty-eight paragraphs as fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We note that the factual support for many of these findings is scattered over various days of the record in a proceeding that continued for four years, thereby making our review more difficult. Those facts were as follows.\n   The plaintiff, a citizen of the United States (U.S.), and the defendant, a citizen of the United Kingdom (U.K.), met in October, 2009, and began cohabitating in Greenwich, Connecticut, in February, 2010. The parties had a child on October 11, 2010. In April, 2011, the parties discussed relocating to London, England, and ultimately decided to do so on July 7, 2011, at which time they made substantial preparations for the move.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about September 7, 2011, while in the U.K. together, the plaintiff surreptitiously took the minor child's American passport from the defendant with the intent to abscond with the minor child without the defendant's consent and bring him back to the U.S. Although the plaintiff eventually conceded that he had taken the passport, he refused to return it to the defendant. Accordingly, the fearful defendant filed an application in a court in Stockport, England, under the Children Act 1989 for residence, contact, prohibited steps, and financial provision orders concerning the minor child (Stockport proceeding). That court entered an immediate temporary order that the minor child not be removed from the jurisdiction of England and Wales. Subsequently, on October 18, 2011, the plaintiff brought a Hague Convention proceeding against the defendant in the U.K. under the Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985 (Hague proceeding),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   thereby staying further actions in the Stockport proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff filed the present case in the Superior Court by way of an application for custody dated November 12, 2011, and an order of notice dated December 7, 2011. On the last two pages of the affidavit that the plaintiff filed with his application, he affirmatively responded to the following statements: \"I have not been a party or a witness or participated in any other capacity in cases in Connecticut or any other state concerning custody of or visitation with any child listed in this affidavit,\" and \"I do not know of other civil or criminal proceedings in Connecticut or any other state, now or in the past, that could affect the current proceeding ....\" In addition, directly below the defendant's signature, there was a legend that stated: \"You have an ongoing duty to tell the court about any case that could affect the current proceeding, in\n   Connecticut or any other state, if you learn about it during this case.\" The defendant was fully aware of the Stockport and Hague proceedings at the time he filed the custody application in Connecticut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 5, 2011, a hearing was held before the High Court in London in which several orders were entered, largely on the consent of the plaintiff's U.K. counsel, including the following: the Hague proceeding would be dismissed; the Stockport proceeding would be transferred to England's family court; the shared residence, contact, and maintenance issues between the parties would be mediated; England and Wales would be the forum conveniens for all disputes concerning the minor child; and the minor child would reside with the defendant on an interim basis, although the plaintiff would have reasonable contact time with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Over the next several months, the defendant tried to have the custody matter adjudicated in the courts of the U.K., while attempting to have the present Connecticut action dismissed. The plaintiff appeared in person at hearings in both the U.K. and Connecticut sporadically throughout this time period. Notably, on August 15, 2012, a U.K. judge ordered the plaintiff to make monthly payments to the defendant, on an interim basis, for the minor child's support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eventually, in December,\n   2012,\n   the U.K. court made an express finding that it had jurisdiction to hear the defendant's application for support, on the ground that the U.K. was the habitual residence of the minor child. It also decided to continue the previous August 15, 2012 support order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, in the present Connecticut action, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the case on February 14, 2012, citing the following grounds: the plaintiff had voluntarily consented to the jurisdiction of the courts of England for all disputes concerning the minor child, and there had been no custody determination by Connecticut; there was a foreign custody determination in effect within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-115hh et seq. ; the court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-115q, as it is a forum non conveniens for resolution of this matter; and the court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the action pursuant to the common law, as it is a forum non conveniens for resolution of this matter. An evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss eventually took place over the course of several days in 2014, at which both parties testified as witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although the plaintiff personally attended the hearing on the motion to dismiss on some of these dates in the beginning and middle of the year, he deliberately refused to appear personally in court on both October 31, 2014, and December 1, 2014, even though he had been ordered to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   On a rescheduled hearing date\n   of December 17, 2014, the plaintiff again failed to appear in person, but ultimately appeared via telephone, at which time he elected to withdraw the present action with prejudice with a stated intention to pursue custody of the minor child in the U.K. courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the court made these findings of fact, the parties then were given a chance to argue orally regarding the motion before the court. At the end of the hearing, the court issued its ruling on the record, stating: \"[T]he court finds that the entire\n   <em>\n    case\n   </em>\n   was brought by [the plaintiff] wherein his claims were entirely without color and that he continuously, for over a four year period, including today, acted in bad faith. The record and the facts are replete with examples of that ... bad faith. And, for that reason, the court is going to grant the request for attorney's fees in the amount of $87,548.11.\" (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff then brought the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims, inter alia, that the court improperly awarded attorney's fees to the defendant under the bad faith exception to the American rule by broadly concluding, in derogation of\n   <em>\n    Maris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458934\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/834/#p845\">\n    269 Conn. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20A.2d%20133\">\n    850 A.2d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that the plaintiff's underlying custody action was both (1) \"entirely without color\" and (2) taken in bad faith. We conclude that the court did not find with adequate specificity that the plaintiff's actions were entirely without color.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We begin by setting forth the standard of review and legal principles relevant to this claim. \"It is well established that we review the trial court's decision to\n   award attorney's fees for abuse of discretion....

For example, as previously recounted, the court stated at the end of the hearing that it \"finds that the entire case was brought by [the plaintiff] wherein his claims were entirely without color and that he continuously, for over a four year period,\n   <em>\n    including\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    today\n   </em>\n   , acted in bad faith.\" (Emphasis added.) Without more elaboration on the part of the court, we have no way of ascertaining what conduct the court was referencing when it stated \"including today,\" because it is not clear what the court believed the plaintiff had done that day that was improper, other than contesting the motion, and whether that perceived impropriety supported the court's finding\n   that his claims were entirely without color or its finding that he acted in bad faith. Ultimately, we conclude that although the court found\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   both that the plaintiff's custody action was entirely without color and that he acted in bad faith, it did not delineate the two separate findings, and it did not cite factual support for each with the high degree of specificity required by our case law.

Therefore, we do not know whether the court found that the action was entirely without color based on the facts underlying the case, or whether the action was entirely without color because it was legally frivolous. We address both possibilities in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   With respect to the factual merit of the plaintiff's action, the court made no findings on the record that addressed whether it was in the best interests of the minor child for the plaintiff to have custody. We begin\n   by noting that, because this is a child custody proceeding, the question of whether the plaintiff here \"could\" prevail factually on his application is a somewhat subjective inquiry, given that the court has considerable discretion in fashioning its custody orders. Specifically, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56(a) provides in relevant part: \"In any controversy before the Superior Court as to the custody or care of minor children ... the court may make ... any proper order regarding the custody ... of the children if it has jurisdiction under the provisions of chapter 815p.... [T]he court may assign parental responsibility for raising the child to the parents jointly, or may award custody to either parent or to a third party,\n   <em>\n    according to its best judgment\n   </em>\n   upon the facts of the case and subject to such conditions and limitations as it deems equitable.\" (Emphasis added.) \"In making ... any order ... the rights and responsibilities of both parents shall be considered and the court shall enter orders accordingly that serve the best interests of the child ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56(b).\n   In other words, by virtue of the fact that the outcome in the present action was\n   so dependent on the court's personal assessment of what was in the best interest of the child, versus its application of black letter law, it is inherently more difficult for a court considering a custody application to determine that no reasonable person could have concluded that the facts supporting the application might have been established. Indeed, in the present case, the court never indicated on the record that its finding of \"entirely without color\" was grounded in a determination that no reasonable person could have concluded that awarding the plaintiff some degree of custody might be in the best interest of the child. In fact, although the defendant makes the argument in her brief that \"a custody action is ... a comprehensive determination of what is in a child's best interest,\" and that \"the prospects of the plaintiff ever being awarded custody were extraordinarily dim\" in light of several factors implicating the best interest of the child,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    the court never mentioned the best interest of the child standard at any point during its ruling\n   </em>\n   .\n   Because the court did not base its \"entirely without color\" finding on any factual considerations of what might be in the best interest of the minor child here, we turn to the question of whether the court based its finding on any legal considerations. On this point, the plaintiff suggests that, in child custody matters, it is necessary for the court, in determining whether the claims are colorable, to consider whether the party reasonably could have concluded that both standing\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   and jurisdiction might have been established. The plaintiff then argues that because he, \"as a person holding himself out as [the minor child's] father, had the absolute right to\n   claim a determination of custody and visitation of his son, who is an American citizen, in [the minor child's] home state of Connecticut,\" his custody claim was necessarily colorable. After reviewing the transcript of the court's oral decision in this matter, we conclude that it is not necessary to address this argument because the court here expressly stated that it was not basing its \"entirely without color\" finding on jurisdictional considerations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time, however, we think it prudent to note that, to the extent the court did discuss jurisdiction in its ruling, it acknowledged several times that Connecticut had legitimate \"home state jurisdiction\" under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-115 et seq., at the time the custody application was filed, thereby suggesting the alternate conclusion that the plaintiff's custody action\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   colorable with respect to its legal sufficiency.\n   Finally, we recognize the defendant's argument in her brief that \"the plaintiff's petition was wholly without merit at its inception\" because it was brought for ulterior purposes, namely, in retaliation for the defendant filing the Stockport proceeding and with the purpose to harass her. Because this assertion relates to whether the plaintiff was motivated by improper purposes in bringing or conducting this litigation, however, it bears upon the finding of bad faith conduct. See\n   <em>\n    Maris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458934\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/834/#p845\">\n    269 Conn. at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20A.2d%20133\">\n    850 A.2d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (clear evidence that challenged actions are taken \"for reasons of harassment or delay or for other improper purposes\" supports finding of bad faith conduct). In our view, the assertion is not particularly relevant to the court's finding that the claims were entirely without color.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, we can theorize several circumstances in which a litigant may have retaliatory or other questionable motives in choosing to initiate an action against another, yet his or her claims may still have legal or factual merit and, thus, are not entirely without color.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As previously discussed,\n   <em>\n    Maris\n   </em>\n   makes clear that in order to impose attorney's fees and costs as a sanction pursuant to its inherent authority, the court must find\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   that the litigant's claims were entirely without color\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that the litigant acted in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    Berzins\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Berzins\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20651\">\n    306 Conn. at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%20941\">\n    51 A.3d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

See footnote 8 of this opinion. Importantly, however, that was a proceeding entirely separate from the present custody proceeding and, thus, entirely separate from the colorability of the claims at issue here.
