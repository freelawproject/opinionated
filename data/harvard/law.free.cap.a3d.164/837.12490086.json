On July 1, 2008, following a jury trial, the Superior Court rendered a judgment of conviction against the defendant on two counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70(a)(2), one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21(a)(2), and one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a(a)(1)(A). The conduct supporting these charges arose out of two incidents of sexual contact that the defendant had with the child victim sometime between 2002 and 2003, when the victim was five or six years old and in first or second grade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 2, 2008, the court sentenced the defendant as follows: On the first count of sexual assault in the first degree, the court sentenced the defendant to seventeen years incarceration, execution suspended after twelve years, with ten years of probation; on the second count of sexual assault in the first degree, the court sentenced the defendant to twelve years incarceration; on the count of risk of injury to a child, the court sentenced the defendant to ten years incarceration; and on the count of sexual assault in the fourth degree, the court sentenced the defendant to one year incarceration. The court ordered all sentences to run concurrently, for a total effective sentence of seventeen years incarceration, execution suspended after twelve years, with ten years of probation. This court affirmed the\n   defendant's conviction on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233632\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/124/118/\">\n    124 Conn.App. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.3d%201021\">\n    3 A.3d 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344917,4344661,4344526\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/908/\">\n    299 Conn. 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20525\">\n    10 A.3d 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 17, 2015, the defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence.

I\n   </em>\n   ). The defendant alleged that, for his sentence to comply legally with \u00a7 53a-70(b)(3) and\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   , the trial court was required to do each of the following: (1) add a term of special parole to each count of first degree sexual assault, (2) eliminate any term of probation, and (3) reduce his unsuspended term of incarceration by the length of the added term of special parole. The defendant argued in his motion that the law \"does not authorize a sentence of imprisonment, special parole,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   probation. Accordingly, once the court adds special parole to the sentence, it must remove probation.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n   The trial court conducted a hearing on April 30, 2015. The parties initially assumed that the defendant's conviction of the sexual assault in the first degree charges was for a class B felony. During the hearing, however, the court raised a concern about whether a conviction of that crime was for a class A felony rather than for a class B felony because the legislature had changed the classification during the period the crimes were alleged to have occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, the court ruled\n   that, regardless of whether the defendant's conviction was for a class A or a class B felony, a period of special parole was required pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   , and, therefore, the defendant's sentence was illegal because it did not include a period of special parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, thereafter, vacated the defendant's sentences and imposed the following new sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On each count of sexual assault in the first degree, the court resentenced the defendant to eleven years incarceration, with one year of special parole; on the count of risk of injury to a child, the court resentenced the defendant to seventeen years incarceration, execution suspended after twelve years, with twelve years of probation; and, on the count of sexual assault in the fourth degree, the court resentenced the defendant to one year incarceration. The court ordered all sentences to run concurrently, for a total effective sentence of seventeen years incarceration, execution suspended after twelve years, with one year of special parole and ten years of probation. Both the state and the defendant now appeal from the trial court's judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The state claims that the defendant's original sentence was not illegal for lack of a term of special parole, and, therefore, the trial court improperly granted the defendant's motion on that ground. To support its claim, the state relies on two recent cases from our Supreme Court,\n   <em>\n    Victor O. II\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jason B.\n   </em>\n   The state further contends that we also must assume that the defendant's conviction for sexual assault in the first degree was for a class B felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The state contends that the burden to prove illegality in his sentence was on the defendant and that he failed to provide any evidence to demonstrate that the crimes were class A felonies. Therefore, the state argues, we must assume that the original sentence on count one, which contained a term of probation, was legal, and we should hold as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant acknowledges that our Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    Victor O. II\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jason B.\n   </em>\n   , clarified any ambiguity in the law regarding whether \u00a7 53a-70(b)(3) required\n   a period a special parole as part of a defendant's sentence. Indeed, in both of those cases the court held that \u00a7 53a-70(b) does not require that a trial court sentence persons convicted under this statute to a period of special parole. He argues, nonetheless, that we should conclude that his original sentence was illegal for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   First, he contends that he relied, to his detriment, on the language of \u00a7 53a-70(b)(3), which, he argues, plainly and unambiguously provides that a person convicted under this section \"shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment and a period of special parole.\" Second, he contends that he relied, to his detriment, on his reading of\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   . He argues that in\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court had construed the specific language in \u00a7 53a-70(b)(3) and, in doing so, the court had concluded that a period of special parole\n   <em>\n    was required\n   </em>\n   in cases such as his. Ultimately, the defendant argues that, at the time he filed his motion, it was settled law that special parole was required and he should not be penalized for relying on established law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The state responds that it was not settled law at all. The state contends that, although there may have been some question as to whether a period of special parole was required in cases of sexual assault in the first degree due to the language of \u00a7 53a-70(b)(3) and a particular reading of a portion of our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   , the matter certainly was contested by the state. Thus, the state argues, the defendant's reliance on that disputed matter when preparing his motion is no reason to give him the benefit of his misinterpretation of the law. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We set forth the applicable legal principles and our standard of review. \"[T]he jurisdiction of the sentencing court terminates once a defendant's sentence has begun, and, therefore, that court may no longer take\n   any action affecting a defendant's sentence unless it expressly has\n   been authorized to act. ... Practice Book \u00a7 43-22, which provides the trial court with such authority, provides that [t]he judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner. An illegal sentence is essentially one which either exceeds the relevant statutory maximum limits, violates a defendant's right against double jeopardy, is ambiguous, or is internally contradictory. ... We previously have noted that a defendant may challenge his or her criminal sentence on the ground that it is illegal by raising the issue on direct appeal or by filing a motion pursuant to ... \u00a7 43-22 with the judicial authority, namely, the trial court. ...\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tabone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668520\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/527/#p533\">\n    279 Conn. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 533-34,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20A.2d%201058\">\n    902 A.2d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).

Thus, our Supreme Court agreed with the resentencing court that special parole was not required and that it had not set forth such a requirement in its remand order in\n   <em>\n    Victor O.

Id., at 245-47,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20940\">\n    128 A.3d 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It is clear from\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Victor O. II\n   </em>\n   that the issue concerning whether special parole was mandatory for defendants convicted of violating \u00a7 53a-70 had not been decided by a reviewing court until our Supreme Court issued its ruling in\n   <em>\n    Victor O. II\n   </em>\n   . Although there may have been some uncertainty created by the language in\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   regarding whether a sentence pursuant to a conviction of \u00a7 53a-70 required a period of special parole, our Supreme Court neither addressed nor ruled on that issue in\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the requirement of special parole for those persons convicted of a violation of \u00a7 53a-70 was \"settled law\" prior to\n   <em>\n    Victor O. II\n   </em>\n   is untenable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   That this argument is untenable is further demonstrated by the action taken by the trial court in\n   <em>\n    Victor\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O. I\n   </em>\n   on remand, the very case on which the defendant relies. In\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   , after our Supreme Court issued its remand order, the remand court resentenced Victor O. to a term of imprisonment of twelve years for his conviction of sexual assault in the first degree, with no period of special parole. Id., at 244-45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20940\">\n    128 A.3d 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The remand court specifically concluded that our Supreme Court did not hold that a period of special parole was required for all persons who were convicted of sexual assault in the first degree. Id., at 245,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20940\">\n    128 A.3d 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At best, then, the issue that the defendant now claims was \"settled law\" when he filed his motion and the trial court issued its ruling in the present case would be characterized, more appropriately, as unsettled in Supreme Court case law. The \"requirement\" of special parole for persons convicted of \u00a7 53a-70 had not been construed by our Supreme Court, and\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   certainly did not clarify the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In any event, it is clear that whether special parole was required was not \"settled\n   law\" when the defendant filed his motion. The defendant's mistaken interpretation and contention that it was \"settled law\" is not a basis for this court essentially to pretend that the law was settled by\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   and to then conclude that the law changed with\n   <em>\n    Victor O. II\n   </em>\n   . See\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733604\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/792/#p804\">\n    287 Conn. at 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=950%20A.2d%201220\">\n    950 A.2d 1220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (decision that corrects mistaken interpretation of law, does not constitute change in law). Accordingly, the defendant's argument, that he relied on the purported \"settled law\" that special parole was mandatory, as allegedly established by\n   <em>\n    Victor O. I\n   </em>\n   , is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, we consider the state's contention that if we agree that the defendant's original sentence was not illegal because it did not include a period of special parole, we must determine whether the defendant's conviction for sexual assault in the first degree, as alleged in count one, was a class A or a class B felony. The state contends that if the defendant's conviction,\n   on count one, of sexual assault in the first degree was a class A felony, then a period of probation would not have been allowed pursuant to \u00a7 53a-29\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the original sentence on count one, therefore, would be illegal. The state further contends that, because the defendant failed to meet his alleged burden of proof by providing evidence that his conviction on count one was, instead, a class A, rather than a class B, felony, we must assume and hold that the conviction was for a class B felony and that the sentence, therefore, was legal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendant contends that we should not decide this issue because it was neither presented to nor decided by the trial court. He argues that it was not his theory of illegality before the trial court and that he, therefore, did not attempt to provide any proof whatsoever that his conviction on count one should have been classified as a class A felony. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Only in [the] most exceptional circumstances can and will [a reviewing court] consider a claim, constitutional or otherwise, that has not been raised and decided in the trial court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Martin M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415756\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/143/140/#p151\">\n    143 Conn.App. 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 151,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20A.3d%20135\">\n    70 A.3d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20919\">\n    309 Conn. 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20A.3d%2041\">\n    70 A.3d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). \"For this court to ... consider [a] claim on the basis of a specific legal ground not raised during trial would amount to trial by ambuscade, unfair both to the [court] and to the opposing party.\" (Internal quotation\n   marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Koslik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065376\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/116/693/#p702\">\n    116 Conn.App. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20275\">\n    977 A.2d 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147608,4146425,4148204\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/930/\">\n    293 Conn. 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=980%20A.2d%20916\">\n    980 A.2d 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For purposes of this appeal, we assume, without deciding, that the defendant's conviction on count one was for a class B felony.

Here, however, the state does not ask us to correct an\n   <em>\n    illegal sentence\n   </em>\n   ; rather, it seeks to have us issue a ruling declaring that the defendant's sentence\n   <em>\n    is legal\n   </em>\n   because the defendant did not claim and prove that it was illegal on the ground that the conviction was for a class A felony and the sentence improperly included a period of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because the defendant does not claim that his sentence on count one is illegal on the ground that his conviction should have been classified as a class A felony, for which our Supreme Court has ruled a period of probation would not be permitted, we decline to issue the ruling that the state is seeking; there simply is no record on which we could base such a ruling.

This court also granted a motion filed by the state to stay briefing in this appeal pending the decision of our Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Jason B.\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Victor O. II\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The state posits that if the conviction was for a class A felony, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-29(a), a term of probation would have been prohibited for count one, and the sentence would be illegal on this ground because \u00a7 53a-29(a) provides: \"The court may sentence a person to a period of probation upon conviction of any crime,\n    <em>\n     other than a class A felony\n    </em>\n    ....\" (Emphasis added.) We are mindful that our legislature has amended \u00a7 53a-29 several times since the defendant's commission of the crimes that formed the basis of his conviction. Nevertheless, because those amendments have no bearing on the outcome of this appeal, we refer only to the current revision of \u00a7 53a-29.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    We note that, effective October 1, 2015, the legislature amended \u00a7 53a-70(b)(3) to permit a period of supervised probation for class A felonies under this section. See Public Acts 2015, No. 15-211, \u00a7 16 (\"Any person found guilty under this section shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least ten years, a portion of which may be suspended, except as provided in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, or a term of imprisonment and a period of special parole pursuant to subsection (b) of section 53a-28 which together constitute a sentence of at least ten years. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of section 53a-29 and except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a court may suspend a portion of a sentence imposed under this subsection and impose a period of supervised probation pursuant to subsection (f) of section 53a-29.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Victor O. II\n    </em>\n    , our Supreme Court acknowledged that that statement was unclear, that it set forth too broadly the state's concession in\n    <em>\n     Victor O. I\n    </em>\n    , and that its decision and remand order could have been misinterpreted on that basis: \"As we previously noted, in support of his contention that \u00a7 53a-70(b)(3) requires that he be sentenced to a period of special parole, the defendant relies on our statement in [\n    <em>\n     Victor O.

Id., at 193,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20A.3d%20669\">\n     20 A.3d 669\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Although we recognize that it is possible to construe this statement as indicating that the defendant must be resentenced to a period of special parole instead of a period of probation, we intended only to explain that probation was prohibited and that special parole was the only form of supervised release that could be imposed. Indeed, the state did not concede that the defendant's sentence was illegal because it should have included a period of special parole; the state conceded only that probation was not an authorized sentence because the defendant had been convicted of a class A felony. In fact, the state expressly argued that the trial court is never required to sentence a defendant to special parole but that, if the court does elect to impose such a sentence, then the term of imprisonment and period of special parole together must total at least ten years.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Victor O.
