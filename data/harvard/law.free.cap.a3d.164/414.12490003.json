McDuffie and Hakeem A. Chance, jointly tried before a jury, separately appeal from a July 29, 2014 judgment of conviction. Co-defendants argue the trial judge impermissibly denied their motions requiring the State to release information regarding a global positioning system (GPS) tracking device used to prove their involvement in two burglaries. Also, co-defendants argue the judge erroneously admitted testimony regarding the prior military training of a police officer, who identified McDuffie as the passenger in the vehicle driven by Chance. More specifically, each defendant articulates these challenges, seeking to vacate his conviction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    POINT ONE\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF HIS FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL WITH A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A COMPLETE DEFENSE BY SUSTAINING DETECTIVE ECKERT'S REFUSAL TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION REGARDING THE MODEL NUMBER OF THE GPS TRACKING DEVICE INSTALLED ON THE BMW, THE LOCATION WHERE IT WAS INSTALLED, THE TYPE OF BATTERY WHICH POWERED THE DEVICE, AND THE LENGTH OF TIME IT COULD BE EXPECTED TO HOLD A CHARGE SUFFICIENT TO TRANSMIT RELIABLE DATA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    POINT TWO\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   TESTIMONY THAT DETECTIVE AROCHAS WAS A TRAINED MILITARY SHARPSHOOTER AND THUS HAD SPECIAL TRAINING AND EXPERTISE IN MAKING RELIABLE SPLIT-SECOND IDENTIFICATIONS WAS NOT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   RELEVANT, AND ITS POTENTIAL FOR PREJUDICE FAR OUTWEIGHED WHATEVER PROBATIVE VALUE IT MIGHT HAVE HAD.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Finally, each defendant challenges the imposed sentence as manifestly excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We have reviewed these arguments in light of the record and applicable law. We affirm each conviction. However, insufficient factual findings require we remand for resentencing and correction of the judgments of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We recite the facts related to the issues on appeal, taken from the record of the ten-day trial. After obtaining a warrant, Detective James Eckert, of the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office (BCPO), installed a tracking device on a dark blue BMW X6 (BMW) registered to Chance's mother. The designated device is available only to law enforcement; however, components of the device, including the GPS chip, are sold commercially. The GPS records location data on the device itself, and transmits its position via cell towers, which allows police to track the device location in real time on a laptop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 12, 2012, a joint surveillance team commenced the operation. The team consisted of detectives from the BCPO Special Investigation Squad who were assisted by local police, operating three unmarked vehicles. BCPO Sergeant John Booth was in charge of the team. He occupied the tracking vehicle, which was driven by Detective Jonathan Arochas and contained Detective James Eckert, the GPS expert, and Detective Michael Falotico. The first of two trailing vehicles contained only BCPO Detective Elliott Cookson; the other vehicle, driven by Detective Edward Young of the Fort Lee Police Department, was also occupied by undercover officers from Hackensack and Teaneck. The officers in the three vehicles communicated with one another using portable radios. Detective Eckert tracked the BMW in real time via the GPS data transmitted to his laptop, and the officers in the trailing vehicles maintained intermittent visual contact with the BMW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the days leading up to the investigation under examination, the accuracy of the GPS device was checked, using visual observations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Immediately prior to the events on the evening of July 12, 2012, Detective Eckert confirmed the GPS device was functioning properly and accurately recording the BMW's location. Specifically, Detective Eckert observed the BMW in the parking lot of the Hilton Hotel in Hasbrouck Heights, the same location the GPS pinpointed the BMW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At 7 p.m. Detective Young observed Chance enter the BMW, still parked at the Hilton in Hasbrouck Heights, and drive off. Detective Eckert used the GPS device while occupying the tracking vehicle, and the trailing vehicles confirmed the BMW, driven by Chance, traveled to Englewood and stopped on William Street, across from McDuffie's address, at 7:32 p.m. Chance returned to the Hilton and again began to travel at 8:42 p.m. The BMW was tracked to the vicinity of Dubois Court, Englewood, where it stopped for two minutes. Detective Eckert acknowledged Dubois Court, which is not a public street, was not specifically displayed on the laptop map. No officer physically observed McDuffie enter the BMW. However, Detectives Cookson and Eckert noted Chance and a black male passenger in the BMW when it stopped for gas on Route 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The police continued to track the BMW as it headed North on the Garden State Parkway and exited in Nutley at 9:31 p.m. After driving around Nutley, at 9:40 p.m., the BMW drove down Spatz Avenue, a cul-de-sac, turned around, drove one block over and parked on Margaret Avenue. The BMW remained parked on Margaret Avenue for eleven minutes. During this time, the three law enforcement vehicles were parked approximately three blocks away, and the officers did not observe the BMW parked on Margaret Avenue or see defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A few minutes after 10 p.m., Sergeant Booth received a call from the Nutley Police Department, informing him police received notice an alarm was triggered from a home on Spatz Avenue. Later that evening or early the next morning, Nutley police also received information regarding the robbery of a second home on Spatz Avenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Spatz Avenue is a short dead end street, with the dead end abutting the Garden State Parkway. The two vandalized homes on Spatz Avenue sit adjacent to one another. The first owner testified his residence, from which the alarm call was sent, was ransacked, but nothing was stolen. The second owner, a Newark Police Officer, reported his home was broken into some time while he was at work and listed missing items as a laptop, an iPod, $400 cash, and $14,500 in jewelry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After receiving the call from the Nutley police, Detective Booth instructed the trailing vehicles to stop the BMW. Detective Cookson pulled behind the BMW. The BMW, followed by Cookson, passed the parked second trailing vehicle, which joined the pursuit. Finally, the tracking vehicle followed behind the other two police vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When the BMW stopped at a traffic light located at the intersection of Centre Street and East Passaic Avenue, Detective Arochas pulled alongside the BMW and activated the police lights and siren to commence a motor vehicle stop. Detective Cookson attempted to pull in front of the BMW to block its lane of travel. Before he could do so, the traffic signal changed, the BMW accelerated, and collided with Detective Cookson's vehicle. The BMW then slammed into Detective Arochas's vehicle. As a result, the laptop was jarred from Detective Eckert's grasp and closed, terminating the real time GPS link. The BMW swerved again, hitting Detective Young's vehicle and sped away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The BMW accelerated, reaching a high rate of speed; it ignored several traffic signals, and drove on the wrong side of the road. Detective Arochas led the police pursuit and maintained consistent visual contact. He watched the BMW strike a center concrete barrier, while making a sharp left turn. The impact punctured the front left tire, yet the vehicle continued traveling on the rim. The BMW could not negotiate a curve on Long Hill Road, Little Falls, on three wheels and collided into a stone wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As Detective Arochas's vehicle pulled perpendicular to the stopped BMW, the passenger briefly turned and faced him. Detective\n   Arochas was able to get a full view of the passenger's face, illuminated by headlights, before the passenger turned away and fled the BMW. Chance also abandoned the vehicle, but was found approximately fifty feet from the crash site and arrested. Despite Detective Young's efforts, the passenger escaped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Detective Eckert retrieved the GPS device and downloaded the location data. The subsequent search of the BMW recovered two iPhones traced to Chance, a mini flashlight, a black bandana, ski mask and one sneaker on the driver's side, and a pair of sneakers and a cell phone on the passenger's\n   side. None of the reported stolen property was recovered or found along the chase route.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In an unrelated investigation, another officer provided a tip to Detective Arochas, received from a credible confidential informant that \"Dammen McDuffie\" was involved in the burglaries. Detective Arochas determined McDuffie lived on Dubois Court in Englewood, the same area where the BMW stopped prior to proceeding to Spatz Avenue on July 12. Searching motor vehicle records, he found McDuffie's photograph and instantly recognized him as the passenger he saw in the BMW. Police obtained an arrest warrant and went to McDuffie's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   McDuffie was located, standing behind his vehicle, in the parking lot outside his home on Dubois Court. Four unmarked police vehicles, carrying at least five officers, including Detectives Eckert and Young, which surrounded McDuffie, identified themselves, and attempted to place him under arrest. When ordered to get on the ground, McDuffie unsuccessfully attempted to run, but was grabbed and arrested. McDuffie resisted efforts to handcuff him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At trial, Sergeant John Booth, Detectives Eckert, Arochas, and Falotico, who were in the tracking vehicle on July 12, along with Detectives Cookson and Young from the trailing vehicles, testified. Detectives Eckert and Cookson identified Chance as the driver of the BMW. Detective Young described the male passenger in the BMW; Detective Arochas specifically identified McDuffie as the passenger he saw flee following the crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At the close of evidence, the jury convicted McDuffie of two counts of third-degree burglary,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:18-2, and the disorderly persons offense of resisting arrest,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:29-2. He was acquitted of hindering apprehension. Chance was convicted of two counts of third-degree burglary, three counts of second-degree eluding/failure to stop,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:29-2(b), and eight counts of fourth-degree aggravated assault on a police officer,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:12-1(b)(5)(A). McDuffie's motion for a new trial was denied. Sentence was imposed for each defendant and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Co-defendants seek to reverse their convictions challenging the admissibility of evidence from the GPS unit and testimony regarding Detective Arochas's prior military training. The standard for reviewing these issues requires we consider whether the trial judge abused his discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We consider these two issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Co-defendants argue their right to a fair trial was impeded because the judge denied their motions to suppress the GPS data and to disclose specific information regarding the nature and location of the GPS device. During a December 19, 2013, pre-trial\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   104 hearing, Detective Eckert, who personally installed the device, was the only witness. He testified regarding his training and expertise with the GPS device. He stated the device's efficacy was dependent upon proper use and acknowledged on occasion the device distorted speed or displayed inaccurate information when losing power or when the signal was disrupted by reflections from water or very tall structures. During cross-examination, Detective Eckert declined to disclose the model of the GPS device, where police installed the device on the BMW, the exact battery used to power the device and the duration of a single charge. Detective Eckert confirmed the device was used not just in Bergen County, but by hundreds of other law enforcement agencies across the\n   country. Co-defendants objected, asserting non-disclosure of the\n   identifying information prevented them from engaging an expert who could contest the reliability of the GPS readings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The trial judge considered and rejected co-defendants' arguments. He stated co-defendants' requests would provide information to identify \"the actual item,\" disseminating the exact GPS device, now exclusively accessible to law enforcement, to \"many people.\" Further, he noted co-defendants retained the opportunity to cross-examine Detective Eckert and retain an expert if they chose. He concluded the GPS data was admissible. At trial, Detective Eckert was again asked where the device was installed on the BMW. The State's objection was sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On appeal, co-defendants maintain withholding the GPS information impeded their ability to assert a complete defense, thus violating their due process rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crane v.

We are not persuaded by co-defendants' circular reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The State revealed the computer chip technology responsible for sending and receiving radio signals, employed by the GPS device and released the actual location data the device collected. The related datasheet included the manufacturer of the computer sheet and the recorded location of the BMW, the number of satellites the device was connected to, and the accuracy, to the meter, of the reported location. In our view, this technical data provides an adequate foundation for an expert to identify any additional information necessary to challenge the GPS device's\n   accuracy. Co-defendants did not present an affidavit of an expert to explain common areas of unreliability of GPS devices or offer a link to how the location on the BMW affected the device's reporting. Moreover, no expert explained what information was needed to make this assessment. The lack of expert testimony or other evidence to establish how the undisclosed information was \"essential to a fair determination of the case,\" defeats co-defendants' request for disclosure.\n   <em>\n    Garcia, supra\n   </em>\n   , 131\n   <em>\n    N.J.\n   </em>\n   at 80,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"303087\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/131/67/#p70\">\n    618\n    <em>\n     A\n    </em>\n    .2d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Co-defendants also suggest the sole evidence tying them to the scene of the burglaries was the GPS data, requiring the requested disclosures.

Based on the record evidence, we reject co-defendants' assertions as unfounded. Unrefuted facts prove police tested the accuracy of the GPS device prior to commencing surveillance. Detective Young saw Chance enter the BMW and Detective Cookson confirmed two men occupied the BMW after it was shown to stop near McDuffies' residence. The BMW was observed exiting the highway in Nutley, and after a house alarm was tripped on Spatz Avenue, the BMW passed the trailing surveillance\n   vehicles prior to stopping at the light on Centre Street and East Passaic Avenue as it headed toward the Parkway entrance. These uncontroverted facts sufficiently corroborate the GPS data confirming the location of the BMW occupied by defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Co-defendants further urge reversal arguing the trial judge ignored proof of \"inconsistencies\" in the GPS readings, which showed the device incorrectly recorded the BMW traveled at various implausible speeds. The \"inconsistencies\" in the GPS data identified by co-defendants were examined during Detective Eckert's testimony. He admitted certain readings showed a \"mistake, but only in speed, not in GPS location.\" The evidence was not offered to prove speed, nor was speed an element of any offense charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Having considered each of these arguments, we reject co-defendants' claim the trial judge abused his discretion in denying\n   their motion for disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The judge balanced the competing considerations and weighed the claimed needs presented by the State and co-defendants. In light of co-defendants' general claim for release of the GPS specifications and its location on the BMW, and the absence of a showing of need for these specifics, we conclude the interests of the State must prevail to protect ongoing and future investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Co-defendants' next challenge the admission of Detective Arochas's prior military training, as aiding his identification of McDuffie, despite viewing him for \"a split second\" in nighttime conditions. Detective Arochas testified his training as a Marine Corps sniper provided special training and expertise, which enabled him to remember faces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Co-defendants assert the trial court erred in admitting statements Detective Arochas was trained as a Marine Corps sniper, not relevant to his ability to identify the passenger in the BMW. Co-defendants maintain Arochas's prior military training had no relationship to his ability to observe \"from mobile vantage points and ... make reliable split second identifications under ... hectic, harrowing and distracting circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The issue arose in limine, as co-defendants moved to bar Detective Arochas background training and experience, arguing the testimony was prejudicial. The trial judge denied the motion concluding this background, specifically the training involving memory tests to recall observed details, was relevant to the detective's ability to identify McDuffie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   When Detective Arochas was questioned regarding his \"special training and experience\" as a Marine, McDuffie's objection was overruled. Detective Arochas then testified he attended the Marine Corps sniper school and underwent three-months of training in \"memory, observation, and concentration.\" He explained the \"memorization school\" required \"burning an image into your head so you can identify the objects later. ... [Y]ou'll look at a picture\n   for a brief split second, then you'll ... write down what you saw in that picture [,]\" requiring recall of seven of ten objects to qualify as a sniper. He then described his observations of McDuffie during the investigation and chase. He insisted his prior training enabled him to remember McDuffie's facial characteristics, even though he saw him very briefly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   An evidentiary decision is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. \"To demonstrate abuse of such discretion, the danger of undue prejudice must outweigh probative value so as to divert jurors 'from a reasonable and fair evaluation of the basic issue of guilt or innocence.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, we are constrained to vacate the sentences and remand for the court to set forth reasons for the application of\n   aggravating and mitigating factors, the basis for rejecting argued mitigating factors, and for the imposition of the consecutive sentences. The judgment of conviction must also be corrected as to assessed fines and penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part for resentencing.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
