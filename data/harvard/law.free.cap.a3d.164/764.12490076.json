We conclude that, even if we were to assume, without deciding, that individuals who make such reports were entitled to absolute immunity\n   at common law, the legislature has abrogated that common-law immunity by affording only qualified immunity to those who report abuse or neglect pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101e(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A review of the pleadings and the documents submitted in conjunction with the motion for summary judgment reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The plaintiff, a cardiologist, and the defendant, a psychiatrist, formerly were married and are the parents of two minor children. On January 24, 2011, the trial court rendered a judgment dissolving the parties' marriage. As a result of the divorce, the parties had shared custody of their two children. On February 20, 2011, the parties' four year old son purportedly informed the defendant that the plaintiff had \"hurt\" his \"tushie\" and had \"put a stick\" in his \"tushie.\" The defendant did not take any immediate action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The next day, on February 21, 2011, the parties' son purportedly repeated the allegations to the defendant. The son also told the defendant's boyfriend, Adam Joshua Watsky, about this alleged abuse. Watsky surreptitiously recorded the allegations on his cell phone. The defendant informed Watsky that her son had made similar allegations the day before. Watsky and the defendant thereafter discussed what course of action\n   they should take. Watsky wanted to \"make a report to a state agency.\" The defendant, however, convinced Watsky that they would instead\n   have the parties' son repeat the allegations to his therapist, David Meyers, at his next therapy appointment. They would then seek Meyers' opinion as to whether filing a report was necessary. Later that day, the defendant composed an e-mail describing the son's purported allegations and sent it to Meyers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The next day, February 22, 2011, at the son's therapy appointment, Meyers conducted an evaluation of the child. The defendant was not present for the evaluation. After the evaluation, however, Watsky, Meyers, and the defendant had a conversation regarding the allegations. As a result of that conversation, Watsky believed that Meyers thought that \"follow-up with a state agency was required.\" Acting on this belief, Watsky filed a report of suspected child abuse with the department later that day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Due to the report of suspected abuse, the department scheduled an evaluation of the parties' two children for February 24, 2011. The evaluation consisted of an interview and physical examination of the children, both of which were attended by the defendant at the department's request. In the course of the interview and physical examination, the defendant repeated the son's allegations to department personnel, a police officer, and personnel from Yale-New Haven Hospital's Child Sexual Abuse Clinic (Yale Clinic).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the department evaluation, the defendant sought a restraining order against the plaintiff on her children's behalf for the pendency of the department's investigation. A three day hearing concerning the restraining order took place between March 9 and March 11, 2011. At the hearing, the defendant testified\n   as to the allegations made by the son. The court,\n   <em>\n    Abery-Wetstone, J.\n   </em>\n   , however, dismissed the restraining order application after concluding that the defendant's testimony was not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the March, 2011 restraining order hearing, the department closed its investigation. The department concluded that the allegations against the plaintiff were unsubstantiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, on February 13, 2013, the plaintiff commenced the present action, seeking damages from the defendant for \"falsely and maliciously accus[ing] the plaintiff of sexually assaulting their four year old son.\" The plaintiff's operative complaint contains four different causes of action, all of which arise from the report of sexual abuse that the defendant made to department and Yale Clinic personnel during the department's investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the complaint sounds in (1) vexatious litigation, (2) defamation, (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (4) negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant filed an answer and a special defense alleging qualified immunity with respect to the claims for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. As to the defamation claim, she also\n   alleged that the statements \"were made in truth.\" The plaintiff filed a reply denying the allegations of the defendant's special defenses.\n   On December 15, 2014, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. The court heard oral argument on the motion on March 30, 2015. The defendant argued that she is entitled to summary judgment on the counts sounding in defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. She contended that those causes of action are barred because she is entitled to absolute immunity from suit by virtue of the litigation privilege. According to the defendant, she is entitled to absolute immunity for her statements regarding her son's abuse accusations pursuant to the litigation privilege because those statements were made to \"appropriate authorities in the course of investigating [the son's] claims of sexual abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff filed an objection to the defendant's motion for summary judgment. In his objection, he argued that \"the public policy of the state of Connecticut manifestly does not afford immunity, either absolute or qualified, to those who make false reports of child abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In a memorandum of decision filed July 28, 2015, the court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. It rejected the defendant's argument that she was entitled to absolute immunity from suit pursuant to the litigation privilege. The court concluded that the legislature \"has made clear that a report of suspected child abuse is entitled to only a conditional or qualified privilege ....\" In so concluding, it cited \u00a7 17a-101e(b), which provides in relevant part: \"Any person ... [who] in\n   <em>\n    good faith\n   </em>\n   , makes, or in\n   <em>\n    good faith\n   </em>\n   does not make ... [a report of suspected child abuse to the department] ... shall be immune from any liability, civil or criminal, which might otherwise be incurred or imposed ....\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, in light of this statute, the court stated that it would \"[decline] the defendant's invitation to undermine the existing\n   conditional statutory immunity by recognizing an absolute [immunity] under the common law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This interlocutory appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly determined that the litigation privilege does not entitle her to common-law absolute immunity for the statements that she made to department and Yale Clinic personnel in connection with the department's investigation of her son's alleged sexual abuse. The crux of the defendant's claim is that she is entitled to absolute immunity because affording her absolute immunity advances the policy underlying that doctrine. According to the defendant, the policy underlying absolute immunity \"is that in certain situations the public interest in having people speak freely outweighs the risk that individuals will occasionally abuse the privilege by making false and malicious statements.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thus, she argues that the factual circumstances underlying this appeal, i.e., a department investigation of suspected child abuse, presents a situation where the law encourages people to speak freely, even at the expense of immunizing individuals who make false and malicious statements. As support for this argument, the defendant posits that this state has a \"robust\" policy of protecting children from abuse, which is best effectuated by encouraging\n   individuals to speak freely when reporting suspected child abuse to the department. Consequently, the defendant contends, affording absolute immunity to individuals who report child abuse to the department will encourage individuals to speak freely\n   when making such reports and, therefore, advance the overarching goal of protecting children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Additionally, the defendant asserts that the trial court erred in concluding that \u00a7 17a-101e abrogates the absolute immunity that she contends the common law affords her. Specifically, she argues that the legislature did not intend to abrogate such common-law immunity because the statute fails to state in explicit language that it is abrogating common-law absolute immunity. We are unpersuaded by the defendant's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin by setting forth our standard of review and the relevant law. \"Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-49, summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Such questions of law are subject to plenary appellate review.... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party....

In reaching this resolution, we are guided by our Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Chadha\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Chadha\n   </em>\n   , we begin our analysis with a review of the language of the\n   relevant statutory provisions. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-103(a) provides in relevant part that any person \"having reasonable cause to suspect or believe that any child under the age of eighteen is in danger of being abused, or has been abused or neglected ... may cause a written or oral report to be made to the Commissioner of Children and Families or the commissioner's representative or a law enforcement agency....\" Section 17a-101e(b) provides in relevant part that \"[a]ny person ... [who] in\n   <em>\n    good faith\n   </em>\n   , makes ... the report pursuant to [section] ... 17a-103 shall be\n   <em>\n    immune\n   </em>\n   from\n   <em>\n    any liability, civil or criminal\n   </em>\n   , which might\n   <em>\n    otherwise be incurred or imposed\n   </em>\n   and shall have the\n   <em>\n    same immunity\n   </em>\n   with respect to\n   <em>\n    any judicial proceeding which results from such report\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The parties do not dispute that this language clearly expresses the legislature's intent that individuals who make statements that fall within the purview of \u00a7 17a-101e(b) are entitled to qualified immunity rather than absolute immunity. Indeed, it is well established that conditioning immunity on the exercise of good faith is consistent with qualified immunity, not absolute immunity. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Villages, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Longhi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486174\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/1162/#p702\">\n    166 Conn.App. 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702-703,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486174\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/1162/#p702\">\n    142 A.3d 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (statute granting immunity to municipal officials \"acting in good faith\" plainly \"affords qualified immunity, rather than absolute immunity\" [emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted] ). Given that the meaning of the plain language of the statute is not disputed, the issue we must decide is how that language affects the absolute immunity that we have assumed the common law afforded to individuals reporting child abuse to the\n   department. See\n   <em>\n    Chadha\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Charlotte Hungerford Hospital\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3594133\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/272/776/#p787\">\n    272 Conn. at 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=865%20A.2d%201163\">\n    865 A.2d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The issue presented ... is not what [the statutes] say; at least with respect to the nature of the immunity provided thereunder, namely, qualified immunity, the pertinent statutory language is unambiguous.

It is impossible to give effect both to the qualified immunity provided by \u00a7 17a-101e(b) and any purported absolute immunity that may have existed at common law.

If the legislature wanted to provide protection to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   reporters of abuse, then it certainly could have done so.

See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101e(d) (imposing $2000 fine, maximum jail sentence of one year, or both, for false report).

As discussed previously, in rejecting a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Chadha\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court observed that it \"never has [been] held that the legislature cannot implicitly supersede the common law.\"\n   <em>\n    Chadha\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Charlotte Hungerford Hospital\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3594133\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/272/776/#p787\">\n    272 Conn. at 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=865%20A.2d%201163\">\n    865 A.2d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the statutes at issue in\n   <em>\n    Chadha\n   </em>\n   did not state expressly that the legislature was abrogating absolute immunity. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=865%20A.2d%201163\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17b ; General Statutes \u00a7 19a-20. However, the only \"reasonable interpretation\";\n   <em>\n    Chadha\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Charlotte Hungerford Hospital\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 790,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=865%20A.2d%201163\">\n    865 A.2d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; of \"the plain language of [those statutes compelled] the conclusion that the legislature\n   intended to abrogate the common-law absolute immunity ....\" Id., at 796,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=865%20A.2d%201163\">\n    865 A.2d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the present case, we similarly are compelled to conclude that the only reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 17a-101e is that it expresses a clear legislative intent to abrogate the absolute immunity that the common law may have afforded to individuals who report child abuse to the department. Thus, as the defendant's statements constitute reports of abuse falling within the purview of \u00a7 17a-101e, the trial court properly determined that the defendant was entitled to only the qualified immunity provided by that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although our interpretation of the plain language in \u00a7\u00a7 17a-101e and 17a-103 has led us to conclude that the legislature intended to abrogate the absolute immunity that the common-law immunity may have afforded to individuals reporting abuse to the department, the defendant's public policy arguments are not lost on us. Rather, we ultimately recognize that, by enacting these statutes, the legislature already has performed a careful evaluation and balancing of the important policy considerations surrounding the reporting of suspected child abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Indeed, as the defendant highlights, the legislature has stated expressly: \"The public policy of this state is ... [t]o protect children whose health and welfare may be adversely affected through injury and neglect; to strengthen the family and to make the home safe for children by enhancing the parental capacity for good child care; to provide a temporary or permanent nurturing and safe environment for children when necessary; and for these purposes to require the reporting of suspected child abuse or neglect, investigation of such reports by a social agency, and provision of services, where needed, to\n   such child and family.\" General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101 (a).\n   Affording absolute immunity in this context surely would, as the defendant suggests, encourage individuals to speak freely in reporting suspected child abuse and, therefore, aid in the overarching goal of protecting the welfare of children. The legislature, however, did not afford such immunity when enacting \u00a7 17a-101e. Instead, it determined, as a matter of policy, that there are limits on the methods to be used in pursuing the goal of child protection. Clearly, immunizing individuals who make bad faith reports exceeds the limitations that the legislature has imposed on achieving the goal of child protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   To be sure, \u00a7 17a-101e reflects the determination that, although child protection is an important goal, its achievement does not outweigh the harms resulting from reports of child abuse that are made in bad faith. That is, by excepting reports made in bad faith from its purview, the statute contemplates and accounts for (1) the harm likely inuring to an individual falsely and maliciously accused of child abuse, and (2) the extent to which false reports waste limited department resources and detract from the investigation of real cases of child abuse. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3955758\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/459/#p473\">\n    284 Conn. 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473-76,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=935%20A.2d%20103\">\n    935 A.2d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (\"Although some states have concluded that the statements of complaining witnesses [made to law enforcement] are subject to absolute immunity ... we disagree that an absolute privilege for such statements is warranted....

With this in mind, we conclude that in the limited circumstances of this case, the defendant's statements to Yale Clinic personnel constitute a \"report\" falling within the scope of \u00a7 17a-101e. In other words, because this was a department investigation and Yale Clinic personnel spoke to the defendant only at the behest of the department during its investigation, a report to the Yale Clinic in this very limited context was tantamount to a report to the department. It logically follows, then, that statements made to Yale Clinic personnel under these limited circumstances should be subject to the same strictures that \u00a7 17a-101e imposes on statements made to the department. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the defendant's contention, nothing in this opinion is intended to suggest that Yale Clinic personnel are in fact \"agents\" of the department.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
