On appeal, Boatley argues his sentence violates the Fifth Amendment because it was enhanced beyond the statutory maximum of ten years based upon prior felony convictions not charged in his indictment. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>urges revisiting the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We review constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo. United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008). The prior precedent rule dictates that we must \u201cfollow a prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), it is unlawful for a convicted felon to possess any firearm or ammunition in or affecting commerce. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Those knowingly violating the provision are subject to a maximum ten years imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). However, the minimum sentence becomes 15 years if the felon has three previous convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction that raised the statutory maximum penalty for reentry by a deported alien was a sentence enhancement, and not an element of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 235, 118 S.Ct. at 1226. Because it was not an element, the Supreme Court determined the prior conviction did not have to be mentioned in the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 226-28, 118 S.Ct. at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The Supreme Court then held in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that other than prior convictions, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum is an element of that offense. <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Most recently, in <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court extended Apprendi\u2019s principle to statutory m\u00ednimums, holding that \u201cany fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 133 S.Ct. at 2155. However, the Supreme Court also expressly noted it was not revisiting <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>at that time. <em>Id. </em>at-, 133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">We have previously recognized that we are \u201cbound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2006). We have also refused to \u201cget ahead of the Supreme Court and beat it to the punch by overruling <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>ourselves.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir.2001). Because <em>Alleyne </em>did not explicitly overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but rather explicitly refused to address it, <em>Al-mendarez-Torres </em>is still the governing law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not commit an error by enhancing Boatley\u2019s sentence based on his prior felony convictions. Based upon the foregoing, we affirm the Appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
