Beasley was sentenced to 262 months of imprisonment. We vacated Beasley\u2019s sentence and remanded the case because the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines. On remand, Beasley\u2019s advisory guidelines sentencing range was 168 to 210 months in prison. Within that range, the district court sentenced Beasley to 210 months of imprisonment. Beasley now challenges the reasonableness of his 210-month sentence alleging that the district court failed to consider his post-sentence rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-21\">\u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). Here, the record reflects that the district court considered information regarding Beasley\u2019s post-sentence rehabilitation efforts. Beasley\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b178-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
