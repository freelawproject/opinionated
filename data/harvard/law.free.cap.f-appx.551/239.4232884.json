He argues only that the district court imposed unreasonable sentences by failing to explain adequately its reasons for the sentences imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-22\">A district court commits procedural error by \u201cfailing to adequately explain the chosen sentence[s] \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation[s] from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, because Zuniga did not object to the district court\u2019s alleged failure during the sentencing hearing, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Zuniga does not attempt to show, and therefore cannot succeed in showing, that the district court plainly erred by failing to explain adequately its reasons for imposing the sentences. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
