After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-22\">Sanders was charged with possession of a Winchester 12-gauge shotgun and ammunition. Because Sanders had several prior convictions, he faced a mandatory minimum term of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. At trial, Sanders stipulated that he possessed the firearm and ammunition and that he had prior convictions, but he argued that the government had to prove that his purely intrastate possession of a firearm and ammunition \u201csubstantially\u201d affected interstate commerce rather than merely showing some \u201cminimal nexus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-23\">The government proffered evidence and testimony that the firearm and ammunition had been manufactured outside of Florida and recovered in the state. Sanders moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that this testimony was insufficient to establish a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect on interstate commerce. The court overruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>the motion, noting that the argument was foreclosed by precedent. The jury found Sanders guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">The presentence investigation report identified Sanders as an armed career criminal under \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b), which subjected him to a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence. Without the enhancement, Sanders would have faced a sentencing range of 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment and a statutory maximum of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). Sanders objected, arguing that the court should not enhance his sentence because his prior convictions had not been proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. At an evidentiary hearing, the government proffered evidence and testimony to establish the validity of the prior convictions and Sanders\u2019s identity as the perpetrator of those offenses. The district court overruled Sanders\u2019s objections and, although it agreed that the mandatory minimum \u2022 sentence was arbitrary and unjust, sentenced Sanders to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Sanders now appeals, raising two arguments: First, Sanders contends that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional as applied to him. Second, he argues that his sentence is invalid because the government did not prove his prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">I. Section 922</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Sanders argues that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional because something more than a minimal interstate nexus is required under <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). He notes that his conduct was purely intrastate. We review the constitutionality of a statute <em>de novo. United States v. Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1107 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Sanders\u2019s argument is squarely foreclosed by precedent. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.2011) (holding \u00a7 922(g) constitutional as applied because \u201c[t]he jurisdictional requirement is satisfied when the firearm in question has a \u2018minimal nexus\u2019 to interstate commerce\u201d such as travelling in interstate commerce). \u2018We are bound by prior panel decisions unless or until we overrule them while sitting <em>en banc, </em>or they are overruled by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">II. Prior convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Sanders next argues that, for the court to impose an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence, the government had to prove his prior convictions to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We review constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo. United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">The fact of a prior conviction is not an element of the offense that needs to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-40, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). We have previously noted that, until the Supreme Court specifically overrules itself, we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres. United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">As Sanders concedes, the Supreme Court has not overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. at - n. 1, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2160 n. 1, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (explaining that the Court was not reconsidering its decision in Almendarez-Torres). Thus, it remains binding precedent, and the government was not required to prove Sanders\u2019s prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Sanders\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
