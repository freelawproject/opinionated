In 2009, Sylvester pled guilty to one count of distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). At sentencing, the district court found that Sylvester was a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and that his enhanced advisory guideline range was 151 to 188 months. After the government filed a substantial assistance motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), the court then reduced Sylvester\u2019s guideline range to 120 to 150 months and sentenced Sylvester to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court later denied Sylvester\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion challenging his sentence. On appeal, Sylvester argues that the district court erred in concluding that Amendment 750 did not reduce his guideline calculations because it had sentenced Sylvester under the career offender provisions of \u00a7 4B1.1. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). We are bound by the opinion of a prior panel unless the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc overrules that opinion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission has noted, however, that a defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction where an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)). The Guidelines explain that the amendment relied upon for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief must lower the \u201capplicable guideline range,\u201d which is \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 lBl.l(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Amendment 750 retroactively lowered the sentencing range applicable to crack cocaine offenses by revising the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 750 (2011). Amendment 750 did not make any changes to \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender guideline provision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">When a defendant is sentenced as a career offender, his base offense level is determined under \u00a7 4B1.1, not under \u00a7 2D1.1 based on his attributed drug quantities. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Moore, </em>we held that Amendment 706, which reduced the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses, was inapplicable to the sentences of four defendants who had been sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.1 as career offenders. 541 F.3d at 1327-30. The defendants\u2019 sentences were based on the applicable guideline ranges for career offenders, and the defendants\u2019 otherwise applicable base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of those ranges. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Notably, in that case, defendant Moore had received a sentence below his otherwise applicable career offender guideline range, and the district court had provided that the downward departure was predicated on the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure based on substantial assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 1325, 1330. We noted that the district court did not find that Moore\u2019s criminal history was overrepresented under \u00a7 4B1.1, and there was no indication that the district court had sentenced Moore to a downward departure sentence based on the guideline range that would have applied absent the career offender designation. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. In his appeal, Moore had relied on two district court cases that had permitted \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief for career offender defendants where the original sentencing courts had departed downward pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3 from the career offender guidelines to the original Chapter Two sentencing range. <em>Id. </em>at 1329. We held that those cases were dissimilar from Moore\u2019s case because, for Moore, \u201cthere [was] no basis for concluding that the reduction of Moore\u2019s base offense level lowered the sentencing range relied upon by the district court in determining his sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">In <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>a four justice plurality of the Supreme Court ruled that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is available to a defendant who entered into a Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement that includes an agreed-upon sentence that is expressly based on a guideline range that has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2690, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011). In her concurring opinion, Justice Sotoma-yor said that sentences imposed pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement are \u201cbased on\u201d the plea agreement itself and not the applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 2696 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). Nonetheless, where a plea agreement expressly applied a particular guideline range, Justice Sotomayor agreed that the plea agreement was based on that guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 2697 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). If that guideline range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the defendant would be eligible to seek \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">We\u2019ve since held, after <em>Freeman, </em>that <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent in this Circuit. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. We explained in <em>Lawson </em>that neither the <em>Freeman </em>plurality nor Justice Sotomayor \u201caddressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that <em>Free</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>man </em>was not \u201cclearly on point to the issue that arose in <em>Moore </em>\u201d \u2014 whether career offenders were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief based on the retroactive lowering of crack cocaine base offense levels. <em>Id. </em>We therefore held that a defendant who was convicted of a crack cocaine offense, but sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, was still not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Here, the district court properly denied Sylvester\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because, as a career offender, Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering his guideline range. <em>See id. </em>Contrary to his arguments on appeal, Sylvester\u2019s guideline range was \u201cbased on\u201d the career offender guideline in \u00a7 4B1.1, not the drug quantity guideline in \u00a7 2D1.1 that was affected by Amendment 750. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">As for Sylvester\u2019s argument that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman </em>abrogated this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moore, </em>our decision in <em>Lawson </em>explicitly foreclosed this argument. <em>See id. </em>It is immaterial that, unlike the defendant in <em>Lawson, </em>Sylvester received a substantial assistance downward departure from his career offender guideline range because the advisory guideline range at issue in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is the range determined <em>prior to </em>any departures or variances by the sentencing court. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). In this instance, that range was Sylvester\u2019s range under \u00a7 4B1.1. Moreover, like <em>Moore, </em>Sylvester\u2019s reduction was based on substantial assistance, not on the district court\u2019s desire to depart downward to the \u00a7 2D1.1 guideline range. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
