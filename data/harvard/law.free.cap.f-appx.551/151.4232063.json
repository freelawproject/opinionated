He contends that the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) erred in denying his motion to reopen and that the BIA erred in affirming that denial. He contends that his removal proceedings should have been reopened because he never received notice of his hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-21\">On October 16, 2012, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Haliti\u2019s motion to reopen and dismissed Haliti\u2019s appeal. Haliti did not file with this court a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal but instead filed with the BIA a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal. Because Haliti did not file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order dated October 16, 2012, this court lacks jurisdiction over that order. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006). This court\u2019s jurisdiction therefore extends only to the BIA\u2019s February 27, 2013, order denying Haliti\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-22\">Although Haliti filed a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration, he fails to analyze the BIA\u2019s reasons for denying the motion, which the BIA provided in a clearly worded, succinct opinion. Haliti has therefore abandoned the only issue that is before this court, which is whether the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion for reconsideration. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 447 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-23\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b179-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
