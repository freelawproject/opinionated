After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal, but vacate the district court\u2019s judgment so that the proper basis for the dismissal can be reflected in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A2Q\">A. Complaint Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">According to Blankenship\u2019s <em>pro se </em>amended complaint (\u201cthe complaint\u201d), in December 2011, Blankenship called Gulf Power to disconnect the power to his daughter\u2019s Atilla Avenue residence in Pensacola, Florida because she was moving to New Orleans, Louisiana. On April 11, 2012, Gulf Power sent Blankenship a notice advising him that payment for the electrical service in his name at the Atilla Avenue residence was past due and that the past-due amount of $1,020.51 for the Atilla Avenue residence had been transferred to Blankenship\u2019s account for his primary residence on Mitchell Lane in Pensacola. A May 2012 Gulf Power bill reflected a total charge of $1,075.95, in-eluding $925.51 for five \u201cPrevious Location Balance\u201d charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">On May 26, 2012, Blankenship received notice from Gulf Power that it would disconnect the power at his Mitchell Lane residence on June 1 if he did not pay the outstanding balance of $1,015.95. Blankenship claimed that he did not owe the outstanding balance and that the transfer of the Atilla Avenue residence\u2019s balance to his primary residence account was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">Blankenship\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint alleged numerous claims, including conspiracy, fraud, misrepresentation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, abuse of authority, and racketeering. Additionally, the complaint alleged violations of various Florida and federal statutes, including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, the \u201cResponsible Utility Customer Protection Act,\u201d and the \u201cPublic Utility Holding Company Act.\u201d The complaint also alleged that Gulf Power, \u201cclothed with the authority of the State law,\u201d had violated Blankenship\u2019s substantive and procedural due process rights, his equal protection rights, and \u201cthose rights from the Bill of Rights incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">Blankenship prepared his complaint on a civil rights complaint form for actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The complaint alleged that \u201cCitizenship\u201d was the basis for jurisdiction and that the amount in controversy exceeded $10,000, but also cited 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(a)(3), which gives district courts original jurisdiction over civil rights actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">In the prayer for relief, Blankenship asked for $10,000 in monetary damages, expenses, and court costs, compensation for non-economic damages, and an order directing Gulf Power to restore power service to his primary residence on Mitchell Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>B. District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">A magistrate judge issued a Report (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) recommending that Blankenship\u2019s case be dismissed for lack of federal jurisdiction. Explaining that there is no federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 to entertain wholly insubstantial or obviously frivolous claims, the R &amp; R concluded that all of Blankenship\u2019s alleged federal claims should be dismissed. Specifically, the R <em>&amp; </em>R determined that (1) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a criminal statute that does not provide a private cause of action; (2) the Public Utility Holding Company Act was repealed in 2005 by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which also does not provide a private cause of action; (3) there is no federal law titled the Responsible Utility Customer Protection Act (and the Pennsylvania law of that name was inapplicable to events occurring in Florida); (4) \u00a7 1983 does \u201cnot afford a basis for relief\u2019 because that statute only applies to action taken \u201cunder color of state law,\u201d and Blankenship\u2019s \u201cassertion that Gulf Power was \u2018cloaked with the power of state law\u2019 [did] not make it so\u201d; and (5) there is no other federal law that provides a private right of action for Blankenship\u2019s claims about Gulf Power\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The R &amp; R further concluded that Blankenship\u2019s complaint failed to establish diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a) because, even assuming diverse citizenship, Blankenship had not pled the required $75,000 amount in controversy. The R &amp; R specifically declined to make findings with respect to any state law claims. Because the complaint\u2019s allegations \u201creveal[ed] no discernible basis for federal jurisdiction,\u201d the R &amp; R recommended that the entire action be dismissed for \u201cfailure to raise a substantial non-frivolous federal claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">The district court, over Blankenship\u2019s objections, adopted the R &amp; R \u201cas the Court\u2019s opinion.\u201d The district court\u2019s order, however, directed the clerk to \u201center judgment stating, \u2018This cause is DISMISSED under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) (2)(B) (ii) for Plaintiffs failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d As directed, the clerk\u2019s judgment stated that the case was dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Federal courts have limited jurisdiction and are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, </em>405 F.3d 964, 975 (11th Cir.2005). If at any time the district court determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, \u201cthe court must dismiss the action.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3); <em>see also Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Norton, </em>324 F.3d 1229, 1240 (11th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">\u201cThe district courts have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. However, even a claim that arises under federal law may be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction if (1) the claim \u201c \u2018clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction,\u2019 \u201d or (2) the claim \u201c\u2018is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala. v. Sanders, </em>138 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 682-83, 66 S.Ct. 773, 776, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946)). \u201cUnder the latter <em>Bell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>exception, subject matter jurisdiction is lacking only if the claim has no plausible foundation, or if the court concludes that a prior Supreme Court decision clearly forecloses the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also McGinnis v. Ingram Equip. Co., </em>918 F.2d 1491, 1494 (11th Cir.1990) (en banc) (stating that the test is whether the claim alleged \u201cis so patently without merit as to justify the court\u2019s dismissal for want of jurisdiction\u201d (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Here, the district court properly concluded that Blankenship\u2019s federal claims were so patently frivolous that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 1831. As the district court determined, neither the statutes cited in Blankenship\u2019s complaint, nor any other federal statute, provides a cause of action for Gulf Power\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct. Furthermore, nothing in the complaint indicates that Gulf Power\u2019s alleged actions in attempting to collect the outstanding payment could be \u201cfairly attributable\u201d to the state and thus were taken \u201cunder color of state law,\u201d which is necessary to obtain relief under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 49-51, 119 S.Ct. 977, 985, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999); <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). Given that Blankenship\u2019s complaint failed to allege a substantial, nonfrivolous federal claim, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. <em>See Sanders, </em>138 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The district court also correctly concluded that it lacked diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). \u201c[T]o invoke a federal court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction, a plaintiff must claim ... that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000,\u201d and the plaintiff satisfies this requirement \u201cby claiming a sufficient sum in good faith.\u201d <em>Federated Mut. Ins. Co. v. McKinnon Motors, LLC, </em>329 F.3d 805, 807 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). Blankenship\u2019s complaint alleges only that the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000. Additionally, Blankenship\u2019s complaint disputes that he owes Gulf Power the outstanding $1,020.51 balance and seeks monetary damages of only $10,000. Thus, it is evident from the face of the complaint that the amount in controversy does not exceed $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Further, because the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction in this case, it properly declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Blankenship\u2019s state law claims. <em>See Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, </em>484 U.S. 343, 350, 108 S.Ct. 614, 619, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988) (\u201c[W]hen the federal-law claims have dropped out of the lawsuit in its early stages and only state-law claims remain, the federal court should decline the exercise of jurisdiction by dismissing the case without prejudice.\u201d (footnote omitted)). Thus, as the district court correctly concluded, Blankenship\u2019s entire action was due to be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">We nonetheless vacate the judgment below and remand for two reasons. First, although the district court correctly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Blankenship\u2019s complaint, it did not in fact dismiss the complaint for that reason under Rule 12(h)(3). Instead, the district court, apparently in error, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a merits determination not addressed in the R &amp; R adopted by the district court. Because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, however, it did not have authority to dismiss the complaint on the merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, the district court cited as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the basis for the dismissal 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Yet, Blankenship paid the full filing fee and was not proceeding <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">For these reasons, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for the district court to dismiss this action without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\">. We review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court. <em>Bishop v. Reno, </em>210 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\">. We also note that the district court's dismissal of Blankenship's action for lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction would be an involuntary dismissal and, thus, without prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) (providing that an involuntary dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction does not operate as an adjudication on the merits); <em>Crotwell v. Hockman-Lewis Ltd., </em>734 F.2d 767, 769 (11th Cir.1984) (explaining that a district court's dismissal of a case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be without prejudice).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
