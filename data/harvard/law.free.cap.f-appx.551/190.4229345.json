The District Court dismissed. his claim and granted defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion because the court believed there was no genuine issue of material fact since Hill had failed to provide enough evidence to establish his exposure to radiation. The court found that Hill could not establish for certain that [Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (\u201cNORM\u201d) ] radiation existed at the ... pipe yard during his time of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-24\">The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants with a careful and thorough Order and Reasons. The court\u2019s reasoning can be summarized in the following excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-25\">[I]t is undisputed that new pipe does not have scale, and not all used pipe has scale. Further, not all used pipe with scale contains NORM. In order to prove his exposure, then, Hill must show that he handled a specific category of defendants\u2019 pipes, namely, used pipes with scale containing NORM. Hill offers no direct evidence that he was exposed to defendants\u2019 pipes with scale containing NORM. Hill\u2019s [circumstantial] evidence requires an impermissible chain of speculation to find that he was exposed to radiation in defendants\u2019 pipes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-26\">(Footnote and paragraph breaks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-27\">We have examined the briefs and applicable law and pertinent parts of the record. There is no error, and the summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
