Reverio challenges his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>viction and sentence on the grounds that section 922(g)(1) and the Armed Career Criminal Act are unconstitutional. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the constitutionality of a statute. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1185 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Reverio challenges the constitutionality of section 922(g)(1) on four grounds, all of which fail. Reverio argues that section 922(g)(1) interferes with his fundamental right to bear arms under the Second Amendment, but his argument is foreclosed by our holding in <em>United States v. Rozier, </em>598 F.3d 768 (11th Cir.2010), \u201cthat statutes disqualifying felons from possessing a firearm under any and all circumstances do not offend the Second Amendment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 771 (discussing the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008)). Reverio also makes the conclusory argument, for the first time, that section 922(g)(1) \u201cviolate[s] the Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process clauses of the Fifth Amendment unless the government can establish that the restrictions are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest,\u201d but Reverio fails to establish any plain error with respect to his conviction because he cites no precedent in support of his argument. <em>See United States v. Lejarde</em>-Rada, 319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003). Reverio \u201cmaintains that.... section 922(g)(1) ... violates the Tenth Amendment\u201d by infringing on a police power reserved for the States and that Congress exceeded its power under the Commerce Clause by enacting section 922(g)(1), but Reverio concedes that his arguments are foreclosed by our precedents. <em>See Jordan, </em>635 F.3d at 1189; <em>United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1273 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Hiley v. Barrett, </em>155 F.3d 1276, 1277 (11th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 389-90 (11th Cir.1996). Section 922(g)(1) is also constitutional as applied to Reverio, who admitted in his factual stipulation that the firearm he possessed was \u201cmanufactured outside the State of Florida and therefore traveled in interstate and/or foreign commerce.\u201d <em>See Jordan, </em>635 F.3d at 1189; <em>Scott, </em>263 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Reverio\u2019s arguments about the Armed Career Criminal Act also fail. Reverio argues that the Act violates the Second Amendment, but convicted felons do not possess the same right to gun ownership as do law-abiding citizens. <em>See Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 626, 128 S.Ct. at 2816-17 (\u201cthe right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited\u201d and \u201cnothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons\u201d). Reverio argues that the Act is contrary to the \u201cprinciple[ ] codified\u201d in the Sentencing Guidelines that offenders can rehabilitate and should not have counted against them any prior sentence that is more than 10 years old, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2), but Congress decided to treat armed career offenders differently. Reverio also argues that his 15-year sentence is overly harsh because he refrained from criminal activity for about a decade before possessing a firearm, but the Act is intended to punish Reverio for his recidivism, not \u201cthe motive or purpose of [his] current possession of firearms,\u201d <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">We AFFIRM Reverio\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
