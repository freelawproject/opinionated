The district court sentenced Byrd to 21 months in prison to be followed by five years of supervised release. In addition to the standard conditions of supervision, the district court imposed special conditions of supervision, and Byrd now appeals the imposition of those special conditions applicable to sex offenders. Specifically, Byrd challenges the conditions requiring that he (1) participate in a specially designed sex offender treatment program, which may include the administration of polygraph examinations; (2) consent to the administration of yearly polygraph examinations; (3) have no unauthorized or unsupervised direct or indirect contact with any children under the age of 18; (4) have no affiliation or employment with any organization involved in an activity that would place him in direct contact with minors; (5) not engage in a relationship with an individual who has children under the age of 18, unless he receives approval from his probation officer; and (6) not go to places known to be frequented by minors, including but not limited to any recreational, leisure, sporting or other activity where children are present and/or supervision is deemed inadequate without prior approval of the probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-21\">Byrd argues that the district court committed procedural error in imposing these special conditions of supervised release because under the plain language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(d)(7), which lists the recommended special conditions of supervised release applicable to sex offenders, his failure to register as a sex offender did not meet the definition of a \u201csex offense\u201d as defined in \u00a7 5D1.2, comment, (n.l). He further contends (1) that the special conditions are not expressly listed in \u00a7 5D1.3(d)(7) and are, thus, outside the scope of the Guidelines, and (2) that the district court did not articulate reasons for imposing the special conditions of supervision. In addition, Byrd challenges the substantive reasonableness of the special conditions, asserting that the conditions were not reasonably related to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors; that the imposition of the conditions imposed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>greater deprivation of liberty than justified; and that the special conditions are not consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Because Byrd did not object to the procedural reasonableness of the special conditions of supervision in the district court, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Juarez, </em>626 F.3d 246, 253-54 (5th Cir.2010). Contrary to Byrd\u2019s assertion, the record reflects that the district court noted that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as the advisory guidelines range, and had expressed concerns over Byrd\u2019s criminal history, including his failure to register as a sex offender. Therefore, the district court provided adequate reasons for the imposition of the sentence and did not plainly err in this regard. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Even if we assume that the district court believed that failure to register as a sex offender qualified as a sex offense under the Guidelines, we conclude that the district court\u2019s decision is not plain error. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5D1.2, comment. (n.l). Byrd\u2019s argument that the district court was prohibited from imposing certain special conditions of supervised release because they are not specifically set forth in the Guidelines fails. <em>See United States v. Weatherton, </em>567 F.3d 149, 153 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">In the district court, Byrd specifically challenged the special condition prohibiting him from all direct or indirect contact with children. Accordingly, we review his challenge to the substantive reasonableness of that condition for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>558 F.3d 408, 412 (5th Cir.2009). We review his challenge to the substantive reasonableness of the remaining special conditions for plain error only. <em>See Juarez, </em>626 F.3d at 253-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">The condition, as currently phrased, prohibiting all direct or indirect contact with children is substantively unreasonable and is therefore vacated. <em>See United States v. Windless, </em>719 F.3d 415, 421-22 (5th Cir.2013). The case is therefore remanded for the district court to consider whether to impose a condition that would satisfy <em>Windless. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">The special conditions requiring sex offender treatment, requiring consent to the administration of polygraph examinations, restricting employment around children, restricting travel to places frequented by children, and prohibiting Byrd from entering into a relationship with anyone with minor children without approval from the probation officer are reasonably related to relevant factors, involve no greater deprivation of liberty than necessary, and are consistent with the policy statements of the Guidelines. <em>See Weatherton, </em>567 F.3d at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
