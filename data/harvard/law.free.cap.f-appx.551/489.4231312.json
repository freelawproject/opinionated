In the underlying criminal case in the Western District of New York, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Johnson entered into a plea agreement in which he waived his right to pursue relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He pled guilty to one count of a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), one count of conspiracy to commit a RICO violation, one count of a continuing criminal enterprise involving narcotics, three counts of a continuing criminal enterprise involving murder, one count of conspiracy to distribute narcotics, one count of murder for hire, and one count of possession with intent to distribute narcotics. In 1995, he was sentenced to multiple terms of life imprisonment. He subsequently challenged his conviction in a \u00a7 2255 motion, which was dismissed in 2001 based on a finding that his plea-agreement waiver was enforceable, and that, in any event, his substantive arguments failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">On appeal, Johnson argues that the district court erred in three ways in dismissing the instant \u00a7 2241 petition: (1) he had no genuine opportunity to challenge his convictions or sentences under \u00a7 2255 because of his plea agreement waiver; (2) the court in which he was convicted erred under <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), a retroactively applicable Supreme Court case, because it did not find that he committed each of the individual violations necessary to make up his continuing criminal enterprise offenses; and (3) his conviction for attempt to commit a racketeering conspiracy was invalid because \u201cattempt to conspire\u201d is a non-existent offense. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005). A prisoner typically collaterally attacks the validity of his federal sentence by filing a \u00a7 2255 motion in the district of conviction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003)-. If a prisoner has failed to seek or already has been denied relief on a \u00a7 2255 motion, the \u201csavings clause\u201d in \u00a7 2255(e) bars him from filing a \u00a7 2241 petition unless he shows that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1351 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that \u201ca \u00a7 2255 motion is the exclusive remedy for a federal prisoner to collaterally attack his conviction and sentence, except in the rare cases where it is inadequate to do so\u201d). The restrictions in the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) are jurisdictional. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1340 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The petitioner bears the burden of presenting evidence that affirmatively shows the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy. <em>Turner v. Warden Coleman FCI, </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2873, 186 L.Ed.2d 923 (2013). The unavailability of relief due to the restriction on second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions does not establish that \u00a7 2255 relief is inadequate. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). In <em>Wofford, </em>we determined that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d under the savings clause when (1) a claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of the Supreme Court establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a non-existent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1244. We later clarified that <em>Wofford\u2019s </em>three-step test was <em>dicta. Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1319 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc). However, we have since interpreted <em>Wofford\u2019s </em>holding to impose two necessary, but not sufficient, steps to qualify under the savings clause: (1) the prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>must present a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; and (2) that decision must have overturned circuit precedent that resolved his claim in a way that prevented him from bringing it at trial, on appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1341-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">First, we are unconvinced by Johnson\u2019s claim that he had no genuine opportunity to challenge his convictions or sentences under \u00a7 2255 because of his plea agreement waiver. As the record shows, Johnson did not raise this argument in the district court, so we do not consider it now. <em>See Hurley v. Moore, </em>233 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that \u201c[arguments raised for the first time on appeal are not properly before this Court\u201d). Regardless, we have held that the bar on second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions in \u00a7 2255(h) is not sufficient to demonstrate inadequacy or ineffectiveness for the purposes of \u00a7 2255(e); thus, a voluntary waiv\u00e9r of the right to bring a \u00a7 2255 motion similarly would not render that remedy inadequate. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">We also conclude that the district court properly determined that Johnson failed to establish that a motion under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to address the legality of his detention. Indeed, Johnson has failed to meet the <em>Wofford </em>test (as articulated recently in Williams) with regard to his <em>Richardson </em>arguments \u2014 specifically, he has failed to satisfy <em>Wofford\u2019s </em>second requirement that the Second Circuit\u2019s case law precluded his argument before the Supreme Court decided <em>Richardson. Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1343. While <em>Richardson </em>did resolve a circuit split, that split did not involve a decision by the Second Circuit. <em>See Richardson, </em>526 U.S. at 816, 119 S.Ct. 1707. In fact, after Johnson\u2019s guilty plea and sentencing, the Second Circuit noted that it had not yet addressed the issue. <em>See United States v. Alli-Balogun, </em>72 F.3d 9, 12-13 (2d Cir.1995) (determining that the failure to give a unanimity instruction as to a continuing criminal enterprise charge was not plain error, as neither the Second Circuit nor the Supreme Court had addressed the issue, and declining to decide whether such an instruction was required). In short, Johnson has failed to demonstrate that any of his claims qualified under the savings clause to allow him to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition to collaterally challenge his convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\">. Finally, as for Johnson\u2019s argument that \"attempt to conspire\u201d is a non-existent offense, it has no merit since, among other things, Johnson was not convicted of \"attempt to conspire.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
