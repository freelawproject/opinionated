Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. Gomez appealed earlier his convictions for importing controlled substances, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 960, 952, 851, possessing controlled substances with intent to distribute, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 851, 841(a)(1), and smuggling goods into the United States, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545, and we affirmed. <em>United States v. Garcia-Duran, </em>No. 11-12320 (11th Cir. Jan. 31, 2012). Gomez now argues that he is entitled to a new trial based on newly-discovered evidence that his codefendant, Rodrigo Wood, testified falsely at trial that he had been unsuccessful in his earlier attempts to enter the United States. Gomez also argues, for the first time, that the district court should have ordered discovery and conducted an evidentiary hearing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Gomez\u2019s motion for a new trial. Gomez based on his motion on newly-discovered evidence that Wood had \u201crecanted\u201d his earlier testimony and admitted to entering the United States on three occasions before making the trip with Gomez. Gomez argues that Wood\u2019s statements prove he is a \u201cperjurer and disreputable person\u201d and \u201ca liar as claimed by the ... defense ... [at] trial,\u201d but those arguments reveal that the evidence was merely impeaching and cumulative to other evidence introduced at trial that Wood had testified falsely about his role in the conspiracy to import controlled substances. <em>See United States v. Champion, </em>813 F.2d 1154, 1170-71 (11th Cir.1987). The newly-discovered evidence also would not probably have changed the outcome of Gomez\u2019s trial. <em>See id. </em>at 1171. Testimony from federal agents, a longshoreman, and a taxi driver proved that Gomez and his cohorts transported heroin and cocaine into the United States illegally; Gomez confessed to a federal agent that he had been involved the conspiracy to import; and Gomez admitted at trial to strapping cocaine to his body and then attempting to import the illegal substance to earn $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-18\">The district court also was not required to, and did not plainly err by failing to, <em>sua sponte </em>order discovery or conduct an evi-dentiary hearing. The parties and the district court assumed the truth of the newly-discovered evidence, and \u201cthe record contained all the evidence needed to dispose of ... [Gomez\u2019s motion] for a new trial.\u201d <em>See United States v. Scrushy, </em>721 F.3d 1288, 1305 n. 30 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>We AFFIRM the denial of Gomez\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
