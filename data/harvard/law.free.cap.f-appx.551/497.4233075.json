INS, </em>911 F.2d 539, 541 (11th Cir.1990) (dismissing Section 2241 petition filed by state prisoner against whom only an immigration detainer was lodged). The filing of an immigration detainer, alone, does not render a federal prisoner in custody of ICE under Section 2241 for purposes of challenging that detainer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Having reviewed the record and considered the arguments of the parties contained in their briefs, we affirm the district court in all respects to this appeal for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
