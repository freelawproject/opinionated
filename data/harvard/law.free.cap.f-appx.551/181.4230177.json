Pursuant to the terms of Appellant\u2019s voluntary motion, the district court\u2019s order explicitly \u201creserv[ed] [Appellant\u2019s right to reopen the case against [Appellee] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>in the event it is discovered that the sworn financial statement dated December 6, 2007, and offered by [Appellee] is found to be inaccurate or there has been an unlawful transfer of assets during the course of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">More than five years later, Appellant asked the district court to re-open his case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In its order of June 12, 2013, the district court concluded that Appellant\u2019s motion was, <em>inter alia, </em>untimely. As the district court explained, an order granting a voluntary motion to dismiss may be vacated under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe decision to grant or deny 60(b) relief lies in the sound discretion of the district court and will be reversed only for an abuse of that discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Where a motion under Rule 60(b) is based on \u201cmistake,\u201d \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201cmisrepresentation,\u201d or \u201cmisconduct,\u201d then Rule 60(c) requires that the motion be made \u201cno more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the district court reasoned, however, Appellant\u2019s motion was made five years after the voluntary dismissal of all his claims against Appellee and was therefore untimely under Rule 60(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We agree. Accordingly, without addressing any of the other grounds for the district court\u2019s decision, this court now finds that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Appellant\u2019s motion on the basis of untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b209-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-6\">. Originally, this case also involved two other defendants in addition to Appellee, Mr. Jay T. Lanners and Profitable Dining, LLC, who had a separate settlement agreement with Appellant. As to those defendants, the district court denied Appellant\u2019s motion on a separate basis upon finding under Rule 60(d)(3) that no \"fraud on the court\u201d had been committed by Lanners. However, we granted Appellant\u2019s voluntary motion to dismiss his appeal as to Lanners and Profitable Dining on July 8, 2013. We therefore need not address the district court\u2019s conclusions under Rule 60(d)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-21\">. <em>See In re Pettle, </em>410 F.3d 189, 192 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-22\">. <em>Provident Life &amp; Acc.
