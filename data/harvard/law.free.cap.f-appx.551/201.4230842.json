Cervantes asserts that he is entitled to withholding of removal because he suffered persecution in Mexico when individuals who had taken a vehicle from Cervantes without paying for it kidnapped and beat Cervantes\u2019s brother and threatened to kill Cervantes after he reported the theft to the police. The BIA determined that Cervantes had failed to establish past persecution based on his membership in a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Cervantes has failed to brief sufficiently that he was persecuted on the basis of his membership in a particular social group. Pursuant to Rule 28(a)(8)(A) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, an appellant\u2019s argument must contain the reasons for the requested relief with citation to the authorities, statutes, and parts of the record on which he relies. Cervantes\u2019s brief fails to meet this standard, as it contains only speculative and conclusional assertions relating to past persecution; he makes no argument relating to his membership in a particular social group. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003) (holding that arguments not briefed are abandoned). Furthermore, Cervantes\u2019s conclusional assertions are insufficient to establish that he is entitled to withholding of removal. <em>See Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2012); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004). Consequently, Cervantes\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
