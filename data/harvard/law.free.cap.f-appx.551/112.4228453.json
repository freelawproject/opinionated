Dalby Correctional Facility (the Dalby Facility) in Post, Texas. Acosta-Solano filed a complaint, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming his constitutional rights had been violated at the Dalby Facility. The district court characterized his claim as a Bivens<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claim, and dismissed the complaint as frivolous, finding that a <em>Bivens </em>actions could not be brought against a private entity. On appeal, Acosta-Solano contends that the district court should have given him an opportunity to amend his complaint prior to dismissing it as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-20\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 767 (5th Cir.2009). The magistrate judge conducted a Spears<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> hearing, thereby giving Acosta-Solano an opportunity to amend his complaint. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9 (5th Cir.1994). Further, at the <em>Spears </em>hearing, Acosta-Solano declined to name any other individual as a defendant in his complaint. Thus, Acosta-Solano\u2019s argument that the district court failed to give him an opportunity to amend his complaint is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Moreover, Aeosta-Solano fails to explain in his brief how the Dalby Facility or any other individual for that matter, violated his constitutional rights. Although pro so briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, whether construed as a \u00a7 1983 action or a <em>Bivens </em>action, Aeosta-Solano has abandoned his claims before this court by failing to raise them on appeal. Therefore, his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Aeosta-Solano is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b140-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-21\">. <em>Bivens v.
