He also appeals the revocation of a prior term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-20\">Cabana contends that the district court erred when it enhanced his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 because he did not willfully obstruct justice and his statement to the magistrate judge was not materially false. The district court\u2019s determination that a defendant obstructed justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 208 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-21\">At Cabana\u2019s initial appearance, the magistrate judge explained that he wanted to ensure that Cabana\u2019s name was correct and that it was spelled correctly on the complaint. The magistrate judge then asked Cabana whether he was Jose Diaz-Hernandez, the name Cabana had given Border Patrol agents upon his arrest. Cabana unequivocally answered yes and continued to respond to that false name throughout the proceeding. Cabana\u2019s use of a false name when under oath before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the magistrate judge was sufficient to support the obstruction of justice enhancement, even without a showing of significant hindrance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 SC1.1, comment. (n.4(F)); <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>964 F.2d 390, 392-93 (5th Cir.1992). Therefore, the district court did not clearly err when it enhanced Cabana\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Cabana also contends that the district court erred when it denied him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 because the denial was based on the district court\u2019s erroneous determination that he obstructed justice. In the alternative, he argues that his was one of the extraordinary cases in which the reduction was warranted despite an obstruction of justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1 under a standard that is even more deferential than the purely clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cThe ruling should not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">As previously discussed, the district court did not clearly err when it enhanced Cabana\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1. Further, Cabana has failed to demonstrate that this is indeed one of those extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 apply. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>120 F.3d 564, 574-75 (5th Cir.1997). Although his alias may have been well known to immigration officials, his use of a false name when under oath before the magistrate judge suggests that he had not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct. Therefore, the district court\u2019s determination that Cabana was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1 is not without foundation. <em>See Washington, </em>340 F.3d at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Finally, Cabana raises no claims of error with respect to the revocation proceeding or sentence. Thus, he has abandoned any issues on appeal regarding the revocation judgment. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgments are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b172-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
