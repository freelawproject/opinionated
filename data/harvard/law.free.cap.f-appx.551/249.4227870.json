We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-21\">Reedom\u2019s pro se complaint alleges that Louis M. Ackal, the sheriff of Iberia Parish, the Iberia Sherriff s Department, and Farrell Bonin, an employee of the department, violated state, federal, and constitutional provisions by improperly investigating an accident involving his brother. For these violations, Reedom claims damages of $20 million. The district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, which dismissed Reedom\u2019s complaint on the ground that he \u201chas not established that he has personally sustained an injury caused by the defendants, since his claims relate solely to alleged injuries to his brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-22\">We review questions of standing de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under that standard, \u201cthe party bringing the suit must establish standing to prosecute the action.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cConstitutional standing requires that the plaintiff personally suffered some actual or threatened injury that can be fairly traced to the challenged action and is redressable by the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition to these minimum requirements, \u201ccertain court-created requirements for standing exist, ones arising from judicial prudence and not from the constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> One such requirement is that plaintiffs \u201cassert their own legal rights and not those of others.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-23\">On appeal Reedom discusses neither why he has standing nor the reasons the district court erred in concluding that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>lacked standing. He instead provides a discussion of the Due Process Clause and the text of a Supreme Court case that addressed the pleading requirements under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">We agree with the district court that Reedom has failed to establish that he suffered some personal injury as a result of the defendants\u2019 actions. Reedom\u2019s complaint alleges only that the actions of the defendants caused his brother harm. He does not allege that he personally suffered any injury. Read liberally,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Reedom\u2019s complaint may also be understood to allege that all African-Americans in Iberia Parish have been injured by the defendants\u2019 conduct. This does not establish standing, however, since Reedom does not claim that he is a resident of Iberia, or even Louisiana.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The record indicates rather that Reedom resides in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Because Reedom has thus failed to establish that he has suffered any personal injury, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
