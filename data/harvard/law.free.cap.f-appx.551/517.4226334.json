Etienne challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support her conviction; the denial of her motion for a mistrial; the denial of her request for a jury instruction on good faith; and the validity of an order appointing appellate counsel. Etienne also argues, for the first time, that the district court should have declared a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments about a coconspir-ator\u2019s guilty plea and Etienne\u2019s theory of defense. We dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction Etienne\u2019s appeal of the order appointing appellate counsel because she failed to mention that order in her notice of appeal, and we affirm Etienne\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence supported the finding of the jury that Etienne conspired to submit false claims to Medicare using treatment notes signed by her or on her behalf that falsely reported she had provided physical therapy to patients at two clinics owned by Rosina Cheverez. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1349, 1347; <em>United States v. McNair, </em>605 F.3d 1152, 1195 (11th Cir.2010). Etienne knew she was signing false treatment notes. Three of Etienne\u2019s co-conspirators, Yaquelin Usan, Barbara Mendez, and Christopher Smith, testified that Etienne had complained to them about signing treatment notes stating that she provided therapy she had not given and that she saw more patients than she could possibly treat. Smith, another therapist, testified that he was told when hired that he would sign treatment notes for patients whom he would not treat; 'he used false notes prepared by a secretary or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>office manager from a template; and he signed 14 to 16 false notes daily and received a bonus if he signed more than 20 notes. Etienne\u2019s treatment notes overstated her working hours and patient load. Usan testified that Etienne worked two to three hours about three days a week on which she would provide therapy for 6 to 10 patients and sign between 9 and 12 false notes, and Mendez admitted that she signed false notes on Etienne\u2019s behalf. Agent Joshua Hawkins of the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified that Eti-enne\u2019s signature appeared on most of the more than 3,000 treatment notes used by the clinics; he compared Etienne\u2019s signature with certified copies of her driver\u2019s license and passport, which he identified at trial; he noticed that many of Etienne\u2019s notes contained identical progress reports and patient statements; and Etienne misrepresented having worked 22, 40, and 60 hours on three particular days. Etienne also profited from her fraud. Agents Hawkins and Mary Franklin testified that Etienne had formed a business, KC Staffing, that she used to open bank accounts into which she deposited more than $270,000 in checks from the clinics, and Franklin identified those checks at trial. Etienne argues that the government should have used a handwriting expert to verify her signature, but the jury could have inferred that Etienne\u2019s signatures on the checks and treatment notes were genuine by comparing them with the signatures on her identity documents. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 901(b)(3). The jury reasonably found Etienne guilty based on her knowing participation in the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Mateos, </em>623 F.3d 1350, 1362 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Etienne\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Etienne argued that the prosecutor vouched for Usan, Mendez, and Smith when, in rebuttal to Etienne\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor responded that the district court would \u201cdecide ... if they\u2019re telling the truth\u201d at sentencing, but the argument neither \u201cplaced the prestige of the government behind the witnesses] by making explicit personal assurances of [their credibility] or ... implied that evidence not formally presented to the jury supported] the witnesses\u2019] testimony.\u201d <em>See United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1177-78 (11th Cir.2006). And the district court eradicated any possible prejudice by instructing the jury that they \u201cshould decide whether\u201d to \u201cbelieve or disbelieve any witness\u201d and that the parties\u2019 arguments were \u201cnot evidence and [were] not binding.\u201d <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1256 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The district court also did not plainly err by failing <em>sua sponte </em>to declare a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments about a coconspirator\u2019s guilty plea and Etienne\u2019s theory of defense. Eti-enne argues that the prosecutor imputed Smith\u2019s guilt to Etienne by stating that she had \u201ccomplained about signing too many notes\u201d with Smith, who \u201cgot caught\u201d and \u201cpled guilty,\u201d but the prosecutor was entitled to mention Smith\u2019s guilty plea as supporting his credibility and to rebut an insinuation by Etienne that she and Smith had discussed having to treat too many patients instead of signing too many notes. <em>See United States v. DeLoach, </em>34 F.3d 1001, 1004 (11th Cir.1994). Etienne also argues that the prosecutor impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to her by appealing to the jury to use its \u201ccommon sense\u201d when determining whether Etienne provided \u201chonest treatment\u201d and whether \u201cshe [knew] other people were giving fake treatment, and she gave honest treatment, but she didn\u2019t get any of the money.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s argument highlighted that the evidence was inconsistent with Etienne\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>arguments that she overlooked her coworkers fraud and her signature had been forged on the false treatment forms and on checks deposited in her bank account. <em>See United States v. Bernal-Benitez, </em>594 F.3d 1303, 1315 (11th Cir.2010). The district court eliminated any possible prejudice caused by the prosecutor\u2019s argument by instructing the jury that \u201cthe fact that a witness has pleaded guilty to an offense is not evidence of the guilt of any other person\u201d and that \u201c[t]he defendant does not have to prove her innocence or produce any evidence at all\u201d because \u201c[t]he government must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Etienne\u2019s request for a jury instruction on good faith. There was no foundation in the evidence to support that instruction. <em>See United States v. Martinelli, </em>454 F.3d 1300, 1315 (11th Cir.2006). Etienne did not concede that she had signed false treatment reports; instead, she argued that she had been an honest employee whose signature had been forged on checks and false treatment reports. In any event, \u201cthe subject matter of the requested instruction was substantially covered by\u201d the instruction that the jury had to find that Etienne acted knowingly, willfully, and with the intent to defraud. <em>See id. </em>at 1315-16. That instruction necessarily required the jury to \u201crule out the possibility\u201d that Eti-enne acted in good faith. <em>See id. </em>at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Etienne challenges the order conditioning the appointment of appellate counsel on the sale of certain property, but we lack jurisdiction to review that order. On May 5, 2013, Etienne filed a written notice stating that she was appealing her conviction and sentence imposed on April 24, 2013. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B). Although the district court filed its order appointing appellate counsel on May 8, 2013, Etienne did not move to amend her notice of appeal to add the order appointing appellate counsel. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1), (b)(4). Because \u201cthis court has no jurisdiction to review ... judgments or issues which are not expressly referred to and which are not impliedly intended for appeal,\u201d <em>Whetstone Candy Co., Inc. v. Kraft Foods, Inc., </em>351 F.3d 1067, 1080 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), we dismiss Eti-enne\u2019s appeal of the order appointing appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">We AFFIRM Etienne\u2019s conviction and DISMISS the appeal of the order appointing appellate counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
