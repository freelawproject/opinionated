On appeal, Sotoma-yor argues: (1) that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(3)(C) for acting as a pilot, copilot, captain, navigator, or any other operation officer for a vessel carrying a controlled substance (\u201ccaptain enhancement\u201d); and (2) that his 84-month sentence was substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">I. CAPTAIN ENHANCEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b543-16\">The district court did not clearly err in applying the two-level enhancement in \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l)(C). At sentencing, Soto-mayor admitted he had operated the boat and used a GPS device on the return trip from the Bahamas to the United States with the marijuana. These facts are materially indistinguishable from those in <em>United States v. Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2005), in which the defendant admitted he drove the boat and navigated using instructions and a compass.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-17\">Further, in <em>Cartwright, </em>we rejected the very argument that Sotomayor makes here, that the captain enhancement does not apply to someone who merely drives a boat, but only to someone who has formal training and special skill. <em>See id. </em>at 1297-98; <em>see also United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1329 (11th Cir.2003) (citing with approval opinions from two other circuits concluding that no particular training, li-censure, or special skills are required to justify the captain enhancement).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>concluded in <em>Cartwright </em>that the captain enhancement \u201ccreates a test about the facts of the offense, not a term of art\u201d and that the defendant \u201ceasily qualified for the enhancement\u201d because he drove the boat and used a compass to navigate. <em>Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d at 1299. Moreover, the fact that the defendant \u201cwas not officially named the captain or pilot\u201d and that others also steered the boat did not change the result. <em>Id. </em>Under our precedent, the district court properly applied the two-level captain enhancement based on Soto-mayor\u2019s admitted conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">II. REASONABLENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Sotomayor contends that his 84-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. We review the reasonableness of a sentence under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We will reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191 (quotation marks omitted). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1189.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Sotomayor\u2019s 84-month sentence is at the low end of the advisory guidelines range of 84 to 105 months\u2019 imprisonment and well below the applicable 40-year statutory maximum, both indications of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that although we do not presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect it to be so); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that a sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty is an indication of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">The sentence, moreover, met the goals encompassed within \u00a7 3553(a). Sotomayor was caught bringing 667 pounds of marijuana into the United States by boat. As the government pointed out at sentencing, this was Sotomayor\u2019s fourth controlled substance conviction in six years, and the relatively short sentences he had received for his prior convictions had not deterred him from participating in the marijuana importation scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">Sotomayor\u2019s arguments about his early admission of guilt, his cooperation with authorities, and his financial reasons for participating in the importation scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>were all considered by the district court, which concluded that these factors were not sufficient to warrant a downward variance. Although Sotomayor argues that the district court did not adequately consider his mitigating factors, it was within the district court\u2019s discretion to give them less weight. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (stating that the weight accorded any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court). Under the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion when it refused to vary downward. Sotomayor has not shown that his 84-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-13\">. When <em>Cartwright </em>and <em>Rendon </em>were decided, the captain enhancement was found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 (b)(2)(B), and it was moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>to \u00a7 2D 1.1 (b)(3)(C) in 2010. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 728, 748.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b544-7\">.
