Schweitzer, Michael Kalogridis, Thomas Pizzi Jr., and Serge Vidal (collectively \u201cthe Association\u201d). Greiser filed an amended complaint for damages and to enjoin the Association from violating his right of free speech under the First Amendment by censoring his newsletters to homeowners; his right to be free from an \u201cunlawful seizure\u201d of his apartment under the Fourth Amendment; his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment in an action to evict; and state laws that prohibited \u201cfil[ing] false charges and spreading] false information.\u201d The Association moved to dismiss Greiser\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The district court granted the motion and dismissed with prejudice Greiser\u2019s federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his claims under Florida law, which the district court dismissed without prejudice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The district court correctly dismissed Greiser\u2019s second amended complaint. Greiser failed to allege that the Association acted under color of state law. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Even if accepted as true, Greiser\u2019s allegations failed to establish that the State of Florida or any state entity \u201ccoerced or ... significantly encouraged\u201d the Association to censor Greiser\u2019s newsletter or to evict Greiser, <em>see Rayburn ex rel. Rayburn v. Hogue, </em>241 F.3d 1341, 1347 (11th Cir.2001); the Association performed a function \u201cexclusively reserved to the state\u201d when it screened potential tenants, serviced its apartment building, or censored Greiser\u2019s newsletter, <em>see Carlin Commc\u2019n, Inc. v. S. Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>802 F.2d 1352, 1361 (11th Cir.1986); or the Association acted as a \u201csurrogate for the state\u201d by virtue of being incorporated under state law or using its laws to evict Greiser, <em>see Focus on the Family v. Pinellas Suncoast Transit Auth., </em>344 F.3d 1263, 1279 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also Beker Phosphate Corp. v. Muirhead, </em>581 F.2d 1187, 1189-90 (5th Cir.1978). Greiser argues, for the first time on appeal, that the \u201ccontinuing prosecution of the state eviction action [constitutes cruel and unusual punishment that] is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment,\u201d but we will not consider a claim not presented to the district court. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Greiser\u2019s remaining claims under state law. A district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim after dismissing all claims over which it has original jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). In fact, we \u201cencourage[ ] district courts to dismiss any remaining state claims when, as here, the federal claims have been dismissed prior to trial.\u201d <em>Raney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>370 F.3d 1086, 1089 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it denied Greiser\u2019s request for injunctive relief. To obtain a preliminary injunction, a party must establish that there is a substantial likelihood that he will prevail on the merits. <em>See Sofarelli v. Pinellas Cnty., </em>931 F.2d 718, 723-24 (11th Cir.1991). Because Greier\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim, he was not entitled to a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Greiser\u2019s second amended complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
