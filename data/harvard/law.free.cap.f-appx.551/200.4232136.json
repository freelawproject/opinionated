Hernandez sought withholding of removal based on threatening phone calls she and her family received from individuals in Mexico demanding money.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">We review the order of the BIA and will consider the underlying decision of the immigration judge only if it had some impact upon the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 517 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cTo be eligible for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1138 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Hernandez contends that the BIA erred in determining that she failed to demonstrate past persecution and a clear probability of future persecution. She also challenges the BIA\u2019s alternative determination that she failed to demonstrate membership in a particular social group for purposes of withholding of removal. The BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal is reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134. Under that standard, we will not reverse the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion but compels it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">Members of Hernandez\u2019s family continue to live in Mexico, and she and her family have not been harmed beyond receiving threatening phone calls demanding money. Economic extortion does not constitute a form of persecution under immigration law. <em>Castillo-Enriquez v. Holder, </em>690 F.3d 667, 668 (5th Cir.2012). The BIA\u2019s determination that Hernandez failed to make the requisite showing regarding persecution is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b229-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
