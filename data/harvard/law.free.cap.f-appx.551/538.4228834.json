The district court ruled that Holyfield-Vega lacked standing to sue the officials. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-25\">The district court correctly concluded that Holyfield-Vega failed to allege that she had suffered an injury in fact. To have standing, a plaintiff must establish that she has incurred an injury to a protected interest that is \u201cconcrete and particularized.\u201d <em>Fla. Wildlife Fed\u2019n, Inc. v. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., </em>647 F.3d 1296, 1302 (11th Cir.2011). Holyfield-Vega alleged that \u201c[tjhe removal of pray[er]\u201d from \u201cschool and other areas\u201d by federal and state officials violated her right to the free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>exercise of religion under the First Amendment, but Holyfield-Vega failed to describe how she had been injured by the officials\u2019 conduct. Holyfield-Vega argued that she was entitled to proceed \u201c[a]s a concern[ed] United States Citizen,\u201d but a plaintiff \u201cdoes not state an Article III case or controversy\u201d by \u201cclaiming only harm to [her] and every citizen\u2019s interest in proper application of the Constitution ... and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits [her] than it does the public at large,\u201d <em>Lance v. Coffman, </em>549 U.S. 437, 439, 127 S.Ct. 1194, 1196, 167 L.Ed.2d 29 (2007) (quoting <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 573-74, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2143, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)); <em>Fairchild v. Hughes, </em>258 U.S. 126, 42 S.Ct. 274, 66 L.Ed. 499 (1922). The district court correctly dismissed Holy-field-Vega\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Holyfield-Vega\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
