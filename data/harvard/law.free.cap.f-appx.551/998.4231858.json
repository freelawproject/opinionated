Jenice argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to discuss any of the specific statutory sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>factors and misstated that it was considering the factors \u201cas set forth in Title 18 United States Code, Section 3554(a).\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential standard for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Overstreet, </em>713 F.3d 627, 636 (11th Cir.2013). \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the Guidelines range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008). The government argues that we should review only for plain error because Jenice did not object to his sentence, but we need not address that argument because, whether we review for abuse of discretion or for plain error, our decision is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">The district court committed no reversible error. The district court stated that it \u201cconsidered the statements of all parties, the presentence investigation report which contains the advisory guidelines and the statutory factors.... \u201d That statement established that the district court considered the nature and circumstances of Jenice\u2019s offense, his criminal history, the need for deterrence, and the change in his circumstances from a life \u201ctrouble[d] with drugs\u201d to a life devoted to his church and his community. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>see also United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007). A slip of the tongue by the district court that it considered section 3554, which has no subsection (a) and concerns orders of forfeiture, instead of section 3553(a), which concerns the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence, does not make Jenice\u2019s sentence procedurally unreasonable. The district court correctly determined that Jenice had an advisory guidelines range of 41 to 51 months of imprisonment, and Jenice requested and received \u201ca sentence at the low end\u201d of that range. As Jenice admitted at his sentencing hearing, a sentence of 41 months of imprisonment is \u201cmore than adequate to serve the purposes of 3553.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">We AFFIRM Jenice\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
