On appeal, Lormil argues the district court clearly erred in failing to grant him a two-level \u201cminor role reduction\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), because he was a minor player in the importation scheme who \u201cdid none of the planning, arranging, purchasing, or packing of the drugs\u201d and did not have an equity interest in the drugs. After a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">The facts of this case are as follows. Lormil was stopped by Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) after disembarking a flight from Haiti to Miami, Florida. While examining his luggage, CBP officers discovered cocaine hidden in a false lining of his suitcase. The cocaine was seized, and a Drug Enforcement laboratory report determined that the net weight of the cocaine amounted to 2.515 kilograms. Lormil was arrested and subsequently interviewed by Homeland Security Investigation officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">Lormil told the investigators that he made a living by selling American products in Haiti and regularly traveled between the two countries. On this particular trip, a Haitian woman by the name of Philemon, who Lormil had known for fifteen years, gave him a suitcase and asked him to deliver it to a Haitian man named Enoch, who was located in West Palm Beach. Lormil further stated he had known Enoch for eleven years. Lormil told the officers that he looked in the suitcase after he received it but only saw clothes; he did not know the bag contained cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">Lormil eventually pleaded guilty and prior to sentencing, objected to the Pre-sentence Investigation Report because, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, he argued that he deserved a reduction for his role in the offense because he was a minor player. He renewed this objection at sentencing. The district court overruled his objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>and sentenced Lormil to 42 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact we review for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 980, 945 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion in making this fact-intensive determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cIf the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The sentencing guidelines provide a \u201crange of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). A two-level reduction for a minor role is warranted for a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The proponent of a downward adjustment \u201calways bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFS\">We do not create a presumption that drug couriers are never minor or minimal participants, any more than that they are always minor or minimal. Rather, we hold only that the district court must assess all of the facts probative of the defendant\u2019s role in her relevant conduct in evaluating the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 943. In determining whether someone is entitled to the minor role adjustment, the court \u201cmust measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which she was held accountable at sentencing,\u201d utilizing a nonexhaustive list of indi-cia including the <em>\u201camount of drugs, </em>fair market value of drugs, amount of money to be paid to the courier, equity interest in the drugs, role in planning the criminal scheme, and role in the distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945 (emphasis added). In some cases, the drug quantity alone can be dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">Here, Lormil has failed to meet his burden of showing his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence because he presented no evidence other than his own uncorroborated story casting himself as a mere courier. While it is true that he offered the names of the alleged leaders, federal agents were never able to contact or locate them. Furthermore, the large amount of cocaine Lormil smuggled within his suitcase coupled with its high street value satisfy several of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>factors, and we are required to give great deference to the district court\u2019s balancing of those factors. <em>See id. </em>at 945. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
