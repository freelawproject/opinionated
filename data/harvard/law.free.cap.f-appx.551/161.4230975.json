Hyrtado pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm while illegally in the United States. The probation officer determined that Hyrtado\u2019s two prior Georgia aggravated assault convictions were crimes of violence (COV); accordingly, in the Pre-sentence Report (PSR), the probation officer indicated that Hyrtado\u2019s base offense level was 24 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). Hyrtado raised no objection to this determination nor to any other aspect of the district court\u2019s guideline calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-20\">Hyrtado now appeals the 120-month sentence imposed by the district court. In his opening brief, he argues that the district court erred in relying on the PSR\u2019s characterization of his Georgia convictions as COVs. The Government concedes that no state court documents pertinent to Hyr-tado\u2019s Georgia aggravated assault convictions were attached to the PSR. To the extent- the district court relied on the PSR\u2019s characterization of Hyrtado\u2019s prior offenses to enhance his sentence, it erred. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-21\">However, after Hyrtado filed his opening brief, this court granted the Government\u2019s unopposed motion to supplement the appellate record with copies of records of Hyrtado\u2019s two prior Georgia aggravated assault convictions. The Government argues that the state court records establish that Hyrtado\u2019s aggravated assault convictions were COVs. We may consider the state court documents in assessing the instant appeal, even though the district court did not do so. <em>See United States v. Vargas-Soto, </em>700 F.3d 180, 183 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-22\">As Hyrtado concedes, his failure to object to the application of the enhancement in the district court results in plain error review. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012). To prevail under the plain error standard, Hyrtado must show an error that is \u201cclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable debate.\u201d <em>Puckett v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). He also must demonstrate that any error affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>If he makes these showings, this court has the discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1 instructs that \u201ccrime of violence\u201d has the meaning given that term in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and the commentary to that Guideline. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.1); <em>United States v. Mohr, </em>554 F.3d 604, 606 (5th Cir.2009). For an offense to qualify as a COV, it must either \u201c(1) contain as a statutory element the \u2018use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u2019; (2) belong to the list of enumerated offenses; (3) or fall under the \u2018residual clause\u2019 of \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2) by presenting a \u2018serious risk of physical injury to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mohr, </em>554 F.3d at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We have not previously addressed whether the statute of conviction, Ga.Code \u00a7 16 \u2014 5\u201421(a)(2), is a COV. Having reviewed the statute, we conclude that any differences between the statute and the generic, contemporary definition of \u201caggravated assault\u201d are immaterial, and therefore Hyrtado\u2019s previous convictions are COVs because they belong to the list of enumerated offenses. <em>See United States v. Esparza-Perez, </em>681 F.3d 228, 231-32 (5th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Rojas-Gutierrez, </em>510 F.3d 545, 549 n. 5 (5th Cir.2007); \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.1). In the alternative, in view of the conduct expressly charged in the state court indictments, Hyrtado\u2019s aggravated assault convictions were COVs under the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.1). <em>See United States v. Stoker, </em>706 F.3d 643, 649 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>619 F.3d 474, 478 (5th Cir.2010). Thus, any error by the district court did not affect Hyrtado\u2019s substantial rights, and plain error has not been shown. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b189-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
