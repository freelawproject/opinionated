Carrera contends that the sentence is unreasonable because the Guideline for illegal reentry, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, lacks an empirical basis, double-counts criminal history, and places too much weight on a prior conviction; that his prior conviction occurred in 1999; that illegal reentry is not a violent offense but merely a trespass; and that the court failed to\u2019 give sufficient consideration to his motive for returning, which was to attend his brother\u2019s funeral and participate in a family novena.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Although Carrera objected to the sentence as greater than necessary to satisfy the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and requested a variance based on the age of the conviction and his motive, he did not challenge the empirical basis of \u00a7 2L1.2, nor did he raise his trespass argument. We need not review these arguments for plain error, however, as even under the ordinary standard, they fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">When, as here, a district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, the sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). As Carrera concedes, his challenge to the applicability of the presumption to a sentence based on \u00a7 2L1.2 is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">A within-guidelines sentence is not necessarily unreasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis and double-counts prior convictions. <em>See id. </em>With respect to the age of the prior conviction, the \u201cstaleness of a prior conviction used in the proper calculation of a guidelines-range sentence does not render a sentence substantively unreasonable and does not destroy the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to such sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir.2011). We have likewise rejected the argument that an illegal reentry is merely a trespassory offense. <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">Carrera\u2019s contention that the district court failed to take into account that he returned to attend the novena and funeral for his brother also fails. The district court specifically addressed this argument but concluded that, in light of Carrera\u2019s criminal history, this factor was not sufficient to warrant a sentence below the guidelines range. The district court was in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Carrera\u2019s mere disagreement with the district court\u2019s decision to afford greater weight to his criminal history than to the arguments he offered for a lesser sentence is not enough to rebut the presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
