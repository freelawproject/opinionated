Ubanda maintains his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it overstates the seriousness of his offense and fails to take his personal circumstances into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-23\">As Ubanda concedes, review is for plain error under <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>he preserves for possible further review the issue of whether an abuse of discretion is the proper standard. 505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). For reversible plain error, Ubanda must show a clear or obvious forfeited error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Even if he shows such reversible plain error, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>Ubanda fails, however, to show any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-24\">In addition to preserving the issue of the correct standard of review, Ubanda seeks to preserve other issues for review as well. He acknowledges his other contentions, including that his within-Guidelines sentence should not be afforded a presumption of reasonableness because Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 was not based on empirical data and national experience, are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). <em>Duarte </em>also forecloses Uban-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>da\u2019s contention that the application of \u00a7 2L1.2 results in double counting because his prior convictions were used in determining both his offense level and his criminal history category. <em>See id. </em>Likewise, this court has rejected the claim that the offense of illegal reentry is merely a trespass offense and is treated too harshly under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>518 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201cCongress considers illegal reentry into the United States subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony an extremely serious offense punishable by up to twenty years in prison\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Insofar as Ubanda maintains the district court failed to take into account his personal history and characteristics, the court heard Ubanda\u2019s mitigating assertions, but determined those circumstances were insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attached to his within-Guidelines sentence. Ubanda\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s evaluation of the sentencing factors was not sufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AhD\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
