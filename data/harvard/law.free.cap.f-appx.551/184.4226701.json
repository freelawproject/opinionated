Appellant Navidad Ubben claims the property was her separate properly under Texas law and that the district court failed to follow state law by refusing to hold a hearing, thus denying procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-22\">The district court issued a short but sufficiently explanatory order, dated January 24, 2013, noting that the Ubbens had the burden \u201cto prove by clear and convincing evidence that the garnished accounts contain separate property, which usually requires tracing of the funds\u201d (citing <em>United States v. Ingram, </em>No. 4:04-CV-868-A, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2102, at *13-14 (N.D.Tex. Feb. 14, 2005)). The court concluded that \u201c[b]eeause [the Ubbens] have not made even the slightest attempt at showing that the accounts contain separate properly and have not disputed any facts raised by the government, a hearing is not necessary and the ... exemption [from garnishment] does not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>There is no error, and the judgment, being based on the Final Order of Garnishment, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b212-23\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR.
