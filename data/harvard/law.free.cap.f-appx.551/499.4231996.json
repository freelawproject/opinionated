At sentencing, the district court found that Jackson qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) and enhanced his sentence accordingly. Jackson argues that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender because his prior conviction under Florida Statutes \u00a7 316.1935(1) for fleeing or attempting to elude law enforcement is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-18\">The Sentencing Guidelines require enhanced sentences for defendants that qualify as career offenders. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). To be deemed a career offender, a defendant must, among other things, have \u201cat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). A crime of violence is any offense, state or federal, that and fits into one of three categories found in \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and is punishable by a term of imprisonment in excess of one year. <em>United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 975 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 288, 184 L.Ed.2d 169 (2012). Here, the relevant category of crimes, often referred to as residual clause crimes, <em>id., </em>\u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-21\">\u201cWe review de novo whether a prior-conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Chit-wood, </em>676 F.3d at 975 (internal quotation marks omitted). In determining whether a prior offense qualifies as a crime of violence, we apply a categorical approach, looking \u201cno further than the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this approach, \u201cwe consider whether the <em>elements of the offense </em>are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.\u201d <em>Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d at 975-76 (internal quotation marks omitted). Inclusion is justified when an offense \u201ccreates as much risk of physical injury\u201d as one of the crimes enumerated in \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>979. Our inquiry is also guided by \u201ccases interpreting the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act [ (ACCA) ], 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), because the \u00a7 4B1.2 definition of \u2018crime of violence\u2019 and ACCA\u2019s definition of \u2018violent felony\u2019 are substantially the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 975 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s prior conviction under an Indiana law prohibiting knowing and intentional flight from a police officer was a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2274, 2277, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011). The Court compared vehicle flight to burglary and arson and determined that it posed a comparable risk to those crimes because it \u201cintentionally] release[s] ... a destructive force\u201d and creates a \u201cconfrontation leading to violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2273-74. Importantly, the Court found that vehicle flight poses such risks even when the fleeing criminal drives in a relatively safe manner. <em>See id. </em>The risk of danger inherent in vehicle flights arises from the \u201clegitimate and lawful\u201d force police may use to end the confrontation created by the decision to flee. <em>See id. </em>at 2273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">This court has held that \u201cvehicle flight in violation of [Florida Statutes] \u00a7 316.1935(2) qualifies as a violent felony under the [ACCA].\u201d <em>United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290, 1301 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 182, 187 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013). In <em>Petite, </em>we stressed that \u201cthe Supreme Court made it clear that [r]isk of violence is <em>inherent </em>to vehicle flight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1295 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we held that vehicle flight, \u201ceven without any reckless driving on the part of the offender,\u201d poses a substantial risk of injury to persons and property by provoking a \u201cdangerous confrontational response from [the] officer.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Jackson argues that his conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude law enforcement under Florida Statutes \u00a7 316.1935(1) does not qualify as a crime of violence. We disagree. After careful review of the record and relevant case law, we conclude that a conviction under \u00a7 316.1935(1) is a crime of violence within U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Like the statutes in <em>Sykes </em>and <em>Petite, </em>\u00a7 316.1935(1) makes it a felony for the operator of a vehicle to flee from a law a law enforcement officer after being ordered to stop. <em>See id. </em>at 1294-95. Since vehicle flight inherently poses a substantial risk of injury similar to the risk posed by the crimes of burglary and arson, <em>id. </em>at 1301, we hold that a conviction under Florida Statutes \u00a7 316.1935(1) qualifies as a crime of violence for the purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
