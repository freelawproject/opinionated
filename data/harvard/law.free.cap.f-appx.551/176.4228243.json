His only contention is that the district court impermissibly considered the need to promote respect for the law and the need for just punishment when imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-23\">Because Urbina failed to object in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir.2009). To prevail under the plain error standard, Urbina \u201cmust show an error that is clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260. If he makes such a showing, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error, \u201cbut only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-24\">Among the factors a district court should consider when imposing sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>generally is \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8558(a)(2)(A). The factors in subsection (a)(2)(A), however, are not listed among the factors that a district court should consider when deciding whether to revoke a term of supervised release and impose sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(e). \u201c[I]t is improper for a district court to rely on \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) for the modification or revocation of a supervised release term.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 844 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">In <em>Miller, </em>however, we addressed a revocation and sentencing pursuant to \u00a7 3583(e). <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 844. Urbi-na\u2019s revocation and sentencing was based in part on an allegation that he used and possessed cocaine. Revocation of release and imposition of a sentence of imprisonment were mandatory pursuant to \u00a7 3583(g), which does not list or omit any of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(g). We have not found clear or obvious error when a district court has considered the factors set out at \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) in revocations that are governed in whole or in part by \u00a7 3583(g). <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>473 Fed.Appx. 400, 401 (5th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>460 Fed.Appx. 351, 352 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2759, 183 L.Ed.2d 628 (2012); <em>United States v. Flores-Gaytan, </em>542 Fed.Appx. 353, 353-54, No. 12-41398, 2013 WL 5670855, at *1 (5th Cir. Oct. 18, 2013) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>532 Fed.Appx. 547, 548-50 (5th Cir.2013) (unpublished), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 349, 187 L.Ed.2d 243 (2013). Although the cases on point are unpublished, they are \u201chighly persuasive because [this court] explicitly rejected the identical argument that [Urbi-na] advances here.\u201d <em>United States v. Pino Gonzalez, </em>636 F.3d 157, 160 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b204-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
