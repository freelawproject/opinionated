The presen-tence investigation report (PSI) determined that Young qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. At the sentencing hearing, Young argued that the career offender guideline range imposed penalties that were too high given the relatively low severity of his predicate offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Young also objected to the PSI\u2019s two-level use-of-violence enhancement for striking a police dog. The district court assumed, for the purposes of sentencing, that the enhancement did not apply, but noted that this did not change his applicable guideline range because of Young\u2019s career offender designation. The court\u2019s written statement of reasons, however, indicated that the PSI was adopted without change.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">On appeal, Young argues that the erroneous statement of reasons may affect his eligibility for certain programs in prison and asks that we remand the case for the entry of a judgment consistent with the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing. Young also argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When the unambiguous oral pronouncement of a sentence conflicts with the court\u2019s written judgment, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1245 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">Young\u2019s argument that the discrepancy between the district court\u2019s written statement of reasons and its oral findings at sentencing constitutes reversible error fails. Although the statement of reasons indicates that the PSI was adopted without change, the court expressly stated that it would evaluate Young\u2019s sentence under the assumption that he prevailed on the enhancement objection. Nevertheless, Young is correct that the statement of reasons departs from the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing. Young asserts that the PSI\u2019s finding of the use of violence could impact some of his prison rights. To that end, we remand to the district court with instructions to update the statement of reasons to conform to the court\u2019s oral findings at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we first ensure that the sentence was procedurally reasonable by checking whether the district court properly calculated the guideline range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">Despite Young\u2019s assertions to the contrary, the district court expressly considered his arguments regarding the application of the career offender guidelines to his case. The court acknowledged that the guideline range was not binding upon it, but stated that the particular facts in Young\u2019s case, including the consistency of his criminal behavior, dictated that a longer sentence was necessary. The court calculated the correct guideline range, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not rely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>erroneous facts, and adequately explained its sentence. Accordingly, Young\u2019s sentence was not procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). The district court \u201cshall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, th\u00e9 need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The imposition of a sentence well below the statutory maximum penalty is an indicator of reasonableness. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324 (including the fact that a sentence was well below the statutory maximum among factors contributing to the sentence\u2019s reasonableness). Although we do not apply a presumption of reasonableness for sentences falling within the guidelines range, \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Young\u2019s 188-month sentence was within the applicable guideline range and below the thirty-year statutory maximum. The court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the frequency and consistency of his offenses in evaluating the need to promote respect for the law, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. Accordingly, we affirm Young\u2019s sentence and remand the case with instructions to amend the statement of reasons to conform to the district court\u2019s oral findings at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">AFFIRMED. REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO AMEND THE STATEMENT OF REASONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-9\">.
