We construe his arguments on appeal as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that Lindsay\u2019s claim he was denied a right to counsel in the state court proceeding, in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights, was barred by the <em>Roolcer-Feld-man</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Johnson v. Governor of Fla., </em>405 F.3d 1214, 1217 (11th Cir.2005). Whether a plaintiffs complaint is barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is a legal question that we review <em>de novo. Doe v. Fla. Bar, </em>630 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.\\2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is a jurisdictional rule that precludes lower federal courts from reviewing state court judgments. <em>Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). The doctrine \u201cprecludes a United States district court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction in an action it would otherwise be empowered to adjudicate.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 291, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). \u201cThe <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine ... is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The district court did not err in determining the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine operated to bar Lindsay\u2019s federal action. Lindsay\u2019s continued insistence that his federal case is actually an \u201cappeal\u201d of the state court parental rights termination proceeding makes clear this is the type of case precluded by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. As to his remaining claims, Lindsay offers no specific argument with respect to the district court\u2019s order dismissing, for failure to state a claim, his Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims and challenge to the constitutionality of Chapter 63, Florida Statutes, and accordingly has waived those challenges. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (explaining issues not raised on appeal are deemed waived). Thus, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-23\">. <em>Pro se </em>pleadings are construed liberally. <em>Tannenbaum v.
