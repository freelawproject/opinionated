He also argued ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court dismissed Hughes\u2019s claims as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), as frivolous, and as barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-16\">In his appellate brief, Hughes reurges the merits of his claims but fails to address the district court\u2019s detailed analysis and dismissal of his claims. When an appellant, like Hughes, fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that issue. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Hughes\u2019s claims are therefore deemed abandoned. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-17\">Hughes also argues for the first time that he has been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Because we do not generally consider claims raised for the first time on appeal, we will not address this claim. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
