(\u201cCAT\u201d). Summary dismissal is authorized if, among other things, the appellant indicates on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>notice-of-appeal form \u201cthat he or she will file a brief or statement in support of the appeal and, thereafter, does not file such brief or statement, or reasonably explain his or her failure to do so, within the time set for filing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E); <em>see Claudio v. Holder, </em>601 F.3d 316, 318 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Apaestegui de Abanto, represented by counsel, indicated on the notice of appeal form (Form EOIR-26) that she would file a brief but failed to do so. Further, she did not avail herself of \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E)\u2019s provision for lenity by explaining her failure to file a brief or statement within the time in which she was allowed to file the brief or separate statement. Thus, the BIA was within its \u201cstatutorily designated discretion\u201d summarily to dismiss the appeal. <em>See Rioja v. Ashcroft, </em>317 F.3d 514, 515-16 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Accordingly, this court need not reach Apaestegui de Abanto\u2019s contention that her notice of appeal otherwise apprised the BIA of the grounds for her appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 516. Nor do we reach her arguments going to the merits of her claim for relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
