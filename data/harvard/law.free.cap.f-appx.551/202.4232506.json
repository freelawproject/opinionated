However, the only issue he briefs pertains to Dr. Bernard, to whom Stewart was sent for an independent evaluation after Stewart\u2019s doctor and the employer\u2019s doctors disagreed regarding causation of Stewart\u2019s back problems. Stewart contends that Dr. Bernard is biased such that his opinions should have been discounted by the Administrative Law Judge and the BRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The BRB concluded that it did not need to address the issue of Dr. Bernard\u2019s alleged partiality: \u201cBecause [the treating physician] did not relate claimant\u2019s continuing back problems to his work injury, claimant has not met his burden of establishing that his back condition is work-related. Therefore it is not necessary to address claimant\u2019s allegations with respect to Dr. Bernard\u2019s alleged partiality.\u201d A.S. <em>v. Tigress Envtl. &amp; Dockside Servs., </em>BRB No. 12-0425, 2013 WL 2472385, at *3 (DoL Ben. Rev. Bd. May 29, 2013). Stewart has wholly failed to address the basis for the BRB\u2019s ruling and, thus, has abandoned the only relevant issue before this court. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir.2006) (\u201cInadequately briefed issues are deemed abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
