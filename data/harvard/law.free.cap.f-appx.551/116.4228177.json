The district court sentenced him to serve 10 months in prison, which was ordered to run consecutively to the sentence imposed for Otero-Mendez\u2019s new illegal reentry offense. On appeal, Otero-Mendez argues that the consecutive 10-month within-poli-ey-guidelines revocation sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and because it served as punishment for the new offenses that he had committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We review revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 496-97 (5th Cir.2012). Because the 10-month revocation sentence did not exceed the 10-year statutory maximum term of imprisonment and was within the applicable policy range of 4-10 months, it was a legal sentence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(B)(i); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2); U.S. SENTENCING GuiDELINES MANUAL (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 7B1.4, p.s. (2011); <em>United States v. Pena, </em>125 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir.1997). The district court exercised its discretion to order that the revocation sentence be served consecutively to the 46-month sentence for the new illegal reentry conviction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c), p.s. &amp; cmt. n. 3(C). Because the sentence fell within the statutory range and was in keeping with the Guidelines\u2019 advice regarding concurrent or consecutive sentences, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006). Otero-Mendez\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not demonstrate that the sentence imposed was plainly unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Kippers, </em>685 F.3d at 496-97. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
