He contends that in imposing the above-guidelines sentence, the district court overemphasized his immigration history, which consisted of only two prior illegal reentry offenses. He further asserts that the district court overemphasized his prior convictions for assault, which were serious, but mainly misdemeanors. Garza-Medrano requests this court to vacate his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-20\">In addition, to preserve the issue for further review, Garza-Medrano, relying upon <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), argues that revocation sentences should be reviewed for \u201creasonableness.\u201d However this court reviews such sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). Revocation sentences exceeding the policy statements range but not exceeding the statutory maximum have been upheld as a matter of routine and are not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 265 (5th Cir.2009). In this case, the sentencing court noted Garza-Medra-no\u2019s recidivism when it imposed the sentence. The need for a sentence to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct is a proper factor for consideration. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e), 3553(a)(2)(A). Accordingly, Garza-Medrano\u2019s revocation sentence was not plainly unreasonable. <em>See Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-17\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR.
