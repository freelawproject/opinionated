He argues that the district court erred by applying a two-level adjustment to his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) based on a finding that one of Barrera\u2019s coconspira-tors possessed a dangerous weapon during the offense. He also argues that the district court erroneously denied his request for an offense level reduction based on his limited role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-19\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(l) provides for a two-level enhancement of the defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); <em>accord United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 244 (5th Cir.2001). The commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 instructs that \u201c[t]he enhancement should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n.ll(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-20\">The enhancement will apply where the defendant personally possessed the weapon or where a coconspirator possessed the weapon during the conspiracy and the co-conspirator\u2019s possession was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant. <em>See United States v. Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir.2010). The Government is required to prove the applicability of the enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id.; United States v. Aguilera-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>Zapata, </em>901 F.2d 1209, 1215 (5th Cir.1990). \u201cIf the Government meets that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 396 (5th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n.ll(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Barrera has failed to demonstrate clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that the enhancement applies because his cocon-spirator\u2019s possession of the weapon was reasonably foreseeable to Barrera. Law enforcement agents observed Barrera\u2019s co-conspirator throw the weapon out of the window of the vehicle they were pursuing, and the coconspirator admitted to owning the weapon, attempting to discard it, and knowingly participating in the conspiracy by, inter alia, loading marijuana into the tractor-trailer. Thus, the Government \u201cshowfed] a temporal and spatial relationship of the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and [Barrera\u2019s coconspirator],\u201d <em>see Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d at 390, and that Barrera\u2019s coconspirator \u201cknowingly possessed the weapon,\u201d <em>see Aguilera-Zapata, </em>901 F.2d at 1215. The record also indicates that Barrera participated in the conspiracy by driving the tractor-trailer loaded with 967 kilograms of marijuana to a truck stop so that a driver he recruited could transport the drugs to Houston, all while Barrera maintained communication with his coconspirator. These facts are sufficient to support the district court\u2019s imposition of the enhancement based on a finding of foreseeability. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mergerson, </em>4 F.3d 337, 350 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 765-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Aguilerar-Zapata, </em>901 F.2d at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, a district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by four levels if the defendant was a minimal participant in the criminal activity, by two levels if the defendant was a minor participant, or by three levels if the level of participation falls between minimal and minor. A \u201cminimal participant\u201d is one who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group,\u201d such as one who demonstrates a lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n.4. A \u201cminor participant\u201d is any participant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n.5. \u201cIt is not enough that a defendant does less than other participants; in order to qualify as a minor participant, a defendant must have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">It is the defendant\u2019s burden to show that his role in the offense was minor or minimal. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 597 (5th Cir.2001). In determining whether a defendant is entitled to a mitigating role reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2, the district court must consider the broad context of the defendant\u2019s crime. <em>See United States v. Atanda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 198 (5th Cir.1995). The district court\u2019s denial of a mitigating role reduction is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Barrera\u2019s argument that he was entitled to a mitigating role reduction because he was less culpable than his coconspirators is unavailing. Barrera worked closely with his coconspirators to ensure that the marijuana-laden tractor-trailer would be transferred to a driver who would then transport the load to Houston. Additionally, Barrera has been held responsible for the conduct to which he pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The district court\u2019s determination that Barrera was similarly situated to his co-conspirators \u201cis plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203. Barrera\u2019s participation was essential, and not merely peripheral, to the advancement of the offense, <em>see id. </em>at 204, and was \u201ccoextensive with the conduct for which he was held accountable,\u201d <em>see Garcia, </em>242 F.3d at 598-99. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in denying Barrera a mitigating role adjustment. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
