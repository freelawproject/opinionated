Six Unknown, Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). The district court dismissed Simmons\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The district court did not err by dismissing Simmons\u2019s complaint. Simmons failed to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\u201d that is, from which the district court could \u201cdraw the reasonable inference\u201d that King violated Simmons\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Simmons alleged that she was defamed when King imitated her \u201cpigeon-toed walk\u201d and waved his arms while making \u201cmonkey sounds,\u201d but \u201c[d]ef-amation, by itself, is ... not a constitutional deprivation,\u201d <em>Siegert v. Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 233, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 1794, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991). Simmons complained that King\u2019s conduct violated the First Amendment, but Simmons failed to allege that she was punished for or prevented from engaging in a constitutionally protected expression. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. Amend. I. Simmons also complained that King discriminated against her based on her disability in violation of her right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, but Simmons failed to allege that King\u2019s conduct resulted in a \u201cdeprivation ... of [any] liberty or property interest guaranteed by the Constitution,\u201d <em>Emory v. Peeler, </em>756 F.2d 1547, 1553 (11th Cir.1985). <em>See Harris v. Ostrout, </em>65 F.3d 912, 916 (11th Cir.1995) (recognizing that a prisoner\u2019s allegations that he had been twice cited for disciplinary violations because of his race and had his recreational privileges suspended as a result \u201cstate[d] a[ ] ... Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claim\u201d). Simmons further complained that King \u201churt\u201d her feelings and made her \u201cangry and depressed,\u201d but we cannot say that her injuries are objectively and sufficiently serious to constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1111 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Simmons\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
