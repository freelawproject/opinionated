He asserts that the guidelines minimum sentence was substantively unreasonable and that the district court abused its discretion by declining to vary below the guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>range in light of the specific circumstances of his case. We generally review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because McGinn\u2019s sentence was within the properly-calculated guidelines range, a presumption of reasonableness applies. <em>See United States v. Jenkins, </em>712 F.3d 209, 214-15 (5th Cir.2013). We need not decide whether his failure to object to the sentence that was imposed results in plain error review, because even under the ordinary standard, McGinn has shown no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">McGinn asserts that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 is entitled only to \u201climited deference\u201d because it is \u201ccompletely divorced from the Sentencing Commission\u2019s institutional role\u201d and \u201cbereft of empirical support.\u201d He contends that the guideline requires an inflated base offense level and illogical enhancements, producing sentences that \u201care too harsh for the average child pornography offender.\u201d Such an argument is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>720 F.3d 220, 228 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 16, 2013) (No. 13-5918); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>665 F.3d 114, 119-23 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2773, 183 L.Ed.2d 643 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Additionally, McGinn asserts that his sentence was unreasonable because he is an \u201cotherwise law abiding citizen[]\u201d who leads a normal life and possessed only 100 still images of child pornography and four videos. He asserts that applying the severe enhancements under \u00a7 2G2.2 resulted in a sentence that was too harsh. According to McGinn, he did not purchase or sell the images, did not use them to entice minors to engage in sexual acts, and merely viewed the images without engaging in \u201cany kind of hands-on offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Although he attempts to minimize his conduct of merely viewing child pornography, we noted in <em>Miller </em>that \u201creal children are actually being abused and violated when pornographic images are made.\u201d 665 F.3d at 123. McGinn asserts what is essentially a policy disagreement with the Guidelines, and the district court was within its discretion to reject it. <em>See id. </em>at 122-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">We defer here to the district court\u2019s determination that a 188-month sentence was necessary to meet the sentencing goals of punishment and deterrence, as well as the other factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Miller, </em>665 F.3d at 119-23. As McGinn fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
