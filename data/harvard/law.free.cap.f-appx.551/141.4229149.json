In his motion, he asked the district court to compel the Government to file a motion to reduce his sentence as provided in Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Government argues that Collins\u2019s appeal should be dismissed because Collins failed to file a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-23\">Collins\u2019s notice of appeal was filed after the expiration of the time for filing a timely notice of appeal and the time during which the district court could have extended the time for filing a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i), (b)(4). Accordingly, we GRANT the Government\u2019s motion for summary dismissal and DISMISS Collins\u2019s appeal as untimely filed. <em>See Burnley v. City of San Antonio, </em>470 F.3d 189, 192 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-24\">The Government\u2019s alternative motions for summary affirmance or for an extension of time to file an appellate brief are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>DENIED. Collins\u2019s motion for leave to amend his reply brief is GRANTED; his motions for a three-point reduction for his substantial assistance and to place our decision under seal are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b169-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
