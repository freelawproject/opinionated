In one case, Brewer pled guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1). In the other case, he plead guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. The District Court sentenced Brewer to a total of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment and, without objection, to three consecutive three-year terms of supervised release. Brewer appealed his sentences in each case, but the appeals were dismissed pursuant to the appeal waiver contained in the plea agreements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-22\">Brewer, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>thereafter moved the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.S. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his convictions and sentences in the two cases on several grounds, including the claim that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to object to the court\u2019s imposition of consecutive terms of supervised release. The court agreed with Brewer that consecutive terms of supervised release are prohibited, but concluded that his claim was barred because he did not challenge the imposition of consecutive terms on direct appeal. The court denied Brewer\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and granted his application for a certificate of appealability on one issue: \u201cwhether [in his plea agreements] he waived his ineffective assistance of counsel claim for his counsel\u2019s failure to object at sentencing to the Court\u2019s order<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>ing consecutive terms of supervised release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">In its brief on appeal, the Government correctly states that the District Court erred in concluding that the appeal-waiver provisions of Brewer\u2019s plea agreement foreclosed his ineffective assistance argument. Appellee\u2019s brief at 5. It also correctly states that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e) unambiguously requires that terms of supervised release be imposed concurrently. <em>Id. </em>In short, defense counsel\u2019s failure to object constituted ineffective assistance which prejudiced Brewer. We accordingly vacate the District Court\u2019s judgments, and remand the cases with the instruction that the District Court amend the judgments to provide that the terms of supervised release run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">VACATED and REMANDED, with instruction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-18\">. Each plea agreement contained this sentence-appeal waiver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-19\">The defendant ... expressly waives the right to appeal defendant\u2019s sentence, directly or collaterally, on any ground, including the applicability of the \"safety valve\u201d provisions contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, except for an upward departure by the sentencing judge, a sentence above the statutory maximum, or <em>a sentence in violation of the law apart from the sentencing guidelines.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-24\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
