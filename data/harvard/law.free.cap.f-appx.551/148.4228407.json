This action, originally filed in state court and removed therefrom, involved the foreclosure on their residence in Cedar Park, Texas. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-21\">Like the district court before us, we have reviewed the Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendants-Appellants, the response of the Trevarthens, and the reply thereto of Defendants-Appellants, as well as the appellate briefs of the parties and the record on appeal. As a result, we are satisfied that the district court nailed this one precisely in the concluding paragraph of its Order of April 26, 2013. After noting that this is \u201cnot the first time Grant Trevarthen has appeared before this Court in frivolous foreclosure litigation\u201d and after identifying prior cases of that ilk, the court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>that \u201cthe spurious allegations and baseless causes of action asserted indicate this suit is simply more legal gamesmanship by the Trevarthans in their ongoing campaign to abuse the legal system and win a free house.\u201d We agree, adding only that the instant appeal is equally spurious and contumacious.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
