In context of the record, the district court\u2019s explanation for his 33-month sentence, though brief, was adequate; and that sentence was procedurally reasonable. <em>See United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226 (11th Cir.2007). The court\u2019s 33-month sentence was also substantively reasonable in the light of the record and the relevant sentencing factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a) and 3853(e), particularly given Rosado-Curbelo\u2019s problems with recidivism and with adhering to the terms of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
