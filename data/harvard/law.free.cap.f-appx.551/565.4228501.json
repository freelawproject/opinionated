On appeal, Trejo argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress contraband discovered during a warrantless search of his vehicle and the fruits of that search. Specifically, Trejo challenges the district court\u2019s finding that a positive alert from a law-enforcement canine trained in narcotics detection provided sufficient probable cause to justify the search. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">On January 6, 2012, a detective from the Polk County Sheriffs Office contacted Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Jason Lemery to request that Lemery be on the lookout (BOLO) for a white Chevy Tahoe with Florida license tag ADCT27 traveling southbound on Interstate 75. The Polk County detective informed Lemery that the vehicle was suspected of transporting narcotics. Based on this call, Lemery understood that he was to look for probable cause to stop the Tahoe, and to enlist the services of a law-enforcement canine trained in narcotics detection during any resulting stop to determine if the vehicle in fact contained narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-14\">Lemery situated his patrol car along Interstate 75 and waited for the Tahoe\u2019s arrival, receiving updates on the vehicle\u2019s location as it approached. That afternoon, the Tahoe passed in front of Lemery\u2019s patrol car. Lemery initiated a traffic stop, maintaining that the Tahoe was traveling too closely to the vehicle in front of it and that the windows were unlawfully tinted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Trejo was driving the vehicle with his eventual co-defendant, Juaquin Ramirez, as his passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">Just a few minutes after Lemery initiated the traffic stop, Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Michael Jordan arrived with a drug-detection canine named Barny. Bar-ny is trained to detect the presence of several narcotics, including methamphetamine. When Barny detects narcotics, he normally \u201calerts\u201d his handler, Jordan, to the presence of the narcotic odor by aggressively pawing and scratching at the location.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">Jordan and Barny conducted an exterior sniff test of the Tahoe during the traffic stop. During the test, Barny alerted to the seams of both the driver\u2019s side and passenger\u2019s side front doors. Based on Barny\u2019s alerts suggesting the presence of narcotics, Lemery and Jordan searched the vehicle\u2019s interior without a warrant. The search revealed about four pounds of methamphetamine concealed inside and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>underneath the center console. Based upon this evidence, Trejo and Ramirez were charged with knowingly and intentionally possessing, and conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute, fifty grams or more of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Trejo filed a motion to suppress the contraband seized during the warrantless search of his vehicle, as well as any admissions made or evidence deriving from that search. Trejo argued that Barny\u2019s positive alert, standing alone, did not provide the probable cause necessary to justify the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">At a suppression hearing to address Trejo\u2019s motion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the government presented evidence regarding Barny\u2019s training and certifications to support the reliability of his field alerts. Trooper Jordan began working with Barny in 2009, although Bar-ny had some prior training as a drug detection dog. When Barny and Jordan began working together, the pair completed their first joint training and certification course, which required eighty hours of training over two weeks. The program was administered by Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Michael VanLeer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and resulted in a certification issued by Florida\u2019s Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Highway Patrol Academy. The standards for the initial certification course were governed by Florida regulations. <em>See </em>Fla. Admin. Code r. 11B-27.013.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">After this initial joint certification, Jordan and Barny re-certified annually. The re-certifications that Jordan and Barny completed required the pair to pass annual exams, which were again administered by VanLeer in a manner consistent with the \u201cstandards and guidelines set forth by the Florida Highway Patrol.\u201d Barny and Jordan had passed their most recent re-certification examination on September 21, 2011, just a few months before the January 6, 2012 traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">The pair also trained weekly. The weekly training format was similar to the initial and annual certification examinations \u2014 trainers would hide narcotics in various places and order the canines to find and alert their handlers if they detected a narcotics odor. In total, Jordan estimated that Barny participated in over eight hundred training sessions. And in those training sessions, Barny never falsely alerted to the presence of a narcotic odor when, in fact, no narcotics had ever been present. Only three times did Barny fail to identify a narcotic odor in training when an odor should have prompted an alert.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">Trejo countered the government\u2019s offer of proof of Barny\u2019s reliability not by challenging the adequacy of Barny\u2019s training, but by arguing that his real world search record was so poor that, even with the training, a positive alert in the field could not provide probable cause to conduct a warrantless search. Barny\u2019s real world search records revealed that he had been called upon to conduct 311 sniff searches. On 303 of these calls, Barny alerted to the presence of narcotics. Of these 303 alerts, officers identified residue but no measurable contraband 107 times. In addition, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>71 occasions officers could not even find any residue. Trejo argued that this amounted to at least a 28.5% false alert rate in real world situations, and at worst a false alert rate of around 58%. This high error rate in the field, Trejo argued, rendered the officers\u2019 reliance on Barny\u2019s positive alert to supply probable cause unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The district court denied Trejo\u2019s motion to suppress, adopting the conclusions set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation. The magistrate judge concluded that the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that canine Barny is reliable.\u201d The magistrate judge questioned Trejo\u2019s characterizations of Barny\u2019s error rate in the field, noting that Trejo faults Barny, who is trained to alert to narcotics odor, for alerting to residue (which gives off an odor). As a result, the magistrate judge concluded that the 23.5% field error rate \u2014 the rate at which Barny alerted but neither residue nor contraband was found \u2014 \u201cis likely a better barometer of Barny\u2019s reliability in. the field.\u201d Even if the 58% field error rate were accepted, the magistrate judge noted that probable cause to search a vehicle requires only a \u201cfair probability\u201d that contraband will be found. Beyond that, the magistrate judge noted, \u201cthe training of a dog alone may be sufficient proof of reliability.\u201d The magistrate judge thus concluded that \u201cBarny\u2019s alert gave officers probable cause to search the Chevy Tahoe pursuant to the automobile exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Trejo was convicted at a bench trial based on stipulated facts, and now appeals his conviction and the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">The propriety of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Virden, </em>488 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2007). We review the factual findings for clear error and the application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id. </em>We construe the facts in the light most favorable to the government here because it prevailed in the district court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">The Fourth Amendment provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. A warrantless search is <em>per se </em>unreasonable unless it falls into one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>450 F.2d 324, 325 (5th Cir.1971).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> One such exception is the automobile exception, which permits warrantless searches of a vehicle when there is probable cause to believe it contains contraband or evidence of a crime. <em>Virden, </em>488 F.3d at 1321-22. An alert from a narcotics detection canine establishes probable cause if \u201call the facts surrounding a dog\u2019s alert, viewed through the lens of common sense, would make a reasonably prudent person think that a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a crime.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1058. This analysis requires courts to examine the totality of the circumstances surrounding the canine\u2019s alert, instead of applying \u201crigid rules, bright-line tests, and mechanistic inquiries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">This Court has \u201clong recognized that probable cause arises when a drug-trained canine alerts to drugs.\u201d <em>United States v. Tamari, </em>454 F.3d 1259, 1265 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted). Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>finding probable cause, we generally require that the dog\u2019s alert be reliable, and have recognized that \u201ctraining of a dog alone is sufficient proof of reliability.\u201d <em>United States v. Sentovich, </em>677 F.2d 834, 838 n. 8 (11th Cir.1982); <em>see also United States v. Dunkley, </em>911 F.2d 522, 527 (11th Cir.1990) (citing <em>Sentovich, </em>677 F.2d at 838 n. 8, with approval).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">On appeal, Trejo argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Florida v. Harris, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1050, 185 L.Ed.2d 61, raises the requirements for the government\u2019s reliability showing. Tre-jo asserts that, in light of <em>Harris, </em>this Court must vacate and remand for the district court to consider in the first instance (1) whether the organizations that trained and certified Barny were \u201cbona fide\u201d and (2) whether Barny\u2019s training program utilized double-blind precautions to prevent the certification of canines who respond to a handler\u2019s cues as opposed to the odor of narcotics alone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Trejo also argues that the district court erred when it found Barny\u2019s alert reliable despite his error rate in the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Trejo\u2019s argument, however, reads too much into <em>Harris. </em>In <em>Harris, </em>the Supreme Court considered how a court should decide whether a drug detection dog\u2019s alert during a traffic stop provides probable cause to search a vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 1053. In <em>Harris, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed a Florida Supreme Court ruling that the Fourth Amendment requires the government to offer evidence from a checklist of items, emphasizing the need for evidence of not only the canine\u2019s training and certification but also evidence of performance in the field, including false alerts. <em>Id. </em>at 1054-55. The Supreme Court rejected this approach as too formulaic for the totality-of-the-circumstances probable cause inquiry, noting that \u201ca finding of a drug-detection dog\u2019s reliability cannot depend on the State\u2019s satisfaction of multiple, independent evidentiary requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">The U.S. Supreme Court criticized the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s overreliance on field data in particular, noting that those records \u201cmay markedly overstate a dog\u2019s real false positives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1056-57. \u201cThe better measure of a dog\u2019s reliability,\u201d the Supreme Court concluded, \u201ccomes away from the field, in controlled testing environments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1057. For that reason, the Supreme Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAO\">evidence of a dog\u2019s satisfactory performance in a certification or training program can itself provide sufficient reason to trust his alert. If a bona fide organization has certified a dog after testing his reliability in a controlled setting, a court can presume (subject to any conflicting evidence offered) that the dog\u2019s alert provides probable cause to search. The same is true, even in the absence of formal certification, if the dog has recently and successfully completed a training program that evaluated his proficiency in locating drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1057. The Supreme Court went on to note that \u201c[i]f the State has produced proof from controlled settings that a dog performs reliably in detecting drugs, and the defendant has not contested that showing, then the court should find probable cause. If, in contrast, the defendant has challenged the State\u2019s case (by disputing the reliability of the dog overall or of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>particular alert), then the court should weigh the competing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><em>Harris </em>does not unsettle this Court\u2019s jurisprudence that an alert from a canine trained in narcotics detection can establish probable cause. <em>See Sentovich, </em>677 F.2d at 838 n. 8. Rather, it recognizes, consistent with <em>Sentovich, </em>that a court may \u201cpresume\u201d that a dog\u2019s alert provides probable cause to search under certain circumstances, such as when the canine is certified by a \u201cbona fide\u201d organization or \u201chas recently and successfully completed a training program.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1057. By no means does <em>Harris </em>impose a categorical requirement, as Trejo suggests, that the district court make a factual finding that the canine is certified by a \u201cbona fide\u201d organization before finding that the dog\u2019s record in controlled settings supports a finding of reliability. <em>See id. </em>at 1057-58. Indeed, imposing a categorical evidentiary requirement like this would contradict the flexible and commonsense totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry <em>Harris </em>demands. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Here, the training that Trooper Jordan and his canine Barny completed is sufficient to support a presumption that Bar-ny\u2019s alert was reliable absent credible evidence to the contrary. Indeed, Jordan and Barny\u2019s training is quite similar to the training programs the Supreme Court considered in <em>Harris. </em>In <em>Harris, </em>the certification and training program for the initial certification was offered by state police departments and the refresher course was offered by \u201ca private company that specializes in testing and certifying\u201d narcotics detection dogs. <em>Id. </em>at 1054. The Supreme Court discussed both of these programs with approval. <em>Id. </em>at 1058. Here, the original certification course was offered by the Florida Highway Patrol and run by one of the State Troopers. And although Trejo questions the legitimacy of the organizations under whose standards Jordan and Barny were annually recerti-fied, the recertification course was taught by the very same instructor who offered the initial course. That the district court did not declare the certifying organizations \u2014 the Florida Highway Patrol, the International Forensic Research Institute, and the National Forensic Science Technology Center \u2014 to be \u201cbona fide\u201d in so many words makes no difference. And even if the certifying organizations were not \u201cbona fide\u201d within the meaning of <em>Harris, </em>the evidence clearly established that Barny and Jordan had \u201crecently and successfully completed a training program,\u201d and so the presumption of reliability was permissible absent a timely challenge to the adequacy of the training program.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">On that point, Trejo, like the defendant in <em>Harris, </em>\u201cdeclined to challenge in the trial court any aspect of [the canine\u2019s] training.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1058. To be sure, he now \u201craise[s] questions about that training\u2019s adequacy \u2014 for example, whether the programs ... used enough blind testing,\u201d and asks us to remand for a determination of whether the program used double-blind testing protocols. <em>Id. </em>But Trejo \u201cnever voiced those doubts in the trial court, and cannot do so for the first time here.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Garcia-Sandobal, </em>703 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2013) (noting that a party\u2019s failure to file a specific written objection to a proposed finding in a magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation waives the party\u2019s right to review of that finding). As Trejo\u2019s case came to the trial court, Barny had successfully completed drug-detection courses each year for the three years leading up to. the search of Trejo\u2019s vehicle and maintained his proficiency through weekly training courses. Such a training record, viewed alone and unchallenged before the trial court, is sufficient to establish a drug de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>tection dog\u2019s reliability. <em>See Harris, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1058.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Trejo\u2019s cross-examination focusing on Barny\u2019s field performance failed to rebut the government\u2019s case for Barny\u2019s reliability. <em>Cf. id. </em>As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Harris, </em>records of a dog\u2019s field performance in most cases have \u201crelatively limited import.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1056. Because of the risk that field data \u201cmay markedly overstate a dog\u2019s real false positives,\u201d a dog\u2019s performance in controlled testing environments\u2014 where Barny\u2019s performance was exceptional and nearly flawless \u2014 is a better measure of a canine\u2019s reliability than field performance. <em>Id. </em>at 1056-57. As a result, even considering the proffered field error rate, the positive alert from a drug detection dog with an excellent training record, coupled with the BOLO indicating that Trejo\u2019s Tahoe was suspected of transporting narcotics, established a \u201cfair probability\u201d that drugs would be found in the vehicle. This is all that probable cause requires. <em>See Virden, </em>488 F.3d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">For these reasons, we do not agree with Trejo\u2019s argument that we must remand to the district court to make a factual finding that the organizations issuing Barny\u2019s certifications were \u201cbona fide\u201d or that the training programs utilized double-blind training protocols. Neither do we agree that Barny\u2019s field error rate undermines the conclusion that his alerts are reliable indicia of the presence of narcotics sufficient to support probable cause. We therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-12\">. Trejo does not challenge the legality of the initial stop on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\">. Because the district court conducted a hearing focusing on Barny\u2019s alert, at which Trejo had an opportunity to present evidence and challenge the reliability and sufficiency of the alert, we do not understand Trejo's appeal to allege procedural error. <em>Cf. Florida v. Harris, </em>568 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1050, 1058, 185 L.Ed.2d 61 (2013) (describing the procedure for probable cause hearings and providing guidelines for district courts weighing evidence presented in this context).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b595-15\">. VanLeer was certified as a trainer by the International Forensic Research Institute and the National Forensic Science Technology Center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 1209.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\">. Trejo argues that, even if we do not find that the Federal Constitution requires double blind testing protocols, we must certify the question to the Florida Supreme Court to determine whether the State Constitution would impose such a requirement. We consider this argument waived, however, because he did not argue it until filing his brief with this Court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(a); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1352 n. 9 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">. Trejo also suggests that Jordan may have \"cued\u201d Barny to alert regardless of whether he detected an odor, which might undermine the case for probable cause. <em>See Harris, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1057-58 (\u201cAnd even assuming a dog is generally reliable, circumstances surrounding a particular alert may undermine the case for probable cause \u2014 if, say, the officer cued the dog (consciously or not) ....\"). However, Trejo did not argue to the district court that Jordan improperly cued Barny during the search of Trejo\u2019s automobile with sufficient clarity to preserve it. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ramirez-Flores, </em>743 F.3d 816, 821-22 (11th Cir.2014). For this reason, we would review this issue-if it is entitled to review at all in light of its omission from Trejo\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendations, Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(b)(2) \u2014 only for plain error. Given our precedent and the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, the district court did not commit plain error when it found that Bar-ny\u2019s alert in this case was sufficiently reliable to provide probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
