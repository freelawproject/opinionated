His subsequent motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 failed. Incarcerated at a federal facility in Fort Worth, Texas, he appeals the dismissal, in the Northern District of Texas, of his petition for habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The Supreme Court held recently that \u201cany fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury\u201d. <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). Alsop contends his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced based on judicial fact-finding regarding the amount of crack cocaine involved in his offense, which increased his mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error; its legal conclusions, <em>de novo. E.g., Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005). The primary means of collaterally attacking a federal conviction and sentence is provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). That motion must be filed in the sentencing court. <em>Id. </em>A federal prisoner also may attack the validity of his conviction through a \u00a7 2241 petition, pursuant to \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d, if he can show the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see, e.g., Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426. Petitioner bears the burden of showing the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate or ineffective. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). A petitioner who wishes to proceed under the savings clause must establish his claim: (1) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been <em>convicted </em>of a nonexistent offense\u201d; and (2) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 904 (emphasis added). \u201cOnly the custodial court has the jurisdiction to determine whether a petitioner\u2019s claims are properly brought under \u00a7 2241 via the savings clause of \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">Alsop does not claim he is actually innocent of his four-count conviction. Instead, he claims his sentence was improperly enhanced based on the district court\u2019s fact-findings, particularly the calculation of the amount of crack cocaine involved in his offense. That claim goes to the validity of the <em>sentence, </em>not the conviction, and thus \u201cdoes not amount to a claim that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense as required by the <em>Reyes-Requena </em>savings clause test\u201d.' <em>Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.2002) (addressing a \u00a7 2241 petition based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)). Accordingly, <em>Alleyne </em>is not a retroactively applicable Supreme Court opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ion indicating AIsop was convicted of a nonexistent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
