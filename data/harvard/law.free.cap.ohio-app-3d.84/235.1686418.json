The following facts were adduced at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Det. Hancock testified he was a twenty-year veteran of the Cleveland Police Department and a thirteen-year member of the department\u2019s strike force. He further stated he had made over one thousand drug arrests in his career as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Det. Hancock testified that at approximately 5:00 p.m. on July 25, 1991, he and two other officers were patrolling a Cleveland Metropolitan Housing Authority project known as the \u201cWilson Estates.\u201d He testified he and the other officers were on a <em>routine patrol </em>of the area, which is known as an \u201cextremely high crime area of prostitution, drugs, assaults, even homicides.\u201d He further stated they patrolled the area \u201cat least once, if not many times during our shift\u201d and that it was an \u201call black area.\u201d Det. Hancock also testified he was sitting in the rear passenger seat of the unmarked police car<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that he and his colleagues were in plainclothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Det. Hancock testified the police car had just turned into Chester Court from East 55th Street. As the officers pulled into a parking lot adjoining a courtyard, \u201cwhich is like the main hub of activity in that area,\u201d they observed a young white male, defendant Richard Nealen herein, who was coming from the courtyard and approaching a parked car. Det. Hancock stated the following concerning what transpired thereafter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">\u201cWe then drove to where the car was. As the male was attempting to enter his car, <em>we identified ourselves as policemen, and asked him what he was doing </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">\u201cAt that time, we observed that he had his left hand closed in a tight fist. <em>We asked him what he had in his hand? He then attempted to enter the car, </em>and we [sic, he] put his hand on, like you call the door jamb, and a rock of cocaine popped out onto the ground, and one popped out onto the driver\u2019s seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-12\">\u201cWe then exited our police vehicle. I retrieved the rock of suspected crack cocaine that fell to the ground. Detective Tim asked the male to step out of the car. He retrieved the rock that was on the driver\u2019s side that had fallen inside the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u201cAt that time Mr. Nealen was placed under arrest for VDSL, and read his rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: For what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: For violation of Drug State Law. He was read his rights and placed in the car. Prior to being placed in his car, he was given a search for weapons and other contraband, and found to have a crack pipe in his, I think he was wearing shorts, in his shorts\u2019 pocket. That\u2019s about the end of that. We towed his car and took him back to the station and booked him for drugs.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Det. Hancock stated that at no time prior to the inadvertent \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the suspected rocks of cocaine did the officers exit their car, display any type of threatening gestures, or attempt to restrain defendant\u2019s freedom of movement. However, he did state that the officers approached defendant because they had a \u201csuspicion\u201d and that defendant \u201ctended to stick out in that area a little bit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Defendant was thereafter indicted by the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury on a one-count indictment alleging violation of R.C. 2925.11, drug abuse, <em>viz., </em>possession of cocaine in less than the bulk amount. Defendant pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence on the basis that the officers lacked probable cause to justify their \u201cinvestigatory stop and subsequent search and seizure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The trial court held a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. Following Det. Hancock\u2019s testimony and the arguments of counsel, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and ordered defendant discharged, stating the basis of its decision thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">\u201cI don\u2019t believe that the facts as asserted by the police officer \u2014 well, I understand what he did and why he did it \u2014 justify any intrusion into the privacy of this Defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">The state has filed a timely appeal of the trial court\u2019s order pursuant to Grim.R. 12(J) and presents the following as its sole assignment of error for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in suppressing evidence that was discovered prior to when the suspect was stopped within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">This assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">The state argues there was no \u201cinvestigatory stop\u201d in the case <em>sub judice; </em>therefore, defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights could not have been violated by the actions of the police officers toward him. This argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The salient facts of the case as stated in the testimony of Det. Hancock are the following: (1) the police officers were on <em>routine patrol; </em>(2) the police officers were in a \u201cblack neighborhood\u201d; (3) the police saw defendant, a white male, going toward his car with \u201chis left hand closed in a tight fist\u201d; (4) the officers approached defendant on a <em>suspicion; </em>(5) the officers identified themselves as policemen; (6) the officers asked defendant \u201cwhat he was doing\u201d; (7) the officers asked defendant \u201cwhat he had in his hand\u201d; (8) defendant then accidentally dropped two rocks of cocaine. These words, \u201cpolice,\u201d \u201cwhat are you doing,\u201d and \u201cwhat do you have in your hand,\u201d denote an investigatory stop. The police wanted an answer; otherwise, they would not have asked the questions after identifying themselves as policemen. The foregoing facts clearly demonstrate a complete absence of \u201carticulable facts\u201d upon which to base an approach or stop of defendant. Defendant was doing nothing wrong. Since Det. Hancock\u2019s stop of defendant was unreasonable, it constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights; therefore, the evidence thus obtained, <em>viz., </em>the rocks of cocaine which \u201cpopped out\u201d of defendant\u2019s hand as he attempted to enter his vehicle, was properly suppressed as the \u201cfruit of a poisonous tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In relevant part, Det. Hancock\u2019s testimony on cross-examination follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\u201cQ: Is there any \u2014 what observable facts did you observe that would lead you to believe that my client was up to criminal behavior?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201cA: Things did not fit, all right. We had a <em>suspicion </em>that maybe something was going wrong. Ninety-five percent of our work is, there\u2019s a suspicion of something going wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">\u201cQ: So there were no facts, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">\u201cA: <em>No, it was just our suspicion.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\"><em>a </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: You weren\u2019t investigating a particular offense, per se?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: No, we were not there for any specific purpose, other than to just see what we can see.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">Furthermore, in addition to the lack of \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d upon which to base the initial approach of defendant in the case <em>sub judice, </em>Det. Hancock asked defendant what defendant\u2019s purpose was for being in the neighborhood. A reasonable person could assume he was not free to leave at this point. Consequently, it is clear Det. Hancock conducted an \u201cinvestigative stop\u201d of defendant. <em>Brown v. Texas </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 47, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">On this issue, the Supreme Court stated the following in <em>State v. Andrews </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 86, 87-88, 565 N.E.2d 1271, 1273-1274:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u201cIn <em>Terry [v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889], the United States Supreme Court held that a police officer may stop and investigate unusual behavior, even without probable cause to arrest, <em>when he reasonably concludes that the individual is engaged in criminal activity. In assessing that conclusion, the officer \u2018must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion. </em>\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 21-22 [88 S.Ct. at 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d at 906]. Furthermore, the standard against which the facts are judged must be an objective one: \u2018[W]ould the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure or the search \u201cwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 that the action taken was appropriate?\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 21-22 [88 S.Ct. at 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d at 906].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">\u201c * * * [C]ourts have concluded that <em>an objective and particularized suspicion that criminal activity was afoot must be based on the entire picture </em>\u2014 a <em>totality of the surrounding circumstances. Id. [United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411] at 417-418 [101 S.Ct. 690, 694-695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621, 628-629]; <em>State v. Bobo </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 177, 524 N.E.2d 489; <em>United States v. Rickus </em>(C.A.3, 1984), 737 F.2d 360, 365. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\n<em>a % * *</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">\u201c * * * An area\u2019s reputation for criminal activity is an articulable fact which is a <em>part </em>of the totality of circumstances surrounding a stop to investigate suspicious behavior. Bobo, <em>supra, </em>at 179, 524 N.E.2d at 491; <em>[State v.] Freeman </em>[64 Ohio St.2d 291, 18 O.O.3d 291, 414 N.E.2d 1044], <em>supra. </em>See, also, <em>United States v. Magda </em>(C.A.2, 1976), 547 F.2d 756, 758; certiorari denied (1977), 434 U.S. 878 [98 S.Ct. 230, 54 L.Ed.2d 157].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, \u201cthe area\u2019s reputation for criminal activity\u201d is the <em>only </em>articulable fact Det. Hancock could point to in order to justify the officers\u2019 approach. The facts that defendant was white and was \u201cclenching his fist\u201d are insufficient to support a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d defendant \u201cmight be engaged in criminal activity.\u201d Cf. <em>State v. Bobo </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 177, 524 N.E.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Indeed, the facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>are similar to those faced by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Brown v. Texas, supra. </em>In <em>Brown, </em>appellant was arrested after refusing to identify himself to a police officer who had stopped appellant as he was walking in an alley in a \u201chigh crime area\u201d because he \u201clooked suspicious.\u201d In overturning appellant\u2019s conviction, the Supreme Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">\u201cThe flaw in the State\u2019s case is that none of the circumstances preceding the officers\u2019 detention of appellant justified a reasonable suspicion that he was involved in criminal conduct. Officer Venegas testified at appellant\u2019s trial that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the situation in the alley \u2018looked suspicious,\u2019 but he was unable to point to any facts supporting that conclusion. There is no indication in the record that it was unusual for people to be in the alley. <em>The fact that appellant was in a neighborhood frequented by drug users, standing alone, is not a basis for concluding that appellant himself was engaged in criminal conduct. </em>In short, the appellant\u2019s activity was no different from the activity of other pedestrians in that neighborhood. When pressed, Officer Venegas acknowledged that the only reason he stopped appellant was to ascertain his identity. The record suggests an understandable desire to assert a police presence; however, that purpose does not negate Fourth Amendment guarantees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">\u201cIn the absence of any basis for suspecting appellant of misconduct, the balance between the public interest and appellant\u2019s right to personal security and privacy tilts in favor of freedom from police interference.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>443 U.S. at 51-52, 99 S.Ct. at 2641, 61 L.Ed.2d at 362-363.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Furthermore, this is the law as articulated by the Ohio Supreme Court as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The facts of <em>State v. Williams </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 58, 554 N.E.2d 108, upon which the state relies in its brief to this court, are inapposite to those of the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Williams, </em>Deputy Sheriff Garst was <em>investigating a complaint of a possible theft </em>of produce from a rural garden. When the deputy arrived at the property, he proceeded to walk down a path past some fields; eventually he discovered <em>marijuana plants growing </em>on the property. Garst then returned to his vehicle and radioed for assistance. As he waited, he proceeded to investigate the property further. During that time, defendant Williams arrived at the property and parked his truck behind Garst\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Garst soon thereafter saw defendant Williams, approached him, and asked Williams what he was doing there. Williams\u2019 response, <em>viz., </em>that he was there to squirrel hunt, <em>aroused Garst\u2019s suspicions </em>since it was not squirrel hunting season and Williams was not carrying a gun. At that point, Garst asked Williams to accompany him back to his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"AI\">When they arrived at Garst\u2019s vehicle, Garst patted Williams down and found a knife and several .22 caliber shells. When Garst asked Williams where the gun was, Williams said it was in his truck. Garst thereupon walked over to the truck and saw the gun through the window. Williams was subsequently indicted for and convicted of having a weapon while under a disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">On these facts, the Supreme Court of Ohio held Williams\u2019 motion to suppress evidence was properly denied by the trial court. It is clear that <em>prior to Garst\u2019s approach </em>of Williams, Garst could point to several \u201cspecific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts,\u201d reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>warranted an intrusion into Williams\u2019 privacy. <em>Id. </em>Garst had received a complaint of criminal activity, and had seen evidence thereof in the form of growing marijuana plants and a path which led to them. Thus, when Garst saw Williams, he could reasonably inquire as to Williams\u2019 purpose for being on the property. In contrast, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>there were <em>no </em>facts justifying an intrusion into defendant\u2019s privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The state also cites <em>Michigan v. Chesternut </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 567, 108 S.Ct. 1975, 100 L.Ed.2d 565, in support of its argument that the police actions in the case <em>sub judice </em>were reasonable. Once again, however, the facts of <em>Chestemut </em>are distinguishable from those of the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANN\">In <em>Chestemut, </em>some police officers on routine patrol saw a man exit a car and approach Chestemut. When Chestemut saw the officers\u2019 patrol car, he turned and began to run. The officers followed Chestemut \u201cto see where he was going,\u201d caught up with him and drove alongside him for a short distance. The officers neither attempted to stop defendant nor made any inquiries of him. The officers then observed Chestemut pull a number of packets from his pocket and discard them. The officers stopped, and one officer retrieved the packets. The packets contained pills which, from that officer\u2019s experience, appeared to be narcotics. Chestemut, who had stopped running, was thereupon arrested for possession of narcotics; a later search of Chesternut\u2019s person revealed more narcotics and paraphernalia. Subsequently, Chestemut moved to suppress the evidence obtained by the officers on Fourth Amendment grounds. The trial court granted Chesternut\u2019s motion, and the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">On appeal to the United States Supreme Court, the decisions of the Michigan courts were reversed. The Supreme Court stated its rationale thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">\u201cIn <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>the Court noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">\u201c \u2018Obviously, not all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves \u201cseizures\u201d of persons. Only when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a \u201cseizure\u201d has occurred.\u2019 392 U.S., at 19 [88 S.Ct. at 1879, 20 L.Ed.2d at 905], n. 16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">\u201cA decade later in <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>Justice Stewart, writing for himself and then Justice Rehnquist, first transposed this analysis into a <em>test to be applied in determining whether \u2018a person has been \u201cseized\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth </em>Amendment.\u2019 446 U.S. [544], at 554 [100 S.Ct. 1870, at 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497, at 509 (1980)]. [Footnote omitted.] The test provides that the <em>police can be said to have seized an individual \u2018only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have be</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>lieved that he was not free to leave.\u2019 Ibid. </em>The Court has since embraced this test. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\"><em>it </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">\u201c * * * The test\u2019s objective standard \u2014 looking to the reasonable man\u2019s interpretation of the conduct in question \u2014 allows the police to determine in advance whether the conduct contemplated will implicate the Fourth Amendment. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u201cApplying the Court\u2019s test to the facts of this case, we conclude that <em>respondent was not seized by the police before he discarded the packets </em>containing the controlled substance. * * * [T]he police conduct involved here would not have communicated to the reasonable person an attempt to capture or otherwise intrude upon respondent\u2019s freedom of movement. [Footnote omitted.] The record does not reflect that the police activated a siren or flashers; or that they commanded respondent to halt, or displayed any weapons; or that they operated the ear in an aggressive manner to block respondent\u2019s course or otherwise control the direction or speed of his movement. * * * While the very presence of a police car driving parallel to a running pedestrian could be somewhat intimidating, this kind of police presence does not, standing alone, constitute a seizure. [Footnote omitted.] * * * Without more, <em>the police conduct here </em>\u2014 a brief acceleration to catch up with respondent, followed by a short drive alongside <em>him </em>\u2014 was <em>not \u2018so intimidating\u2019 that respondent could reasonably have believed that he was not free to disregard the police presence and go about his business. </em>[Citation omitted.] The <em>police therefore were not required to have \u2018a particularized and objective basis for suspecting [respondent] of criminal activity,\u2019 </em>in order to pursue him. [Citation omitted.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>486 U.S. at 573-576, 108 S.Ct. at 1979-1981, 100 L.Ed.2d at 571-573.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In <em>Chestemut, </em>therefore, the officers never \u201cseized\u201d defendant, they merely followed him; furthermore, defendant voluntarily threw away the contraband while he was running. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, the officers <em>drove up to </em>defendant, <em>identified </em>themselves as <em>policemen, asked him what he was doing </em>and <em>what he had in his hand. </em>Clearly, the police presence was intimidating, they expected an answer, and a reasonable person could assume he was not free to leave until the officers were satisfied with a response. Moreover, at that point defendant <em>accidentally </em>dropped the contraband; it was not a voluntary act, but occurred only after the officers\u2019 stop and interrogation of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">In <em>State v. Chatton </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 59, 11 OBR 250, 463 N.E.2d 1237, the Ohio Supreme Court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">\u201cIt is firmly established that the detention of an individual by a law enforcement officer must, at the very least, be justified by \u2018specific and articulable facts\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>indicating that the detention was reasonable. <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 21-22 [88 S.Ct. 1868, 1880-1881, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 906-907, 44 O.O.2d 383] * * *[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">\n<em>a * * *</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201cIn <em>Brown v.

That being so, the trial court properly granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Accordingly, the state\u2019s assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">The judgment of the trial court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b273-13\">Harper and Krupansky, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b273-14\">Nahra, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-13\">.

He stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-18\">\u201cAs we pulled into the parking lot, which adjoins a courtyard, which is like the main hub of activity in that area, we observed a male coming from the courtyard approaching a Pontiac automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-19\">\u201cWe then drove to where the car was.

We asked him what he had in his hand? <em>He then attempted to enter the car, </em>and we <em>[sic, </em>he] put his hand on, like you call the doorjamb, and a rock of cocaine popped out onto the ground, and one popped out onto the driver\u2019s seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u201cWe then exited our police vehicle. I retrieved the rock of suspected crack cocaine that fell to the ground. Detective Tim asked the male to step out of the car. He retrieved the rock that was on the driver\u2019s side that had fallen inside the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">\u201cAt that time Mr. Nealen was placed under arrest for VSDL, and read his rights.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Hancock also testified that the police officers did not get out of their vehicle, did not display any weapons, and did not touch Nealen in any way.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">\u201cAn arrest requires <em>either </em>physical force * * * <em>or, </em>where that is absent, <em>submission </em>to the assertion of authority.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) California v. Hodari D. </em>(1991), 499 U.S. ---, ---, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 1551, 113 L.Ed.2d 690, 697-698. See, also, <em>State v. Smith </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 255, 544 N.E.2d 239, reversed on other grounds (1990), 494 U.S. 541, 110 S.Ct. 1288, 108 L.Ed.2d 464 (no seizure took place where police asked Smith to \u201ccome over here a minute\u201d but did not display weapons, did not threaten Smith, and did not touch Smith or block his exit).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">In this case, Nealen did not stop when the police asked him questions, but continued to get into his car. At that point, when reaching into his car, he dropped the rocks of cocaine. Since the initial encounter with police lacked physical force, and since. Nealen did not submit but continued on his way, the encounter was not a seizure and did not require reasonable suspicion pursuant to <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889. Nealen\u2019s subsequent arrest was not based on the fact that he was a white man in an all-black, high-crime neighborhood, but was based on the rocks of cocaine that he dropped. Therefore, no Fourth Amendment violations occurred, and the motion to suppress should have been denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
