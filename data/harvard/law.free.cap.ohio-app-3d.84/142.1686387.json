Baldwin, to Metro Hospital on 1/25/87 at approximately 1:30 a.m. from 4515 Clark Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio for gunshot injury. * * * THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR MEDICAL RECORDS, ONLY GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF INJURY AND DESCRIPTION OF PATIENT. PLEASE INCLUDE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BULLETS REMOVED AND NOT REMOVED BY YOUR HOSPITAL.\u201d (Capitalization in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The hospital has filed five sets of copies of records for individualized scrutiny. A review of these records reflects that, on January 25,1987, Cleveland Emergency Medical Service (\u201cEMS\u201d) transported Baldwin to the hospital where he arrived at 1:35 a.m. Both the emergency room report and the report by the EMS team which transported Neil S. Baldwin to the hospital were generated while Baldwin was alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The hospital contends that these documents are medical records.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">\u201cA medical record is \u2018any document or combination of documents, except births, deaths, and the fact of admission to or discharge from a hospital, that pertains to the medical history, diagnosis, prognosis, or medical condition of a patient and that is generated and maintained in the process of medical treatment.\u2019 R.C. 149.43(A)(3). Record III \u2014 12 is the five-page Mt. Sinai Hospital Emergency Room Record of Alfred McClairin, which depicts his medical condition and treatment and is therefore excepted from disclosure. Records X \u2014 31-32 are Emergency Medical Service\u2019s run sheets indicating barely legible medical conditions and treatment, which also are exempted from disclosure.\u201d <em>State ex rel.

We are compelled to hold that the hospital has properly refused to release the reports relator seeks because they are medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Accordingly, relator\u2019s request for relief in mandamus is denied.
