Sweeney, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">Defendant-appellant James J. Brown was tried to the bench and convicted on six counts, each with specifications. Appellant was convicted of aggravated burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.11; grand theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02; two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>counts of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11; failure to comply with order or signal of police officer in violation of R.C. 2921.331; and possession of criminal tools in violation of R.C. 2923.24. The appellant was sentenced to a term of incarceration of ten to twenty-five years, with ten years of actual incarceration on counts one, three, four and five; one and one-half to five years on count two; two to ten years on count six; all to run concurrently. Execution was suspended only on count five.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The state presented the testimony of Ms. Kim Wharton, who resided at the Village-in-the-Park Apartments in Westlake, Ohio. Wharton testified that on January 31, 1990, she was in her bedroom when she heard noises on her patio. By peeking around a doorway, she observed a man breaking into her apartment. Wharton exited through the front door and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Patrolman Patrick E. Kelly testified that he responded to the police broadcast. Upon arrival at the apartment complex he saw appellant walking quickly toward a white car. Although the officer requested the appellant to stop, the appellant entered the car and drove away. The court also heard the testimony of two other police officers, Richard Papes and Charles Bronston, that appellant led a high speed chase through Westlake, Bay Village, Rocky River, Lakewood, and Cleveland. These officers testified that while they were in pursuit, appellant swerved his vehicle in an effort to force each of them off the road. Appellant eventually was apprehended near West 103rd Street in Cleveland. Appellant was transported back to the apartment complex, where Wharton identified him by his clothing as the intruder.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The trial of this matter did not occur until a year after the appellant\u2019s arrest. The victim\u2019s jewelry was found in the appellant\u2019s jacket, which had been held in the Westlake Police Department\u2019s property room for the one-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The appellant testified on his own behalf. Appellant testified that he has a long history of arrests, mostly burglaries, but that he also had a history of cooperating with police, admitting when he committed a crime, returning stolen articles, and helping the police \u201cclear up\u201d other burglaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">In mid-January 1990, appellant was released from prison on prior charges. Upon release, appellant testified that he decided to \u201ctalk to his mother,\u201d and took a cab to Lakewood. He went to a gas station, near the police station, and sat in the back corner lot for some time. He then went back downtown and took a bus to Mansfield. The next week he returned to Cleveland with his cousins, where they engaged in drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">When questioned more closely about January 31, 1990, the appellant testified that he spent the previous evening in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, with his wife. After an argument, he took her car and drove to Cleveland to visit his cousin. After more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>drug abuse, he drove to Lakewood, and dropped his cousin off at a \u201cdope\u201d house. He discovered that he was near the gas station and pulled in. He sat on the corner and \u201ctalked to his mother.\u201d Appellant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">\u201cQ. You feel your mother is buried on that property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">\u201cA. I talked to you about it. I tried to get somebody \u2014 the people here to get the Lakewood police to dig up the files to let me take her. I know she\u2019s been there a long, long time. For some reason it doesn\u2019t bother me. Now she is not buried. It is not proper. She don\u2019t want to be there. I have to put her someplace. I don\u2019t want to put her in \u2014 I want to put her in North Royalton. There is a good cemetery there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">\u201cQ. What happened with you at the gas station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">\u201cA. Me and mom talked quite a while. It was a chilly day. It was sunny out, and I just sat there and talked. I don\u2019t remember what all we talked about, but I got mad. I was getting mad at my mom said, I need to get a shovel, either find a shovel or buy a shovel. I didn\u2019t have a shovel in the car. The best thing I had was screwdrivers, tools. I didn\u2019t have a crowbar. In that type of car you have to crank it, so I got in the car. I started driving out on Detroit. I drove way out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">\u201cQ. Do you remember driving way out on Detroit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">\u201cA. I remember going past the Lakewood Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">\u201cQ. Do you remember anything after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-12\">\u201cA. Not much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-13\">\u201cQ. Do you remember getting into Westlake?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-14\">\u201cA. I remember going all the way out towards \u2014 passed around Avon, somewhere. I have cousins that live out there, too, and they live in a place called Sheffield Lake. I remember going that direction. I never made it to their house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-15\">\u201cQ. What is the next thing you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-16\">\u201cA. Seeing a doctor here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-17\">\u201cQ. When was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-18\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know. Sometime around February. I am not good on dates. I am very bad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-19\">\u201cQ. Would it have been February 1st?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-20\">\u201cA. No. Just a few days before the feds came and got me. They put me on the sixth floor. When everybody comes in here you go through a special interview. I guess I was wired up pretty good. I heard sounds. These people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>realized something was wrong.' He evaluated me. A couple of days later a doctor saw me, and I don\u2019t know what all he prescribed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s at the medical and psychiatric floor, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">\u201cA. Yes, the psychiatric floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">\u201cQ. You were there for 10 to 14 days, would that be fair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">\u201cA. To be honest, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">\u201cQ. It could have been a few days, maybe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s the next thing you remember, talking to a doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">\u201cQ. Do you remember going to an apartment building on Detroit, the apartment that\u2019s been testified to by Kim Wharton and the police officers here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-13\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">As his testimony continued, it was evident that appellant had no recollection of the events at Wharton\u2019s apartment, nor of the high speed chase afterwards. Appellant testified that he is a nonviolent person and that he is a burglar because he cannot face people.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">Appellant was apparently an abused child, and believes his father murdered his mother and buried her at a gas station in Lakewood. Appellant testified that his father is currently incarcerated on child molestation charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-16\">Appellant sets forth four assignments of error, the first three of which will be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-17\">I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-18\">\u201cThe trial court improperly \u2018accepted\u2019 the pychiatric <em>[sic </em>] report finding the appellant sane and thus denied the appellant due process of law and the the <em>[sic </em>] effective assistance of counsel under the U.S. Constitution and O.R.C. 2945.37, <em>et seq\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-19\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-20\">\u201cThe trial court denied the appellant effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and the Ohio Constitution and violated his right to due process as applied to the state by and through the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution when it denied him an independent psychiatric evaluation and accepted the sanity report without counsel\u2019s stipulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u201cFailure of defense counsel to refer the appellant for a psychiatric evaluation for competency and failure to enter a written not guilty by reason of insanity plea constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Throughout all three of these assignments of error, appellant is essentially arguing that he was rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during the pendency of the charges against him. Trial counsel for the appellant was assigned on December 12, 1990, and trial commenced February 11, 1991. No request for a competency hearing was made on the record prior to trial. Neither was a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity entered.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">The test for ineffective assistance of counsel was reiterated by this court in <em>State v. Eberling </em>(Apr. 9, 1992), Cuyahoga App.Nos. 58559 and 58560, unreported, 1992 WL 74227. The court held:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u201cThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that the accused shall enjoy the right to \u2018have the Assistance of Counsel\u2019 in all criminal prosecutions. See, also, Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution. The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel exists, and is needed, in order to protect the fundamental right to a fair trial in that it assures the fairness, and thus, the legitimacy of our adversary process. <em>Powell v. Alabama </em>(1932), 287 U.S. 45 [66, 53 S.Ct. 55, 63, 77 L.Ed. 158, 169]; <em>Johnson v. Zerbst </em>(1938), 304 U.S. 458 [462-463, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1022-1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461, 1465-1466]; <em>Gideon v. Wainwright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335 [342-443, 83 S.Ct. 792, 794-796, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, 804-805]; <em>Kimmelman v. Morrison </em>(1986), 477 U.S. [365, 377-378, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 2584-2585, 91 L.Ed.2d 305, 320-321], The constitutional right to counsel is the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>McMann v. Richardson </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 759, 771 [90 S.Ct. 1441, 1449, 25 L.Ed.2d 763, 773-774].</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">\u201cIn <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693], the Supreme Court of the United States set forth the following two-pronged analysis for determining whether counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective as to require reversal[:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">\u201c [\u2018]First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.!\u2019]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">\u201cIn other words, counsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136 [538 N.E.2d 373], at paragraph two of the syllabus. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The morning of trial in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. We are here on the matter of the State of Ohio, Case No. 249310, versus James Joseph Brown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\u201cWe have received just this morning a sanity report which states that the defendant did not, at the time of the offense, suffer from a mental disease or defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">\u201cIt says he was \u2014 did have a long history of substance abuse and was a product of an abusive environment, but they said he did not suffer from a mental disease or defect at the time of the offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">\u201cYou have anything with regard to that, Mr. Gaunter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\">\u201cMR. GAUNTER: Your Honor, we would request, and we thank the court for the referral to the psychiatric clinic, but we requested that because my client has no recollection of the events surrounding the date of the incident as set forth in the indictment and because of his long history of abuse suffered at the hands of his father, various psychiatric experiences that are detailed by Ms. Haines in the report as set forth by Dr. King; however, your Honor, we would respectfully request of the Court that the Court grant an order for an independent psychiatric evaluation of Mr. Brown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Gorie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\">\u201cMR. GORIE: Your Honor. I object to the referral. I think it would be frivolous. I have no reason to believe the conclusion will be different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. I will overrule the motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">R.C. 2945.37 mandates a hearing on the issue of defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial where the issue is raised before trial, and for good cause shown where raised after trial has begun. The issue of appellant\u2019s competency was never raised, and the discourse above does not constitute a hearing on that issue. From the statements read by the judge, it is evident that the psychiatric evaluation was performed to evaluate the appellant\u2019s sanity at the time the crimes were committed, and not his competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Under the facts and circumstances of this case, it was incumbent upon appellant\u2019s counsel to, at the very least, raise the issue of appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The ultimate irony of this case is that the views of this court are supported by the brief of the prosecution. The state concedes that no plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was entered, nor was a request for a competency hearing made. The appellee\u2019s brief states:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u201cTrial procedures concerning the insanity issues are governed by R.C. 2945.37 through R.C. 2945.40. It should first be noted that, in the instant case, Appellant was not referred for an evaluation for competency to stand trial nor was a written plea of not guilty by reason of insanity entered on his behalf.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">\u201cWhen a defendant is referred for an evaluation of sanity at the time of the act, there is no statutory requirement that a hearing be held on the issue in the absence of a formal plea of not guilty by reason on sanity. Indeed, if the issue of competency (as distinguished from sanity at the time of the act) is raised, R.C. 2945.37 mandates that \u2018the Court shall hold a hearing on the issue as provided in this section.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The prosecution also points out that appellant\u2019s trial counsel made no effort to challenge the psychiatric report that was submitted to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">\u201cThe trial court also gave Appellant\u2019s trial counsel an opportunity to be heard concerning the contents of the report. Appellant\u2019s counsel presumably could have challenged the finding of the report by whatever means he chose, but elected not to do so, instead requesting an independent evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">\u201cIn sum, the trial court although not required to do so, held a hearing on the psychiatric report and gave Appellant\u2019s trial counsel every opportunity to be heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">U \u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s counsel made no request to have the examining psychiatrist testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">We do find it troublesome that the appellant\u2019s counsel did not seek to question the examining psychiatrist as a witness when given an opportunity by the judge to challenge the report. Since the report itself has not been included as part of the record on appeal, we are unable to hold that this particular failure rose to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">However, trial counsel was assigned to represent a man who had no recollection of life for a period of several days, and no recollection of the crimes of which he was accused. His last memory is of speaking to his mother whom he believes is buried at a service station in Lakewood. He recalls the need to find a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>shovel so he can properly bury her at a cemetery in North Royalton. Appellant then \u201cwoke up\u201d in the psychiatric unit of the Cuyahoga County Jail. There is no trial tactic or strategy which would reasonably have led trial counsel under such circumstances to fail to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity on behalf of his client. Until such a plea was entered, the trial judge had no obligation to even consider ordering the requested independent evaluation pursuant to R.C. 2945.39(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">This failure to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity pursuant to Crim.R. 11 falls below an objective standard of reasonable representation. Appellant was prejudiced by the failure of counsel to bring before the court the only possible theory of defense to the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Appellant\u2019s first, second and third assignments of error are well taken, and this case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">IV</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">\u201cThe trial court denied the appellant his right to a speedy trial pursuant to O.R.C. 2941.401 and O.R.C. 2963.30.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">R.C. 2941.401 allows a person serving a term of incarceration to request adjudication on pending charges. The statute, in pertinent part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-11\">\u201cWhen a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of this state, and when during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in this state any untried indictment, information, or complaint against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days <em>after he causes to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and the appropriate court </em>in which the matter is pending, written notice of the place of his imprisonment and a request for a final disposition to be made of the matter, except that for good cause shown in open court, with the prisoner or his counsel present, the court may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The <em>request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the warden or superintendent having custody of the prisoner, </em>stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time served and remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the adult parole authority relating to the prisoner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-12\">\u201cThe written notice and request for final disposition <em>shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden or superintendent having custody of him, who shall promptly forward it with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting attorney and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Although the record reflects a photocopy of a letter sent on April 6, 1990, by the appellant to Prosecutor John T. Corrigan, the prosecutor at trial avowed no knowledge of the letter. The letter states that appellant was in the Franklin County Jail. The docket and court file reflect no receipt of the letter. Assuming the letter was mailed to the prosecutor\u2019s office, the appellant still failed to comply with the other requirements of R.C. 2941.401. The letter was not filed with the court, nor was there a certificate by the warden or superintendent. Both the letter and the accompanying certificate should have been mailed by the warden or superintendent to the prosecutor and to the court by certified mail, return receipt requested. Absent compliance with R.C. 2941.401, the court was not obligated to bring appellant to trial within one hundred eighty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The record does reflect a letter requesting disposition of pending charges received by the trial court on October 25, 1990, from the United States Penitentiary in Terra Haute, Indiana. This letter comports with the requirements of R.C. 2963.30, which essentially mirrors R.C. 2941.401, but applies to prisoners held out of state. Appellant properly invoked his rights, and was brought to trial within the one hundred eighty days set forth in R.C. 2963.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Appellant\u2019s forth assignment of error is overruled. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b453-8\">Blackmon and Krupansky, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
