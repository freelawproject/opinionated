Abele, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">This is an appeal from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered by the Scioto County Common Pleas Court. The jury found Wade Turvey, defendant below and appellant herein, guilty of two counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(3) and one count of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">Appellant assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-14\">First Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-15\">\u201cThe trial court erred by overruling defendant-appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-16\">Second Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-17\">\u201cThe trial court erred by refusing to grant the defendant-appellant\u2019s motion to admit into evidence the audio recording of the defendant-appellant\u2019s statement made to investigator Ken Days and to play the audio recording of the defendant-appellant\u2019s statement to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-18\">Third Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-19\">\u201cThe trial court committed reversible error by improperly admitting hearsay evidence, over the defendant-appellant\u2019s objection, when the trial court permitted Jerri Robinson to testify about a statement made by Tracy Robinson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-20\">Fourth Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>\u201cThe trial court committed reversible error by improperly limiting the defendant-appellant\u2019s cross-examination of investigator Days, thereby denying the defendant-appellant of his right to effectively confront the witnesses against him, in violation of the defendant-appellant\u2019s rights as guaranteed to him by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">Fifth Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">\u201cThe trial court committed reversible error by admitting, over objection, the defendant-appellant\u2019s incriminating statements without any evidence of a corpus delicti.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">Sixth Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-8\">\u201cThe trial court committed reversible error by admitting, over objection, double hearsay testimony during Rolland Williston\u2019s rebuttal testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">Seventh Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-10\">\u201cThe jury\u2019s verdicts relative to Count One and Count Two of the indictment were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">On November 22,1989, the grand jury indicted appellant for one count of gross sexual imposition and one count of rape against his stepdaughter, Tracey Robinson, and one count of gross sexual imposition against her cousin, Jerri Robinson. Both girls were born in 1977. The bill of particulars explained the offenses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-12\">\u201cThe defendant, while picking berries performed cunnilingus upon Tracy Robinson when said victim was in third grade. Since victim was in third grade, the defendant has touched, fondled and licked Tracy Robinson\u2019s breast and vaginal areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-13\">\u201cOn July 29, 1989, and July 30, 1989, defendant fondled Jerri Robinson\u2019s vaginal area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">On August 1, 1989, Jerri\u2019s stepfather complained to the Scioto County Children Services (\u201cSCCS\u201d) about the sexual abuse appellant committed against Jerri. A SCCS caseworker questioned Jerri on August 2, 1989. After Jerri alerted the caseworker to the sexual abuse against Tracey, the caseworker questioned Tracey on August 3, 1989. On August 22, 1989, Scioto County Sheriffs Department Investigator Ken Days questioned appellant. Appellant confessed to the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">The clerk of courts issued a summons on the indictment on November 22, 1989. The summons ordered appellant to appear in court on November 29, 1989. Appellant never received the summons. The summons came back on December 4, 1989 with a notation \u201cnot enough time for service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>No further action appears in the file until March 13,1990, when the prosecutor requested issuance of a warrant to arrest appellant. The March 26, 1990 return of the warrant indicates appellant was arrested on March 23,1990. On March 26, 1990, appellant appeared in court with counsel and pleaded not guilty to the charges in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">On May 29,1990, appellant moved to suppress the audiotaped confession and a written confession he made on August 22, 1989 to Scioto County Sheriffs Department Investigator Ken Days. The court held a hearing on the motion on June 5, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"AhD\">Appellant testified he voluntarily went to talk with Days about the charges on August 22, 1989. Appellant further testified that when Days advised him of his right to an attorney, appellant said, \u201cWell, get him in here.\u201d Days did not find appellant an attorney or cease questioning appellant. Appellant contends Days threatened to put appellant\u2019s stepdaughter in a home if he did not confess to the crimes. Appellant further contends Days acted violently during the questioning-jumping up, scooting chairs around in the room, and hitting a table. Appellant\u2019s wife, who was present during some of the questioning, corroborated the bulk of appellant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel asked the court to listen to the entire one-hour-and-twenty-minute audiotape of the confession, arguing in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">\u201cI have had the tape analyzed. It is turned off approximately eight times during the confession. There are conversations that went on while the tape recorder was turned off, and it was turned back on. I can point out \u2014 I can prove that my client can\u2019t read or write, so Mr. Days is writing this down, and reading it back to him. Mr. Days left out words that my client said that went to the heart of what this case is going to be about.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The court listened to a portion of the audiotaped confession. That portion spans pages eighteen through thirty-seven of the motion to suppress hearing transcript. On the last of those pages, appellant\u2019s counsel interrupted the audiotape to make a point. After some discussion among counsel, the court expressed reluctance about listening to the remaining portions of the audiotape. The court indicated it would prefer to listen to live testimony by appellant\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">The record transmitted on appeal does not contain a complete copy of the audiotape. We have only the nineteen pages of the motion to suppress hearing transcript containing the portion of the audiotape played in court. In that portion, Days asked appellant questions and discussed the <em>Miranda </em>rights contained on the written statement form. Appellant contends that portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>audiotape demonstrates Days led appellant to believe that by confessing to the crimes, appellant would receive \u201chelp\u201d and would not be sent to prison:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">\u201cQ. When these things happened, what were you trying to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">\u201cA. I was just \u2014 I just, you know, needed affection, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">\u201cQ. You needed affection, or you were trying to show them affection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">\u201cA. Trying to show them affection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">\u201cQ. Do you understand this is the wrong way to do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-10\">\u201cA. Yeah, I understand that now, and that\u2019s the reason <em>I was wanting to go to the doctors and stuff to get some help.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">\u00ab \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-12\">\u201cA. There was something else I was wanting you to put on there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-13\">\u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-14\">\u201cA. <em>You was [sic] telling me that you knowed [sic] that I wasn\u2019t no [sic] crazy person or psychiatric person or anything like that, and the last thing we need is somebody else in prison.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-15\">\u201cQ. Okay. You and I were discussing whether somebody was crazy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-16\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-17\">\u201cQ. Whether you were crazy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-18\">\u201cA. <em>And the last thing that you need is somebody else in prison. The only thing that I need is some help, and that\u2019s why I an here, just asking the judge for some help.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-19\">\u201cQ. Okay. What do you want some help for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-20\">\u201cA. I want some help to make sure this ain\u2019t going to happen again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-21\">\u00ab sH * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-22\">\u201cQ. * * * Who decides whether you get some help or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-23\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The judge will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-24\">\u201cQ. All right. Is there any doubt in you mind about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-25\">\u201cA No, there ain\u2019t no doubt in my mind. I believe he will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-26\">Days testified appellant did <em>not </em>request an attorney. Days further testified he did not threaten appellant during the questioning. Days noted he went to great lengths to tell appellant that neither Days nor the prosecutor\u2019s office could get appellant any \u201chelp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-27\">The court overruled appellant\u2019s motion to suppress and tried the matter to a jury. The first witness was the SCCS caseworker who interviewed Jerri on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>August 2, 1989, and Tracey on August 3, 1989 about the incidents. The caseworker testified the interviews substantiated the complaints she had received about the sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Jerri testified consistent with the bill of particulars. She noted that when she spent the night with her cousin Tracey near the end of July 1989, she woke up during the night to find appellant fondling her vagina. Jerri slapped appellant and he left the room. After Jerri told Tracey what happened, Tracey told Jerri that appellant had fondled Tracey, too.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">When Tracey testified, she denied having Jerri spend the night, denied telling Jerri that appellant fondled her, and recanted what she told the caseworker about the sexual abuse. Tracey testified she is currently living with appellant. Tracey further testified she lied about the sexual abuse because appellant \u201cwhipped me all of the time, and he made me work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Days testified that appellant confessed to the crimes. Days denied threatening appellant at the time of the confession. During cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel asked Days whether he is presently barred from the Scioto County Jail. The prosecutor objected, claiming the question was irrelevant. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued the question is relevant because issues have been raised about the way Day interrogates inmates and other people suspected of committing crimes. The court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Appellant called various witnesses to the stand to testify about possible reasons why false allegations might have been made against him. Appellant caught his wife in bed with another man just two days before the allegations. Animosity exists between appellant and Jerri\u2019s stepfather, the man who made the sexual abuse complaint. One caseworker testified that when she interviewed Tracey at school, Tracey said no abuse ever occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Appellant testified he was taking Valiums at the time he confessed. He further testified he confessed after Days threatened to take his stepdaughter away if he did not confess. On cross-examination, appellant acknowledged he managed to deny some of the allegations Days made during the interview. Appellant further acknowledged that his family was separated at that point not due to the sexual abuse allegations, but rather due to his wife\u2019s adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Appellant\u2019s counsel moved the court to admit the audiotaped confession into evidence. The court overruled the motion, noting that if the audiotape is to be used for impeachment, it may only be used if an inconsistency exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">The state presented one witness on rebuttal. Shawnee Mental Health Center Caseworker Rolland Williston testified he talked with appellant\u2019s wife in connection with his counselling of Tracey. Williston testified appellant\u2019s wife told him Tracey had indicated to her that some abuse had occurred. Appellant objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>the testimony as being double hearsay. The court overruled appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The jury found appellant guilty as charged. The court sentenced appellant to two years on each gross sexual imposition conviction and seven to twenty-five years on the rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts the court erred by failing to grant his motion to suppress the written and audiotaped confessions. Appellant argues his testimony demonstrates Days refused his request for an attorney, and Days made inappropriate threats and promises to induce the confession. In particular, appellant argues Days led him to believe that a confession would lead to \u201chelp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">In a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence, the trial court assumes the role of trier of facts and is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and evaluate the credibility of witnesses. <em>State v. Warren </em>(Aug. 12, 1991), Hocking App. No. 90CA7, unreported, 1991 WL 156521. Thus, the credibility of witnesses during a motion to suppress evidence hearing is a matter for the trial court. A reviewing court should not disturb the trial court\u2019s findings on the issue of credibility. <em>State v. Fanning </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 1 OBR 57, 437 N.E.2d 583; <em>State v. Tutt </em>(Apr. 14, 1986), Warren App. No. CA85-09-056, unreported, 1986 WL 4506. Accordingly, in our review we are bound to accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>State v. DePalma </em>(Jan. 18, 1991), Ross App. No. 1633, unreported, 1991 WL 13824. Accepting these facts as true, we must independently determine as a matter of law, without deference to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, whether they meet the appropriate legal standard. See <em>State v. Shelpman </em>(May 23, 1991), Ross App. No. 1632, unreported, 1991 WL 87312; <em>State v. Simmons </em>(Aug. 30, 1990), Washington App. No. 89CA18, unreported, 1990 WL 127065.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">It is fundamental that the police must terminate the custodial interrogation of a suspect if the suspect requests the assistance of counsel. <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. Once an individual in custody invokes his right to counsel, the interrogation \u201cmust cease until an attorney is present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See, also, <em>Minnick v. Mississippi </em>(1990), 498 U.S. 146, 111 S.Ct. 486, 112 L.Ed.2d 489. Also, a defendant\u2019s confession must be voluntary, and not the product of improper inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Appellant also cites <em>State v. Edwards </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St.2d 31, 3 O.O.3d 18, 358 N.E.2d 1051, vacated as to death penalty, <em>Edwards v. Ohio </em>(1978), 438 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3147, 57 L.Ed.2d 1155, where the court held at paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">\u201cIn deciding whether a defendant\u2019s confession is involuntarily induced, the court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including age, mentality, and prior criminal experience of the accused; the length, intensity and frequency of interrogation; the existence of physical deprivation or mistreatment; and the existence of threat or inducement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Appellant correctly notes a court must consider the totality of the circumstances when determining whether a confession was voluntary. See, also, <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 81, 571 N.E.2d 97, 112; <em>State v. Brewer </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 50, 58, 549 N.E.2d 491, 499; and <em>State v. Barker </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 135, 7 O.O.3d 213, 372 N.E.2d 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Appellant notes a similarity between the facts in the case <em>sub judice </em>and the facts in <em>State v. Booher </em>(1988), 54 Ohio App.3d 1, 560 N.E.2d 786. In <em>Booher, </em>the trial court considered the undertone of \u201chelp\u201d together with other circumstances and concluded the confession was \u201cnot a product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by the defendant.\u201d The court of appeals affirmed the suppression of Booher\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Appellee agrees courts must examine the totality of the circumstances when determining whether a confession is a product of free will. Appellee notes that although in <em>Booher </em>the police and the prosecutor told the defendant dozens of times that they wanted to help him, in the case <em>sub judice </em>the trial court found Days made no such representations or promises to appellant. Appellee further notes Days told appellant that only the judge can decide what happens.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">In <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 123, 22 OBR 199, 202, 489 N.E.2d 277, 279, the court emphasized that appellate courts must defer conflicts in the evidence to the trier of fact who had the opportunity to hear the witnesses and observe their demeanor. The court wrote at 123, 22 OBR at 202, 489 N.E.2d at 280:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">\u201cThe choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>conflicting evidence was adduced at the suppression hearing. The investigating officer testified appellant did not request the assistance of counsel. The investigating officer also told appellant that only the judge can decide what happens. Accordingly, we must defer to the trial court\u2019s choice to believe the investigating officer that appellant did not request counsel. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s confession was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>In <em>State v. Dailey </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 88, 91-92, 559 N.E.2d 459, 463, the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">\u201cA suspect\u2019s decision to waive his Fifth Amendment privilege is made voluntarily absent evidence that his will was overborne and his capacity for self-determination was critically impaired because of coercive police conduct. <em>Colorado v. Spring </em>[1987], <em>supra, </em>479 U.S. [564] at 574, 107 S.Ct. [851] at 857 [93 L.Ed.2d 954 at 965]. See, also, <em>State v. Black </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 262, 2 O.O.3d 422, 358 N.E.2d 551, paragraph four of the syllabus, vacated in part (1978), 438 U.S. 910, 98 S.Ct. 3134, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154. Thus, coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to finding that a confession is not voluntary within the Fifth Amendment, on which <em>Miranda </em>was based. <em>Colorado v. Connelly (1986), 479 </em>U.S. 157, 170, 107 S.Ct. 515, 523-24, 93 L.Ed.2d 473.\u201d See, also, <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 544 N.E.2d 895.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">When we view the totality of the circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s confession, we find no evidence that \u201cappellant\u2019s will was overborne or his capacity for self-determination impaired.\u201d We find no threats or promises made by Days which require the conclusion that appellant\u2019s confession was the product of improper inducement. Again, during the interrogation appellant acknowledged he understood the judge could decide whether he would receive any \u201chelp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Therefore, we believe the evidence reveals appellant made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his constitutional rights. We find appellant\u2019s statements were properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">In his second assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court erred by refusing to admit the audiotape into evidence and by refusing to play the entire audiotape to the jury. Appellant contends the court should not have permitted the prosecutor to use only the written form of his confession, but should have admitted the entire confession \u2014 both the four-page written portion and the eighty-minute audiotaped portion. Appellant argues the audiotape is the best evidence of the confession. Appellant further argues the audiotape would have demonstrated to the jury that appellant was confused and uncertain during the confession, and would have demonstrated to the jury that Days suggested to appellant that the court would treat him leniently.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">Appellee contends the court correctly refused to admit the audiotape unless appellant could demonstrate the audiotape was inconsistent with the written confession. Appellant did not demonstrate that any inconsistencies exist. Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>lee notes the court permitted appellant to cross-examine Days about the confession, and permitted appellant to present impeachment evidence. -</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">We agree with appellee that the written confession and the audiotaped confession are not two parts of the same confession. Appellant was well aware that he was making a written confession, and he was well aware that he was making an audiotaped confession. Each confession is complete by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Appellant argues Evid.R. 1002, the best evidence rule, requires admission of the audiotape. We disagree. The rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">\u201cTo prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is required, except as otherwise provided in these rules or by statute enacted by the General Assembly not in conflict with a rule of the Supreme Court of Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The rule would apply if the state was attempting \u201cto prove the content of a writing,, recording, or photograph.\u201d In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, the state made no attempt to prove what was on the audiotape. Rather, the state presented Days\u2019 testimony about the confession, and presented the written confession itself. Neither Days\u2019 testimony nor the written confession was dependent upon the existence of the audiotaped confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">We recently encountered this issue in <em>State v. Waughtel </em>(Oct. 23, 1991), Scioto App. No. 90 CA 1918, unreported, 1991 WL 224182. We held, in essence, that a litigant cannot invoke Evid.R. 1002 unless the opposing party is attempting to prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph. In <em>Waughtel </em>we noted the federal counterpart to Evid.R. 1002 has been interpreted in a similar manner. See 11 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice (1989) X-10, Section 1002.02; <em>Meyers v. United States </em>(D.C.Cir.1948), 171 F.2d 800, 812. We also noted that other states have reached similar conclusions. See, <em>e.g., McElroy v. Brisco </em>(Miss.1985), 479 So.2d 706, 709; <em>People v. Kulwin </em>(1951), 102 Cal.App.2d 104, 107-108, 226 P.2d 672, 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">In his third assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court improperly admitted hearsay evidence when it permitted Jerri to testify that Tracey told Jerri that appellant had fondled Tracey, too. Appellant asserts the admission of the statement \u201cdirectly impacted on appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence on one of the charges of gross sexual imposition.\u201d The court agreed with appellee that Jerri\u2019s testimony falls within Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c). The rule excludes certain statements from the definition of \u201chearsay\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>\u201c(D) Statements which are not hearsay. A statement is not hearsay if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-4\">\u201c(1) Prior statement by witness. <em>The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination </em>concerning the statement, <em>and the statement is </em>* * * <em>(c) one of identification </em>of a person soon after perceiving him, if the circumstances demonstrate the reliability of the prior identification.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In order for Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) to apply, the declarant must testify at trial and be subject to cross-examination concerning the statement. Additionally, the statement must be one of \u201cidentification of a person\u201d- and must have been made \u201csoon after perceiving\u201d the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant argues that the declarant, Tracey, had not yet testified at trial when the court admitted the identification statement. We know Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) permits identification statements only when the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination. One critical question in this assignment of error is whether the declarant must testify <em>before </em>the identification statement may be admitted, or if the prosecutor\u2019s promise that Tracey would testify later during the trial was sufficient to permit admission of the identification statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">In <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 545 N.E.2d 1220, modified by <em>State v. Dever </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 401, 596 N.E.2d 436,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court commented on Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c). The court\u2019s comments indicate trial courts may now admit identification statements even if the declarant has not yet testified at trial. The <em>Boston </em>court wrote 46 Ohio St.3d at 124, 545 N.E.2d at 1236:</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">\u201cThe Staff Note to Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) indicates that this rule extends the principle recognized in Ohio in <em>State v. Lancaster </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 83, 54 O.O.2d 222, 267 N.E.2d 291. Paragraph five of the syllabus in <em>Lancaster </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-9\">\u201c \u2018Prior identification of the accused may be shown by the testimony of the identifier, or by the testimony of a third person to whom or in whose presence the identification was made, <em>where the identifier has testified and is available for cross-examination, </em>not as original, independent or substantive proof of the identity of the accused as a guilty party, but as corroboration of the testimony of the identifying witness as to the identity of the accused.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-10\">\u201cFurther, the Staff Note to the rule indicates that \u2018 * * * [t]he rationale for the rule is that the perception made nearer the event is at least as likely, if not more likely, to be accurate than a subsequent identification in the courtroom. * * * [T]he trial judge [is required] to determine whether the circumstances under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>which the identification was made demonstrate reliability of the prior identification. * * *\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">\u201cThus, a prior identification that is found reliable by a trial judge falls outside the hearsay rule <em>if it is shown that the child-identifier, either at trial or a hearing, had been or is subject to cross-examination </em>under oath concerning the identification statement and the child responds willingly to questions about the previous identification. If these conditions are met and the judge finds the statement of prior identification reliable, then the statement of the declarant can be admitted at trial through a third person to whom or in whose presence the identification was made. See, also, R.C. 2945.55.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In <em>State v. Lancaster </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 83, 54 O.O.2d 222, 267 N.E.2d 291, paragraph five of the syllabus, as quoted above in <em>Boston, </em>the court permitted the identification statement only where the declarant had already testified at trial and was available for cross-examination concerning the statement. In <em>Boston, </em>however, the court did not require both prior testimony and availability for cross-examination. The court in <em>Boston </em>permitted the identification statement either where the declarant already testified <em>or </em>where the declarant was available for cross-examination. This language in <em>Boston </em>permits identification statements even when the declarant has not yet testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The next paragraph in <em>Boston </em>went one step further and stated that identification statements are admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) even if the declarant does <em>not </em>testify at trial. The court wrote in 46 Ohio St.3d at 124, 545 N.E.2d at 1236:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">\u201cAccordingly, admitting a child\u2019s out-of-court identification of the perpetrator under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c), <em>without the child\u2019s testimony at trial, </em>requires the trial judge to conduct a voir dire examination of the child at which the child, under oath, is subject to cross-examination concerning her identification and responds willingly to questions about her identification.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-8\"><em>Boston </em>erased any doubt about whether identification statements are admissible prior to the time the declarant testifies at trial. The statements are admissible regardless of whether the declarant has already testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">In <em>United States v. Owens </em>(1988), 484 U.S. 554, 561, 108 S.Ct. 838, 844, 98 L.Ed.2d 951, 959, when confronting the issue of whether a declarant\u2019s memory loss prevents the declarant from being \u201csubject to cross-examination,\u201d the court commented on the meaning of the phrase as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-10\">\u201cIt seems to us that the more natural reading of the \u2018subject to cross-examination concerning the statement\u2019 includes what was available here. Ordinarily a witness is regarded as \u2018subject to cross-examination\u2019 when he is placed on the stand, under oath, and responds willingly to questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Although the <em>Owens </em>court appeared to construe the federal counterpart to Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) as requiring the declarant to be placed on the witness stand under oath, the court did not require the declarant to be placed on the witness stand under oath prior to the admission of the identification statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In accord with <em>Boston </em>and <em>Owens, </em>we find the fact that the declarant, Tracey, had not yet testified did not prevent the trial court from admitting Jerri\u2019s testimony about Tracey\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Next, we will address the question of whether Jerri\u2019s testimony that Tracey said appellant had fondled her, too, is \u201cone of identification of a person.\u201d Here we have difficulty. We doubt the state presented the testimony in an effort to identify appellant. The record transmitted on appeal contains no allegation or hint that someone other than appellant committed the sexual abuse against Tracey. Tracey has known appellant, her stepfather, for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">In <em>Boston, </em>the court reviewed various rules of evidence and established guidelines for Ohio courts to use when dealing with child sexual abuse cases. After noting problems with the use of Evid.R. 803(4) in child abuse cases,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court, in 46 Ohio St.3d at 124, 545 N.E.2d at 1236, suggested employing Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) under certain circumstances in child abuse eases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">\u201cWe suggest a better way of admitting a child\u2019s statements identifying the perpetrator of child abuse can be found, <em>under certain circumstances, </em>in Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) rather than Evid.R. 803(4).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Later, at 126, 545 N.E.2d at 1238, the court noted Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) may be used in child abuse cases under proper circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-10\"><em>\u201cUnder proper circumstances, </em>Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) may be used to admit the out-of court statement of a child declarant identifying, to a third person, the perpetrator of alleged child abuse.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">The <em>Boston </em>court did not discuss what \u201ccertain\u201d or \u201cproper\u201d circumstances would permit the use of Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) in child abuse cases. Consequently, we can only assume the <em>Boston </em>court referred to prior case law when it stated that \u201cunder certain circumstances\u201d and' \u201cunder proper circumstances\u201d the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>may be applied in child abuse cases. The <em>Boston </em>court did not expressly expand, enlarge, modify, or qualify the application of Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Despite the fact <em>Boston </em>merely suggested the application of Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) under proper circumstances, and did not change the definition of \u201cproper circumstances,\u201d a difference exists between the thirteen <em>pre-Boston </em>and the ten <em>post-Boston </em>Ohio appellate court cases citing Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c). The <em>pre-Boston </em>cases generally involved identifications made by strangers to law enforcement personnel during the course of investigations conducted shortly after the crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The stranger often, but not always, identified the defendant among others in a line-up or photo array. In the <em>pre-Boston </em>cases, the identifications were necessary to prove no other person committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">By contrast, the majority<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the <em>post-Boston </em>cases citing Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) involved close relatives \u2014 two fathers,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> three stepfathers,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>uncle<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 of child victim-declarants. The post <em>-Boston </em>identifications generally involved identifications made by children to mothers or doctors weeks or months after the crime. The child observed neither the defendant nor the defendant\u2019s photograph during the identification. In the <em>post-Boston </em>cases, the identifications addressed not the identity of the defendant, but rather addressed the fact a crime was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Perhaps the <em>post-Boston </em>shift in Ohio appellate case law occurred due to the fact that after commenting on the use of Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c), the <em>Boston </em>court exercised its inherent judicial authority to create a new common-law rule of evidence. Post <em>-Boston </em>courts might have confused this new rule of evidence with Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c). The <em>Boston </em>court wrote in 46 Ohio St.3d at 127, 545 N.E.2d at 1239:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">\u201c * * * We are still faced with the problem of having no workable exception to hearsay in child abuse cases where no other exception is applicable. Until such a rule is approved, <em>we, pursuant to our inherent judicial powers, hold </em>that an out-of-court statement of an allegedly abused child of tender years, including identification of a perpetrator, made to a qualified expert in child abuse, is admissible if the expert has independent evidence of physical or emotional abuse of the child, the child has no apparent motive for fabricating the statement and the child has been found unavailable after a good-faith effort to produce the child in court.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Although the new common-law rule requires an identification of the perpetrator, the new common-law rule differs significantly from Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c). One difference lies in the fact that whereas Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) contemplates a statement of identification and nothing more, Boston\u2019s new common-law evidence rule contemplates a statement that a crime has occurred. The requirement that the statement include an identification of the perpetrator is peripheral, not central, to the new common-law rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">When we examine case law commenting on the theory behind Evid.R. \u2019 801(D)(1)(c), we have little doubt that Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) should not be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>in the case <em>sub judice, </em>and perhaps should not have been cited or applied in the majority of the post-Boston Ohio appellate cases citing the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The majority of Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) cases from other jurisdictions does not involve identifications made by declarants closely related to the defendant. See <em>Owens, supra; United States v. Hines </em>(C.A.11, 1992), 955 F.2d 1449; <em>United States v. Simmons </em>(C.A.2, 1991), 923 F.2d 934; <em>United States v. O\u2019Malley </em>(C.A.7, 1986), 796 F.2d 891; <em>Hosford v. State </em>(Miss.1990), 560 S.2d 163; <em>State v. Spence </em>(1989), 182 W.Va. 472, 388 S.E.2d 498; <em>People v. Flores </em>(1989), 128 Ill.2d 66, 131 Ill.Dec. 106, 538 N.E.2d 481; <em>Jimpson v. State </em>(Miss.1988), 532 So.2d 985; <em>Livingston v. State </em>(Miss.1988), 519 So.2d 1218; <em>State v. Harris </em>(Mo.1986), 711 S.W.2d 881; <em>State v. McClendon </em>(1986), 199 Conn. 5, 505 A.2d 685. All of those cases except <em>Hosford </em>involved identifications made by unrelated adults during line-ups or photo arrays.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In one recent Ohio case, <em>Lee, supra, </em>the Tenth District Court of Appeals cautioned against allowing identification statements that might be perceived by the jury as being evidence that a crime took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u201cTo the extent such statements by the victim concerned only the identity of defendant, no objection would have been proper. Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c). However, beyond identifying defendant as the perpetrator, the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements also could have been perceived by the jury as evidence that a theft and a burglary had been committed. Such evidence is unquestionably hearsay.\u201d <em>Lee, supra, </em>at 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>no substantial question existed concerning the identity of the perpetrator. Appellee undoubtedly offered Jerri\u2019s testimony about Tracey\u2019s statement in an effort to prove a crime took place, not in an effort to identify appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">In <em>Owens, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court reviewed the legislative history of Fed.R.Evid. 801(D)(1)(c). We note the legislative history of the federal rule, as well as the premise behind the rule, support a view that the rule should not be employed under circumstances where no real question of identity of the defendant exists. The <em>Owens </em>court wrote in 484 U.S. at 562, 108 S.Ct. at 844, 98 L.Ed.2d at 960:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-10\">\u201cThe premise for Rule 801(D)(1)(c) was that, given adequate safeguards against suggestiveness, out-of-court identifications were generally preferable to courtroom identifications. Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes on Rule 801, 28 U.S.CApp., p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>717. Thus, despite the traditional view that such statements were hearsay, the Advisory Committee believed that their use was to be fostered rather than discouraged. Similarly, the House Report on the Rule noted that since, \u2018(a)s time goes by, a witness\u2019 memory will fade and his identification will become less reliable,\u2019 minimizing the barriers to admission of more contemporaneous identification is fairer to defendants and <em>prevents \u2018cases falling through the cracks because the witness can no longer recall the identity of the person he saw commit the crime.\u2019\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">There exists no danger that the case <em>sub judice </em>might \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d due any inability on Tracey\u2019s part to identify the person she saw commit the crime against her. That person is her stepfather. It is highly unlikely she forgot his identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In <em>Harris, supra, </em>the Missouri Supreme Court noted a danger inherent in the use of Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) \u2014 the danger that the stature and character of the witness will bolster the credibility of the declarant. The <em>Harris </em>court wrote in 711 S.W.2d at 883:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">\u201cThe underlying concern appears to have been not so much the hearsay quality of the testimony but the fact that it was employed for the purpose of unprovoked bolstering of the identifying witnesses\u2019 testimony. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-8\">\u201c * * * [W]e believe the practical effect on a jury of the third person\u2019s hearsay corroboration of the identifying witness\u2019s testimony concerning the extrajudicial identification is to lend substantial credence to the identifying witness\u2019s testimony, and such <em>credence is principally derived from the stature and character of the third person rather than the substantive basis for his testimony.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">We agree that Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) should not be applied in circumstances outside the purpose of the rule. The rule should not be applied in circumstances where identity is not a true issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">Last, we will discuss the question of whether Tracey\u2019s identification of appellant was made \u201csoon after perceiving him.\u201d The crux of Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) enables prosecutors to present evidence that during or soon after a crime the victim identified the defendant as the perpetrator. In the <em>pre-Boston </em>Ohio appellate cases citing Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c), and in the Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) cases from other jurisdictions, the declarant generally identified the defendant during a police line-up or photo array during the investigation occurring soon after the crime. By contrast, in the <em>post-Boston </em>Ohio appellate cases, the declarant generally identified the defendant weeks or months after the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">The question arises whether the \u201cperceiving him\u201d language refers to the actual crime, or whether it refers to any subsequent viewing of the defendant, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>by line-up, by photograph, or by chance on the street corner. For purposes of our discussion, we will liberally construe the rule and assume the \u201cperceiving\u201d may occur either at the time of the crime or at a later time, such as during a lineup. We will also assume that the \u201cperceiving him\u201d can occur by means of a photograph in a photo array.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Even assuming a liberal construction of the rule, we find that in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the record contains no evidence that Tracey made her statement to Jerri \u201csoon\u201d after Tracey \u201cperceived\u201d appellant. We have no precise evidence of when or where Tracey last saw appellant prior to Tracey\u2019s statements to Jerri. Likewise, we have no precise evidence of when appellant allegedly committed the crimes against Tracey.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We readily acknowledge that it really doesn\u2019t matter when Tracey last saw her stepfather prior to telling Jerri about the sexual abuse. Tracey knows her stepfather. Although one stranger\u2019s memory of the identity of another stranger will fade, a child\u2019s memory of her parent\u2019s identity will not fade at anywhere near the same rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The irrelevance of when Tracey last \u201cperceived\u201d her stepfather before telling Jerri about the crime underscores our belief that Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) should not be employed in cases where no true issue exists concerning the identity of the perpetrator. No one has alleged that someone other than appellant committed the crimes against Tracey. We believe that in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the state attempted to present the testimony not to prove who committed the offense, but rather to prove the fact an offense was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we find the trial court incorrectly applied Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) and incorrectly admitted Jerri\u2019s testimony concerning the statement Tracey made to Jerri. We sustain appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">In his fourth assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court erred by limiting his cross-examination of Days. In particular, appellant asserts the trial court should have permitted him to ask Days whether he is presently barred from the Scioto County Jail. Appellant further asserts the trial court should have permitted him to ask Days why he is presently barred from the Scioto County Jail. Appellant contends issues have been raised about the way Days interrogates inmates and other people suspected of committing sex crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>In <em>State v. Ferguson </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 160, 5 OBR 380, 450 N.E.2d 265, the court held that the scope of cross-examination falls within the sound discretion of the trial court. See, also, <em>O\u2019Brien v. Angley </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 159,17 O.O.3d 98, 407 N.E.2d 490. In <em>State v. Montgomery </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 410, 413, 575 N.E.2d 167, 171, the court followed established law on what constitutes an abuse of discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">\u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 \u2018 * * * connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. * * * \u2019 <em>State v.

Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 552 N.E.2d 894.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we find no unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable attitude evident from the trial court\u2019s decision to prevent appellant from asking Days whether he is presently barred from the Scioto County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Although appellant contends the question would have led to evidence that issues have been raised about the way Days interrogates people suspected of sex crimes, appellant does not contend the question would have led to evidence of how Days interrogated appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">In his fifth assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court erred by admitting his written confession concerning acts he committed against Tracey. Appellant argues the court should have required evidence of a <em>corpus delicti </em>before admitting the confession evidence. Appellant notes that while on the witness stand during the trial below, Tracey recanted her previous allegations against appellant. Tracey testified she had lied earlier when she told others appellant had sexually abused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Appellant cites <em>State v. Edwards </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St.2d 31, 3 O.O.3d 18, 358 N.E.2d 1051, vacated as to death penalty, <em>Edwards v. Ohio </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3147, 57 L.Ed.2d 1155, where the court held the state must produce some evidence in addition to a confession before the confession may be admitted into evidence. The court held in paragraph one of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-12\">\u201ca. The corpus delicti of a crime is the body or substance of the crime, included in which are usually two elements: (1) the act and (2) the criminal agency of the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>\u201cb. There must be some evidence in addition to a confession tending to establish the corpus delicti, before such confession is admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">\u201cc. The quantum or weight of such additional or extraneous evidence is not of itself required to be equal to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, not even enough to make a prima facie case. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In <em>State v. Van Hook </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 256, 261-262, 530 N.E.2d 883, 888-889, the court again noted the <em>corpus delicti </em>evidence need not rise to the level of a prima facie proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">\u201cWe hasten to point out, however, that the standard of proof is not a demanding one. The prosecution need only adduce \u2018some proof * * * tending to prove [the act and its agency],\u2019 but not necessarily such evidence as would rise to the level of a prima facie case. * * * Also, as previously mentioned, Ohio does not require evidence upon all elements of the crime but only \u2018some material element.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we find the prosecution presented sufficient <em>corpus delicti </em>evidence to permit the introduction of appellant\u2019s confession. A caseworker testified her interview with Tracey substantiated a complaint she had received concerning appellant\u2019s sexual abuse of Tracey.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">In his sixth assignment of error, appellant asserts the court erred by admitting double hearsay testimony by the state\u2019s rebuttal witness Rolland Williston. Williston testified in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-12\">\u201cA. Okay. To the best of my knowledge, that Tracey had indicated to mother, Debbie, that some years, and I believe it was two years, that Tracey had gone back to a place of residence during strawberry picking time, if memory is doing pretty well, and that there had been some kind of inappropriate touching at that time, that she went back supposedly to go to the bathroom, and that inappropriate touching, I believe, was indicated as a touching between the legs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">Appellee contends that although appellant objected to the question calling for the double hearsay, appellant failed to object to the Williston\u2019s answer. Thus, appellee argues, it is not clear whether appellant preserved the matter for review. Appellee additionally contends appellant failed to give two bases for his objection \u2014 one for each portion of the double hearsay. Last, appellee contends Williston\u2019s testimony is \u201cso innocuous that it is hardly worth arguing about.\u201d We will address each of appellee\u2019s contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>First, we find appellant adequately preserved the matter for review. Appellant alerted the court to the fact the question posed to Williston asked for double hearsay. Appellant thus gave the court an opportunity to prevent any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Second, we find no merit to appellee\u2019s contention that appellant should have given two bases for his objection \u2014 one for each portion of the double hearsay. The hearsay rule, Evid.R. 802, states that hearsay is not admissible. After a litigant raises the hearsay specter, however, common practice and common sense require the opposing party to overcome that specter by noting an applicable exception to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Last, we find no merit to appellee\u2019s contention that Williston\u2019s testimony is \u201cso innocuous that it is hardly worth arguing about.\u201d The testimony involved hearsay. Appellee gives us no reason to declare that the hearsay falls within any one of the many exceptions to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we sustain appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">In his seventh assignment of error, appellant contends the judgment with regard to the charges involving Tracey is against the manifest weight of the evidence. In particular, appellant notes Tracey recanted her allegations against appellant. With regard to the rape conviction, appellant notes the record contains no evidence that he penetrated Tracey.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">When considering an appellant\u2019s claim that his conviction is against the weight of the evidence, we must defer to the trier of fact. In <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 79, 80, 24 O.O.3d 150, 151, 434 N.E.2d 1356, 1357, the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-11\">\u201cIt is emphasized that an appellate court may not reverse the judgment of conviction unless reasonable minds could not fail to find reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt. It is fundamental that the weight to be given the evidence and credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of facts. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">In <em>State v. Eskridge </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 56, 526 N.E.2d 304, paragraph two of the syllabus, the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">\u201cA reviewing court will not reverse a conviction where there is substantial evidence upon which the court could reasonably conclude that all the elements of an offense have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See, also, <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 553 N.E.2d 576; <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492; <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">In <em>State v. Otten </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 339, 340, 515 N.E.2d 1009, 1010-1011, the court discussed the manner in which courts should determine whether a criminal conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">\u201cIn determining whether a criminal conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Moreover, where there is substantial evidence upon which a jury has based its verdict, a reviewing court abuses its discretion in substituting its judgment for that of the jury as to the weight and the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>State v. Nicely </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 147, 529 N.E.2d 1236; <em>State v. Schiebel </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 564 N.E.2d 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">In view of our disposition of appellant\u2019s third and sixth assignments of error, after a review of . the evidence adduced at trial we find the prosecution failed to present substantial competent and credible evidence upon which the trier of fact could have reasonably concluded that all elements of the offenses against Tracey (Counts One and Two of the indictment) had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As we discussed under appellant\u2019s third and sixth assignments of error, the court should not have permitted certain testimony which we believe was critical to the jury\u2019s decision to convict appellant. The court should not have permitted Jerri to testify that Tracey told her that appellant committed the crimes against her. The court also should not have permitted Williston to testify that Tracey\u2019s mother stated that Tracey said appellant committed the crimes. As to the offense against Jerri (Count Three of the indictment), however, we find the prosecution presented substantial competent and credible evidence upon which the trier of fact could have reasonably concluded that all elements of the offense had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">We find no merit to appellant\u2019s contention that a rape conviction requires proof of penetration. R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-9\">\u201c(A)(1) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another who is not the spouse of the offender * * * when either of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">\u00ab * if: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-11\">\u201c(b) The other person is less than thirteen years of age, whether or not the offender knows the age of such person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>The statute prohibits sexual conduct with children less than thirteen years of age. Appellant appears to believe sexual conduct involves penetration. Appellant is wrong. R.C. 2907.01(A) defines \u201csexual conduct\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">\u201c \u2018Sexual conduct\u2019 means vaginal intercourse between a male and female, and anal intercourse, fellatio, and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal or anal intercourse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The statutory definition of \u201csexual conduct\u201d includes not only penetration via vaginal or anal intercourse, but also includes fellatio and cunnilingus, neither of which require penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we sustain appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error concerning counts one and two of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b778-9\">Grey, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b778-10\">Harsha, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-11\">. The modification does not affect our discussion of <em>Boston.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b768-12\">. The <em>Boston </em>court questioned whether Evid.R. 803(4), the hearsay exception involving statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment, should be used where the declarant is a child. The rationale behind the rule \u2014 the declarant\u2019s self-interest in telling the truth when seeking a medical diagnosis or treatment \u2014 fails when the declarant is a young child. The <em>Boston </em>court wrote in 46 Ohio St.3d at 121, 545 N.E.2d, at 1234:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-13\">\"In order to comply with Evid.R. 803(4), the child's statement must have been motivated by her desire for medical diagnosis or treatment. Oftentimes the child appears too young to be able to (1) formulate her medical problem, (2) communicate this to another person, who is frequently a stranger, and (3) transmit this information for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b769-6\">.

I concurred in <em>Waughtel, supra, </em>but I believe the issue here is different. In that case, there was a taped confession and a transcript of the tape, not as we have here, two confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">Appellee did have the right to introduce only the written confession, but appellant had a similar right to introduce the taped one. We are opening the door to mischief by holding that where a confession is taped and a second confession is obtained in writing, the original taped confession becomes inadmissible. Whether there are any inconsistencies is for the jury. The applicable rule here is Evid.R. 401, relevancy, not Evid.R. 1002, best evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">To my mind, one of the best protections to ensure the validity and accuracy of the subsequent written confession is the sure and certain knowledge by the officer taking the written confession that the original tape will always be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">Thus, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Harsha, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AuF8\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">I concur in portions of the principal opinion. However, with respect to the second assignment of error, I concur for reasons other than those stated in that opinion. With respect to the third, sixth and seventh assignment of error, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In the second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by excluding his audiotaped confession from evidence. I do not find it necessary to determine whether the written and taped confessions are separate and distinct or two parts of one whole. Evid.R. 106 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">\u201cWhen a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party, <em>an adverse party may require him at that time to introduce any other part or any other writing or recorded statement </em>which is otherwise admissable <em>[sic </em>] and which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Thus, I see no purpose to distinguish an unadmitted <em>portion </em>of a writing previously admitted from \u201cany other writing or recorded statement.\u201d Clearly, it was an abuse of discretion not to admit the tape pursuant to Evid.R. 106. That having been said, I note that the taped confession was not proffered at trial as required by Evid.R. 103. The record on appeal contains only a portion of the recording. Absent such a proffer, we have no way to determine whether the exclusion was prejudicial. Appellant waived the error he asserts in the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"AZk\">In resolving the issues raised by the third assignment of error, I find it unnecessary to apply the common-law hearsay exceptions announced in <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 545 N.E.2d 1220. These exceptions need not be employed (nor the exception currently found in Evid.R. 807) when another hearsay exception is applicable. I find that the testimony in question was admissible as an \u201cexcited utterance\u201d under Evid.R. 803(2). In this case, the victim of Count Three of the indictment testified that when she told her cousin she had been molested, her cousin instinctively responded by saying that appellant had also molested her. In this regard, it is the revelation of molestation rather than the molestation itself which constitutes the startling event which resulted in the hearsay statement. As the statement was properly admissible under Evid.R. 803(2), we should not reverse the judgment of the trial court. While I agree that the court improperly ruled the testimony admissible under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c), we are not permitted to reverse a correct judgment because erroneous reasons were assigned as its basis. <em>Joyce v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 93, 96, 551 N.E.2d 172, 174. Accordingly, I must dissent from the principal opinion\u2019s resolution of the third assignment of error as I would overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>The sixth assignment of error asserts that the trial court improperly admitted double hearsay. See Evid.R. 805. The contested testimony consisted of a counselor testifying as to what the victim\u2019s mother told him the victim had told her. I agree with the conclusion in the principal opinion that hearsay evidence was improperly admitted below. I find, however, that appellant was not prejudiced by the admission due to the remaining overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt as discussed in my resolution of the seventh assignment of error. Even if the hearsay evidence had been excluded, substantial evidence as to every element of all three offenses was presented by the state such that the jury could find appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, I would overrule the sixth assignment of error as the improper admission did not alter the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In the seventh assignment of error, appellant argues that the judgment of conviction for rape was against the manifest weight of the evidence as there was no evidence of penetration. I agree with the principal opinion\u2019s conclusion that neither fellatio nor cunnilingus requires penetration. This conclusion, as to fellatio, is supported by <em>State v. Long </em>(1989), 64 Ohio App.3d 615, 618, 582 N.E.2d 626, 628, and given the definition of \u201ccunnilingus,\u201d see Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary (3 College Ed. 1988) 338, I find <em>Long </em>equally applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The principal opinion sustains the seventh assignment of error based upon its resolution of the third and sixth assignments of error. Based upon the third and sixth assignments of error, the principal opinion holds that the state failed to present substantial, competent, credible evidence upon which the trier of fact could find all the elements of Counts One and Two proven beyond a reasonable doubt. I disagree. Appellant\u2019s written confession contained admissions of both rape and gross sexual imposition committed against his stepdaughter. The investigator for the prosecutor\u2019s office also testified that appellant admitted the incidents to him. I note that Count Three of the indictment is also established by this evidence. These sources are independent of the alleged errors in the third and sixth assignments of error. Accordingly, I find there was substantial, competent, credible evidence going to all the elements of all the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Based upon the foregoing, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
