A Kubota representative tried to persuade Moreland to take over the existing Kubota dealership in the area, Davis Implement Supply Co., Inc., a company owned and operated by Gene Davis. Moreland refused to take over Davis\u2019 company, which had gone out of business due to financial setbacks, and formed his own corporation, Central Line Tractor &amp; Equipment Company (\u201cCentral\u201d), with himself as sole shareholder. Farm equipment and machinery charged to Davis, but owned by Kubota, was transferred to Central and charged as a floor plan. At Kubota\u2019s suggestion, Central hired Davis as a vice-president and salesman.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">In early October 1988, Davis gave a $7,500 credit to a customer for a 1050 John Deere tractor the customer traded in towards the purchase of a new Kubota tractor. On October 21, 1988, Davis sold the John Deere tractor and other equipment and machinery to defendant-appellant, Robert Rapp, for $9,236.25. When appellant tendered a check for $2,236.25 as payment for the purchase, Moreland discovered that Davis gave appellant \u201ccredit\u201d for the balance of $7,000, an amount Davis owed appellant for earlier business dealings between the two. Moreland was not present at the dealership when Davis and appellant consummated the deal. Moreland immediately disavowed the $7,000 credit once he discovered what Davis had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">Approximately six months later, Central cashed appellant\u2019s check \u201cunder protest\u201d and filed suit to recover the balance. Following a bench trial in Warren County Common Pleas Court, the trial court granted judgment for $7,000 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Central. In a timely appeal, appellant submits the following four assignments of error for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s finding that the transfer of inventory from Davis Implement Supply to Central Line Tractor &amp; Equipment Company on or about August 22, 1988 was not a bulk transfer, was against the manifest of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">Assignment of Error No. 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in ruling that Robert Rapp had no right to pursue, secure and retain credits, in the amounts owed him by transferor, Davis Implement Supply, against purchase of farm implements in possession of transferee, Central Line.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">Assignment of Error No. 3:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in disregarding satisfaction of plaintiffs claim by virtue of invoice and receipt of payment in full executed by vice-president of plaintiff corporation acting with full apparent authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">Assignment of Error No. 4:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in permitting plaintiff Central Line to repudiate satisfaction of claim, after retaining check six (6) months before negotiation \u2018under protest\u2019 so as to delay and defeat Robert Rapp\u2019s continuing rights as creditor in the merchandise, until barred by Section 1306.09, O.R.C.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">Appellant\u2019s first, second and fourth assignments of error concern the bulk transfer provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, codified in R.C. Chapter 1306. The trial court concluded that R.C. Chapter 1306 was inapplicable to the case at bar and that appellant, as a creditor of Davis Implement Supply Co., had no right to secure credits against equipment in Central\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">A \u201cbulk transfer\u201d is defined as \u201c * * * any transfer in bulk and not in the ordinary course of the transferor\u2019s business of a major part of the [transferor\u2019s] * * * inventory * * R.C. 1306.01(A). The purpose of laws governing bulk transfers is to protect the unpaid seller of merchandise and goods from a sale by a merchant of his stock and inventory, otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade. <em>Harper &amp; Kirschten Shoe Co. v. S. &amp; B. Shoe Co. </em>(1922), 16 Ohio App. 387, 393. Where a bulk transfer occurs, the failure to comply with those provisions pertaining to the preparation of property schedules and a list of creditors, R.C. 1306.03, and notice to creditors, R.C. 1306.04, renders the transfer ineffective as to those creditors not properly noticed. These creditors may disregard the transfer and levy on the transferred goods by appropriate legal proceedings. See R.C. 1306.03, Official Comment 2 to UCC 6-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Appellant argues that R.C. Chapter 1306 applies to the case at bar and, as a creditor who did not receive adequate notice of the bulk transfer, he may levy on those goods Davis transferred to Central. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">The record reflects that appellant provided farm implements and other machinery to Davis, who attempted to sell them on appellant\u2019s behalf. The record also demonstrates that when Davis\u2019 company went out of business, those tractors and machinery that Kubota owned but had provided and charged to Davis on a floor plan were transferred to Central under similar arrangements and did not constitute a transfer of assets from Davis to Central subject to R.C. Chapter 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"ALQ\">Even if appellant is correct in his claim that the bulk sales provisions apply, appellant failed to comply with the law in two major respects. First, appellant did not take appropriate legal proceedings to recover from Central; he simply engaged in a self-help remedy and removed several pieces of Central\u2019s property without Moreland\u2019s knowledge and consent. Second, the 1050 John Deere tractor, the specific item appellant took in exchange for the $7,000 credit Davis owed appellant, was never part of Davis\u2019 inventory, but was received by Central as a customer trade-in.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Judgments supported by some competent, credible evidence will not be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273. Having reviewed the record herein, we agree that the transfer of assets from Davis\u2019 company to Central was not covered by R.C. Chapter 1306 and that appellant had no right to pursue his claims as a creditor of Davis against Central. The trial court\u2019s decision is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">We also reject appellant\u2019s claim that Central\u2019s conduct in retaining his check for six months denied appellant his opportunity to pursue a bulk transfer claim under R.C. 1306.09, which places a six-month statute of limitations on such actions. Having found R.C. Chapter 1306 inapplicable, Central\u2019s conditional negotiation of appellant\u2019s check cannot preclude an action which appellant did not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">For the reasons set forth above, appellant\u2019s first, second and fourth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">In his third assignment of error, appellant claims that Central is estopped from asserting its claim for $7,000 because Davis, acting as Central\u2019s agent, prepared an invoice for the transaction reflecting a $7,000 credit. It is appellant\u2019s position that Davis, as an employee and vice-president, had the authority to bind Central as its agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>When Moreland discovered the credit Davis gave to appellant, he quickly disavowed it and demanded that Davis collect full payment. Moreland also testified that Davis had no authority to extend credit to any customer, especially for Davis\u2019 own debts. Thus, Davis\u2019 transaction with appellant constituted an unauthorized act which cannot bind Central, as the principal, unless it was done with Central\u2019s full knowledge and understanding accompanied by a manifestation of the principal\u2019s intention to ratify the unauthorized transaction. <em>Meyer v. Klensch </em>(1961), 114 Ohio App. 4, 18 O.O.2d 261, 175 N.E.2d 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The burden to prove the existence of an agency relationship lies with the party who asserts the agency\u2019s existence. <em>Avon Lake City School Dist. v. Ohio Dept. of Taxation </em>(1989), 55 Ohio App.3d 171, 174, 563 N.E.2d 754, 758. The evidence presented below fails to show that Davis\u2019 extension of credit to appellant was authorized by Moreland or Central, and indicates that the extension of credit was promptly repudiated. Since neither Moreland nor Central ratified Davis\u2019 unauthorized act, there is no agency relationship and Moreland and Central were not estopped from asserting a claim against appellant for the $7,000 balance. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b232-7\">William W.
