Burton, in the sum of 819/ <em>7s. 9d. </em>sterling money of <em>Great </em>Britain, the payment of which, with interest thereon at the rate of five <em>per centum per </em>annum, he was desirous of assuring to them in three equal annual payments to be made in good merchantable crop tobacco, to be delivered at, and addressed to them in <em>Lon</em>don, upon which they were to draw the usual and accustomed commission of 21s. sterling for each hogshead. The property conveyed was 2,000 acres of land, being part of the tract whereon the said <em>Baylor </em>resided, nine young negro men and two young women by name, together with the future progeny of the said females. Each sum payable annually, was to bear interest from the date of the deed, and, in case of non-shipment of the tobacco, a farther sum equivalent to and in lieu of the usual mercantile commission thereon, at the rate of 21 <em>s. </em>sterling per hogshead, estimating each hogshead to be worth 10/. sterling, was to be added to each payment.

But the Jury have expressly referred to the Court the question of law arising upon the facts ; for, if they had found <em>usury </em>expressly, there could have been no question, and judgment must, of course, have been rendered for the defendant. The argument goes <em>to the </em>extent that there can be no <em>special </em>verdicts in. cases turning upon questions of usury. It is true, the question, \u201c usury, <em>or not,\u201d </em>is proper for the consideration of a Jury, and they may decide it, if they think proper; but if they do not, but choose to refer it to the <em>Court, </em>the Court will decide it upon the facts, as in all other cases of special verdicts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-9\">That this was a clear case of usury, is evident; not the case of a <em>merchant </em>about to establish commercial intercourse, but of a <em>planter, </em>who, indebted to <em>Donald St? Burton, </em>under the pressure of circumstances yielded to their demands. In consideration of a forbearance of three years, he was hound to ship them tobacco, and to allow them the enormous core mission of 21s. per hogshead; and, even if he did not ship, he was to pay the same commission, estimating each hogshead at it)/ -terling! It is not <em>found, </em>that 2Is. per hogshead was the reasonable and usual commission. But, if reasonable wheu tobacco is actually shipped, it surely cat not be said to be reasonable, or usual, when tobacco is not shipped. There never <em>could </em>have been a <em>custom </em>so unreasonable. A <em>commission </em>is a compensation <em>lor doing something. </em>The allowance, therefore, where no tobacco was shipped, and they were at no trouble, could not operate as a <em>commission, </em>but must have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>intended as a <em>premium for the use of money. </em>That this additional <em>premium </em>was stated <em>by the way of commission </em>makes no difference. <em>A </em>man shall not shelter himself under the pretext of commercial dealing, so as to evade the statute. It was impossible for the Legislature to describe-every case which constitutes usury; but they have gone as far as the ingenuity of man can to prevent it; so that, if, in any case, the <em>intention </em>appear to be to get more than legal interest, it is usury, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> All the cases go to this; that, if the party attempts to disguise the transaction, in any manner, so as, in effect, to obtain more than legal interest, it will be as much usury as if a certain rate of interest above the legal, had been taken, <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-11\">In all the cases cited on the other side as depending on the usage of trade, the usage was expressly proved and found by the jury, and was fair and reasonable in itself. The premium taken was conformable to the usage, and no more than a just compensation for risk and trouble. In 3 <em>Term Rep. </em>531. <em>Tate </em>v. Wellings, the contract, it is true, was decided not to be usurious: but this turned on the circumstance of its being for stock, which is fluctuating in value ; and, as the party was bound to return stock, it was reasonable that the other should receive as much money as would command as much stock with the dividends. Besides, the party had his election to pay stock, \u00f3r money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-13\">In <em>7 Bac. </em>198. <em>(Gwil. </em>edit.) and 1 <em>Atk. </em>350. it is said, that, where both principal and interest are at hazard, it is not usury. But, in the present case, there was no hazard of principal or interest; both being secured by the deed of trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-14\">The only plausible ground on which gentlemen insist is, that the penalty might have been avoided by shipping the tobacco: but, either way, <em>Baylor </em>was to pay an enormous interest.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Thursday, <em>October </em>19th, 1809.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AX6\">The Judges pronounced their opinions.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\"><em>\u0430) Cowp. </em>112.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\"> 2 <em>Term Rep. </em>52. <em>note.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b242-9\"> 1 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>144.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b242-10\"> S <em>Term Rep. </em>531,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(e)\">\n<p id=\"b242-11\"> <em>Roberts v.

Burton, merchants in London, in three equal annual instalments, by the shipment of tobacco to their address, on which they were to be allowed a commission of one guinea per hogshead; \u201c and, in case of non-shipment of the tobacco, a further <em>\u201c </em>sum in each payment, equivalent to and in lieu of the <em>\u201c </em>usual mercantile commission thereon, at the rate of one <em>u </em>guinea per hogshead, and estimating each hogshead to \u201c be worth 10/. sterling: then <em>James </em>Brown, on the re- \u201c quest of <em>Donald </em>Burton, was to sell, &amp;c. the lands in \u201c the ejectment mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"As4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\u201c They find that, after executing the said deed, <em>Baylor \u201c </em>did ship and consign to the said <em>Donald is? Burton </em>105 \u201c <em>hogsheads of tobacco, agreeably to the covenants in the be- </em>\u201c <em>fore-mentioned deed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEc\">\u201c They find that <em>Donald &amp; Burton </em>advanced <em>other </em>sums \u201c of money for the use of Baylor, as exhibited by an ac-<em>u </em>count which they find <em>in hcec verba; </em>and that the deed \u201c of trust in the said account mentioned, is the same as \u201c the one before set forth.\u201d But they do not find, nor does the deed of trust mention, that the same was to stand as a security for any future advances which <em>Donald id Burton </em>should make to <em>Baylor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">They also find, that a suit was instituted for the recovery of the <em>balance due on the last-mentioned account, </em>and a verdict and judgment entered for 200/., <em>which has sim\u00f3 been paid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">They then find the sale of the lands by Brown, (after advertising the sale thereof once,) and the purchase thereof by <em>Pollard, </em>and a deed of bargain and sale for the same from <em>Brown </em>to Pollard, which, after reciting the deed of trust from <em>Baylor </em>to <em>Brown, </em>proceeds thus: \u201c And whereas \u201c the said <em>fohn Baylor failed altogether </em>in shipping to the \u201c said <em>Donald is?

Burton </em>did afterwards request \u201c the said <em>fames Brown </em>in writing, to sell, &amp;c. in conse- \u201c quence of which, &amp;c. the lands were exposed to sale, \u201c &amp;c. and <em>Pollard </em>became the purchaser,\u201d &amp;c,</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>The District Court upon this special verdict gave judgment for the defendant. And I am of opinion, that judgment Was correct. For the Jury have expressly found the shipment of tobacco, which, according to the valuation in the deed, (made for a different purpose, I admit,) must have amounted to much more than the debt and interest; thereby expressly negativing and contradicting the statement of facts contained in the recital of the deed to <em>Pollard; </em>and they have moreover found, that the balance actually due (though not that which was claimed) on the account exhibited by <em>Donald </em>Si Burton, hath been actually paid. Upon this state of facts, I am of opinion, that enough appears upon <em>this </em>verdict, for the Court to give judgment in favour of the defendant, and that the same be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">With respect to the question, whether this contract be Usurious, I learn from a note in the hand-writing of the late Judge Pendleton, which is, accidentally, in my possession at present,' that in a former suit between the same parties, grounded upon this very contract, it was determined by this Court to be usury by the nature of the contract appearing in the instrument <em>itself. </em>I was previously of the same opinion, in which I am the more confirmed by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Let it be supposed, that after entering into this contract, Mr. <em>Baylor </em>had purchased bills on <em>London </em>to the amount of his whole debt and interest, and had there tendered the money to <em>Donald it? Burton: </em>might they not still have insisted that he should pay them eighty guineas more in lieu of the commission of one guinea per hogshead, at the rate of 10/. sterling per hogshead, which he was to allow them by this contract ? Or suppose that fifty hogsheads of tobacco had sold for as much as the whole debt would amount to. Must he not still have paid the commission of a guinea per hogshead, according to these stipulations, on thirty hogsheads more than paid his debt ? Here, then, is a condition arising out of this contract for <em>further for</em>bearance, that the debtor should <em>in any event </em>be liable to pay eighty guineas (amounting to about ten <em>per cent.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>more than Ins original debt and interest. This, I conceive, brings the case fully within the statute. For <em>Baylor </em>could not, by any means whatever, discharge himself from the obligation to pay this additional premium over and above his debt and interest.</p>\n<author id=\"b248-3\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"ALr\">This is the third case which has come before this Court between the present parties, and grounded upon the same deed, viz. the deed of 24th August, 1790.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">As to the first case, I do not recollect whether the account current, which is contained in the present special verdict, was also to be found in it, nor do 1 remember the <em>particulars </em>of that verdict: but the Court went fully into the question of usury suggested to arise upon the construction of that deed, and were equally divided upon that question. I was one of those who thought the deed not usurious, in which opinion Judge <em>Lyons </em>concurred. As that opinion has never been published, and perhaps never maybe in any particular report of the case, I will beg leave to read it as a part of my opinion on the point of usury in the present case. It was delivered on due deliberation, and I have since seen no cause to change the result therein \u2022contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">[Here Judge Roane read the opinion now alluded to, which see in the note below.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b249-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>In addition to the reasons contained in this opinion, I will beg leave to say, with Judge Lyons, in his opinion delivered in the same case, \u201c that in questions of usury the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tc intent is more to be regarded than the words 5 that <em>Do- </em>\u2022\u201c <em>nald Burton </em>were commission-merchants in London, \u201c and desirous of extending their trade by procuring con- \u201c s gnments of tobacco, the profits of which trade, in ad- \u201c dition to that of securing the debt due to them, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>i\u00a3 their object; and that it was a lawful object, being in the \u00a3\u00a3 course of their business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAZ\">Such was the opinion of a moiety of the Court, in the first case of <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Baylor. </em>As for the note mentioned by the Judge who preceded me, and <em>said to contain </em>the opinion of Judge Pendleton on this point of usury, it is true that the judgment of the District Court thereupon was affirmed; but it was only by the equal suffrages of the Judges of this Court. No man has a greater veneration for the memory of that great judge than myself: but his opinion in a case in which he did not sit, which he had not heard argued, and did not take the trouble to study, ought not to be quoted as an authority. It is even less than an <em>extrajudicial </em>and <em>obiter </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">In the next case between the same parties, this Court reversed a judgment in favour of the defendant, on account of certain <em>defects in the special verdict. </em>In reversing that judgment on that ground, and thus keeping alive the controversy between the parties, the majority of the Court undoubtedly adjudged and admitted the deed of <em>24th Au</em>gust, 1790, not to be usurious: for else, <em>cui </em>bono, send back the parties to make their case more complete ? why not at once put an end to the controversy ? why continue a tedious litigation between the parties, if the Court thought that, upon the foundation of that controversy, the party claiming can never be entitled to recover? As to this point, the decision of the Court, a few days ago, in the case of <em>Murdock and others </em>v. <em>Herndon's </em>Executors, is a satisfactory authority. In this second case of <em>Pollard </em>v. Baylor, this question of usury was argued at length by the bar: when, therefore, the Court <em>sustained </em>the cause, and took measures to have a more perfect verdict rendered, did it not virtually at least, overrule an objection which strikes at the very foundation of the claim ? did it not, in effect, decide, that the deed of August, 1790, was not usurious?</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Taking it, then, both upon the merits of the question as aforesaid, and upon the decision in the second case just mentioned, which, otherwise, ought not to have called for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>a more perfect verdict, that the foundation of this claim is not objectionable, it remains to inquire, whether the special verdict now before us is adequate or not to sustain a judgment for the appellant under the standard setup by this Court in relation to the verdict contained in the second ease, just mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\">On a minute comparison of the present verdict with that contained in the former case, 1 think the present verdict <em>at least </em>as imperfect as the former one, I will endeavour to state the particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"AYF\">The verdict in the former case was condemned, and the judgment reversed, on three grounds: 1st. That it was not found whether,' <em>at the time </em>of the execution of the deed of 24th Avgust, 1790, <em>James Brown </em>was the agent of <em>Donald Burton, </em>and, as such, received the indenture from <em>Baylor. </em>This objection equally applies to the present verdict. There is nothing more on this point found in this case than in the former. It is true it is found, that the account current stated in the verdict was \u25a0 <em>rendered </em>by <em>James </em>Brown, <em>attorney for Donald Burton: </em>but this merely relates to the time of <em>its </em>presentation, viz. <em>January, </em>1795, and that <em>Brown </em>was then attorney for <em>Donald Burton; </em>it does not establish the fact of his agency as at the time of the execution of the deed, 2dly. Another objection to that verdict was, that it was not found whether the publication of the time and place of sale was <em>duly </em>niade, agreeably to the terms stated in the-deed, but that the Jury found <em>evidence </em>only ; (i. <em>e. </em>the advertisement itself;) but that finding is stronger than the present in this particular; for, in that case, it was found that <em>James Broxvn </em>did duly advertise the sale of the land, which word \u201c duly\u201d would seem to extend also to the number of times of publication required by the deed, whereas in the present case it is only found that the sale was made, <em>James Brown </em>\u201c <em>having advertised </em>the same <em>on the 10th of March </em>in the <em>Virginia </em>GazetteIt is neither found that it was duly advertised as in the former case, nor more particularly, that it was advertised four weeks, according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>requisitions of the deed. These two objections to the former verdict apply, therefore, with equal force, at least, to the one before us. A third objection made to the former verdict was, that it was not found that the 105 hogsheads of tobacco were shipped \u201c in pursuance \u201c fulfilment of the covenants in the deed of trust,\u201d or \u201c <em>to </em>\u201c <em>meet bilk drawn on Donald Burton at the time of such </em>\u201c shipments.\u201d This objection does not apply to the case before us, for it is found in this verdict, that the defendant \u201c dirl ship and consign to <em>Donald &amp; Burton </em>105 hogsheads w of tobacco, <em>agreeable to the covenants in the said deed.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">But, in lieu of this last objection, another presents itself which did not exist in the former case, ft is not found in this case, as it was in the former, that <em>James Brcwi</em>ivas requested in whiting, by <em>Donald </em>Burton, to sell the premises in question, as required by the terms of the deed. This requisite is essential to the legality of a sale, and ought to be found; for the defendant did not mean to subject his land to be advertised and sold at the pleasure of the <em>agent, </em>but only of the <em>principals, </em>in whose liberality and honour he may have had more confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">There is, perhaps, still another defect in the present finding, which also existed in the former case, but was not noticed in the judgment of the Court. By the terms of the deed, the agent was not to sell the whole trust property to pay a <em>small </em>sum, but only \u201c <em>as much as should be </em>\u201c <em>needful,\u201d </em>for raising the amount of the principal and interest of any instalment which should remain unpaid, with a further sum adequate to the commission stipulated on the sales; <em>i. e. </em>21i. per hogshead. To this sum, thus com - pounded, the opinion of the Court in the former case seems to have added, as I think ought to be added, all moneys due \u201c <em>for bilk drawn on Donald </em>Burton, <em>at the </em>\u201c <em>time of the shipments of the tobacco.\u201d </em>Now, although f have no doubt but that all the bills stated in the account current in truth fall within the above description, yet this is not found by the verdict, nor stated in the account itself, except in relation to <em>the first </em>bill for 165/. drawn <em>Sept. </em>22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>1 \u2019/90. By a <em>rough </em>calculation which I have made, the balance of principal and interest of the original sum secured by the deed <em>left due </em>by the proceeds of the tobacco shipped, added to the commission on 105 hogsheads of tobacco, according to the terms of the deed as aforesaid, and to this advance of 165/. will fall short of the sum actually raised by the sale of the land and negroes by the sum of 382/. or thereabouts; and therefore it would seem by the verdict before us, that <em>more </em>of the land and negroes were sold than was <em>justified </em>by the terms of the deed; But (as before said) having no doubt but that <em>all </em>the bills mentioned in the account were for advances made at the time of the respective payments\"; and, if so, as they ought,according to the opinion of the Court before mentioned, to make part of the sum for which the trust property was liable to be sold; I should think that this fact should be left open to be supplied in the verdict in future, and thus the sale actually made of the trust property stand justified as to the <em>whole </em>sum raised thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The result of my opinion is, that the foundation of this claim being free , from objection on the ground of usury or any other objection, both upon my own deliberate opinion on the point, and by the judgment of the Court in the former case, (which, otherwise, ought to have affirmed the judgment for the defendant on the merits,) that still the verdict before us should be set aside, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded; first, on the ground of the two (and perhaps three) objections common to this case with the former, as I have endeavoured to point them out; and, on this additional ground, that it is not found in the present verdict, that <em>fames </em>Brown, the agent, was required <em>in writing </em>to make the sale in question, without which, under the provisions of the deed, it ought not to have been made.</p>\n<author id=\"b254-10\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"Afo\">When this extraordinary contract was under the consideration of this Court on a former occasion in another suit between the same parties, I was clearly of opinion that the contract was- usurious, and gave my rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>sons pretty much at large; and to that opinion I beg leave to refer. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Since the last able and ingenious argument of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the case, I have reconsidered it, with yery great attention^ and the more I reflect upon it, the more am I convinced of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>die correctness of my former opinion, that it has usury stamped upon the very face of it; and no shift, covin, device, or deceit, appears in order to evade the statute, (and such, I am authorized to say, was the opinion of Mr. <em>Pendleton, </em>a late venerable and enlightened President of this Court,) and it appearing as well on the face of the deed itself, as by the verdict, that <em>James </em>Brown, a principal party to the deed, was the agent of <em>Donald &amp; Burton, </em>the contract was void <em>ab initio ; </em>and without considering any other point in the cause, I am of opinion, that the judgment of the District Court is correg\u00ed, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">By a majority of the Court, the judgment of the District Court AFflElED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b245-13\"> The opinion of the Court, pronounced on the 20th of October, 1808, in another ejectment, between the same parties, and founded on the same deed, was, \u201c that the judgment was erroneous in this, that \u201c the Jury have not found whether, at the time of the execution of the ** indenture of the 24th of August, 1790, by <em>John Baylor </em>to <em>James </em>\u00ab <em>Brovin, </em>the latter was the agent or attorney of <em>Donald (S?

The appellant\u2019s attorney did not exhibit the \u00ab deed in question as a mere immaterial paper; but, as he tells us in <em>\u201c </em>Ills exceptions, to support his declaration. But, after that paper s' was rejected by the Court, it would have been improper to have \u201c gone on and shewn, how his title was derived under it.</p>\n<p id=\"AKv\">\u201c Nor have I any difficulty upon the question of usury. The agree- '&lt; ment was to pay a sterling debt, with interest, by instalments, in to- \u00ab bacco, to be consigned to the creditor, who was to have the <em>accus- \u25a0\u201c tomed </em>commissions for selling. It was further agreed, that in case of failure of payment in that mode, the principal, with interest, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>,\u00a3 the amount of tlie commissions, should be paid here, by means of a <em>\u201c </em>sale of the property conveyed. If the covenant had been performed \u201c by the appellee as contemplated, it was clearly unobjectionable. So \u201c in the event, -which has happened, I think the commissions must ci- <em>\u201c </em>tiler be considered as a penalty from which the appellee might: have \u201c delivered himsi-lf, and therefore the contract was not usurious, or <em>\u201c </em>as a stipulated rate of damages, previously agreed upon by tlie \u201c parties, for an injury produced by non-compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00a3t I will view the case, first, as before a failure, and on the face of <em>u </em>the deed itself; and, secondly, as under the event which has hap-5&lt; pened.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u201c /' a to the first view, it is rightly held by Judge Butlers in <em>Tate </em>v. \u201c <em>Willings, </em>3 <em>Term Rep. </em>539. that the question is, Whether a contract &lt;! wits usurious or not, as <em>at the time </em>it was entered into ; for, if tlie <em>\u201c </em>contract was legal at that time, no subsequent event can make it usurious. The s-me doctrine is lic-ld by I.ord <em>Mansfield, </em>in the case of <em>Floyer </em>v. <em>Edwards, Cowp </em>115. It is also held ill the last cape by \u201c the same Judge, ;and I adopt these positions, bee,use I think them <em>\u201c </em>right,) that usury is an agreement to pay, <em>originally, </em>the principal, \u2018\u2018 with greater interest than five <em>per cent. </em>In the case before us, con- \" sidered as ft the time of the contract, tlie commissions could not be \u201c considered as an addition to the legal interest, but as a compensation 11 for a service contracted and intended to be performed ; and, conse- <em>\u201c </em>quently, as no greater interest than the law allows is reserved, the \u201c contract is not usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\"><em>\u201c </em>This position, that a contact is to be adjudged as at the time of \u201c its date, without reference to posterior events, in fact shuts up this <em>\u201c </em>question. But I will notwithstanding consider it in the other aspects</p>\n<p id=\"AYo\">\u201c In the event which has happened, the appellee is compelled to pay <em>\u201c </em>a slim over and above tlie principal and interest, s', <em>e. </em>the amount of <em>\u201c </em>the commissions contemplated. It is true, that, in no event, could <em>\u201c </em>the appellee have avoided the payment thereof; but in the event con- ** templated by the contact, viz. that of his shipping tlie tobacco, lie \u201c could liare converted them into a <em>compensation </em>for a service actually e\u2018 performed, and, consequently, that sum would have ceased to bfe <em>\u201c </em>without consideration. It would have ceased to be an augmentation \u201c of the interest, if otherwise it could be so considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u201c In this view, the case comes clearly within a well established rule, that, although a penalty be reserved, yet if the borrower had it in \u201c his power to comply, and avoid tlie penalty at a certain day, the <em>cam </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>\u201c </em>tract is not usurious. To constitute usluy, the borrower must be <em>\u201c </em>bound, in all events, to pay a greater interest than the law allows; <em>\u201c </em>but in this case he was not so bound, but might, by complying with \u201c his contract, have turned this penalty, as it is now called, into acom- \u201c pensation for a service actually performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\u201c If it be said, that, by the contract, the consiguees are not bound to <em>\u201c </em>sell the tobacco, and therefore the commissions are without a consi- \u201c deration ; the answer is, that in that event, it is, as it were, a sale to <em>\u201c </em>themselves ; and that the service is the same to the consignor, wlxether retained (as if sold) by themselves, or sold to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">\u201c The case of <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Willings </em>is very applicable to our case. There \u201c a greater interest than 5 <em>j&gt;er cent, </em>was reserved on the sum lent5 .\u00ab but, because the borrower might have delivered himself therefrom \u201c within a limited time, by paying stock, the contract was held not to \u201c be usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">\u201c The case of <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>cited by Mr. Call, does not apply. \u201c For there, in addition to the legal interest, profits of a trade were <em>\u201c </em>granted, from which the borrower could not have delivered himself, &lt;l and which therefore formed an addition to the legal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">\u201c In every view of the case, then, the contract is not usurious. If \u201c the contract had been performed, the commissions would have beca \u201c given for a <em>bona jkle </em>and valuable consideration; As it was not per- \u201c formed, the penalty arises, not from the contract itself, but from the \u201c breach thereof by the appellee; and because he did not deliver him- \u00ab self therefrom by performing his agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">\u201c It was well observed, that here are no <em>extrinsic </em>circumstances to \u201c vary the construction arising from the face of the contract. If there \u201c were, a diffei'ent conclusion might follow. If, for example, it had \u201c been agreed collaterally, that the tobacco should not be shipped, <em>\u201c </em>or other circxxmstances existed shewing plainly, that it was well un- \" derstood by the parties, that the tobacco could not or would not be <em>\u201c </em>shipped. These, or such like circxxmstances, might induce the Court \u201c to consider the contx\u2019act as i'eally a shift to evade the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">\u201c But the contract is a mere naked one, and, on its face, I clearly \u201c hold it to be not usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">\u201c I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment of the District Court \u201c ought to be reversed, and a new trial awarded, with directions to \u201c admit the deed in question as evidence to the Jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\"> The following was Judge Flemistg\u2019s opinion, alluded to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Three questions seem presented in this case;</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">\u201c 1st. Whether the contract between <em>John Baylor </em>and <em>James Broun </em>\u201c be usurious ?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">\u201c 2d. Whether <em>Broun </em>was the agent of <em>Donald &amp; Burton </em>at the time <em>Ci </em>of the contract ? and,</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">\u201c 3d. Were not 105 hogsheads of tobacco shipped by <em>Baylor, </em>and \u201c consigned to <em>Donald </em>is* <em>Burton, agreeably to the contract ? </em>and ought \u201c not the whole proceeds to have been applied iu discharge of the debt \u201c then due ?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">\u201c 1. With respect to the first point, it appears, that <em>Baylor, </em>being <em>\u201c </em>largely indebted to <em>Donald Idf Burton, </em>(who had immediate right to \u201c recover their debt by legal process,) and being thus in their power, \u201c and at their mercy, was induced, in consideration of their forbear- \u201c anee for one, two, and three years, to enter into the ruinous contract \u201c before us, thus becoming a loan which is altogether in favour of the \u201c creditors, without any equality or reciprocity between the parties, \u201c and having usury stamped upon the very face of it. <em>Baylor </em>had only this \u201c alternative, either to discharge the debt of the shipment of tobacco, \u201c (for which he was to have credit for just as much as they might please <em>\u201c </em>to allow him,) after deducting a commission of 21 shillings sterling \u201cperhogshead, (let it be sold for what it might,) or submit to have \u201c the trust estate sold for ready money, and pay (over and above all \u201c expenses incident thereunto) a commission of 21 shillings sterling- \u201c for every 10 pounds on the amount of the sales.</p>\n<p id=\"ADqV\">\u201c The first alternative was clearly against the debtor and in favour of \u201c the creditors, because the less they gave him for his tobacco, the higher \u201c commission they secured on the collection of their debts, and the more V freight on their shipping. By the contract the debt was to have been \u201c paid at three annual instalments of 273/. 2s. <em>7d. </em>each, with interest at \u201c 5 <em>per cent, per annum </em>on each instalment from the date of the deed ; \u201c to be paid by shipments of tobacco to the creditors, estimated at and \u201c understood by the contraciing parties to be worth 10/. sterling per \u201c hogshead, and held out as a lure to <em>Baylor. </em>The first instalment, with \u201c the. interest, amounted to 286/. 15s. <em>8d. Hqrs. </em>which 29 hogsheads of \u201c tobacco would have overpaid 3/. <em>od. 2qrs., </em>the commission on \u201c which would have been 30/. <em>9s. </em>The second instalment, with interest, \u201c amounted to 300/. <em>8s. 10d. </em>which 30 hogsheads of tobacco would have discharged, save 8s. tOrf. The third and last instalment would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201c have been 314/. Is. lid. <em>2qrs., </em>which 32 hogsheads of tobacco would \" have overpaid <em>61. </em>19s. 0d. <em>2qrs. </em>the commission on which would have \" been 33/. 12s. The whole commission, then, would have amounted to \"\u201995/. 11s. and the debt overpaid <em>91. </em>14s. <em>6d. </em>by the shipment of 91 hogs- \" heads of tobacco.</p>\n<p id=\"AQb\"><em>\u201c </em>It appears by the verdict, that, long before the expiration of three \" years from the date of the contract, <em>Baylor </em>shipped an consigned to \" the said <em>Donald &amp; Burton </em>105 hogsheads of tobacco, \u2018 agreeably to \" <em>\u2018 </em>covenants in the afore mentioned deed,\u2019 and the amount of the \u201c sales thereof was not applied in discharge of the contract, but a new \" account raised between them, and instead of 10/. per hogshead, as <em>\u201c </em>estimated by the parties at the time of the contract, accounts of sales \u201c of the 105 hogsheads of tobacco are rendered by <em>Donald &amp; Burton, \u201c </em>through their agent <em>James Brovin, </em>at the average price of 6/. 16s 11 <em>d. \u201c </em>per hogshead, s\u00f3 that, instead of the debt and interest being dis- <em>\u201c </em>charged by the shipment of 91 hogsheads of tobacco, and a commis- \" sion to the creditors of 95/. 11s., it would require 131 hogsheads of \" tobacco to discharge the debt, and the debtor pay a commission of <em>\u201c 1371. </em>11\u00ab. besides the loss of <em>31. 3s. Id- </em>per hogshead, on 105 hogs- <em>\u201c </em>heads of tobacco, already shipped <em>agreeably </em>to contract. As to the \" other alternative, the sale of the trust estate, and the very extraordi- \" nary commission on the amount of sales, Mr. <em>Randolph, </em>in his argu- \u201c ment, contended, that it was no hardship on <em>Baylor, </em>because <em>\u2018 </em>that \" <em>\u2018 </em>extra commission must be considered as a penalty which he might \" <em>\u2018 </em>have avoided by the shipment of tobacco.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">\u201c We have already seen that he had shipped 105 hogsheads of to- \" bacco, agreeably to the covenants in the contract, for which, instead \u201c of 10/. as estimated by the contracting parties, they give him credit \" for 61.16s. lid. and the greater part of the proceeds applied to other \" purposes. But had the whole been applied in discharge of the original \u201c debt of 819/. <em>7s. 9d. </em>and <em>Baylor </em>had continued to ship tobacco till the \u201c whole was paid, with interest, he would have sustained a loss of \u201c 42/. for extra commissions, and of 3/. <em>3s. Id- </em>per hogshead on 131 \" hogsheads of tobacco, amounting in the whole to 455/. 3a. lid. and \" thus much in discharging a debt, which, with interest from the date \" of the contract, amounted only to <em>9011. 6s. 6d. </em>The loss on the sale of the trust estate, unrighteously made, cannot' with precision be \" ascertained ; but it must have been enormous, as two thousand acred \u201c of land, near the Bowling Green, in the County of <em>Caroline, </em>and ele- \" ven prime young negroes, with the increase of two families for about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>\u201c </em>five years, sold only for 9857 These calculations are made to shew f\u00a3the unreasonableness and injustice of the contract, which dire uer.es- \u00a3\u00a3 sity compelled <em>Baylor </em>to submit to. It is true, that the party in whose\u00bb <em>\u201c </em>favour the contract so manifestly appears to be, has used no <em>\u2018 </em>shift, <em>\u201c \u2018 </em>covin, <em>device, </em>or deceit, (exocpt^holding out the idea that 107 ster- \u201c ** ling' per hogshead\u2019 was to be received for the tobacco, in order to ,\u00a3 receive more than legal interest for the forbearance or giving day of *\u00a3 payment of the money in order to evade the statute, but has como <em>\u201c </em>boldly forth in dt fiance of the law, and stamped <em>usury </em>on the lace of \u00a3\u00a3 the contract, which renders it utterly void <em>ab initio. </em>From this view \u201c of the case, then, it appears to me, 1st. Th.it the contract being \u00a3\u00a3 usurious, was void in <em>itself; </em>2d. That by the original deed of 1790, <em>\u201c </em>exhibited by the appellant, and under which he claims, it appeal\u2019s? \u00a3\u00a3 clearly to my mind, that <em>James Brovin </em>was the agent of <em>Donald &amp; </em>a\u00a3 <em>Burton, </em>but, had there been any doubt on the subject, he is found by \u201c the verdict to have been their attorney; and, 3dly. That the whole \u00a3\u00a3 proceeds of the 105 hogsheads of tobacco ought to have been applied \"\u00a3 in discharge of the original debt, supposing the contract to have been. \u00a3\u00a3 a legal one.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
