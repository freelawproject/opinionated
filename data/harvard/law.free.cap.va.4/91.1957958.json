Bryant </em>and <em>Sally </em>his wife were sum-v monod to <em>Prince George </em>County Court, <em>September terra, </em>, , . <em>... </em>, , , .... J804, to shew cause, if any tney could, against its being admitted to record. The County Court, on hearing the parties by counsel, and the testimony o\u00f1 both sides, being of opinion \u201c that the nuncupative words of <em>Travis V/o- </em>\u201c <em>mack, </em>deceased, which were committed to writing within \u201c six days after the speaking thereof were, by the said u <em>Womack </em>used in his last sickness, and that he was taken \u201c sick from home, and that he died before he returned to \u201c the place of his habitation ; and also, that he called on \u25a0 \u201c <em>Edxvard Marks, gara, </em>and <em>Jemima Simmons, </em>then present, \u201c to take notice that such words were his will ; ordered \u201c the said words to be established as the nuncupative will \u201c of the said <em>Womack, </em>and that the same be recorded from which decision <em>Bryant </em>and wife appealed to the <em>J </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>District Court of Petersburg, where the said order was reversed without assigning any <em>reasons; </em>and thereupon <em>Marks </em>and wife and <em>Polly Titmarsh </em>appealed to the Court of Appeals. The record being opened here, it appeared that a <em>copy </em>of the writing exhibited as a memorandum of the nuncupative words was inserted ; but the original will was not sent to this Court. A <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>to bring up the <em>original </em>(directed to the Clerk of <em>Prince George </em>County .Court) had been awarded prior to the present terna ; but the paper had not been produced.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A1n\"><em>Hay, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqX\">insisted that the <em>original </em>must be produced. Unless the will itself were before this Court, it cannot hear witnesses ; for, in order to decide correctly in its appellate capacity it must have the same document before it which was exhibited to the Court below. If it must take up the subject on the <em>same grounds </em>as the Court below, the inference is irresistible. The will in this case was once, in the custody of the Clerk of <em>Prince </em>George, but is now lost. The only remedy to set up a <em>lost </em>will is <em>in </em>equitythe invariable practice being to bring a suit in Chancery, in such cases. Its having been recorded in <em>Prince George </em>is of no avail; for that judgment (being reversed) is now as if it never had existed. If the judgment of this Court should be that <em>the will </em>be admitted to record, how can this be done unless the paper itself be produced ? In the cases of <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Holman,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Temple </em>and <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Temple,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the original wills were seen and inspected ; and such has been tjle uujform -usage 0f this Court. The language of the law,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> \u201c when <em>any will </em>shall be produced for probate,\u201d cannot be satisfied by any thing but the production of the original.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-5\"><em>George K. Taylor, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYT\">said that, if the ' original ought to be before the Court, his clients were not to blame for its non-production. As to the loss of the will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>this Court is trying the cause <em>on the record. </em>The will <em>was </em>admitted to record, and entrusted to the Clerk to be safely kept at his peril. There is no certificate from him that it is lost <em>; </em>neither is it certain, from any thing judicially appearing, that such is the case. The only inquiry then is, whether it is, in <em>all </em>cases, necessary for this to have the original will before it. Where it is suggested that the original would throw any light on the subject, (as by interlineations, erasures, ike.) the Court will require it j but, where there is no such suggestion, it is unnecessary and unusual, in the case of <em>Richard Squire Taylor\u2019s </em>will, the original was sent for, because it was suggested that the appearance of the paper itself would show the incapacity of the testator. So in <em>Bates </em>v. Holman, inspection of the paper itself was all important: but in this case no ray of information would be received by the Court from seeing the original.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-6\">Hay. Mr. <em>Taylor </em>has very ingeniously varied the aspect of the cause.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJR\">He says there is no evidence that the will is lost. If so, then I call upon him to produce it. But he asserts there is nothing in <em>this </em>will which may not bo seen on the record. How is that known ? We wish the original will to be seen, for <em>this purpose. </em>It will appear that the person who wrote it was so ignorant of orthography, or language, that he actually <em>made </em>some words. The production of the paper itself may afford very material facte to enable the Court to judge of the ability of the writer to certify correctly the terms of the will. Suppose the paper were written with ink of different colours, and with different hands. These circumstances might weigh; and the consideration that such circumstances might exist, shows the propriety of introducing the original on all occasions, that the Court may determine upon its face.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-7\">\n<em>1 'aylot.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-q\">Why did not Mr. <em>Hay </em>move for a <em>subpeena duces tecum </em>to bring up the original, if he wanted it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-8\">judge Tucker observed, that the party appellant was bound, to produce the paper, if required. The Court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>witnesses ought to inspect the very paper. The proper course probably is to direct a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>to the Clerk of the <em>District Court; </em>for he ought to have retained it in his office. My opinion is, we should proceed no further, at present, until the original paper be produced, or the <em>subpoena </em>be returned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-3\">Judges Roane and Fleming wished to take time to consider the point; and by consent the witnesses were examined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-4\">The <em>substance </em>of the evidence (which, according to the rule of this Court, was taken down in writing in open Court) was, that the testator, being a young unmarried man, and boarding with a Mr. <em>Gary, at City Point, </em>left that place the <em>Sunday </em>before his death, on a visit to his only sister, the wife of <em>Bryant, </em>the appellee ; that he was then very ill, \u201c his disorder having begun with the ague and \u201c fever, and, from that, turned to a constant fever and sore \u201c throat;\u201d that he rode to <em>Bryant\u2019s, </em>a distance of twelve miles, and there growing worse, (with the subsequent symptom of a disorder in his bowels,) died on the following <em>Sunday ; </em>that he had been delirious, at times when the fever was on him, before he left <em>City Point; </em>and, after his arrival at <em>Bryant\u2019s, </em>was frequently delirious, both before and after his speaking the testamentary words ; but was in his senses <em>at the time </em>of speaking them, which was in the presence of <em>Edward Marks, Plenry Simmons </em>and <em>Jemima Simmons, </em>(who all concurred in their testimony as t\u00a9 this point,) and of the three appellants ; <em>Bryant </em>and wife not being present; that he called on all the persons present to take notice that what he had said was his will; (as to which circumstance <em>Edward Marks </em>and <em>Jemima Simmons </em>agreed, though <em>Henry Simmons </em>did not recollect it;) that he gave to his <em>cousin Patsy </em>Marks, wife of <em>John </em>Marks, the appellant, who had been his guardian, and for whom he expressed great regard, his negro woman <em>Sukey, </em>worth about forty-five pounds; and to his \u201c <em>poor </em>old\u201d aunt <em>Polly Titmarsh, </em>a sum of money out of his estate, to \u00bfbuy her a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>horse, (for which he said he supposed eighteen or twenty pounds would be sufficient,) together \u201c with an old field ly- \u201c ing near her house, called Hackney\u2019s, and a line to be run so as to include sixty acres of land(which last-mentioned bequest, being of <em>real </em>property, and <em>nuncupative </em>only, could not have its intended effect;) that the testator had other personal property, viz. a negro man worth about four hundred dollars, a boy worth about two hundred, and two' horses, which, together with his land, fell to <em>Bryant\u2019s </em>wife, as his nearest relation and heiress ; that he owned a hundred acres of land ; and had owned a part of another tract which <em>Bryant </em>had bought of him, and for which a part of the purchase-money was unpaid; that he owed some debts, the amount not ascertained ; that <em>Bryant </em>was in good circumstances, and <em>Marks </em>rather embarrassed ; that the testator, at the time of speaking the testamentary words aforesaid, also said that he gave to Mrs. <em>Simmons </em>(the witness) a desk, then in the room, which he pointed to and said was his, though in fact it was the property of <em>Bryant; </em>that the bequest of the desk was not committed to writing, because (as she stated on oath) she determined not to claim it, and had always said she would not <em>; </em>that <em>Edward Marks </em>drew and signed the writing; (in the form of a certificate of what the testator had said ;) that <em>John </em>Marks, the appellant, afterwards carried it to Mrs. <em>Simmons, </em>and read it over to her several times before she signed it ; which she did on the 26th of <em>October, </em>1803 ; the words having been spoken on the 21st.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b111-7\">Tuesday, <em>May </em>2d.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\n<em> 3 Hen. &amp;

The pretended testamentary words were not a good nuncupative will under our act of Assembly ;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> because . the last illness of the decedent did not commence at the place where he died; neither was he <em>taken </em>sick from home.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">2. The decedent was not sufficiently in his senses to make a will. His supposing a desk to be his which notoriously was the property of Mr. <em>Bryant </em>was a plain proof .of the wandering of his fancy and defect of his intellects.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">3. If he was in his senses, the omission to insert the desk in the written memorandum or .certificate of the will was fatal; because the <em>whole </em>of the testamentary words, or the substance thereof, should have been committed to writing within six days after making the will. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>Saturday, 3.1ay </em>13. In obedience to the writ of <em>subpeena duces tenon, </em>the Clerk of <em>Prince George </em>attended with the original will, which, on inspection, was found to have been truly copied in the record. The bequests contained in it were, in <em>substance, </em>as above mentioned in cur summary of the evidence, and no suspicious circumstance appeared on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">Thursday, <em>May </em>13. The Judges pronounced their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b113-4\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"AC_\"><em>Travis Womack, </em>a young man, un* inarried, on a <em>Sunday </em>in <em>October, 1803, having been </em>for some time in bad health, mounted his horse at <em>City </em>Point, where he resided as a boarder in the family of Mr. Garey, and rode twelve miles to the house of the appellee <em>Bryant, </em>whose wife was <em>WomacPs </em>sister, where be arrived so ill, that he took to his bed, and died the following <em>Sunday. </em>During his illness be made a nuncupative will, whereby he left a negro woman, worth about 45/. to the appellants, <em>Marks and wife, </em>which is the subject of the present controversy\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The first question which seems to have presented itself, is whether <em>any </em>nuncupative will made by the deceased under these circumstances would be valid. The doubt seems to arise from these words in ihe law. \u201c No nuncu- \u201c pative will shall be established unless it be made in the 44 time of the last sickness of the deceased, <em>at his </em>habitation, w,\u2018 or where he hath resided for ten days next preceding, ex*\u00bb <em>\u201c cept </em>where the deceased was taken <em>sick from </em>home, \u201c and dies before he returns to such habitation.\u201d <em>L. V. </em>ed. 1794. c. 92. sec. ,5. Now, as the deceased was not ten. days at the place where he died, before that event happened, and is proved to have been very sick <em>before </em>and even <em>when </em>he left his usual habitation, it seems to be questioned whether be could be said to be taken sick from home.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">I conceive it would be adhering too closely to the letter ef the law, if we were to pronounce that no nuncupative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>will made under such circumstances ought to be es&lt; tablished. The object of the law was to prevent frauds and impositions upon sick persons, by enticing them from their friends and relations, to the residence of strangers, where advantage might be taken of their weakness and infirmity; or where such pretended wills might be fabricated without the desire, or even knowledge, of the deceased, or any of his friends. The decedent in the present case, set out on a visit to his sister, arid her husband: he thought himself able to ride so far ; in this he proved not to have been literally mistaken, though probably the journey hastened his death. He was a mere <em>sojourner </em>at <em>City Point. </em>He had no mansion-house there, nor was he in the family of his father, mother, or other near relation, there. He went to the house of his nearest, or one of his nearest relations, the very persons who now contest .this will. Although he was not <em>first </em>taken <em>sick </em>there, he was taken <em>so much worse </em>than he had been before, as never to leave the house again <em>; </em>it appears to me, therefore, that the case is so far fully within the true intent and meaning of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">With respect to the sanity of the testator, and the proof that he meant to give these little tokens of his gratitude and affection to his relations, one of whom had been hip guardian, I feel not the least doubt either of his capacity^ or intention to make such a disposition, and therefore am of opinion, that the judgment of the District Court be reversed, and that of the county Court affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b114-6\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AXk\">Upon the testimony in this cause, it is dear that the testator was fully competent to dispose of his estate at the time of making the will in question; and that he made a serious and solemn disposition of the property comprised in the same, and desired the persons present to take notice thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Two objections, however, are made in point of lawj</p>\n<p id=\"Alvz\">t. That the substance of the will in relation to the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>property bequeathed by him at the time, was not reduced to writing within six days ; and, 2d. That the testator was not taken sick EROM home, and consequently had no power to make a nuncupative will under the provisions of our act.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">As to the first objection, it does not apply to this case. In this case <em>two </em>months had not elapsed between the date of the bequest and the offering the will for probate in <em>Prince George </em>Court. The act only provides that <em>after six </em>months have elapsed from the time of speaking the pretended testamentary words, no evidence shall be received to establish them, unless the testimony, or the substance of it, was reduced to writing within six day's. The reason of this is obvious; but it does not apply in the case before us <em>; </em>and, therefore, as to the desk which is said to have been bequeathed at the time, but not mentioned in the memorandum, the bequest of it might, notwithstanding, have been established as a part of the will 'ey' <em>oral </em>testimony, at any time within six months. The bequest of the desk ought, upon the testimony, to have been added to, and made part of the nuncupative will, had it been proved by two witnesses <em>other </em>than a <em>legatee: </em>but, as it is, this bequest was rightly omitted as a part of the will, because it could not have been proved, otherwise than by the testimony of the legatee herself. I infer this \u2022 nder the <em>reason </em>at least of the 9th section of the act concerning wills.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">As to the next point: under the statute of <em>Car. </em>II. in England, and our former act on this <em>subject,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>no nuncupative will is good when it is made <em>from the home </em>of the party, unless the testator has been 44 surprised., or taken 44 sick at the place where the will is made and <em>Bluckstone,</em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> commenting on the <em>English </em>statute, say s, that 44 favour should not be shewn to nuncupative wills, unless 44 the party has been <em>surprised </em>by sudden and violent 44 illness.\u201d This would seem to limit nuncupative wills made from the home of the parties to cases in which the party was <em>convalescent </em>when he left home, and was taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ill <em>for the first time </em>after he <em>had </em>left it. In our act of 178a, however, this word \u201c <em>surprisedf </em>is omitted;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> whence I infer, that a will may still be established as a nuncupative will, although the party was unwell when he left home ; if afterwards he was <em>taken </em>more dangerously ill at the place at which the will was made, and of which illness he afterwards died. I cannot on any other ground account for the omission of the word \u201c <em>surprised,\u201d </em>in the act of 1785.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">It is in proof in this case that the party was indeed very <em>unwell </em>when he left home ; but his disorder was, perhaps, only the ague and fever, which, generally, is not mortal, and he was well enough at the time, to ride twelve miles on horseback. His illness probably increased soon after his arrival at the place of his destination, and very possibly assumed its character of danger from the fatigue of the journey <em>only. </em>There is no evidence shewing that he was' taken with the <em>illness of which he died </em>prior to his leaving home, though he was then unwell; and, on this ground, I hold this will to be authorized, under the true construction of the act of Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">With respect to his bequeathing a desk which it is <em>said </em>belonged to another, it is at most only a circumstance whence to infer a state of mind unfavourable to the making of a testament: it is a circumstance which often happens with many testators who bequeath property not their <em>own; </em>and, in this case, that equivocal circumstance is outweighed by positive testimony, shewing a competency in the testator to make a will at the time in question,</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">I am therefore for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b112-7\"><em>Rev.Code, </em>vol. 1. c. 92. s. 5. p. 161.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b112-8\"><em> Ibid. </em>s. 6,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b115-10\"> <em>Rev.
