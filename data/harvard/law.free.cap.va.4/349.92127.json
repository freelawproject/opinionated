The first question was a question of fact; <em>namely, </em>whether, after the parol agreement between <em>Benjamin De Baptist </em>and his brothers, <em>John </em>and <em>William, </em>whereby he transferred to them the benefit of his purchase of the lot from <em>Head, </em>and they undertook to perform the contract on the part of the purchaser, <em>Benjamin </em>made a deed to <em>John </em>and <em>William </em>conveying to them his equitable interest in the subject? The proofs furnished reason to justify an inference, that there was such a deed executed ; but the evidence on the point, was certainly not decisive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-12\">\u2022 II. Supposing no such deed from <em>Benjamin </em>to <em>John </em>and <em>William </em>was executed, and that the transfer of the contract of purchase by him to them, was by parol agreement, the question arose, whether the statute of frauds affected the validity of the parol contract of transfer by <em>Benjamin </em>to <em>John </em>and <em>William, </em>of his equitable interest <em>in the </em>subject under the articles of agreement with <em>Head </em>?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-13\">The counsel for the appellant maintained, 1. that the statute of frauds had no manner of application to the case; that the only rights <em>Benjamin </em>had, were those he held under his executory contract with <em>Head, </em>which was in writing, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>tlie statute required; that the statute applied to the sale of legal titles, or at most equitable titles perfected, not to the transfer of executory rights under executory contracts for the sale and purchase of land$ that as the executory contract might have been rescinded or abandoned by parol, so it might be transferred from the purchaser to another by parol. But 2. if the statute of frauds applied to the case, it had not been pleaded, or in any manner relied on. And 3. if the statute applied, and had been formally pleaded, there was such a part performance by <em>John </em>and <em>William, </em>of the contract with Benjamin, whereby his contract with <em>Head </em>was transferred to them, and they substituted as purchasers of the lot in his place, as would suffice to take the case out of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-4\">The counsel for the appellee, argued, 1. that the statute of frauds invalidated the parol agreement between <em>Benjamin </em>and his brothers, <em>John </em>and <em>William. </em>For on <em>Benjamin\u2019s </em>part, it was a sale, and on theirs a purchase, of the equitable right to the lot which he had acquired under his contract with <em>Head. </em>If he had performed the contract on his part, and thus acquired a perfect equity in the subject, he would certainly not have been bound by a parol agreement to sell or transfer such an equity in land, upon the same principle that a mortgagor was not bound by a parol agreement for the sale of the equity of redemption. The distinction between the sale of an equitable right in lands under a contract of sale consummated by performance on both parts, and an equitable right depending on an executory contract of sale not yet completed by performance, was, he thought, quite too nice. 2. It was no objection to the defence founded on the statute, that it was not pleaded or relied on in the answers. It could not have been pleaded. The plaintiff did not allege in his bill, that there was a parol agreement between <em>Benjamin </em>and <em>John </em>and <em>William, </em>for the transfer of his rights to them : he alleged a written contract, and that fully executed; namely, a deed from <em>Benjamin </em>to <em>John </em>and <em>William, </em>conveying his equitable right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>to them, and the suppression of that deed. He had made out a case in proof, different from that alleged in his bill; and if the statute of frauds applied to the actual case, he could not object that it was not pleaded in defence against ^le unfounded pretensions of his bill. 3. As to part performance, he said, what had been done by <em>John </em>and <em>William </em>amounted, in effect, to no more than paying the purchase money; and it was well settled, that payment of the purchase money was not such a part performance of a contract for the sale and purchase of lands, as would take the case out of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-5\"><em>Stanard, </em>in reply, said that the reason why payment of the purchase money was not sufficient part performance to take such a case out of the statute, was, that if nothing more was done, the purchase money afforded an exact measure of retribution, and complete compensation might be given to the purchaser by refunding the money. But here, specific articles of no determinate value, bricks, were to be furnished, and worked up in the walls of a house; there was no certain measure of compensation, and justice could only be done by a specific execution of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-6\">III. There was no doubt, that all the defendants, except <em>Adams, </em>had actual notice of <em>Beck\u2019s </em>rights under the deed of trust of the 3rd April 1819; and it was contended on the one side, and denied on the other, that <em>Adams also </em>had actual notice. In truth, there were circumstances which raised a suspicion that he had ; but there was no sufficient proof of the fact. But</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-7\">IV. The counsel for the appellant insisted, that it was immaterial, whether <em>Adams </em>had actual notice or not; for be, as well as <em>Beck, </em>claimed only an equity, and <em>Beck\u2019s </em>was the elder equity. The maxim, they said, was strictly applicable, <em>Qui prior est in tempore, potior est in jure.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-8\">The counsel for the appellee said, that rule was not applicable in <em>Virginia, </em>to a case like the present, where a mortgagee was asserting his rights under the mortgage, against a subsequent fair purchaser, unless it appeared that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>the mortgage was duly recorded; for the statute was express, that all mortgages and deeds of trust, to be effectual as against such purchasers, must be recorded. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99. \u00a7 4. p. 362. And there was no certificate exhibited in the court of chancery, of the registry of the deed of trust under which <em>Beck </em>claimed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-4\"><em>Stanard </em>replied, that it was alleged in the bill, and not denied in the answers, and admitted on all hands, in the sequel of the proceedings, that the deed of trust had been duly recorded; but if it was not, that the mortgages or deeds of trust required by the statute to be recorded, were only such as passed the title in the subject.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b379-5\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO0\">There is pretty strong evidence, that before the execution of the deed of trust by <em>John </em>and <em>William De Baptist </em>of the 3rd April 1819, under which <em>Beck </em>claims, they had received from <em>Benjamin, </em>a conveyance of his equity under his contract with <em>Head, </em>and that this was shewn to <em>Beck </em>to induce him to make the loan. But I do not consider this point as material. It would only be proof that <em>Benjamin </em>had abandoned his interest in the contract to them ; and that is otherwise clearly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Subsequent to the execution of the deed of trust to <em>Beck, </em>and with notice of it, <em>Edward De Baptist, </em>another brother, received from <em>Benjamin </em>a deed for this same equity; and all the <em>De Baptists </em>joined in conveying the same to <em>Long, </em>who also had notice of <em>Beck\u2019s </em>lien. <em>Long </em>sold to <em>Adams. </em>The legal title being still in <em>Head, Beck </em>filed this bill calling for it, making the <em>De Baptists, Long </em>and <em>Adams </em>parties, and praying to subject the lot to sale in satisfaction of his debt. <em>Head, </em>answers admitting the contract, the transfer of it by <em>Benjamin </em>to <em>John </em>and <em>William, </em>and the performance on their part; (he does not in his answer, indeed, admit full payment, but it was afterwards admitted by his counsel.) In this state of the case, there seems to mo nothing for the statute of frauds to operate upon. It was not pleaded; but it was urged, in the argument, as bearing upon the transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>of the contract from <em>Benjamin </em>to his brothers <em>John </em>and <em>William. </em>But I cannot think that this is either within the words or the mischief of the statute. The contract for the sale of lands, which the statute requires to be in writing, is here, ^le contract between <em>Benjamin </em>and <em>Head; </em>which <em>was </em>reduced to writing. By furnishing the bricks, building the house, and paying the 100 dollars, <em>Benjamin </em>would have acquired a right to call on <em>Head </em>for the legal title. He transferred to his brothers, the right to stand in his shoes; that is, to do the work, and pay the money : <em>Head </em>accepted them : but this gave them nothing but the privilege of performing the conditions of the written contract; and upon such performance, an equity to call upon <em>Head </em>for the legal title to the lot; a matter (as it seems to me) wholly beside the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The only question, then, is, who has the best right to call for the legal title, which <em>Head </em>is willing to make ? <em>Adams </em>relies a good deal, in his answer, on his being a purchaser without notice : but of what is he a purchaser? Not of the legal title, but at most of an equity; which equity, if <em>Beck </em>had acquired before him he must prevail; the rule in such cases being <em>prior in tempore, potior in jure. </em>That <em>Beck </em>was first in time is admitted; but it was objected in the argument, that it no where appears, that his deed was recorded; and that being a <em>deed of trust, </em>it cannot take effect, as to a subsequent purchaser without notice, except from the time of such recording. But I think that upon this record we are bound to take this as a recorded deed. The parties on both sides have so treated it; and the fact is in no shape put in issue. There is evidence also, that it was recorded ; and that all parties knew, and never meant to question, the. fact that it was recorded. Nor was there any defence for <em>Adams, </em>so natural or ready as to have stated in his answer, that the deed had never been recorded, if the fact had been so ; but no such thing is done. Under these circumstances, I feel no doubt, that we must take this as a recorded deed; and that the plaintiff has the best right to call for the legal title, so far as is necessary to the satisfaction of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Tucker, <em>P. </em>The legal title to the land conveyed by the deed of trust, in this case, is in <em>Head. </em>There are two antagonizing claimants, each insisting on his preferable right to call for the legal title. The first is <em>Beck, </em>who claims by deed of trust under <em>John </em>and <em>William lie Baptist: </em>the other is <em>Adams, </em>who claims also under <em>John </em>and <em>William He Baptist, </em>but likewise sustains his right by claiming under <em>Benjamin. </em>Let us then contrast his rights with those of <em>Beck, </em>under both aspects of bis title.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\">1. Supposing <em>Adams </em>to derive bis right from <em>John </em>and <em>William: </em>in this aspect, he has but an equity posterior to that of <em>Beck, </em>to which it must yield, unless he can shew himself a purchaser without notice. This he cannot do, if the deed of trust under which <em>Beck </em>claims, was duly recorded. Whether it was or not, has not been put in issue; and, perhaps, we ought to take for granted, that there was no just objection to it on that score ; but it will be safest, in sending the cause hack, to leave that matter open to inquiry. If the deed was duly recorded before <em>Adams\u2019s </em>purchase, 1 am clearly of opinion, that it takes precedence of <em>Adams\u2019s </em>title, so far as that title is claimed under <em>John </em>and <em>William He Baptist.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">2. Supposing <em>Adams </em>to derive his title from <em>Benjamin He Baptist, </em>let us compare the conflicting rights of himself and <em>Beck </em>to call for the legal title. Has <em>Benjamin He Baptist, </em>or <em>Adams </em>as claiming under him, any right whatsoever to call for the title from <em>Head, </em>even if <em>Beck\u2019s </em>claim were out of the case ? I think not. For, 1. there is now no contract between <em>Benjamin </em>and <em>Head. </em>There was a contract at first, and a contract by which <em>Head </em>agreed to convey him the lot in question. But the parties had a right to abandon, waive or rescind that contract; and that abandonment, waiver or rescission, might be such as to absolve the vendor from it, and to exclude the vendee from a right to a specific performance. Has the vendee <em>Benjamin He Baptist, </em>by his acts in this case, so absolved the vendor? Can he under the circumstances, demand a specific execution by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>a conveyance to himself or to those claiming under him? He cannot; for it is proved, that in the fall after the contract, <em>Benjamin </em>called on him to transfer the contract to <em>John </em>and <em>William, </em>and it was agreed that <em>they </em>should have the contract, and build the house, which <em>he </em>had engaged to build. An indorsement was accordingly made on the contract, with the assent of <em>Benjamin, </em>though he did not sign it, and it was afterwards read to <em>John </em>and <em>William, </em>who assented to it, though they did not sign it. Yet <em>they </em>went on to do the work ; they went on to borrow money to complete the building; they went on to fulfil the contract. On what ground, then, can <em>Benjamin </em>expect the specific performance of the contract, expressly waived and rescinded by himself, and entered into with bis consent by <em>Head </em>with his two brothers. Has <em>he </em>paid any purchase money? Has <em>he </em>given any consideration to entitle him to a conveyance ? Has he fulfilled the contract on his part, so as to entitle him to demand performance from Head? By no means. He has never paid one cent; he has never given any consideration; he has never moved one step towards performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\">But suppose a specific performance decreed in his favor or in favor of his vendee: how will the matter stand with <em>Head </em>and <em>John </em>and <em>William JDe Baptist </em>? As the lot will not go to pay <em>John </em>and <em>William </em>for their work, they must either go unpaid, or they must look to <em>Head, </em>and <em>Head </em>must pay them. But as they entered upon the work, upon the faith of the arrangement made with <em>Head </em>with <em>Benjamin\u2019s </em>assent and concurrence, they must not go unpaid, while <em>Benjamin </em>gets the lot for nothing. If <em>Head </em>cannot convey them the lot, he must pay them their money. Then, how will <em>he </em>stand ? He will have conveyed away .his lot to <em>Benjamin </em>for nothing, and paid the full value of his building to <em>John </em>and <em>William, </em>who really erected it. Can this be tolerated ? Shall <em>Benjamin </em>be permitted to waive the contract in behalf of his brothers,\u2014to draw <em>Head </em>thereby into an engagement with them, and then to recant, reassert his right, get the property for nothing, and force <em>Head </em>to pay them for their la<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>bour ? It is impossible. <em>Benjamin, </em>therefore, could have no title to specific performance; and <em>Adams </em>stands but in his shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">On the other hand, <em>Benjamin </em>having assented to turn the contract over to bis brothers, and <em>Head </em>and the brothers assenting thereto, <em>they </em>became entitled to a conveyance from <em>Head </em>upon fulfilling the contract on their part. This equitable right they conveyed to a trustee to secure to <em>Beck </em>the 500 dollars borrowed of him, it seems, to enable them to comply with their bargain. This sum they must repay to <em>Beck, </em>and the lot is liable for that repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">I am, therefore, of opinion to reverse the decree and send <em>the </em>cause back for further proceedings, with instructions that <em>Beck\u2019s </em>deed of trust shall have preference over <em>Adams, </em>unless it should appear that the deed of trust was not duly recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Cabell and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred in the opinion of the president, and a decree was entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
