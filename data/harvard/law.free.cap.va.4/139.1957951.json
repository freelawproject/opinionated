The bill (which was filed in October, 1791) charges, that Major General <em>Alexander </em>Spotswood, being seised and possessed of a very considerable estate, both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>real and personal, made and published his testament and last will, whereby, among other things, he devised to his son and heir, <em>John Spotswood, </em>all his lands and working slaves <em>in tail </em>male, with several remainders over, and also all the tradesmen and servants which should be employed? or, in any way, used in and upon his mine tract ci' land at the time of his death; and appointed his wife <em>Butler, Elliott Benger </em>and <em>Robert Rose, </em>his executrix and executors <em>; </em>t^ia\u00ed:\u2019 the testator\u2019s death, the said <em>John Spotswood </em>gave to his sister <em>Dorothea, </em>a negro woman called <em>Molly, </em>_ \u00b0 17 who, proving pregnant some time after, was received by him and replaced by another, called <em>Alary Ann, </em>who was one ^le entailed slaves ; that, after the death of <em>John Spotswood, Nathaniel West </em>Dandridge, who had intermartied with the said <em>Dorothea, </em>demanded of <em>Alary Camp- </em>. <em>* j i bell, </em>the widow of the said <em>John Spotswood, AJolly, </em>with her increase, (four in number,) which she declined delivering until she should see <em>Bernard Moore, </em>the executor of <em>John Spotswood, </em>and guardian of the plaintiff; upon which <em>N. W. Dandridge </em>procured from <em>Bernard Moore </em>an \" 1 order for the said slaves, who were accordingly delivered by. Mrs. <em>Campbell; </em>that <em>Alary Ann </em>and her children, at the recluest \u00b0f <em>Dandridge, </em>were permitted by <em>BernardAloore to </em>remain in his possession, she being the wife of a negro man belonging to him; the said <em>Dandridge </em>agreeing to pay hire for her 5 that she and her children continued in the possession of <em>Dandridge, </em>under that agreement, till his death, which happened in the year , during which time she had a number of children ; that <em>N. IV. Dandridge </em>left a will, in which he appointed his son, William, and his second wife, <em>Jane, </em>executor and executrix, of whom the former only proved the will, and took possession of <em>Mary Ann </em>and her children ; and, although acquainted with the plaintiff\u2019s title, as appears by a letter from him annexed to the bill as part thereof, divided the said <em>Alary Ann </em>and her children between the representatives of his father, <em>N. W. </em>Dandridge, taking bonds to indemnify him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Against the plaintiff\u2019s claim ; that the plaintiff instituted a suit in the District Court of <em>Richmond </em>to recover the said <em>Mary Ann, </em>and such of her descendants <em>as had been re-tamed </em>by the defendants, executors of <em>Nathaniel W. Dan</em>dridge, and obtained a judgment for <em>Mary Ann </em>and her two daughters, <em>Betty </em>and Hannah, as also <em>Jack </em>and Polly, children of Betty, and <em>Polly </em>and <em>Johnny, </em>children .of, <em>Hannah; </em>that, in consequence of that verdict, <em>Wood-son </em>Payne, who intermarried with Mary, one of the daughters of <em>N. W, Dandridge, </em>delivered to him <em>Rachel, </em>another daughter of <em>Mary Ann, </em>and her two children, <em>Mtlly </em>and <em>Henry; </em>but he has received no satisfaction for the hires, which he claims from the agreement of <em>N. W. Dandridge, </em>who was to pay hire; that several of the descendants of <em>Mary Ann, </em>some of whom are named in the bill, others not known, are in the possession of <em>Patrick </em>Henry,who intermarried with <em>Dorothea, John Moores </em>who intermarried with-drma, and <em>Philip Payne, </em>who intermarried with <em>Elizabeth, </em>daughters of the said <em>N. W. Dandridge, </em>and were delivered to them by his executors; that he commenced a suit against <em>N. W. Dandridge, </em>in his life-time, for the negroes, which abated by his death ; and has since demanded them of the present defendants without success; and concludes with praying a discovery, and decree for the slaves and their profits, and for general relief.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b156-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>toHmin^del hvered certain tlaves to legatees, as ty under1 the cjucnt1 action against^him, lor other slaves which the^ testator same right, is tliougifprosei cuted to a judgment, to prevent the act of limitatious from au\u00bbwand0in voiirof the legatees.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>The answer of <em>Philip Payne </em>and Elizabeth, his wife, admits, that <em>Mary Ann </em>is the reputed mother of two slaves, given as a part of the said <em>Elizabeth\u2019s </em>portion of her father\u2019s estate, the names of whom are set forth; that, when they received them, they were unable to labour, so that the trouble of raising them was fully worth their hires ; that the respondents heard of the plaintiff\u2019s setting up a claim to the slaves, but deny that they gave any bond to the executor to indemnify him against such claim ; alleging, that the bond they gave was, in the usual form, for refunding, in case of debts ; that, as to <em>Woodson Payne\u2019s </em>giving up the slaves in his possession, they have often heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>him say that the plaintiff agreed to return them, in case he should fail in this suit, and have understood he is under a similar engagement with Mrs. <em>Dandridge ; </em>that they have understood Mrs. <em>Dorothea Dandridge </em>was entitled to a proportional part of Major General <em>Alexander Spotswood\u2019s </em>house servants, under his <em>will; </em>that none were allotted to her except <em>Molly </em>and <em>Mary Ann ; </em>and, from the great length of time which has elapsed since his death, they are now unable to prove any thing respecting it. They refer to his will, and rely upon the act of limitations in the same manner as if formally pleaded, mentioning among other things, that <em>N. W. Dandridge </em>died about the year 1785.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-9\">The answer of <em>Patrick Henry </em>and wife, is nearly the same as that of <em>Philip Payne </em>and wife. They have heard <em>N. W. Dandridge </em>and his wife say, that the negro Molly, in the bill mentioned, was the property of Mrs. <em>Dandridge, </em>under the will of her father General Spotszuood, who gave her a fifth part of his house servants ; that on her marriage with Mr.' Dandridge, Mrs. Campbell, then the wife of <em>John </em>Spotswood, and mother of the complainant, was unwilling to give up the said <em>Aiolly, </em>and prevailed on them to take the said <em>Mary Ann </em>in lieu of her ,\u2022 that, after the division of the house servants, it appeared that several valuable slaves were due to them, and, as they never could get either of them, they (after the death of the said <em>John </em>Spotswood) took back the said Molly, not in full satisfaction for their share of house servants, there being one or more then due, counting both <em>Mary Ann </em>and <em>Molly. </em>Mr. <em>Henry </em>farther states, that, being applied to as a lawyer for his advice (to the best of his recollection) in or before the year <em>1773, </em>he advised that iV. <em>W. Dandridge </em>should claim and hold <em>Mary Ann </em>and her. children, as his property, until the negroes due to him as his wife\u2019s share of the house servants were delivered up, agreeably to the will of General <em>Spotszuood; </em>that he cannot ascertain the time when the claim set up to <em>Mary Ann </em>as his absolute property commenced, but well remembers he had refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>i;o give her up to the complainant <em>before </em>he asked his ad- . Vice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aq-m\">The answer of <em>John Moore </em>and wife states, that they have heard, and believe it to be true, that <em>N. W. </em>Dan<em>tlridge, </em>deceased, and those who claim under him, have been in quiet possession of the slaves for more than twenty years since the complainant was of lull age, and refers to, and relies upon, the answer of <em>Patrick Henry </em>and wife, and the act of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">No answer was filed by <em>William </em>Dandridge, the executor. The deposition of <em>Anna Catherine </em>Moore, one of the daughters of General <em>Spotswood, </em>fully established the fact, that only two negro girls <em>(Molly </em>and <em>Lucy) </em>were allotted to her sister Dorothea, as her proportion of his slaves ; and she believed that <em>Lucy </em>never came into the possession of her said sister. Another witness, <em>Benjamin Pendleton, </em>deposed to some circumstances, (rather vague and inconclusive,) tending to shew that, between the years 1764 and 1769, <em>N. W. Dandridge </em>held a part, or all, of the negroes in dispute, by a hiring from <em>Bernard Moore, </em>the executor of <em>John Spotswood, </em>deceased. The letter from <em>W- Dandridge </em>(one of the executors of <em>N. W. Dandridge) </em>to the plaintiff, mentioned in the bill, was dated <em>December' </em>24, 1791, after this suit was brought. In that letter he said that he \u201c always thought the plain- \u201c tiff\u2019s right to <em>Mary Ann </em>and her children was undeniaw ble.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-10\">The Chancellor dismissed the bill, with costs, whereupon the plaintiff appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-11\">Williams, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-12\"><em>Munfordmd Warden, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-13\">On the part of the <em>appellant, </em>it was contended, that the possession of the slaves in controversy, by <em>N. W. Dandridge, </em>had always been <em>fiduciary; </em>that the acknowledgment by <em>William Dandridge, </em>his executor, of the justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the suit and recovery at law against him, prevented the act of limitations from being a bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-10\">On behalf of the <em>appellees, </em>it was urged, that the tes - timony to prove that <em>N. IV. Dandridge's </em>possession ever was fiduciary, was very d. fective ; that, if at any time it was fiduciary as to <em>John Spotswood </em>or <em>Bernard Moore, </em>his executor, it never was so as to the <em>plaintiff, </em>who claimed (as issue <em>in </em>tail) under his <em>grandfather's </em>will, not under <em>John Spotswood, </em>his father; that since it appeared that the negro <em>Lucy, </em>who had been allotted to <em>Dorothea Dan</em>dridge, had never been delivered, but remained with the estate, which was held by <em>John Spotswood, </em>and the bulk of which passed from him to the plaintiff, it would now be iniquitous to compel the descendants of <em>Dorothea Dandridge </em>to give up <em>Mary Ann </em>(whom it was probable she received instead of Lucy) and her increase; that, according to the maxim, <em>that ha who seeks equity must do equity, </em>the plaintiff, if he recovered the children of <em>Mary Ann, </em>should give up the children of <em>Lucy; </em>that the acknowledgment by <em>William Dandridge, </em>the <em>executor, </em>could not affect the rights of the present defendants, their claim being under the <em>testator, </em>though the property, in coming to them, passed through the hands of the <em>executor, </em>neither could the action of detinue and recovery therein, against <em>him, </em>be given in evidence against them, who were no parties to that suit, and received the slaves from him as their property, by virtue of the will of his testator, especially as the judgment against the executor was for other slaves, held indeed in the same right, but not those now held by the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-11\"><em>In </em>reply, it was said, that the legal representatives of <em>John Spotswood </em>(not the plaintiff only) were responsible for <em>Lucy </em>and her increase, if the defendants had a right to them ; that the plaintiff was certainly entitled to <em>Mary Ann, </em>as being one of the <em>entailed </em>slaves; that the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>merit </em>asrainst the <em>executor </em>bound the <em>legatees, </em>because they , . , , , necessarily claimed under him, since they could not get their legacies without his assent.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b161-4\">Saturday, <em>October 7.</em></decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AyS\"> On <em>Sunday </em>the 30th day of <em>July, </em>1809, Judge Lyons, late President of the Supreme Court of Appeals, departed this life, in the <em>seventy-fifth </em>year of 1 . , <em>r&gt; ,t </em>consists of three his age.

Admitting that the 44 possession of <em>N. W. Dandridge </em>was fiduciary, so far as 41 it respected <em>John </em>Spotswood, (father of the plaintiff,) or \u201c <em>Bernard </em>Moore, executor of the said John, yet, inas- \u201c much as the plaintiff claims, not under his said father, 44 but as heir in tail under the will of his grandfather, 14 <em>Alexander </em>Spotswood, the possession of <em>N. W. Dandridge </em>54 ceased in the year 1785, and <em>this suit </em>was not instituted \u201c till October, 1791, there were more than five years ad-44 versary possession in the defendants, which is a com-44 p\u00edete bar to the plaintiff\u2019s title.</p>\n<p id=\"Auz\">44 This being the opinion of the Court, and decisive of 44 the cause, it seems unnecessary to investigate its merits <em>; </em>44 in which there appeals much cquhv in Savour of the de44 fendants ; and I shall only add that the decree is Ar-44 FIRMED.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
