In the other account, raised between <em>Miller\u2019s </em>estate after his death and <em>Bridges Sf Robertson, </em>the first item was dated in October <em>1814, and </em>the last in August 1816 : and in this account, <em>Miller\u2019s </em>estate was charged with the balance due from him in his lifetime, and some other moneys which became due after his death, in consequence of dealings which commenced in his lifetime, and also with all the moneys disbursed for the estate, by <em>Bridges </em>who was <em>Miller\u2019s </em>administrator; as having been in fact disbursed by <em>Bridges &amp;f Robertson; </em>and the estate was credited with the moneys received by <em>Bridges, </em>the administrator, for <em>Miller\u2019s </em>estate ; shewing the balance of 2837 dollars claimed in the petition, as due <em>Bridges &amp;r Robertson. </em>In the first of these accounts, there, were seven charges, amounting to more than 1800 dollars, for advances by <em>Bridges &amp;f Robertson </em>to take up notes and acceptances of <em>Miller; </em>and, in the last, charges to the amount of 744 dollars, for a note of <em>Miller </em>for 698 dollars, with interest and charges of protest, paid by <em>Bridges Robertson </em>after <em>Miller\u2019s </em>death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\">The escheator pleaded the act of limitations, in both cases, to which the petitioners replied, that the accounts concerned the trade of merchandize between merchant and merchant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">In the case of <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>administrator, there was no evidence to prove, that either <em>Lyle M\u2019 Creedie, </em>or <em>Miller, </em>during the time of the dealings between them, were merchants, and no other evidence of the character of the dealings between these parties, but that which the account furnished. In <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>case, there was proof, that from the year 1803, <em>Miller </em>was engaged, principally, as a mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>chant in trade, and that, for some years previous to his death, he was engaged in speculations in the produce of the country, and in the manufacture of cotton cloth; but the only proof that the dealings between these parties, were dealings between them as merchant and merchant, was that furnished by the accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-4\">Each of the petitioners verified the allegations of his petition by his own affidavit: each of them, moreover, adduced affidavits of witnesses to prove the justice of his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">The evidence of the claim of <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>administrator was quite sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">The evidence of <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>claim consisted of the affidavit of a witness, proving, 1. That the witness had compared the accounts filed by the petitioner with the books of <em>Bridges &amp;f Robertson, </em>and found the <em>greater part </em>of them charged in the hand writing of one <em>Scott, </em>a clerk of the house (who had since gone to <em>Scotland, </em>and was reported to be dead), though the witness could not designate which of the items were in <em>Scott\u2019s </em>hand <em>writing; </em>and that a <em>small part </em>in the commencement of the account, was entered on the books in the hand writing of <em>Triplett, </em>another clerk of the house, who was now a resident of <em>Kentucky. </em>2. That <em>Bridges Robertson </em>did, within the knowledge of the witness, advance considerable sums of money for <em>Miller, </em>and that he died indebted to them to a large amount, besides the two notes filed in the cause. 3. That <em>Bridges fy Robertson </em>paid one note of <em>Miller, </em>indorsed by them, for 200 dollars, due at the <em>Farmers Bank </em>on the 3rd September 1814. And 4. That <em>Bridges, </em>as <em>Miller\u2019s </em>administrator, after his death, took up another note of <em>Miller </em>for 698 dollars, by giving <em>Bridges &amp;f Robertson\u2019s </em>note for the same amount, which was charged to <em>Miller\u2019s </em>estate, in the second account of <em>Bridges fy Robertson </em>filed in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">It was proved, that <em>Miller\u2019s </em>personal estate was not sufficient to pay the claims of the petitioners or any part thereof.

Whether there was sufficient proof, that <em>Miller </em>did not leave sufficient personal estate to pay the debts claimed by the petitioners, respectively, or either of them ? 2. Whether there was sufficient proof that the accounts of the petitioners, or either of them, were such accounts as concerned the trade of merchandize between merchant and merchant, within the meaning of the statute of limitations, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7\u00bb4. p. 488 ? \u201c there being no other evidence of the nature and character of the claims, respectively, except the face of the accounts, and the affidavits; though the original existence of <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>accounts, as it <em>respected, </em>the negotiable notes, was not denied.\u201d 3. Whether, under the circumstances of these cases, the statute of limitations was pleadable in bar of the claims of the petitioners, or of either of them ? and 4. Whether upon the whole case, judgement should bo given for the petitioners, or either of them, or for the escheator ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">The county court adjudged, in the case of <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>administrator, that the escheator should pay him 131 dollars, with interest thereon from the 1st September 1806, till paid, and his costs, out of the proceeds of <em>Miller\u2019s </em>land, in his hands; and, in <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>case, that the escheator should pay him 2837 dollars, with interest thereon from the 1st September 1816 till paid, and his costs, out of the proceeds of the escheated land, or so much thereof as should remain after satisfying the debt adjudged to <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>From these judgements, <em>Watson </em>the esebeator appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed them; and then he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-4\">The causes were argued here by the <em>attorney general </em>for the appellant, and by <em>Taylor </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-12\">I. The first question was, whether there was proof of <em>Miller\u2019s </em>personal estate being insufficient to pay the debts? But of this there was hardly room to doubt; and the court had no doubt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-14\">II. The next question was, whether the debts claimed by the appellees, respectively, were proved ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-15\">There was no doubt, that that claimed by <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>administrator, was proved. But, as to the debt claimed by <em>Robertson, </em>the <em>attorney general </em>said, that (excepting the two notes for 200 dollars and 698 dollars) the evidence was too vague to prove any thing. The witness said that the <em>greater part </em>of the items were entered in the hand writing of one clerk, but instantly contradicted himself by admitting that he could not designate the items entered by him, and that a <em>small part </em>were entered in the hand writing of another clerk; so that it was impossible to understand which were the items, to which the proof of entry in the hand writing of the clerks, applied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-16\"><em>Taylor </em>answered, that the claim of the creditor was verified by his own affidavit; which was all that the statute in such cases required. Then, there was the affidavit of the witness, the obvious meaning of which was, that all the items were charged in the hand writing of the two clerks, the <em>greater part </em>in that of one, and a <em>small part </em>in that of the other; and when he said, that he could not designate which of the items were charged in the hand writing of <em>Scott, </em>his meaning was, that, though he had examined the'books, and found the <em>greater part of </em>the items charged in <em>Scott\u2019s </em>hand writing, yet, not having the <em>books, </em>but only the copy <em>of </em>the <em>accounts </em>filed in the cause, before him, at the time of his affidavit, he could not <em>then </em>designate the items entered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>Scott. </em>There were charges in the two accounts, for notes and acceptances of <em>Miller </em>taken up by <em>Bridges fy Robertson, </em>to the amount of more than 2500 dollars; the original existence of which (it was expressly stated in the case agreed) was not denied ; and surely this fact, coupled with the other evidence, was enough to prove a debt to as large an amount as that which the county court adjudged to this creditor. At all events, the claim was proved to the amount of the notes and acceptances; and if the judgement was wrong in giving the whole balance claimed, this court, proceeding to give the judgement which the court below ought to have given, ought to give judgement for the amount that was proved. Besides, the escheator did not contest the original justice of the claim ; he rested his defence wholly on the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-13\">The <em>attorney general </em>replied, that the last point submitted to the court by the case agreed (namely, whether judgement ought to be given for the petitioners, or for the defendant) presented the question whether there was sufficient proof of the claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-14\">III. The third point was, whether these were accounts concerning the trade of merchandize between merchant and merchant, within the meaning of the exception in the statute of limitations ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-15\">The <em>attorney general </em>argued, 1st, As to the case of <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>administrator, that it was well settled, that the exception in the statute applies only to <em>open, current </em>accounts, not to <em>stated, </em>accounts, or to notes or bills. 2 Wms. Saund. 127. note 6. <em>Ramchander </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>2 Johns. Rep. 200. The account of <em>Lyle &amp;f M'Creedie </em>was not an <em>open, current </em>account; the debits were very few, and there was only a single credit, and that for the proceeds of a bill of exchange; and the last item was dated as early as 1806. The dealings then ceased, and the account was closed; it was thenceforth, in effect, a stated account; and the statute of limitations began to run. Besides, there is no evidence in the case of <em>Lyle's </em>administrator, that <em>Miller, </em>the debtor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>was a <em>merchant; </em>nor is there any thing in his dealings with <em>Lyle M\u2019 Creedie </em>at all peculiar to mercantile business. 2ndly, In <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>case, the last account (that raised between <em>Miller\u2019s estate </em>after his death, and <em>Bridges &amp;f Robertson) </em>certainly was not an account between merchant and merchant. And in the preceding account, of dealings during <em>Miller\u2019s </em>lifetime, many of the largest debits were charges of notes and acceptances of <em>Miller, </em>taken up by <em>Bridges &amp;f </em>Robertson, all of which constituted liquidated demands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-5\"><em>Taylor </em>answered, 1st, That the account on which the claim of <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>administrator was founded, was not the less an open or current account, because the dealings had ceased : the distinction was between <em>open or current </em>accounts and <em>stated </em>accounts: <em>stated </em>accounts were such accounts only as have been, in some way or other, settled between the parties; all other accounts were <em>open or current </em>accounts. It was true there was no evidence filed by <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>administrator, to prove that <em>Miller </em>was a merchant; but the fact was proved by the evidence filed in <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>ease; and by the case agreed in <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>case, the evidence in <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>was made evidence in <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>also. Here, then, were dealings between merchants; one party advancing cash to the other, and not buying, but taking, a bill of exchange from him, the proceeds of which when received were to be put to his credit. This transaction was, in its character, peculiarly mercantile. 2ndly, The account of <em>Bridges fy Robertson </em>with <em>Miller </em>in his lifetime, was plainly an account between merchant and merchant, unless the advances of cash by merchant to merchant in a course of dealing were contrary to the mercantile character of the transaction; which he thought it impossible to maintain. The charges for <em>Miller\u2019s </em>notes and acceptances, were not for his notes and acceptances to <em>Bridges Sf Robertson, </em>but for cash advanced by them to take up his notes and acceptances to others. But, he insisted, the act of limitations could, in no view, be a bar to <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>claim. The oldest <em>item </em>in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>first account of <em>Bridges fy Robertson </em>was dated in 1811; and <em>Miller </em>died in 1814, that is, within five years; so that there was, then, no bar to a claim against <em>Miller\u2019s </em>administratar, and he appropriated <em>Miller's </em>assets to it. Upon that grgj accolint) and upon the second account raised after <em>MilJer\u2019s </em>death, no claim could be asserted for payment out of the proceeds of his land, tili the land was escheated and sold, and the proceeds in the escheator\u2019s hands. Therefore, the statute of limitations could not begin to run for the escheator, until the escheat, which took place in 1817; and <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>petition was filed within five years after, namely, in 1821. The uniting of the two claims, on the account against <em>Miller </em>in his lifetime, and that against <em>Miller\u2019s </em>estate, was not improper in this case; for the statute, which gave this summary proceeding by petition, directed that the court should proceed to judgement according to the right of the case; a phrase always used in our statutes, to dispense with technical forms.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-5\">IV. The <em>attorney general </em>contended, that the escheator might properly avail himself of the statute of limitations in his defence. The statute which gave the remedy against him, directed, in general terms, that he should defend the claims; and thus authorized and required him to make any and every defence which might affect the legal justice of the claims. The escheator, in effect, represented the estate of the deceased debtor; for, notwithstanding the escheat and sale of the land, if any heir of the decedent should after-wards appear within <em>ten </em>years, and prove his right, he would be entitled to the net proceeds of the sale, by the new provision of the statute, enacted in 1819, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 82. \u00a7 19. p. 298.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-6\"><em>Taylor </em>answered, that the escheator represented the commonwealth, and as the statute of limitations did not run against her, so neither was it an available defence for her. The provision of the statute which gave the remedy against the escheator, was enacted in 1804: Sess. Acts of 1803-4, eh. 77. \u00a7 3. Before that statute, the creditors of a dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>dent whose lands had escheated to the commonwealth, always applied by petition to the legislature, for payment of their debts, out of the proceeds of the escheated lands; and if an heir appeared after the opportunity for assertiug his rights at law had gone by, he also applied by petition to the legislature, for the money. They were both applications to the equity of the government. If the creditor proved his debt, it never was heard that the legislature rejected his petition, because he had not come within the time of limitation of actions; and in reference to the possible future claim of an heir, it never was imagined, that he had a better claim on the equity of the government, than a creditor whose claim was just, though it had not been asserted within the statute of limitations. The only object both of the statute of 1803-4, which gave the remedy to the creditor against the eseheator, and of the new provision of 1819, which gave the remedy for the heir, if one should appear, was, to provide a judicial remedy, iu place of the petition to the legislature; and the intent was, that justice should be administered by the courts upon the same principles on which it had always been administered by the legislature. The legislature never intended, that the eseheator might avail himself of the defence of the statute of limitations, to which it had never paid the least respect in its dispensations of equity, in such cases; that the eseheator might avail himself of that statute, which the debtor himself might never have chosen to plead. And, he said, the statute of limitations had never been held an available defence <em>for </em>any one but the debtor himself or bis representatives. Upon this principle, in <em>England, </em>though none but a creditor can sue out a commission of bankruptcy, it was no objection to the commission, that the claim of the petitioning creditor was more than six years old ; <em>Quantock &amp;c. v. England, </em>5 Burr. 2008. <em>Mavor &amp;c. v. Pine, </em>2 Carr. Payne, 91. 12 Eng. C. L. R. 41. But if the statute of limitations was an available defence for the eseheator, from what time did the statute run in respect to him ? Certainly, only from the time when the proceeds of the escheated land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>came to his hands, since, until then, the creditors could institule no judicial proceeding. Otherwise, if the escheat was delayed (as was very often the case) for more than five years after the decedent\u2019s death, the remedy of every creditor by sjmp]e contract would be barred. The creditors, in thepresent cases, being simple contract cr\u00e9ditors, they had no claim for satisfaction out of their deceased debtor\u2019s land. Their right, as well as their remedy, to get satisfaction out of the land, was given by the statute; and, by the statute, neither the right nor the remedy accrued till the proceeds of the escheated land had been collected by the escheator. Both of the creditors in these cases, resorted to their remedy within five years after the escheat; and, therefore, the defence of the statute of limitations failed as to both.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\"> The statute provides, that \u201c When any person shall die indebted, seized of lands which shall become escheated to the commonwealth, not having personal property sufficient to pay such debts, the creditor may exhibit his petition before the court of the county or corporation, in which such es-cheat shall take place, or in the superiour court of law for such county, making the escheator of sucli county or corporation a party defendant, who shall defend such claim; and the said court shall proceed to judgement according to the right of the case, and render the same for such sum as shall appear to be due to such petitioner, if any thing; and it shall be the duty of such escheator, on such judgement being rendered, to satisfy and pay the amount thereof, if the proceeds of the sale he sufficient, and yet in his hands; and if the same shall be paid into the treasury, the auditor shall, and is hereby required, on a copy of such judgement, properly authenticated, being filed, to issue a warrant; and the treasurer shall pay the amount, or so much as has been received on account of such sale: <em>Provided, </em>That the slaves and other personal estate shall he previously applied in the payment of the debts of the said decedent, and that every such creditor shall annex an affidavit to the said petition, stating that the amount of his or her demand is <em>bond fide </em>due and owing at the time of preferring the petition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\"> The reporter states the eases, in this particular, as the president of the court seems to have understood them. As the reporter understands the records, <em>each </em>case (and especially <em>Lyle\u2019s) </em>was submitted upon the evidence filed in <em>loth, </em>so as to make the evidence in each evidence in the other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b270-4\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AVL\">The claims of the petitioning creditors to have satisfaction out of the proceeds of the escheated lands, are resisted on two grounds\u2014that the debts are not proved; and that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">1st, As to <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>case, the court holds that the debt is sufficiently proved ; and the only questions in that case are those which arise out of the plea of the statute of limitations. To the defence founded on the statute, two answers have been given : 1. that the escheator as representing the commonwealth, cannot plead the statute; and 2. that the account is between merchant and merchant, and not within the bar of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In deciding the first of these questions, I do not think it necessary to examine, generally, whether the commonwealth is within the statute of limitations. I incline to think she is not. But, in this case, the statute has constituted the escheator the defendant in the action, and has directed that he shall <em>defend </em>the suit. That defence is not against a claim exhibited against the commonwealth, but against the estate of a decedent, escheated to the state, which the liberal spirit of our laws permits to be charged with any just demands against that decedent. Of these claims the common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u2022wealth and her officers have, and can have, no personal knowledge. Whether they were just in their origin, or have been paid, may be, and in the nature of the thing, must usually be, unknown to them ; and if paid, it may be out of their power to furnish the evidence, either oral or documentary, to establish the payment. The papers of the decedent do not fall into the hands of the escheator; and where he leaves no heirs and no personal estate, there is no one on whom the duty would devolve, of preserving the vouchers which might prove the satisfaction of a demand. Cases like this call most loudly for the protection of the statute against stale and antiquated claims; and if there be any instance, in which we are to make a practical application of the principle, that cases within the mischiefs of a statute, are to be regarded as embraced by its provisions, that instance is afforded here. The petition, indeed, is not one of the actions designated in the statute ; but it is precisely analogous to the action of <em>assumpsit </em>upon a merchant\u2019s account; and in the same spirit in which a court of equity regards the statute as running against a bill, though bills are not mentioned in the statute, a court of law ought to regard it as running against this petition, which is, in effect, an action to recover the amount of an open account. The object of the statute was to limit <em>stale demands </em>of certain descriptions (accounts among others) whatever might be the nature of the suit instituted for their recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">It is said, indeed, that no one can plead the statute of limitations, but a party to the transaction, and cases under the bankrupt laws in <em>England, </em>have been cited to sustain the position. It is unimportant to examine those cases here. Nothing is better established, than that where an executor declines, as he may do in his discretion, to plead the statute, a creditor of the estate may, nevertheless, insist upon it before the master; <em>Ex parte Dewdney, </em>15 Ves. 498. It would be strange indeed, if it were otherwise; for when there is likely to be a deficiency of assets, those who are interested in them ought to be at liberty to protect them by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>every legal defence. So here, the commonwealth, having <em>, , </em>liberally admitted demands upon the land, it is at least reasonable that those demands should be clearly established, and that she should be permitted, through her escheator, to protect the estate from unjust claims, by the same defences the decedent\u2019s administrator would have had. Or, considering her in the light of an heir or mortgagor, against whom a simple contract creditor seeks to marshal the assets, she would be entitled through her officer to the defence of the statute. So, if before this statute, the lands of a mortgagor had escheated to the commonwealth, and the mortgagee being paid out of the personalty, the simple contract creditors had sought to charge the land, there can, I think, be no doubt that the commonwealth, standing in the shoes of the mortgagor, would have a right to the defence of the statute of limitations. But the case here, is infinitely stronger. The commonwealth, through her officer is here, in part, in a fiduciary character. By her law, notwithstanding the es-cheat and sale of the land, and the payment of the proceeds into the treasury, any person shewing title to the land may at any time within ten years assert his <em>claim; </em>and if it be established, shall be entitled to receive the net proceeds of the purchase money. The commonwealth, then, stands here as the representative of the estate. The defences of the estate, by her officer, are indeed, in the first instance, defences of her own right, but they may peradventure turn out to be defences of the rights of some unknown heir. She must, therefore, be looked on as to these defences, as defending for the heir, and as entitled to plead what an heir might rely on, who was resisting an attempt to charge his land with a simple contract debt, by a bill to marshal assets. I am therefore of opinion, that the plea of the statute of limitations was an available plea in this case, unless the appellees can bring themselves within the exceptions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">This is attempted by replying, that the account is an account between merchant and merchant concerning the trade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>of merchandize; and the influence of this replication is resisted on two grounds (in the case of <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>administrator), 1st, It is said, that cases of notes and bills are not within the exception. But this is not an action upon a bill or <em>note; </em>the bill was <em>sold by Miller, </em>and the full amount being eredited, it must be presumed to have been paid. There is then no demand upon the bill. The demand is for the excess of the account <em>above </em>the bill. 2ndly, It is said, this is an account stated or closed in 1806. But, though the <em>dealings </em>then ceased, the account is not for that reason an account stated. An <em>account stated </em>is where the accounts between the parties have been either actually settled, or are presumed to be so from the circumstance of a party\u2019s retaining, for a long time, without objection, the account of the other party, which has been presented to him, shewing a balance against him. By the settlement (or implied admission which is considered equivalent) it has become an ascertained debt. All intricacy of account, or doubt as to which side the balance may fall, is at an end; and thus the case is neither within the letter nor the spirit of the exception. 2 Wms. Saund. 127. d. e. note 7. <em>Freeland </em>v. <em>Heron &amp;c. </em>7 Cranch, 147. The cases have indeed been contradictory as to the question, whether open accounts are or are not barred (though they be between merchant and merchant) where the last item is above five years standing. Chancellor <em>Kent </em>is in favor of the bar in such cases; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>5 Johns. C. R. 522. and a like opinion is intimated in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Pengree, </em>6 Ves. 580. <em>Duff </em>v. <em>East India Co. </em>15 Ves. 198. <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>18 Ves. 286. Yet in <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Hodgson, </em>19 Ves. 179. 185. the whole matter seems to be again unsettled in <em>England. </em>But in <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>Willson, </em>5 Cranch, 15. the supreme court was clearly of opinion, that it is <em>not </em>necessary that any of the items, in the case of merchants\u2019 accounts, should come within the five years. This is, I think, the reasonable doctrine ; for otherwise, there is no perceivable difference between merchants\u2019 accounts and others; since, even between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>common persons, if there be items within five years, the \u2022 \u2022 statute does not bar. See also <em>Catling </em>v. <em>Skoulding, </em>6 T. R. 189. 192.</p>\n<p id=\"A5X\">In <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>case, then, I do not think the <em>bar </em>would apply strictly as such, if the replication were true. But what evidence is there in this case, that the account concerned the <em>trade </em>of <em>merchandize </em>between <em>merchant and merchant </em>? Absolutely <em>none. </em>There is no proof that the parties were <em>merchants; </em>and the account contains no charge of merchandize.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In this case, then, the bar, I conceive, is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Then, 2ndly, As to <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>case. This, though less exposed to the objection of the staleness of the demand, is yet more fundamentally defective than the other. Its defects are in the proofs of the demand, and the nature of the claims. The proof of the demand is altogether defective, because it is certain that the <em>whole </em>account is <em>not </em>proved, and it is uncertain to what part, or to what amount, the proof extends. The witness swears, that the <em>greater part </em>of the items were charged by <em>Scott, </em>and that a <em>small part </em>was charged by <em>Triplett; </em>of the rest there is no proof. Can we divine <em>what </em>items were entered by these two clerks? Or can we ascertain, from this vague testimony, how much their charges will amount to in the aggregate ? It is impossible. If so, then it may be that the very entries made by these witnesses may have been those which related to the bills and notes, and which may, therefore, probably be unprotected by the exception in the statute; or those which were made after the intestate\u2019s death, which for other reasons may be objected to. And, moreover, as the aggregate amount of what was entered by those clerks is not proved, it is not perceived how the sum could be ascertained for which the judgement should have been entered. Accordingly, we find, the court, being unable to distinguish, gave a judgement for the <em>whole </em>account, whereas it is <em>very </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>clear </em>that the whole account was not proved. I am, there-<em>f, c </em>. . .... . . . . . tore, o\u00ed opinion, that m this case also the judgement is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"Axc\">Believing it possible that something may be due in <em>Ro\u00edertson\u2019s </em>case, I have reflected upon the practicability of sending the cause back for further proceedings. But as the case is at law and not in equity, I do not see how it can be done. The parties have put their rights upon this issue and this evidence; and they must abide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Judgements reversed in both cases, and petitions dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-11\"> There was one charge for goods sold; note by reporter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
