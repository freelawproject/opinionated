and Held, upon all the circumstances of the case, that there was nothing in the proceedings of the arbitrators to invalidate the award.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-7\">In two actions, one of <em>debt </em>and the other of <em>assumpsit, </em>brought by <em>Yancey </em>against <em>May, </em>in the hustings court of <em>Richmond, </em>the parties (after a very long and tedious litigation) agreed to refer the controversy to arbitrators; and rules were entered by consent in both suits, at November term 1829, submitting the matters in difference between them in the two cases, to the final determination of <em>Samuel Dunn </em>and <em>Preston Smith, </em>whose award (or the award of their umpire in case of disagreement) thereupon, should be made the judgement of the court; the arbitrators to proceed on the Saturday following, at the city hall, with power to adjourn &amp;c. till the award should be completed, without further notice to either party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-8\">On the 16th January 1830, the arbitrators made an award, stating that they had proceeded, according to the order, after giving due notice to the parties, to receive the testimony offered by them, both being present; and \u201cafter receiving from each party a full statement and hearing thereupon,\u201d they awarded to the plaintiff <em>Yancey, </em>in the action of <em>debt, </em>245 dollars, with interest &amp;cc. and the costs of the suit, and in the action of <em>assumpsit </em>227 dollars (without interest) and the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-9\">This award having been returned to court, a motion was made by the defendant <em>May </em>to set it aside, on the ground of misbehaviour of the arbitrators; and the evidence he offered to sustain this motion, was the testimony of the two arbitrators themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-10\">1. <em>Dunn </em>stated, that the arbitrators met at the time and place appointed in the order of submission : that both parties were before them, and exhibited certain papers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>made explanations concerning the casos : that the arbitrators thought they had all the evidence before them, and that the parties were ready for their decision : that after a consultation between the arbitrators ou the subject. <em>May, </em>who lived in a distant county, said to them, that if they should not make up their award whilst he was in <em>Richmond, </em>he wished them not to come to any conclusion until he could appear before them again, for the purpose (as <em>Dunn </em>thought at the time, and yet thought) of making further statements and explanations : that the arbitrators did not inform <em>M.ay, </em>that a further day for him to appear before them would not be allowed, nor was any period designated at which the parties should appear before them again : that the award was not made up during <em>May's </em>continuance at <em>Richmond: </em>that probably, it would not have been made up before the quarterly term of the court in February 1830, but that they were pressed by <em>Yancey </em>to proceed; and they concluded the business without having the parties again before them : that in the latter part of January <em>Dunn </em>received a letter from <em>May, </em>dated <em>Staunton, </em>25th January 1830, in which <em>May </em>said\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-4\">\u201cAs to the reference in the cases of <em>Yancey </em>against me, I must request, that you take the papers from <em>Mr. Smith, </em>as you are so much engaged in the day, and after you are quite satisfied, return them to him, if you and he think he had best keep them; then I must request, that you and <em>Mr. Smith </em>will not have a final meeting until I come down, as I am satisfied that I had better see that a full and fair explanation is given, and you know that as <em>Yancey </em>did not attend at the <em>Washington </em>tavern, I would not stay in the room with you and <em>Mr. Smith. </em>I do expect <em>Mr. Smith </em>has looked over the papers, and heard all <em>Yancey </em>had to say; and from what you know of the matter, you will think I ought to be heard by myself or counsel; and you know 1 could not get any meeting for that purpose, except at the <em>Washington, </em>when I would not attend, after <em>Yancey's </em>writing that he would not attend there; and so I left <em>Richmond </em>for home, with the expecta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>tion that you would not make up an award until February court, or near that, when I intend to come down, and will be willing to have an end of the matter, as soon as I can be heard before the arbitrators, either by myself with <em>Yancey, </em>or both have counsel\u2014I don\u2019t care which. Should he <em>be </em>desirous of having the matter done with sooner, I have no objection, after your taking all the papers to yourself until you are satisfied, and then have a day fixed when you would meet and determine, when our counsel are to attend with you, though I expect you will not take it up until I come down. If you do, I must get the favor of you to tell <em>Mr. Daniel, </em>that I request him to attend for me. As to what <em>Mr. Anderson </em>says, you recollect he was not positive, whether I said that I would not charge any rent until he got possession, or something about the title. You can see, that in January <em>Yancey </em>wrote to me, that <em>Binford </em>said he should not get possession of the <em>Goochland </em>land; he then went up, and got it, and rented it out. After that, in April, he came down, and gave me the obligation for rent, commencing the 1st January 1819; and I went on to pay him off all that I ought. You see, when the conversation passed, he did not expect to get the possession of the <em>Goochland </em>land, and I must have had to look to some one for it. I went up to see <em>Mr. Binford </em>as soon as I received <em>Yancey\u2019s </em>note, and told him what I had understood from <em>Yancey, </em>and that I did not care which way, as he <em>Binford </em>was good to me for the rent; when he said he never said any such thing, nor made no such pretensions. I wish before you act to get <em>Mr. Bin-ford\u2019s </em>testimony about that, and about the insurance &amp;tc. <em>he. </em>Please let me hear from you in a few days, and oblige your friend &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-4\"><em>Dunn </em>proceeded to testify, further, that on receipt of this letter, he communicated its contents to <em>Mr. Daniel (May\u2019s </em>counsel) and informed him, that the award had already been made and returned: that he also conferred with the other arbitrator, <em>Smith, </em>who said he had already had trouble enough with the business, and should do nothing more in it: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>that he informed <em>May, </em>that the award had been made and returned before his letter was received : that afterwards, and before February term 1830, <em>May </em>exhibited evidence to him, which if it had been shewn him before he made the award, would have intirely changed his opinion, unless it had been counteracted by other evidence : that he asked <em>May </em>why this evidence had not been sooner exhibited; and he said he had overlooked it, and had not found it till after his first appearance before the arbitrators: that the opinion of the arbitrators was formed, principally, on the evidence of a single witness (.flnderson) upon a particular point in controversy, which it was necessary to settle before they entered into any investigation of the papers laid before them : that when the parties were before the arbitrators, they both expressed a wish, that the arbitrators should proceed to decide the case at once, upon the evidence then adduced; neither party intimating that he had any further evidence to offer; and <em>May </em>expressing his willingness that the decision should be made, if it should be made when he was in <em>Richmond </em>and present, though he said, at the same time, he should have been glad to have <em>Binford\u2019s </em>evidence : that the claim preferred by <em>Yancey, </em>which <em>May </em>alleged that <em>Binford\u2019s </em>evidence was necessary to explain, was in fact allowed to <em>Yancey </em>by the arbitrators; it was an item in his account of eleven dollars: that when the parties were before the arbitrators each accused the other of a desire to delay the case. <em>Dunn </em>further testified, that he had informed <em>May, </em>that the award would not-be made and returned till near the February term ; and it was only in consequence of the earnest request of <em>Yancey, </em>made to the arbitrators when <em>May </em>was not present, that it was concluded and returned sooner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-5\">2. The other arbitrator, <em>Smith, </em>testified, that the parties were both before the arbitrators at their first meeting, from which they adjourned to the <em>Washington </em>tavern : that the witnesses were examined in the presence of the parties, and the papers of both were exhibited; and <em>May </em>handed in a paper containing his views of the case : that he <em>(Smith) </em>be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>lieved that all the evidence was before the arbitrators, otherwise he would not have proceeded to an award ; he understood that both parties left the arbitrators, with the expectation that the award would be made upon the evidence and explanations then given; and the arbitrators agreed to proceed to make up the award as soon as they could, without any further meeting of the parties, or explanation from them: that, according to his recollection, no formal proposition was made by <em>May, </em>that the award should not be made up during his absence from <em>Richmond, </em>and he expressed no wish to be heard again; he thought he should remember such a circumstance, if it had occurred ; he remembered, that <em>May </em>said he would be glad to have <em>Binford\u2019s </em>testimony, but he did not ask a continuance for the purpose of procuring it, and he appeared to be willing to go on with the case, without <em>Binford's </em>testimony: that the evidence was examined first by him, and then by Dunn, separately, till the mind of each was satisfied : that it was true the award was made up sooner than otherwise it would have been, in consequence of the importunities of <em>Yancey; </em>but he was not permitted to converse with them on the merits; he once commenced a conversation of the kind with <em>Smith, </em>but <em>Smith </em>stopped him, and he did not attempt it again.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-4\">Upon this evidence, the hustings court overruled <em>May's </em>motion to set aside the award, and entered judgements according to it. <em>May </em>appealed to the circuit court of <em>Henrico, </em>which affirmed the judgements. And then he applied to this court for writs of <em>supersedeas; </em>which were allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-5\"><em>Daniel </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-z\">said, that the courts had been very liberal in their indulgence to awards, in respect of mistakes of fact, or even of law, imputed to the <em>arbitrators; </em>but in cases in which awards were impugned on grounds of misbehaviour of the arbitrators, they had proceeded on different principles, and examined the conduct of arbitrators with great strictness. It was not necessary to convict them of corruption, or of any decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>partiality. If the arbitrators do any thing improper, or omit , t \u2022 \u2022 t , , .u to do what propriety requires; it they hear evidence they ought not to hear, or refuse to hear proper evidence when offered; if they fail to perform any of their functions; and, particularly, if they act in such a manner as to surprize either party, and thus in effect to do him injustice; in such cases of misbehaviour, they said, the award ought to be set aside. They cited <em>Burton </em>v. Knight, 2 Vern. 514. <em>Harris </em>v. Mitchell, Id. 485. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Coryton, </em>cited in <em>Earle </em>v. <em>Stocker, </em>Id. 251. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Frobisher, </em>6 Ves. 70. and <em>Graham's adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Pence, </em>6 Rand. 529. And they endeavoured to shew, that the conduct of the arbitrators, in this case, had had the effect of a surprize upon <em>May; </em>for, they argued, it had given him reason to expect, that he should have an opportunity of being heard again, before the award was finally made up. And the only reason which induced the arbitrators to disappoint that expectation, was the importunity of <em>Yancey, </em>in the absence of <em>May. </em>It was wrong in them to listen to his importunities; much more to yield to them, after they had given <em>May </em>reason to expect a further hearing. It appeared too, that <em>Yancey </em>had commenced a conversation with the arbitrator <em>Smith </em>alone, on the merits, which <em>Smith </em>put a stop to, because he thought it improper; but he must have said enough to shew, that what he was saying was not proper for the arbitrator to hear; and so far, at least, that arbitrator heard that which it was improper that he should have heard, and which might have had an undue influence on his mind.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-7\"><em>Gustavus Myers </em>and <em>Scott, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjcS\">entered into a minute examination of the evidence of the arbitrators, concerning their own proceedings, and maintained that there was no colour for the charge of impropriety in their conduct. Their argument turned, almost intirely on questions of fact; for, they said, every case of this kind must stand on its own peculiar circumstances, so that the adjudication of one case afforded no rule for the decision of another; and hence it would be found, that the authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>cited for the appellant were wholly inapplicable. They cited <em>Ringer </em>v. <em>Joyse, </em>1 Marsh. 404.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b392-9\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL9\">I have examined the evidence of the arbitrators with great care, and I cannot discover any thing in their conduct, which, according to the principles laid down in <em>Graham, </em>v. <em>Pence, </em>and the cases there cited, can be held to amount to misbehaviour. In the case of <em>Walker v. Frobisher, </em>cited at the bar, the arbitrator, after hearing a good deal of evidence, gave notice to the parties, that he should hear no more, in which they acquiesced ; but, afterwards, he examined three witnesses on one side, of which he gave no notice to the other party; and for this lord <em>Eldon </em>(while he acquitted the arbitrator of all intentional wrong) decided, that, on general principles, the award must be set aside. In <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Pence, </em>the arbitrators had a meeting, and the defendant asked a continuance <em>for </em>an absent witness, which the arbitrators granted, and then determined to have nothing further to do with the case, and drew up a writing to that effect, which they communicated to the parties; but, after-wards, the plaintiff had a private, <em>ecc parte </em>conversation with one of the arbitrators, and prevailed on him to resume the arbitration, and then gave notice to the defendant to attend at a certain time and place: the defendant went, and protested against the arbitrators acting further : he said they had divested themselves of all authority, and that they must return that fact to the court; and so <em>left them. They </em>notwithstanding this went on, and made up an award against the defendant without having his defence, or evidence before them; and for this the court set aside their award. But what have the arbitrators done, in the case before us, which in any respect resembles this ? what act that looks like partiality or a departure from duty? The parties were before them; had a full hearing; submitted their evidence, and were willing that the award should then be made. The arbitrators, however, were not ready: they required time to satisfy themselves. <em>Dunn </em>says, that <em>May </em>expressed a wish, that if <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>arbitrators did not decide before he left <em>Richmond </em>(he living in <em>Staunton) </em>they should not make up their award until he could be again before them; but <em>Dunn\u2019s </em>understanding of this was, not that he wished to introduce further evidence, but merely to make further remarks and explanations. <em>Smith, </em>the other arbitrator, says, that he heard no wish expressed by <em>May, </em>to be heard again, and that he does not think he could have forgotten such a circumstance; that both parties left the arbitrators with the expectation that the award would be formed upon the evidence and the explanations then given; and both arbitrators agree, that they gave no promise, nor appointed any future time, for another hearing. Now, suppose <em>Dunn\u2019s </em>recollection perfectly accurate, to what does it amount ? merely, that <em>May </em>wished (if they did not then decide) to make further arguments before them. Did this wish impose an obligation on the arbitrators, to hear him further ? Surely not, unless they should find it necessary to their decision. But the arbitrators agree, that their first intention was to make up the award, so as to be ready for the February term of the hustings court; and that they, being much pressed by <em>Yancey, </em>departed from -this intention, and made it on the 16th January. Was there any misbehaviour in this ? I cannot think so. <em>Yancey </em>had no conversation with them on the subject matter of the arbitration : he merely expressed the wish, that whatever was to be done, might be done without delay: he claimed a sum of money, which to him, no doubt, seemed considerable : he had been at law for it many years: and under these circumstances (though it might not be very delicate) it was quite natural, that he should press to have the business finished. But the arbitrators do not intimate, that this urgency caused them to hurry over or slight the business at all. The first hearing, when the parties were before them, was in the first week of December; and they did not make their award till the 16th January, nearly six weeks after. Surely, this was time enough; and they tell us, they had the documents, first before the one, and then the other, till they were satisfied; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>then met, and made the award. As to the letter written by <em>^-ay </em>t0 <em>Dunn\u2019 </em>that can have no effect on the case. It was not written till the 25th January, sometime after the award was made and returned to the clerk\u2019s office; and even in that letter, he speaks of no new evidence. It consists almost intirely of a long argument on the merits of the case, very improperly addressed to one of the arbitrators. As ' little influence is due to the declaration of <em>Dunn, </em>that <em>May </em>had since shewn him evidence, which, if it had been before him, would have changed his opinion, unless counteracted by other evidence ; for, in the first place, the question before us, is as to the misbehaviour of the arbitrators, upon which this evidence, never before them, can have no bearing; and secondly, if we could be at all influenced by this evidence, it ought to have been filed in the cause. We can never agree, to take the opinion of the arbitrator as to it. Upon the whole, I can see nothing like misbehaviour in the arbitrators, or injustice to the defendant, and am clear that the judgements should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Cabelu and Brooke, J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Tucker, <em>P. </em>said, he inclined to the opinion, that the judgements were erroneous; but as the other judges were clearly of opinion that they were right, and as the question, in his view of it, was a question of fact on the evidence, it was unnecessary to assign the reasons on which his impressions were founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Judgements affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
