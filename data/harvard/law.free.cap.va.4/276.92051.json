The declaration alleged, that <em>Raynolds </em>having sued out a <em>capias ad respondendum, </em>in an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>against one <em>Hooker, </em>on which appearance bail was required by an order of a justice of the peace of <em>Frederick, </em>this process, with an order requiring bail, was put into the hands of one of <em>Gore\u2019s </em>deputies to <em>be </em>executed, and <em>Hooker </em>was by him thereupon arrested; and that the sheriff did not faithfully perform the duty imposed on him by the order requiring appearance bail. The negligence imputed to the sheriff, in the two material counts, was\u20141. that the appearance bail he took, was insufficient; an'd 2. that he took an imperfect bail bond, not obligatory on the person whom he accepted as appearance bail, and so, in effect, failed to take bail at all. By reason whereof, though the plaintiff recovered judgement by default against <em>Hooker </em>and the appearance bail returned by the sheriff, she failed in recovering the amount adjudged to her against them. To these two counts <em>Gore </em>pleaded the general issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>At tlie trial, the plaintiff filed two bills of exceptions to in- . . structions given by the court to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqm\">1. The first stated, that the plaintiff gave in evidence tlie record of her action against <em>Hooker, </em>by which it appeared, that the sheriff returned upon her process against him, that lie had executed the same, and that one <em>Russell </em>was the appearance bail; whereupon regular proceedings were had against <em>Hooker, </em>and <em>Russell </em>as bis appearance bail3 judgement by default was recovered against them for the damages assessed in a writ of inquiry, upon which a <em>fieri facias </em>was sued out against both jointly, and proved unavailing. But the plaintiff did not, at any time, during the pendency of her suit against <em>Hooker, </em>take any exceptions to the sufficiency of <em>Russell </em>as his appearance bail in that suit. Whereupon, the court, on the motion of <em>Gore\u2019s </em>counsel, instructed the jury, that even if they should find that <em>Russell </em>was insufficient bail at the date of the bail bond, yet, as to that point, they should find for <em>Gore, </em>upon the issue joined upon the first count in the declaration above stated, because <em>Raynolds, </em>having failed to take exceptions to the sufficiency of <em>Russell, </em>as appearance bail for <em>Hooker </em>in her action against him, during the pendency thereof, within the time prescribed by the statute,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> could not now in this action against the sheriff, take advantage of the insufficiency of the appearance bail taken by him in the action against <em>Hooker: </em>to which opinion the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ar8\"><em>2. </em>It appeared by the other bill of exceptions, that the name of <em>Russell </em>was not inserted in the body of the bail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>bond taken and returned by the sheriff in <em>Raynolcls\u2019s </em>action <em>\" ** </em>against <em>Hooker: </em>the bail bond ran thus\u2014\u201c Know all men by these presents, that we <em>W. Hooker </em>and -- are held and firmly bound unto <em>Joshua Gore </em>sheriff of <em>Frederick\u201d </em>&amp;e. But the bond was signed, sealed and <em>delivered by Russell, </em>and was a regular bail bond in all respects, except that <em>Russell\u2019s </em>name was not inserted in the blank. Whereupon, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved the court to instruct the jury, that this was not the bond of <em>Russell, </em>because his name do where appeared in the body of it, and that if it was not <em>Russell\u2019s </em>bond, they ought to find for the plaintiff, in this action, on the issue joined on the second count above stated. But the court refused to give such instruction; and instructed the jury, on the contrary, that though <em>Russell\u2019s </em>name did not appear in the body of the bond, yet not being excluded from it, and having been executed by him, it was his bond; and further, that, as the plaintiff in her action against <em>Hooker, </em>had proceeded on this bond as <em>Russell\u2019s bond, </em>and <em>recovered </em>judgement against <em>Hooker </em>and <em>Russell </em>as his appearance bail, which judgement was still <em>in full </em>force, it was not competent to her, in this action, to call in question the validity and effect of the bail bond. To this opinion also the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-7\">There was a verdict and judgement for the defendant; from which the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-8\"><em>Nicholas </em>argued, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9d\">that, at common law, an action on the case lay against a sheriff for any default in the performance of his official duty, and, in particular, for neglecting to take bail when required, and of course, for taking insufficient bail; and that the proceeding against the sheriff given by the statute of <em>Virginia, </em>in case of insufficient appearance bail taken and returned by him, did not deprive the plaintiff of his common law remedy, if he chose to resort to it. As to the objection to the validity of the bail bond, because the name of the bail no where appeared in the body of it, he cited <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Tiernans, </em>4 Rand. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>177. where it was held, that a bail bond blank as to the \u2022 sum to be paid, was a mere nullity ; and <em>Smith v.
