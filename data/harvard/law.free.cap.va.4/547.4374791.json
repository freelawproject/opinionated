The first was for larceny, in stealing a slave named <em>John Henry, </em>the property of <em>William H. Roy. </em>The second was for feloniously carrying or causing to be carried the said slave from the City of <em>Richmond </em>to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>county of <em>Hanover, </em>without the consent of the master, with intent to deprive the said master of the said slave. The third was for enticing and advising the said slave t0 abscond from his master, with intent to defraud and deprive the master of his slave. The plea was, not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Axd\">On the trial, the Commonwealth proved that on Sunday the 25th of July 1847, the prisoner got on the cars at <em>Richmond, </em>and when asked by the conductor of the train for his ticket, he replied that he had not taken any, as he expected two of his negroes to get on the cars some nine miles above the city; which negroes were to come from the county of <em>Fluvanna. </em>On arriving at the Hungary depot, nine miles from the city, the prisoner got out of the cars and looked around for the negroes, but not seeing them, he returned and said he would wait until he got to <em>Taylorsville, </em>and if the negroes did not join him there, he would go on to <em>Fredericksburg, </em>and wait for them at that place. The negroes did not appear at <em>Taylorsville; </em>and the prisoner then paid his passage to <em>Fredericksburg, </em>and went on to that place. On arriving at <em>Fredericksburg, </em>the prisoner remarked to the conductor of the train, that he might want to return the next day, if the negroes did not arrive in <em>Fredericksburg; </em>and requested the conductor to point him out to the depot agent at <em>Fredericksburg, </em>that he might secure his return at the usual rate of return passengers; and this was done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-6\">It was further proved that the agent of <em>Roy, </em>for hiring -out the negro <em>John Henry, </em>in the City of <em>Richmond, </em>having seen the negro in custody in the City of <em>Richmond, </em>on the evening of the 25th of July, was induced, by what he heard, to go the next morning to <em>Fredericksburg, </em>where he found the prisoner under arrest ; and the prisoner there stated to him, that a man by the name of <em>Allen, </em>was to have brought two negroes to the prisoner from <em>Fluvanna, </em>which negroes the pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>soner had agreed with a man in <em>Richmond </em>named <em>Win-free, </em>to take to <em>Alexandria, </em>to a relative of said <em>Winfree; </em>that <em>Winfree, </em>who had employed him to take the two negroes, informed him that they were under a deed of trust, and that the object was to get them out of the way to prevent a difficulty which was likely to arise ; and that <em>Winfree </em>was to give the prisoner 200 dollars for the trip. The witness did not know whether the negro <em>John Henry </em>was one of those referred to by the prisoner; nor could he undertake to identify the persons alluded to by the prisoner as those found in custody in <em>Richmond, </em>of whom the negro <em>John Henry </em>was one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-4\">The Commonwealth then introduced another witness, who stated, that on Sunday the 25th of July, he was at the Junction in the county of <em>Hanover, </em>on the Richmond and Fredericksburg railroad, and about two o\u2019clock his attention was directed to a white man in company with two negroes, whose name the witness afterwards ascertained was <em>Allen; </em>one of which negroes the prisoner in Court admitted was <em>Roy's </em>negro, <em>John Henry. </em>Witness advanced towards them, and held a conversation with the white man. The witness was then about to detail the conversation and declarations of the man <em>Allen, </em>when the prisoner, by his counsel, objected to the testimony, and moved the Court to exclude the declarations of <em>Allen, </em>on the ground that there was no evidence before the Court to prove a conspiracy or connection between the prisoner and <em>Allen. </em>But the Court overruled the motion and admitted the evidence; and the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-5\">The jury found the prisoner guilty on all the counts of the indictment, and fixed the term of his imprisonment in the penitentiary at five years; and assessed a fine upon him under the second count, of 100 <em>dollars; </em>and the judgment of the Court was accordingly. Thereupon the prisoner applied to this Court for a writ of error, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b570-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>Gilmer, </em>for the prisoner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b570-7\"><em>The Attorney General, </em>for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b570-11\">Smith, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ATR3\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">It is the unanimous opinion of the Judges of this Court, that the decision of the Circuit Court, admitting the declarations of the man <em>Allen </em>to be given in evidence, was erroneous, there not being sufficient proof of a conspiracy or connection between him and the prisoner, to justify the giving of his declarations in evidence. The judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore reversed, and a new trial awarded; on which trial, the declarations of <em>Allen </em>are not to be given in evidence, unless a sufficient foundation is laid therefor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
