And then he adduced testimony, proving that <em>Elizabeth Keen, </em>the executrix, being possessed of a bond executed to her testator, which was then in suit, and holding an attorney\u2019s receipt for the same, the bond being filed among the papers in the suit, told the plaintiff that he might have the bond, and gave him the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>attorney\u2019s receipt for it. And then the defendant shewed, <em>J </em>1 . that he was the administrator <em>de boms non </em>with the will annexed of <em>Elisha Keen, </em>and the executor of <em>Elizabeth Keen. </em>Whereupon, his counsel moved the court to instruct the jury that the gift made as above mentioned, if without consideration, was void in law, and that the plaintiff was not entitled, in consequence thereof, to recover the proceeds of the bond in this action; but the court refused to give such instruction. The defendant excepted to the opinion; and appealed from the judgement to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-8\"><em>Rhodes, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axs\">argued, that the gift of the bond by <em>Elizabeth Keen </em>to the appellee, under which he claimed, being a mere parol gift, without actual delivery to the donee of the thing given, could not pass the title to him; and that the delivery of the attorney\u2019s receipt for the bond, was not tantamount to actual delivery of the bond. The possession of the attorney\u2019s receipt, did not authorize the appellee to demand of the attorney, either the bond itself, or the proceeds of it, when collected ; it was nowise an assignment of \u2022the bond. He cited <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>2 Leigh 337. <em>Irons </em>v. <em>Smallpiece, </em>2 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>Ald. 552. <em>Bunn </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>7 Taunt. 244. 2 Eng. C. L.

Stu. 239.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-9\"><em>Taylor, contra, </em>maintained, that the delivery of the attorney\u2019s recepit for the bond was equivalent to the delivery of the bond itself; it was a symbolical delivery of it. There can be no doubt it was so intended, since there was no other imaginable purpose for which it could have been delivered. And the bond not being in the actual possession of the donor at the time, but being filed in court, the only mode of delivering it, was by delivering the attorney\u2019s receipt for it, to the donee. He cited, and examined, <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Pendleton, </em>6 Rand. 473. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>Prec. in Chan. 300. <em>Drury </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 P.

Ewing, </em>upon the authority of many cases there cited. The question is, has there been such delivery here? In contracts of <em>sale, </em>a constructive or symbolical delivery is sufficient to pass the right to the chattel sold, and put it at the risque of the vendee : the cases cited in <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Pendleton </em>prove this. But lord <em>Hardwicke, </em>in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>denies (as a general proposition) that such delivery is sufficient to render a gift valid. There are many things, of which actual, manual tradition cannot be made, either from their nature, or their situation at the time : it is not the intention of the law, to take from the owner the power of giving these : it merely requires that he shall do what, under the circumstances, will in reason, be considered equivalent to an actual delivery. Thus, in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Selby, A. </em>called up two of his servants, and sent for his relative Mrs. W. who had been his housekeeper many years, and to whom he had by his will given <em>\u00a3 </em>500. and said, in their presence, \u201c I give to my cousin Mrs. W. this hair trunk, and all that is contained in <em>it\u2022\u201d </em>and he delivered her the key thereof, and bid the servants take notice and remember it &amp;,c. Three years after, A. made another will by which he gave Mrs. W. <em>\u00a3 </em>1000. but took no notice of the gift of the trunk. He died scon afterwards; and four days after, upon opening the trunk in the presence of several persons, there was found in it several rings, pieces of gold, and among other things a <em>tally upon the government </em>for <em>\u00a3 </em>500. This was considered a sufficient delivery of the <em>tally, </em>though the subsequent will was taken as a satisfaction. Upon this case, lord <em>Hardwicke, </em>in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>comments thus: \u201cThe only case in which such a symbol seems to be held good, is <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>but I am of opinion, <em>that </em>amounted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>same thing as delivery of possession of the tally, provided it was in the trunk at the time. Therefore, it was rightly compared to the cases upon <em>21 </em>Jac. 1. <em>Ryal </em>v. <em>Rowles </em>[1 Atk. 165.] and others. It never was imagined on that statute, that the delivery of a mere symbol, in the name of the thing, would be sufficient to take it out of that statute: yet notwithstanding, delivery of the key of bulky goods, where wines &amp;c. are, has been allowed as delivery of the possession, because it is the way of coming at the possession, or to make use of the thing: and therefore, the key is not a symbol, which would not do.\u201d In <em>Noble </em>v. Smith, chief justice <em>Kent </em>says, <em>\u201c </em>The cases in which the delivery of a symbol has been held sufficient to perfect the gift, were those in which it was considered equivalent to actual delivery; as the key of a trunk, of a room, or of a warehouse, which was the true and effectual way of obtaining the use of the subject.\u201d Upon these authorities, and the reason of the case, I am of opinion (though certainly not without doubts) that the delivery of the receipt, accompanying the gift of the bond, made it a valid gift. The bond itself <em>could not be </em>delivered : it was in court; in the custody of the law. The receipt was its representative. We must presume it described the bond accurately, and stated that it was received <em>to be </em>put in suit; and that when collected, the attorney would account for it. As in the case of the key, the delivery of this receipt, <em>\u201c </em>was the true and effectual way of obtaining the use of the subject.\u201d Speaking from my own experience, I should say an attorney requires no better order for the payment of money he has collected on a bond, than the receipt he has given for the bond : when he takes this in, with a receipt upon it for the money, he feels himself safe. I think, therefore, the circuit court did not err in refusing to give the instruction to the jury asked by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Cabell, J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Brooke, J. I think the circuit court was clearly right in refusing to give the instruction to the jury. A parol gift of a personal chattel, is distinguishable from a sale, in this, that until it is perfected by the delivery of the article or of some equivalent for it, the donor may retract the gift. The old common law on this subject, differed much from the rule of the civil law, which seems to have been adopted by the judges in <em>England, </em>from a pretty remote period. In <em>Clayton </em>135. it was said, that if A. being at <em>York </em>gives a horse to J. S. he may have <em>trespass </em>for the horse: or, as is said 6 Bac. Abr. Trover. C. p. 683. if the person, in whom there is a general property'in goods which lie at <em>York, </em>give them to J. S. who is in <em>London, </em>and before he obtains possession of <em>them, </em>a stranger converts them, J. S. may have <em>trover </em>for them. But this doctrine has been long since changed, and the rule of the civil law preferred. By the common law, <em>trover </em>will not lie until the property is changed; and the decisions have settled, that a gift without delivery or some equivalent does not change the property. As long as the donor may retract the gift, the donee can have no action concerning it.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The gift, in the case before us, was proved to have been made by <em>Mrs. Keen </em>to the appellee; and the attorney\u2019s receipt for the bond, the subject of the gift, then in suit, was delivered to the donee. This was as effectual as the delivery of the bond itself. The attorney was bound to respect his receipt: he could not have refused to pay the money collected on the bond, or to deliver the bond itself, if demanded, to the donee. In the case of <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>the doctrine is very fully examined by lord <em>Hardwicke. </em>That was the case of a donation <em>causa mortis </em>of receipts for South Sea stock, which was held invalid. His first objection was, that there was but one witness, whereas the civil law, from which the doctrine was taken, required five; but this he did not rely on. In conclusion, he said, that the gift there was merely legatory, and amounted to a nuncupative will, and contrary to the statute of frauds. He seems to admit the authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>of <em>Selby v. Jones, </em>where a tally for <em>\u00a3 </em>500. was given by the delivery of the key of a trunk, in which it was found ; though he intimates, that lord <em>Cowper </em>went, in that case, on the ground of a satisfaction or ademption. This doctrine was examined by this court, in <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>where it is said that there is no distinction between gifts <em>causa mortis </em>and gifts <em>inter vivos </em>(like that now before us), except that in the former case, the gift does not take effect until the death of the donor, in the latter, it takes effect immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Judgement affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
