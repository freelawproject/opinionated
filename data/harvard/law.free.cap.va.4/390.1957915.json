They had long been in treaty for the land; a considerable degree of anxiety was manifested by <em>Yancey to </em>possess it; <em>I.ewis </em>always wishing to sell <em>by the </em>acre, and <em>Yancey </em>to purchase <em>in gross. At </em>length a bargain was concluded, by which <em>Yancey </em>was to pay <em>Lewis </em>500/. for the land included within certain specified lines, without mentioning the quantity, or the price, per acre. All the payments were made except the last; when <em>Yancey </em>filed a bill to be relieved from a judgment recovered for the sum due, on the ground, that about one hundred acres of the land within the specified boundaries, were waste and unappropriated; that an entry had been made by <em>John </em>Yancey, a brother of the complainant, and a grant obtained ; but that grant was not produced, neither was there any <em>proof </em>of an <em>actual evic</em>tion, nor of a superior title to that of Lewis, in any other person, though it was <em>alleged </em>that it existed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-4\">It is neither charged in the bill, nor is there any evidence of fraud or concealment on the part of <em>Lewis. </em>He appears to have been ignorant that the title was incomplete j the papers concerning which were returned to the register\u2019s office before his father\u2019s death, though the time for the emanation of a patent had not elapsed. <em>Yancey </em>had married his sister, was left executor of his father\u2019s estate, and guardian to the infant children, of whom <em>Lewis </em>was one. The laud in controversy was devised to Lewis, by the will of his father; and, as he states in his answer, Yancey, from his relation to the family, and his agency in the affairs of the estate, was better acquainted with, the title papers than he was, and actually commenced the treaty for the purchase of it, before <em>he </em>was of age. <em>Tan oafs </em>anxiety to possess the-land was so great, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>when <em>Lewis </em>was only about seventeen or eighteen years old, he made application to him, to promise and engage to sell him the land when he should attain his full age, using many powerful arguments to induce him to do it; such as having lent him <em>{Lewis) </em>money during <em>his </em>minority, which would have been lost had he died under age; and, finally, that unless he <em>{Tancey) </em>could get the land, he should be compelled to remove, with the <em>sister </em>of <em>Lewis, </em>to some other part of the country; his tract of land being too small for the accommodation of his family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-4\">Various <em>circumstances </em>were relied on by the appellee, (to prove that <em>Tancey </em>had, or ought to have had, a more accurate knowledge of the situation and boundaries of the land than the appellee himself possessed,) which are minutely detailed in the opinion of Judge Tucker, and therefore need not be repeated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-5\">The County Court of <em>Rockingham </em>perpetuated the injunction ; but on an appeal taken by <em>Lewis, </em>to the Superior Court of Chancery for the <em>Staunton </em>district, it was dissolved, and the bill dismissed: whereupon <em>Tancey </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-6\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant, argued,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVG\">that as the language of the deed from <em>Lezvis </em>to <em>Tancey </em>was explicit, in conveying the land by certain metes and bounds, <em>Lewis </em>ought not to be received to say, that he meant to sell any less quantity. This would, in effect, be <em>to </em>substitute parol testimony to contradict the plain words of a deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-7\">There is no circumstance, said Mr. <em>Call, </em>from which fraud on the part of <em>Tancey </em>could even be inferred; much less is there any proof of it. The allegations of the answer not being responsive to the bill, are not evidence; and they are not supported by a single deposition.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>Randolph </em>and <em>Wirt, </em>for the appellee, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag-\">that <em>Yancey, being </em>a plain tiff in Chancery, was hound to shew every thing stated in his bill, or it should be dismissed. The <em>gist </em>of <em>Yancey\u2019s </em>complaint was, that by a paramount title, he had lost <em>130 </em>acres of the land bought of <em>Lewis. </em>This is alleged to be in <em>130 </em>acres acquired <em>by John Yancey ; </em>but there is no <em>proof </em>of the existence of a superior title in <em>John </em>Yancey, or in any other person. Nothing but actual <em>eviction </em>should entitle the appellant to the final relief which he now asks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-6\">Suppose this Court should act on the principle that <em>Layton Yancey </em>had lost the land by <em>John Yancey\u2019s </em>paramount title, and afterwards <em>John Yancey\u2019s </em>title should be tested and found <em>against him, </em>will not <em>Layton Yancey </em>thus get his injunction perpetuated, and the land also ? But, if the Court would not require a sentence of actual eviction, surely they will require <em>some proof </em>of <em>John Yancey\u2019s </em>title; which has not been shewn. But, in fact, the defective title complained of does not exist.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-8\">On the <em>circumstances, </em>they contended, <em>Layton Yancey </em>was not entitled to relief. In three months after the works were returned to the register\u2019s office, he became proprietor of all the papers, by being executor of the appellee\u2019s father, and guardian to the infant children, of whom the appellee was one. If, then, there were any neglect in perfecting the title, it was imputable to the appellant alone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-9\">Again, the deed from <em>Lewis </em>to Yancey, was founded on the statement of <em>Yancey himself </em>who had all the title papers, and the best opportunity of knowing the situation of the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-10\">Another circumstance ought to have great weight. The location on part of this tract, was made by <em>John Yancey, </em>a brother of the appellant, partly by a warrant furnished by the appellant himself, who appears to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>been officious in taking the papers from the surveyor,, and carrying them to the office, in order0to perfept the title. '&lt;</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b410-5\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"AMQ\">The object of the appellant\u2019s bill of injunction, was to be relieved against a judgment at law on a bond given in part of the purchase of a tract <em>of </em>land sold to him by the appellee, with warranty, by certain metes and bounds in the deed expressed, within which there was a deficiency of about one hundred acres, for which the appellee had not obtained a patent, though apparently entitled to one under the will of his father, whose title to a patent for the same, as far as appears to the contrary, was, as far as depended upon him, complete at the time of his death, though the six months required by law for a survey to remain in the office, had not then elapsed-</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The father of the appellee, in his will, makes mention of his leaving both patented and unpatented lands, constitutes the appellant his executor, and expresses his peculiar confidence in him in the management of the trust reposed in him, and in the <em>peculiar </em>care he hopes he will take of his younger children, to whom he most earnestly recommends them.</p>\n<p id=\"AIHr\">There is no charge, neither is there any proof of. fraud, imposition, or concealment, at the tiine of the bargain, (which appears to have been many years in contemplation of the appellant,) at least, on the part of the appellee. The desire of the latter to sell <em>by the itere, </em>and the former to purchase <em>in gross, </em>are circumstances which tend to confirm tb,e idea, that the transact tion on the part of the appellee was perfectly fair and unimpeachable ; and that he was perfectly ignorant that he had not a <em>legal </em>title to that part of the lands fop which his father had taken all necessary steps to obtain a patent in his life-time, and probably was prevented from so doing, only by his death. Whether the appe\u2019i<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>lant was equally ignorant, is not altogether so clear to my mind. The trust reposed in him creates a presumption that he might, perhaps ought, to have informed himself of circumstances which regarded the interest of his testator\u2019s estate, and his children committed to his care. The contiguity of his own land to that which he sought to purchase, and his having been present at a survey thereof, made by his testator\u2019s direction in his life-time, strengthen this presumption. His locating the spot; then withdrawing his location, and suffering it to run out of date ; succeeded by the location of his <em>brother </em>on the part of his <em>own </em>warrant, connected with this bill of injunction, are all circumstances which bear a <em>suspicious </em>aspect at the least. The rejection of the appellee\u2019s offer to rescind the contract upon being paid the money he had received, is by no means calculated to dissipate or repel these grounds of suspicion. And if he did indeed declare that he would not take more than double the money he was to give for the whole, at the very time he was complaining of the deficiency, it must be admitted that lie was more willing to ask, than to <em>do </em>equity. It is unnecessary to decide whether all these circumstances taken together, ought not to preponderate against his claim for <em>relief; </em>because he has, in fact, <em>shewn no </em>eviction, <em>nor any Superior title in any other person. </em>The appellee\u2019s title against the Commonwealth, for any thing appearing on this record, is indisputable, and requires nothing but the actual emanation of a patent to render it complete, both at law, and in equity. No entry or location made subsequent to the death of his father, can affect it, unless for some cause for which a <em>caveat </em>might have been entered. Nothing of the kind is even alleged, much less <em>proved. John Yancey\"s </em>location, if actually made, (which certainly does not appear in such manner in the record as to be available,) does not appear to .have been perfected or proceeded upon. I therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>^infc the Chancellor\u2019s decree, dismissing the bill of in* junction, ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Judge Roane concurred in affirming the decree of tho Superior Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Judge Fleming also concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">By the whole Court, the decree of the Superior Court of Chancery for the <em>Staunton </em>district affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
