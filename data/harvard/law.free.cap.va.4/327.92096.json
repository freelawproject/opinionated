But he denied, that the county had ever been, as the plaintiffs alleged, divided by the school commissioners, into two districts, according to the provisions of the statute of February 1829, to amend the several acts concerning the literary fund, though the county of <em>Essex </em>had anciently been divided into two parishes, called <em>South Farnham </em>and <em>St. Anri's, </em>the lines of which were still well known, and his testator in his lifetime resided in the latter parish. And he insisted, that there was no such body of men, known to the law, as <em>\u201c </em>the school commissioners and their successors of <em>South Farnham </em>district, <em>Essex </em>county ;\u201d and that the legacy to them in his testator\u2019s will, was void for uncertainty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-6\">There was no replication to the answer; and the cause was heard, by consent, on the bill, the will therewith exhibited, and the answer : whereupon the court decreed, that the defendant should, out of the assets of his testator in his hands, pay the legacy of 1000 dollars to the plaintiffs. The defendant applied to this court for an appeal from the decree ; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIZt\">said, that the statute of 1828-9, Supp. to Rev. Code, ch. 28. \u00a7 1. p. 40. authorized the school commissioners of any county, if they thought proper, to divide their county into districts, of not less than three nor more than seven square miles; but <em>Essex </em>county had never been so divided into districts; there was no such district as <em>South Farnham, </em>which was only the name of an ancient parish. There were not, and could not be, any school commissioners for <em>South Farnham district; </em>first, because there was no such district; and next, because, if there had been, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the school commissioners never were, and could not be, appointed for a particular district, but always for the whole county, uuder the provisions of the general statute concerning the literary fund, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 33. \u00a7 13-19. p. 87-89. Neither were the school commissioners a body corporate : they had no law to govern them in the administration of any fund for the education of the poor, except that part of the literary fund, and the proceeds of glebe lands, dedicated by law to that object: so that, in the administration of private donations, they would be governed by no other law than that which would govern any other individuals. The school commissioners, in the administration of the fund cofhmitted to them by law, were to select objects from any part of their county, in their discretion. There was, he said, no legal method of ascertaining the \u201c poor children of <em>South Farnham </em>districtand this case fell within the principles ou which the case of <em>Gallego\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Atto. General </em>was decided, 3 Leigh 450.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-6\"><em>Briggs, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiS\">said, it was true, that the school commissioners were not a body corporate, that they were appointed for the whole county, not for particular districts, and that <em>Essex </em>county might not have been formally divided into districts; but he thought it would be quite too technical, to disappoint the charity of the testator on such grounds. For, as he was, in his lifetime, one of the school commissioners, and died in the office, his very will shewed, that the county had been, in fact, divided into districts, and that he knew it; and, applying the words of the bequest to the known state of facts, his obvious purpose was, to give the legacy to the school commissioners of the whole county, to be appropriated to the education of the poor children of <em>South Farnham </em>district, in which he resided. And then, the whole question was, whether the school commissioners could take as such ? Why not ? They were a body of men known to the law; they were, especially, a body of men known to the testator; they were school commissioners for the <em>whole </em>county of <em>Essex, </em>and therefore, for each and every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>part of it; for <em>South Farnham </em>as well as the other parts of the county. The testator had a right to give his property to them, if he pleased, and to rely on them to execute the trust he thought proper to repose in them, whether the law c[large\u00bf them officially with the execution of such a trust, or not. The court, if it saw fit, might require security from them for the faithful administration of the fund. \u2022 Then, as to the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty, there would, he said, be little difficulty in saying, that they should be such poor children of <em>South Farnham </em>district, as the school commissioners should select as proper persons to be educated in the primary schools; and the effect would only be, to add one or two to the number of poor children in that district, to receive the advantage of such education.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b354-4\">The court</author>\n<p id=\"AdB\"><em>(dubitante </em>Carr, <em>J.) </em>held that the bequest was void, and therefore reversed the decree, and dismissed the bill.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
