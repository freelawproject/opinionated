Phelps </em>and <em>A. Earle, </em>requesting them to deliver the title bond to <em>Daniels, </em>and thereby also assigning the title bond itself to <em>Conrad; </em>and this order was presented to <em>Phelps </em>and <em>Earle, </em>but neither of them did or would deliver the title bond to <em>Daniels, </em>and in fact neither of them had possession of the same; of which <em>Conrad </em>had notice, and was requested to deliver the title bond, or cause it to be delivered, to <em>Daniels; </em>and if the bond had been delivered to <em>Daniels, </em>he could have recovered the money due thereon from <em>Rogers </em>and his surety; but <em>Conrad </em>did not, and would not, <em>deliver </em>the title bond to <em>Daniels, </em>or cause it to be done. <em>Conrad </em>pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>and the statute of limitations. At the trial of the issues, the plaintiff filed two bills of exceptions to opinions of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-9\">1. From the first of them, it appeared that it was proved, that the land sold by <em>Daniels </em>to <em>Conrad, </em>had originally belonged to the father of <em>Daniels, </em>who in truth had made the arrangement with <em>Conrad </em>for the sale of it to him, but before the bargain was executed, had given and transferred the benefit thereof (as an advancement) to his son the plaintiff, between whom and <em>Conrad </em>the bargain was finally completed ; and the father having been introduced by the plaintiff as a witness on his behalf, to prove the circumstances and manner of the transaction, was examined, both by the plaintiff\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s counsel, as to the real value of the land which was the subject of the contract, at the time of the sale to <em>Conrad; </em>and in the cross examination, he was asked by the defendant\u2019s counsel, whether he had not, before the sale of the land to the defendant, offered to sell it to one <em>Crouch </em>for less than 400 dollars ? to which he answered, that he had not as well as he remembered, but that if he had, it was for very little less than 400 dollars. Afterwards, in the progress of the trial, the defendant\u2019s counsel called <em>Crouch </em>as a witness, and asked him, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the first witness (the plaintiff\u2019s father) had not offered to sell ' 1 ' . the land to him before the sale made to <em>Conrad, </em>and if so, at what price ? The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the inquiry, that it related to collateral matter, which has been brought into the cause by the defendant\u2019s counsel himself in his cross examination of the first witness, and that it was not competent to the defendant to controvert it. But the court, thinking that the answer to the inquiry might be proper testimony to be weighed by the jury, in estimating the degree of credit that ought to be given to the testimony of the first witness, overruled the objection, and directed the witness <em>Crouch </em>to answer the question ; to which opinion the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-7\">2. It appeared, that upon the contract between <em>Daniels </em>and <em>Conrad </em>being concluded, <em>Conrad </em>gave <em>Daniels </em>an order on <em>Phelps </em>and <em>Earle </em>for the title bond, dated March C. 1820, and signed and sealed by <em>Conrad </em>in these words\u2014 <em>\u201c </em>To <em>O. Phelps </em>and <em>A. </em>Earle\u2014You will please deliver to <em>J. Daniels </em>[the plaintiff] the title bond I hold of <em>C. Rogers </em>and <em>A. Skidmore, </em>for I hereby assign the same to <em>Daniels </em>for value received (N. B. without recourse).\u201d On this order there was this <em>indorsement\u2014\u201c </em>There is no such bond in my hands; (signed) <em>A. Earle.\u201d </em>And the court, on the motion of the defendant\u2019s counsel, instructed the jury, that if they should find from the testimony, that the above order was executed and delivered by <em>Conrad </em>to <em>Daniels, </em>and accepted by <em>Daniels, </em>in place of the actual delivery into his hands of the title bond therein mentioned, they must find a verdict for the defendant; to which opinion of the court the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-9\">There was a verdict and judgement for the defendant; from which the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-10\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au9\">argued, 1st, That the whole inquiry as to the value of the land, and much more the special inquiry propounded by the defendant\u2019s counsel on his cross examination of the plaintiff\u2019s witness, were collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>to the issue : that it was obvious, the inquiry as to the value of the land could only have been gone into, to ascertain the measure of damages; but, in that view, the value of the <em>title bond </em>which <em>Conrad </em>undertook to assign to <em>Daniels </em>for the land, not the estimated value of the land, was the point in issue: that the inquiry propounded to the witness, as to the price for which he had offered to sell the land, was collateral again to the inquiry as to the value of the land, which was itself collateral to the issue ; and the question was only intended to lay a foundation for impeaching the credit of the witness. Now, he said, it was a settled rule, that a witness is not to be cross examined as to a distinct collateral fact, for the purpose of afterwards impeaching his credit; and if a witness answers such a question, evidence cannot afterwards be admitted to contradict his testimony on such collateral matter. Stark. Law Ev. part 2. &lt;\u00a7&gt; 22. vol. 1. p. 134.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 1 Phil. Law Ev. ch. 8. p. [227.]<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> 2ndly, He said the instruction given by the court to the jury was erroneous. Here was no demurrer to the evidence, and no statement of the evidence, from which the whole case could be ascertained. The court directed the jury, that if they should find a single fact, namely, that <em>Conrad\u2019s </em>order on <em>Phelps </em>and <em>Earle for </em>the title bond, had been given by him, and accepted by <em>Daniels, </em>in place of the actual delivery of the bond,\u2014they must find for the defendant. To justify such an instruction, it must appear from the pleadings, that that fact was conclusive of the point in issue; but there was no issue made up on the point. For aught that appeared, it might have been in proof, that <em>Conrad </em>when he gave the order on <em>Phelps </em>and <em>Earle, </em>knew that neither had possession of it; nay, that he had it in his own possession ; that he had afterwards assigned it away, and delivered it to another person : in such case, it could hardly be contended, that his fraudulent imposition of a nugatory order for the bond on <em>Daniels, </em>in place of the actual delivery thereof to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>him, would exempt him from the duty to assign, transfer and deliver the bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-4\"><em>Daniel, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag8\">said, the conduct of both parties at the trial, shewed that the value of the land was material to the issue; for the plaintiff and defendant both, had gone into that inquiry: and then the defendant asked a question, the object of which was to ascertain at what price the land had been offered for sale ; an inquiry of all others, the best calculated to ascertain its real value; so that if a false answer was given by the witness to this question, it was strictly proper to offer evidence to contradict him, and thus to impeach his credit. As to the other point, he said, the precise point in issue was, whether <em>Conrad </em>had, according to his promise, assigned, transferred and delivered the title bond to <em>Daniels. </em>The order drawn by <em>Conrad, </em>on <em>Phelps </em>and <em>Earle, </em>was an absolute deed of assignment of the title bond to <em>Daniels; </em>and the instruction was no more than this, that' the delivery and acceptance of the <em>order </em>for the bond, was tantamount to the actual <em>delivery </em>of the bond itself, <em>if </em>both parties agreed and intended that it should be so. <em>Daniels, </em>it appeared, presented the order to <em>Earle, </em>who said he had no such bond in his possession; but it did not appear that he ever applied to <em>Phelps, </em>or that if application had been made to him, the order would have been ineffectual to procure the bond.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-4\"> <em>Ingraham\u2019s </em>edi. Boston 1828.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b428-5\"> American edi. New York 1820.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b429-8\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AyA\">Without impugning the principles laid down by <em>Starkie </em>and <em>Philips, </em>in the passages cited by the appellant\u2019s counsel, I am of opinion, that there was no error in the admission of the testimony set forth in the first bill of exceptions. The value of the land was certainly material to the issue. The evidence of the witness as to the value, was, of course, directly applicable to the issue, and every fact going to disprove his valuation was, in like manner, material or applicable. For what goes to disprove evidence that is directly applicable, must be itself directly applicable. It, cannot be deemed collateral only. Thus, it cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>denied, that if, in <em>detinue, </em>a witness swears that the value of a horse is 100 dollars, evidence would be admissible to prove that he had sworn, upon a formal trial, that he was worth only 50 dollars. And if such \u25a0 evidence as this would be within the issue, and not collateral but direct, evidence of his declarations not on oath, though less <em>strong, </em>would certainly not be less direct. In like manner, though evidence that he had offered the same horse for the price of 50 dollars, might not be as strong as the evidence of his declarations, because he might be asking a higher price than he really thought the property worth, yet certainly it cannot be fairly affirmed to be less direct. I think, therefore, it was proper to permit evidence to contradict the testimony of the witness as to the price at which he had offered the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The question presented by the second bill of exceptions is more difficult. The first count in the declaration goes distinctly enough for the failure to deliver the bond according to contract. Now, I think, there can be no question, that as to this count, the evidence was conclusive against the plaintiff. For, certainly, if the defendant did draw and deliver the order to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff did accept the same in the place of actual delivery into his hands, of the title bond itself, it was a sufficient fulfilment of the contract to deliver, and a discharge of the defendant in this action. The original contract to deliver was satisfied and at an end, whatever other rights might have become vested in the plaintiff by the act done in satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">What then was the effect of that act ? what rights did it confer on the plaintiff? 1. By the delivery of the order, and its acceptance in the place of the actual delivery of the bond, the title to the bond absolutely passed. <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Pendleton, </em>6 Rand. 473. If it had been afterwards burnt, lost or destroyed, the loss would have been <em>Daniels\u2019s, </em>not <em>Conrad\u2019s. 2. </em>By that delivery and passing <em>of </em>title, the property in the bond itself so passed, that if <em>Phelps </em>or <em>Parle </em>had it in their possession, <em>trover </em>or <em>detinue </em>would have lain for it, whether they accepted the order or not. And if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Lad it not, those actions might have been sustained by the plaintiff against any person in whose possession it might happen to be, even the defendant himself. And if it was found not to be in <em>Phelps\u2019s </em>or <em>Earle\u2019s </em>hands, whose concern was it to search for it, after the plaintiff had received the order as an actual delivery into his hands of the bond itself? It was, surely, the plaintiff\u2019s concern. The defendant was not only not bound to search or sue for it, as he had discharged himself from all further connexion with it, but he had no right to sue for it. He could neither have brought <em>trover </em>nor <em>detinue, </em>nor even a bill of discovery against <em>Phelps </em>or <em>Earle, </em>or any other person. The delivery had passed away the property, and left him powerless over the subject. 3. The right of property in the subject, would have enabled <em>Daniels </em>to sue the obligors at law or in equity on the lost bond, and establish it by the evidence of the defendant himself. Or he might have sued <em>Phelps </em>and <em>Earle, </em>and called upon the defendant to prove their possession; or lie might have brought them all into equity, on the ground that the money was due to him, and demanded, that the obligors should pay it to him accordingly; that <em>Phelps </em>and <em>Earle </em>should give it up, or account for it; or that the defendant, should surrender it if he had it, or pay him the amount of it, if there had been in fact no such bond as he represented. And 4. In like manner, he might at law have sued the defendant in <em>detinue </em>or <em>trover, </em>if the defendant had the bond, or he might sue him in an action for deceit, or even in <em>assumpsit, </em>if he had pretended to sell him a bond, which had no existence. These remedies are still open to him if he is injured. But l do not think he could sue him in <em>assumpsit, </em>after receiving this order as a full compliance with the contract to deliver the bond; and therefore the proof of that fact was a complete bar of his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">I am therefore of opinion, that there is no error in the judgement.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The other judges concurred. Judgement affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
