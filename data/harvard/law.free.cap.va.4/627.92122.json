M\u2019Keown </em>deceased, situated at the junction of Market street and <em>Halifax </em>road, \u201c containing nearly two acres, and having on it a good dwelling house and the usual out houses.\u201d The <em>memorandum </em>of the contract signed by <em>Foley, </em>stated that he had purchased, at auction, for the sum of 1421 dollars, \u201cthe house and lot lately occupied by <em>A. M\u2019K. </em>deceased,\u201d on a credit &amp;c. without any mention of the quantity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-9\">\u25a0 The auctioneer deposed, that after he had prepared the advertisement of the sale by direction of the plaintiff, he understood that a part of the lot as originally held by <em>Alex. M\u2019Keown </em>deceased, had been sold by him in <em>his </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>lifetime, and being therefore uncertain as to the.true quantity, he declared, publicly, at the commencement of the sale, that the lot was to be sold as so much, <em>more or less, </em>and no particular quantity was to be warranted ; that the boundaries of the lot, namely, the enclosure thereof, was repeatedly pointed out to the persons present as containing the ground offered for sale; that when <em>Foley </em>presented himself as a bidder, he had a private conversation with him, and made the same declaration to <em>Foley, </em>which he had made publicly, at the commencement of the sale, pointing out to him at the same time the boundaries of the lot. And another witness, who was at the sale, deposed, that the auctioneer proclaimed, that the quantity of ground was about, or was reckoned at, two acres, but that he would not warrant that quantity, and then pointed to the enclosure as containing the ground he was selling. But eight persons present at the sale, deposed, that they heard no such public declaration as that which the auctioneer said he made at the commencement of the sale; and that all they heard him say, was, in the language of the advertisement, that the lot \u201c contained nearly two acres;\u201d but he pointed out the boundaries, namely, the enclosure, as including the property he was going to sell. One person who was a bidder at the sale said, that if he had purchased the lot, he would have thought himself entitled, under the description of the lot as containing \u201c nearly two acres,\u201d to more than an acre and a half. However, there was very clear proof, that the sale was fi sale in gross, of the ground contained within the enclosure, and not a sale by the quantity ; and that this was intended by the vendor and the auctioneer, and understood by the persons present at the sale. It was proved that the lot contained only one acre and twelve poles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-7\">The chancellor decreed specific execution of the contract. And upon the petition of <em>Foley </em>to this court, an appeal was allowed him from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AtX3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The cause was argued here, by <em>Spooner </em>for the appelant, and by <em>Wyndham, Robertson </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY9\">upon two points: 1. Whether, seeing that the lot was described in the printed advertisement, and by the auctioneer at the sale, as containing nearly two acres, and that before the sale, there had occurred reason to doubt whether the quantity was not exaggerated in the advertisement, and that the lot was in fact only one acre and twelve poles,\u2014the court of chancery ought, under such circumstances, to have decreed specific performance of the contract? And <em>2. </em>Whether the purchaser ought not, at least, to have been allowed an abatement, from the price in proportion to the deficiency ?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b654-4\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AOlG\">I throw out of the case, the evidence of the auctioneer, that he proclaimed that a part of the lot had been sold by the former owner in his lifetime, and that it was sold only for so much, <em>more or less, </em>without warranty of quantity. Where there has been a public advertisement of the terms of a sale at auction, the bidders must be presumed to have looked to those terms, if the contrary be not proved; unless it is proved, that the buyer did know of a change or variation in the terms. Whether, in any case, this knowledge can be brought home to a party who denies it, by proof that other persons heard the announcement of the change, it is not necessary to decide in this case. It would be hard to presume, that the defendant must have heard what he disclaims having heard, when eight or nine persons attending at the same time and place, equally depose that they did not hear it. But, independent of that fact, I take the purchase to have been a purchase in gross. It was not a purchase by the quantity of ground contained in the lot. It was a purchase of the lot of ground, such as it was, whether it was more or less than two acres. It was advertised as containing \u201c nearly two acresan indefinite expression, which excludes all idea of any accurate graduation of the price to the actual quantity of ground. It is impossible to fix upon any precise point, to which the representation can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>be supposed to have referred. Can it be affirmed, that an * * acre and a half came within the description of \u201c nearly two acres?\u201d One bidder thought it would. The party not having warranted or stated any particular quantity,\u2014the lot being small, the enclosure pointed out, and the whole lying under the eye of the purchaser, I cannot doubt that it was a purchase in gross, and that the purchaser should be compelled to complete the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The other judges concurring, decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
