The pleadings were in the form prescribed by the statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 118. p. 463, 4. and the mise joined on the mere right. The jury <em>found </em>a <em>special verdict, </em>stating the following case :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-10\">The land in question was granted by the commonwealth to <em>Christian Snidow, </em>the demandant, by grant regularly issued from the land office, dated September 12. 1787, under which the grantee entered, and was seized in fee; and being so seized, in the year 1796, he covenanted, by articles in writing, to sell and convey the land to <em>John Byars; </em>who, thereupon, received and held the possession, and paid the whole purchase money, but no conveyance was ever executed to him. <em>Byars </em>having thus acquired possession of the land, and a right to demand a conveyance thereof from <em>Christian Snidow, </em>by articles in writing executed in October 1799, covenanted to sell the land to <em>Jacob Snidow, </em>and put him in possession; and <em>Jacob Snidow </em>paid <em>Byars </em>the whole purchase money, but no conveyance was executed to him, at the time, by either <em>Byars </em>his immediate vendor, or <em>Christian Snidow </em>in whom the legal title yet remained. <em>Jacob Snidow, </em>in 1803, by a verbal contract with <em>Abraham </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Williams, </em>the tenant, agreed to sell him the land, and he put him in possession of it, and <em>Williams </em>paid him some part of the purchase money; but in the year 1807 or 1808, this contract between <em>Jacob Snidow </em>and <em>Williams, </em>was rescinded by them, and the latter gave up to the former all the claim he had to the property; nevertheless, <em>Williams </em>continued in uninterrupted possession to the present time, exercising intire control over the subject, without paying any rent to <em>Jacob Snidow, Christian Snidow, </em>or any other person, though he never pretended any other claim or right than that which he derived from the contract between him and <em>Jacob Snidow </em>made in 1803, and rescinded in 1807-8. <em>Christian Snidow, </em>by deed of bargain and sale, dated in November 1824, conveyed the land to <em>Jacob Snidow, Williams </em>being still the tenant in actual possession, as above mentioned; and, not long afterwards, <em>Jacob Snidow </em>demanded tlie possession of <em>Williams, </em>who refused to give it to him. Whereupon, the writ of right in this case, was sued out in the name of <em>Christian Snidow, </em>And the question referred to the court, was, whether the legal title of the land was in <em>Christian Snidow, </em>the demandant ? in other words, whether or no his conveyance to <em>Jacob Snidow </em>of November 1824, executed while <em>Williams </em>still held the possession as above mentioned, operated to pass the legal title to <em>Jacob </em>?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\">The circuit court gave judgement on the special verdict for the demandant; and <em>Williams, </em>the tenant, appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-5\">The case was argued by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellant, and <em>Daniel </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3W\">The only question was as to the nature of the possession held by <em>Williams </em>at the time of <em>Christian Snidotv\u2019s </em>conveyance to <em>Jacob </em>in November in 1824\u2014whether that possession was an adversary one, and so prevented the conveyance from operating to pass the legal title ? If it was, the legal title remained in <em>Christian Snidow </em>notwithstanding the conveyance, and the suit was properly brought in <em>Christian's </em>name; but if <em>Williams's </em>pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>session was not adversary, then the conveyance passed the legal title to <em>Jacob Snidow, Christian </em>had no right, and the suit should have been brought in <em>Jacob\u2019s </em>name.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b40-8\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aln\">The only question arising upon this special verdict, seems to be, has the jury found an adversary possession in Williams? I think not. His possession certainly commenced legally: it was delivered by <em>Jacob Snidow </em>to him, under his contract of purchase: and the jury find, that, after holding under this purchase for some three or four years, <em>Williams </em>gave up to <em>Jacob Snidow, </em>all claim which he had to the land under the contract, and the contract was then rescinded. <em>Williams\u2019s </em>continuance in possession after this, without claim or pretension, I consider as no possession adversary to the right of <em>Jacob Snidow, </em>but a possession under him ; just as if <em>Williams </em>had leased the land from him for years, and at the end of the term, had held over without any agreement. He was, in truth, the tenant of <em>Jacob Snidow, </em>and his possession was <em>Jacob Snidow\u2019s </em>; which so far from being adverse to <em>Christian Snidow, </em>was held under the purchase from his vendee <em>Byars. </em>I think, then, that the deed made by <em>Christian </em>to <em>Jacob Snidow, </em>thus in possession under him, was valid and operative; and that, upon the facts found, the fee was in <em>Jacob. </em>It follows that the judgement of the circuit court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Brooke, <em>J. </em>I am of the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Tucker, <em>P. </em>The question in this case, is, whether the deed from <em>Christian Snidow </em>to <em>Jacob Snidow </em>operated to pass the legal title to the land in controversy, from <em>Christian </em>to <em>Jacob </em>? If it did, then at the time <em>of </em>the commencement of the writ of right, <em>Christian Snidow </em>had no title, and judgement should have been rendered for the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">The judgement of the court below has obviously been given upon the supposition, that the possession of <em>Williams </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>was such an adverse possession as prevented the operation of the deed of bargain and sale from <em>Christian </em>to <em>Jacoby </em>upon the principle of the cases of <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Bibb, </em>3 Call, 362. <em>Tabb </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>Id. 475. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>Id. 488. <em>Clay </em>v. <em>White, </em>1 Munf. 162. <em>Bream </em>v. <em>Cooper\u2019s heirs, </em>5 Munf. 7. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>6 Munf. 38. I do not think so. The incapacity of a person out of possession, to pass an estate in the land of which another has possession, does not arise out of the statute against pretensed titles, as we are told by judge <em>Roane </em>in <em>Tabb </em>v. <em>Baird: </em>that statute does not declare the deed void, but leaves its effect to be decided by the principles of the law relative to the subject. According to these principles, a man cannot give that which he has not; nor can the statute of uses transfer to the bargainee, a possession which is not in the bargainor ; for it only provides that the possession of the bargainor shall be transferred to the bargainee; if he has none, none can be transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">It is, however, very justly observed, that this possession may be a statutory possession, and an actual possession is not essential. Thus if A. in actual possession bargains and sells to B., the vendee, before actual entry, has a statutory-possession, and may bargain and sell to C. Moreover, it is a familiar principle that the possession of my tenant is my possession. If, therefore, I lease for years, I may nevertheless convey by bargain and sale, and my deed will pass the title. So, if there be a fiduciary possession, it will not impede the operation of the deed; <em>Bibb v. Duval </em>and <em>Tabb </em>v. <em>Baird. </em>So too, I think it clear, that if I put a party in possession, or if a man holds possession under me, such possession will not impede the operation of my deed. For, to give it that effect, there must be an actual <em>adverse </em>possession. Was there such a possession here?</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">It is found by the verdict, that <em>Williams </em>came into possession by the consent of <em>Jacob Snidoiv, </em>and indeed under a purchase from him, he having in like manner possession derivatively from <em>Christian Snidow, </em>the patentee, who yet held the legal title. That his possession from the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>his purchase until the rescission of the contract between himself and <em>Jacob Snidow, </em>was an adverse possession, cannot be pretended. He claimed under <em>Christian Snidow </em>derivatively, and not adversely to him; he claimed <em>under </em>his title and not <em>adversely </em>to that title. Until the moment of his refusal to deliver the possession, this state of things continued : he continued in the possession by the permission or sufferance of <em>Jacob Snidow, </em>a privy in title, who held <em>Ms </em>possession <em>under </em>and <em>not adversely </em>to <em>Christian. Jackson </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>9 Johns. Rep. 163. He was strictly a tenant at sufferance ; for \u201c an estate at sufferance is where one comes into possession of land <em>by lawful title, </em>but keeps it after-wards without any title at all;\u201d 2 Blacks. Comm. 150. It is not confined to holding over after the determination of a lease for years : even a mortgagor left in possession, is a tenant at sufferance ; <em>Patridge </em>v. <em>Bere, </em>5 Barn. Ald. 604. 7 Com. Law Rep. 204. S. C. And if a purchaser be let into possession before conveyance of the legal interest, he is a mere tenant at sufferance; <em>Doe v. Sayer, 3 </em>Camp. 8. <em>Right </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>13 East 210. Here then <em>Williams </em>was, at least after the rescission of the contract, a mere tenant at sufferance. That such a tenant has no adverse possession, it cannot be necessary to establish by reference to authority. It remains, then, to consider, whether his refusal to surrender the possession, changed his character from that of a tenant by sufferance into that of a disseizor ? from a rightful possessor into a tortfeasor, against the will of his lord ?</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">That this cannot be, is obvious from various considerations. As the landlord can, at any moment, evict his tenant by sufferance, by entry after demanding possession, his omitting to do so, leaves the tenant still a possession by sufferance. The character of his tenure is not changed until entry. Moreover, even the owner <em>\u201c </em>cannot maintain trespass against a tenant by sufferance, as he might against a stranger ; and the reason is, that being once in by a lawful title, the law (which presumes no wrong in any man) <em>will suppose him to continue upon a title equally lawful, </em>unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>owner of the land, by some public and avowed act, such as . V7 ; v 7 \u2022 \u2022 7 . . an entry is, <em>unit declare his continuance to be </em>tortious, or in \u2018common language wrongful.\u201d 2 Blacks. Comm. 150. I think, indeed, we shall not err in laying it down as a <em>general </em>proposition, that if a person comes into possession lawfully, his or his heirs subsequent unlawful continuance in possession, will not of itself operate as a disseizin, unless at the election of the parly injured. Thus it is that though a tenant at sufferance, who has but a bare possession, cannot by continuance of his possession become a disseizor, yet if the owner thinks it more expedient to suppose or to admit himself to be disseized, and his tenant to have gained a tortious freehold, be may do so, and is then remediable by action. 3 Blacks. Comm. 175. 1 Johns. Ca. 88. Such is the case here as to <em>Williams. </em>When the deed was made, he still held as tenant by sufferance; but when the owner found it necessary to seek his remedy by suit, he was obliged to elect to consider himself disseized, and to consider <em>Williams </em>as in of the freehold, in order to maintain the writ of right, which is only sustainable against the tenant of the freehold. Nor will the refusal to surrender the possession to the rightful owner, operate a disseizin against his will. The rightful owner must have been tortiously ousted, either by violence or by some act that the law regards as equivalent in its effect, to constitute a disseizin; for it is an estate gained by wrong and injury. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Burtis, </em>6 Johns. Rep. 198. Thus, even a lease for a thousand years made by a tenant at will, is no disseizin except at the election of the owner, <em>Blundel </em>v. <em>Baugh, </em>Cro. Car. 302. And even a bargain and sale by a mere tenant, unaccompanied by livery of seizin, would not operate to divest the seizin of the reversioner; lor a particular tenant can only effect this by feoffment, which is therefore called a tortious conveyance, since it can work a disseizin. The rightful conveyances of bargain and sale and lease and release, can never effect this. They only pass what tho party lawfully may pass. See on these topics, Co. Litt. 239.a n. 1. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Horde, </em>1 Burr. 60. 111. 5 Cruise\u2019s Dig. 371.</p>\n<p id=\"AM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>From these authorities it is clear, that <em>Williams\u2019s </em>refusal worked no disseizin, except at <em>Snidow\u2019s </em>election. But if by his refusal, his <em>possession </em>became adverse, it must have operated a <em>disseizin. </em>For, although he who dispossesses a mere tenant for years, may perhaps by disclaiming title to the freehold, avoid the divesting of it, yet it is a universal principle, that he who divests the possession of the tenant of the fee, is a disseizor. Hob. 323. Harg. Co. Litt. 180.b n. 7. 296.b n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">If then there was no disseizin, and by consequence no adverse possession in <em>Williams, </em>the seizin remained in <em>Christian Snidow, </em>until the execution of his deed to <em>Jacob, </em>when it passed to him by the operation of the statute of uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">It appears to me, that the error in this case has arisen, from a misconception of what an adverse possession means. It is not the mere holding over against the will of the party from whom you obtain the possession. It is the holding by claim of <em>title, </em>adverse to <em>another\u2019s </em>title, that constitutes an adverse possession. Though a mere intruder or squatter, without, pretence of title, holds possession of my land, and keeps me out of it, such possession does not amount to an adversary possession within the meaning of the law. Having no pretence of title, he cannot hold by title adverse to my title; and this it is which the law meant to protect. It pays no respect to the wrongful intrusion of a party without a <em>scintilla </em>of title. It requires too, that this adverse possession should be made out not by inference but by clear proof, and makes every presumption in favor of the possession being subordinate to the true owner. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>9 Johns. Rep. 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">These opinions are sustained by the decisions of some of our most respectable tribunals. Authorities upon such a subject, are naturally more abundant in a newly settled country, where adventurers set down, very often, upon the land which suits them best, without pretence of title. Judge <em>Spencer, </em>in the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>2 Caines 185. remarks, that \u201c it has been adjudged, that <em>mere possession </em>by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>a person claiming no title, is no disseizin of the rightful . . . owner, <em>and consequently he may convey </em>or devise, notwithstanding the statute against champerty and maintenance. That to constitute that possession adverse to the true owner, which is equivalent to a disseizin in spite of him, there need, indeed, be no legitimate right, but it must be accompanied by a claim to the land.\u201d And judge <em>Livingston </em>said, \u201c coming in as an intruder, or as a mere occupant, without any claim of title, <em>will not prevent </em>an alienation by the real owner, or be regarded as a holding adverse to his title.\u201d In the case before us, <em>Williams </em>had no pretence of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The judgement must be reversed, and judgement entered for the tenant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
