They then offered evidence to prove that <em>Wyatt </em>bad, up to the return day of the plaintiffs\u2019 execution on the forthcoming <em>bond, and for a </em>long time afterwards continued to have, sufficient property in his possession, of which the debt, interest &amp;tc. in the execution mentioned could have been levied ; but the court rejected this evidence ; and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\">3. The plaintiffs having offered in evidence, a copy of a writ of ca. sa. sued out by one <em>Loyd </em>against <em>Holmes (Wyatt\u2019s </em>surety in the forthcoming bond) which appeared to have been served on <em>Holmes </em>after the plaintiffs\u2019 execution on the forthcoming bond against <em>Wyatt </em>and <em>Holmes </em>was in the sheriff\u2019s hands, and before the return day thereof, and on which <em>ca. sa. Holmes </em>took the oath of insolvency; and having also offered in evidence, along with this <em>ca. sa. </em>a copy of the schedule of <em>Holmes\u2019s </em>effects surrendered on his taking the oath of insolvency; the defendants, thereupon, offered evidence to prove, that <em>Holmes </em>had, at the time he took the oath, and long afterwards continued to have, other property, besides that mentioned in his schedule, sufficient to satisfy the plaintiffs\u2019 execution; but the court rejected this evidence. The defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-6\">4. They then offered evidence to prove, that the plaintiffs\u2019 execution on the forthcoming bond, against <em>Wyatt </em>and <em>Holmes, </em>had been in fact levied by the sheriff on a slave of sufficient value to satisfy the debt, which slave was afterwards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>discharged by the sheriff, without the plaintiffs\u2019 consent; but the court rejected this evidence also; and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-8\">There was a verdict and judgement for the plaintiffs, for 129 dollars with interest &amp;c. to which this court, on the petition of the defendants, allowed a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-9\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkW\">insisted, 1. That the court ought not to have set aside the verdict rendered at the first trial on the original pleadings; for, he said, the deputy sheriff <em>Smith </em>was an incompetent witness to prove the insolvency of <em>Wyatt, </em>since proof of that fact was necessary to exonerate himself from the charge of neglect of duty, of of malfeasance in office, for which he was liable to an action at the suit of the plaintiffs. 2. That, at the time the action was brought, there was no good cause of action, inasmuch as the sheriff\u2019s return on the execution on the forthcoming bond, did not shew that <em>Wyatt </em>was insolvent. The amendment of the return, after the action brought, could not suffice to maintain it. Indeed, the leave for the sheriff to make the amendment of his return, was asked for the sole purpose of procuring matter necessary to maintain the action already pending; and the court ought not to have permitted such an amendment to be made, to answer such a purpose. 3. That the judgement recovered against <em>Wyatt </em>on the assigned bond, was completely satisfied and extinguished by the forthcoming bond; and if the forthcoming bond was insufficient to secure the debt, the sheriff was liable to <em>Triplett &amp;f JYeale </em>for taking insufficient security. They, and they alone, had <em>remedy </em>on the forthcoming bond; they, and they alone, had remedy against the sheriff for taking an insufficient bond : the assignors, certainly, were not entitled to institute any proceedings on the forthcoming bond, or against the sheriff on account of its insufficiency. 4. That the sheriff\u2019s return, that <em>Wyatt </em>was insolvent, especially as the return, in that particular, was made <em>ex post facto </em>to fit the plaintiffs\u2019 case, ought not to have been taken as conclusive evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>fact of <em>Wyatt\u2019s </em>insolvency; and the proof of his solvency offered by the defendants ought to have been admitted. 5. That, as it appeared by the plaintiffs\u2019 own shewing, that a <em>ca. sa. </em>sued out by another creditor, had been served on <em>Holmes, </em>the surety of <em>Wyatt </em>in the forthcoming bond, while <em>Triplett </em>4\" <em>Neale\u2019s </em>execution thereon was in the sheriff\u2019s hands, which, therefore, bound all his effects; and as it appeared by the return on <em>Triplett fy Neale\u2019s </em>execution, that the effects surrendered in <em>Holmes\u2019s </em>schedule had been sold to satisfy the <em>ca. sa. </em>creditor, in the first place, and only 14 dollars, the balance of the proceeds, had been applied to the credit <em>of Triplett </em>4\u2022 <em>Neale\u2019s </em>execution, whereas the whole of the proceeds ought to have been paid to them ; here was clear proof, by the plaintiffs\u2019 own shewing, that they had not pursued their remedy on the forthcoming bond, as efficiently as they might and ought to have done, before they had recourse to their assignors, <em>Smith &amp;f Richard. </em>And 6. That as the assignors by the contract of assignment, in effect, only warranted the solvency of <em>Wyatt </em>the obligor, the evidence offered to prove, that <em>Triplett &amp;/\u2022 Neale\u2019s </em>execution on the forthcoming bond, had been actually levied on a slave, and that this property was released by the sheriff, ought to have been admitted. It would have established the solvency of the debtors beyond question ; and it would have shewn, that the sheriff had made himself liable to the plaintiffs, for the whole debt. They ought to have pursued the remedy which the law gave <em>them </em>against the sheriff, and which must have been amply sufficient.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-4\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEN\">answered, 1. That the verdict on the first trial was properly set aside, on the ground that the testimony of <em>Smith </em>the deputy sheriff to prove the insolvency of <em>Wyatt, </em>had been excluded. <em>Smith </em>was a competent witness : he stood perfectly indifferent between the parties : if <em>Wyatt </em>was in fact insolvent, that would be a defence for him at the suit of either party; if he was solvent, either party, the defendants as well as the plaintiffs, might maintain an action against him for neglect of official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>duty. 2. He said that, though in an action by the assignee against the assignor of a bond, the insolvency of the obligor may be proved by other evidence than the return of <em>nulla bona </em>on an execution against him, <em>yet </em>the assignor has a r&gt;ght to demand such a return, if it be true. The fact of the obligor\u2019s insolvency, was the foundation of an assignee\u2019s right to recourse against the assignor, and, in this case, the fact existed, if at all, before the action brought; and the amended return was only that evidence of the preexisting fact, which the assignees had a right to require from the sheriff. 3. The forthcoming bond is nothing but part of our process of execution; neither <em>Triplett &amp;f JYeale </em>nor the sheriff could have prevented <em>Wyatt </em>from giving it: nor was it true, that the sheriff was liable if he took surety in the bond who turned out afterwards to be insufficient; he was liable only in case the surety was insufficient at the time he was received as such. 4. The sheriff\u2019s return that <em>Wyatt </em>was insolvent was conclusive; <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Goodall, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 105. The evidence offered of the solvency of <em>Wyatt </em>and of his surety <em>Holmes, </em>was nothing to the purpose, unless it were also proved that this was known to the plaintiffs; and if such evidence as the court excluded were admissible, an assignee, after having exerted the utmost diligence without effect, might be surprized, in his action against the assignor, at the trial, and defeated, by evidence of the solvency of the obligor. 5. As to the other matters which <em>Smith Rickard, </em>in the court below, attempted to set up in their defence, he said, they amounted at the most to this, that the sheriff had been guilty of such gross neglect or malfeasance in office, as made him liable to <em>Triplett fy Neale </em>for the debt. Now, in the first place, it was not pretended that <em>Triplett &amp; Nealebad </em>been apprised of this misconduct of the sheriff, though it seemed <em>Smith &amp; Rickard </em>were; and, in the next place, if the sheriff had made a false return as to the insolvency of <em>Wyatt, </em>or been guilty of any misconduct or neglect, <em>Smith Rickard </em>were parties aggrieved thereby, as well as <em>Triplett fy Neale, </em>and had as clear a right to an action- against him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>1 Rev. Code, ch. 78. \u00a7 17. p. 280. cb. 134. \u00a7 48. p. 542. And then the question was, whether the assignees were bound to resort to and exhaust their remedy against the sheriff, before they could have recourse to the assignors? or had a right to recourse against the assignors immediately, leaving them to pursue <em>their </em>remedy against the sheriff? The assignees were not bound to exhaust every possible remedy against the obligor; much more were they not bound to prosecute their remedy against the sheriff; especially, when it did not appear that they were apprised of his having made himself liable, till their assignors alleged the fact in their <em>defence </em>at the trial. According to the adjudications of this court, the assignees had used such due diligence in their effort to recover the debt of <em>Wyatt </em>the obligor, as entitled them to recourse against the assignors. <em>Mackie </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>2 Wash. 219. <em>Stuart v. Goodall, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 105. <em>Barksdale </em>v. <em>Fenwick, </em>Id. 113. in note. <em>Harrison v. Raine, </em>5 Munf. 456. <em>Caton &amp; Veale </em>v. <em>Lenox, </em>5 Rand. 31.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b621-11\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AVqW\">The assignee of a bond or note must use due diligence to recover from the obligor or maker, before he can resort to the assignor. What is due diligence, has been left by the court to depend on the particular circumstances of each case. Generally speaking, the assignee must sue; must pursue a judicious course of proceeding; obtain a judgement, and the return of <em>nulla bona </em>on a <em>fi. fa. </em>These seem to be the general rules established by the cases. The exceptions to <em>them, </em>it is unnecessary to state. It is truly said by judge <em>Roane, </em>in <em>Mackie </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>that \u201c the assignee of a bond acquires a legal right to bring suit upon it, and to receive the money, discharged <em>from any control </em>of the assignor over the subject.\u201d It is this legal right, which imposes on the assignee the duty of pursuing (as the same judge styles it) a judicious course of proceeding; by which, I presume, is meant, that he shall take such steps for the collection of the debt, as a prudent obligee would generally pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"ANYQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>In the case before us, there was a judgement and execua forthcoming bond taken, and an execution on that. The first return on this execution was certainly not such as, of itself, to establish the insolvency of the obligors in the forthcoming bond; but the court permitted the sheriff to amend his return; and this, I think, it had a right to do, though it was after the lapse of five years, and after a verdict for the defendants at a former trial, and a new trial granted in this cause. The amended return, if it be taken to relate back to the date of the first (as I suppose it does) amounts to a return of <em>nulla hona </em>as to <em>Wyatt; </em>and the case of <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Goodall </em>decides, that the assignor, in a suit against him, shall not be permitted to introduce proof to contradict such a return. But what was the return as to <em>jHolmes </em>? So far from\" amounting to a return of <em>nulla bona, </em>it shewed that there were goods of <em>Holmes, </em>and that this execution was levied on some, but not on all of them. This return then does not establish that sort of insolvency of <em>Holmes, </em>which the court will not suffer to be contradicted. The proof, indeed, that at this time <em>Holmes </em>had property sufficient to satisfy this execution, other than that levied on, would stand perfectly well with the sheriff\u2019s return. Such proof the defendants offered, but the court excluded it. In this, I think, the court erred; for such proof was surely relevant both to the question of insolvency and of due diligence. What bearing it might have on those questions, was for the jury, with whom it remained to decide upon all the circumstances, whether the plaintiffs had made out a case which entitled them to come upon the assignors. Farther, to prove that while this same execution was in the hands of the sheriff, there was other property of <em>Holmes, </em>the defendants offered evidence to prove, that this execution was levied upon a slave of value sufficient to satisfy the execution, and discharged by the sheriff without the assent of the plaintiffs: and this too was excluded by the court, though it did not contradict the sheriff\u2019s return, and bore, I think, upon both questions before the jury. It went to convict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the sheriff of a gross violation of duty, such as would have made him clearly liable for the debt; and it might have fairly raised the question, whether due diligence, involving a judicious course of proceeding, would not have required the assignees to take steps against the sheriff, before coming upon the assignors ? I do not understand that any case in this court has gone so far as to say that the assignee, while holding the uncontroled ownership and management of the debt, may pass by the grossest blunders and malconduct of law officers ; conduct rendering them unquestionably liable ; conduct which clearly prevented the making the money out of <em>the </em>debtor;\u2014and come directly upon the assignor. I have seen no such case ; and I think it would be bad policy, as well as hard measure; it would tempt the assignee to connive at the malpractices of sheriffs, and to hurry over in the most careless and summary way, the process which was to bring him upon the assignor. The assignor is quite as much entitled to the favor of the court as the assignee. He gives the whole control of the case out of his hands, and before he is compelled to pay the debt, is entitled to demand proof, that after an honest and diligent pursuit of his debtor, the money cannot be made. I am of opinion that the judgement should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Titcker, P. In the case of <em>Mackie </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>this court, in establishing the liability of the assignor to the assignee, who <em>after due </em>diligence to recover from <em>the </em>obligor has failed to receive the amount of an assigned bond, carefully avoided, nevertheless, to lay down any rule as to what amounts to due diligence. The court has since, with equal caution, declined the attempt to draw the precise line at which the assignor\u2019s liability commences. It is wise, I think, in their successors to follow the example. The demarcation will best be made by successive decisions, which will serve as landmarks to those who engage in the traffic for bonds. The decisions of the courts on such questions, if they do not stand upon the elevated ground of being rules of property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>are at least the law of contracts. Those who buy and those who sell, look for the obligations which are assumed by the assignor, to those decisions. Hence the principle <em>stare decisis, </em>is peculiarly applicable to cases of this description. ^Pon these considerations, I shall take the case of <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Goodall, </em>which has never been impugued, as not now to be questioned; modified at least as it is by the opinion of judge <em>Roane </em>in the case of <em>Barksdale </em>v. <em>Fenwick. </em>And on the same ground, I shall consider the cases of <em>Caton &amp; Veale </em>v. Lenox, and <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Raine </em>as not to be now questioned. With these preliminaries, let us proceed <em>to the </em>consideration of this case. It comes to us upon exceptions to the opinions of the court who tried the cause, and those opinions constitute therefore the subject of examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">1. I do not perceive, that, there was an exception to granting the new trial, but as this matter was made a subject of discussion, I shall observe, that I think the new trial was rightly granted to the plaintiffs, because <em>the </em>verdict had been found under an erroneous instruction of the. court. The return of the sheriff as originally made, having omitted to return <em>nulla bona </em>as to Wyatt, the plaintiffs were indeed without the benefit of that conclusive return; but, as the action might have been sustained by proof of insolvency, without even the institution of a suit, and as such proof is also a sufficient excuse even for negligence in the prosecution of one, if it could have been sufficiently made out that no diligence would have been availing, I think it clear, that the plaintiffs should have been permitted to prove that <em>Wyatt </em>was in truth insolvent when their execution issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">2. Upon the second trial, the amended return was produced in evidence, and was admitted. I think it was properly admitted. It did not give a cause of action by relation, but it was evidence of a fact which existed before the suit, and which might have been proved by other evidence. The plaintiffs, moreover, had a right to have had this return of the sheriff as to the fact, before the suit brought, and were therefore entitled to it <em>nunc pro tunc: </em>and there is less rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>son for the objection to its admissibility, since it did not <em>con- </em>\u201e , , ... .... <em>tradici </em>a former return, but only supplied an omission in it.</p>\n<p id=\"AoP\">3. This return having been admitted, the defendants then \" .... . offered to prove that <em>Wyatt </em>at the date of that execution had other property. This evidence was rejected, and I think properly. It is not stated, that the property so supposed to exist, was known either to the sheriff or to the assignees ; and the fact, therefore, did not go to fix a malfeasance on the sheriff or negligence in the plaintiffs. Nothing is more possible, than that a man may have property un' known to the sheriff and the assignee, though the sheriff may honestly and truly have returned <em>nulla bona </em>as to him. <em>The </em>assignor, as <em>judge Roane tells us, </em>may well be presumed to know more of the obligor and his properly than the assignee. It was, probably, for that reason among others, that in <em>Stuart v. Goodall, </em>the court justified the peremptory refusal of the county court of <em>Henrico, </em>to permit the introduction of evidence to prove that <em>Beverley, </em>the obligor, had goods and effects sufficient to satisfy the execution at the time of the sheriff\u2019s return. Judge <em>Tucker </em>approved this refusal, expressly on the ground, that the admission of the evidence would have been to permit the return to be contested, whereas it was incontrovertible between the assignee and assignor. Judge <em>Roane </em>and judge <em>Fleming </em>concurred in refusing it, though upon grounds somewhat different, and perhaps yet stronger. They seem to have considered the return conclusive upon the rights of the parties, unless the assignee had been proved to have <em>known </em>that there was other property, or that any other execution would probably have produced the money. Many a bond has been bought and sold on the faith of that case, which may therefore be considered as entitled to peculiar respect. It has been familiarly considered as the law of the subject, for more than twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"A4U\">4. The plaintiffs having introduced the return upon the execution against <em>Holmes, </em>shewing that only a certain sum could be made out of him, and proof that between the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>of the issue of their execution and its return, he had taken the oath of insolvency, the defendant then offered evidence to prove that <em>Holmes </em>had other property, without however . r r . ^ offering to prove that the sheriff or assignee knew of it. I can see no material distinction between this and the case arising under the last mentioned bill of exceptions. In that, the return which it was proposed to controvert, was a return of <em>nulla bona; </em>in this, it is the return that the defendant in the execution had taken the oath of insolvency. He might, it is true, have been made to swear out again under a <em>ca. sa. </em>issued at the suit of <em>Triplett 8f Neale; </em>but there was no obligation to sue that <em>ca. sa. </em>tinder the circumstances, nor could the proof that he had other property be proper, unless accompanied by proof that the assignees knew of it. Without such knowledge, they could not be charged with want of due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"Abn\">5. As a last effort the defendants offered evidence to prove, that the execution on the delivery bond was levied on a slave who was discharged by the sheriff <em>without the assent of the plaintiffs. </em>The plaintiffs, then, were in no fault. The sheriff, if the fact was so, was guilty of a malfeasance, and is liable for the debt. To whom? That depends precisely upon the question, whether, in case of the sheriff\u2019s malfeasance, the assignee is or is not bound to pursue him ? If he is not bound to pursue him, then the wrong done is a wrong done to the assignor, who may have his action on the case. My own opinion is, that where the debt is not made, and where the sheriff is only responsible for malfeasance, the assignee is not bound to pursue him. It would clog and embarrass assignments too much to require this; and, moreover, it is better that the party ultimately interested in establishing his default, should institute the proceeding for the purpose. This court seems, indeed, to have been averse to requiring of the assignee more than a diligent pursuit of the obligor, and has exonerated him from the necessity of pursuing collateral, uncertain, and merely contingent remedies. Hence the decision, that though there be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>special bail, and though there has been a <em>ca. sa. </em>returned r \u2022 . \u00b0 . \u201e . . <em>non est inventus </em>(which <em>prima facie </em>makes the bail liable) yet it is not necessary to pursue him : for, peradventure, he <em>\u2018 </em>.... might still relieve himself by bringing in the principal before the return of the first <em>scire facias </em>executed, or of the second returned <em>nihil. </em>Such was the decision in <em>Caton &amp; Veale </em>v. <em>Lenox. </em>And if the assignee is not bound to pursue the bail, even where there is a moral certainty that he must be fixed with the debt (for, in that case, <em>Tlartshorne </em>was proved <em>to be out of the country, </em>and resident in <em>Baltimore), </em>I cannot perceive the propriety of requiring him to proceed against a sheriff, in order to take <em>the chance </em>of fixing upon him a malfeasance, which may charge <em>him </em>with the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that there is no error in the proceedings of the circuit court, and that the judgement ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Cabell and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurring with the president, judgement affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
