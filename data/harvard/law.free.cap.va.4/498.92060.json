And he stated the value of the permanent improvements made by <em>Tod, </em>to be 1270 dollars.

Eq. 19. in notes. 1 Rop. on Prop. Husband and Wife, 445, 6. <em>Curtis v. Curtis, 2 </em>Bro. C. C. 620. In the present case, the only question was a mere point of law; namely, whether the wife had so joined in the conveyances of her husband to <em>Tod, </em>as to make them her own, and so to preclude her from demanding dower? She ought to have been sent to a court of law, to try that question and establish her right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-7\"><em>Leigh </em>answered, that however narrow were the grounds on which the court of chancery originally assumed jurisdiction in matters of dower, the jurisdiction was now established on principles that embraced all cases of dower without exception ; and this, he said, appeared from the authorities cited for the appellant. It was true, that the practice of the court of chancery in <em>England, </em>when doubts arose as to the legal title of the widow to dower, was to put her to bring her action at law to establish her title, retaining her bill, however, in order to give her relief if she should establish her right at law; a practice that might be proper enough there, but there was- no reason for such a practice in our courts, and none such was known here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-8\">II. <em>Stanard </em>contended, that the appellee was a party to both the deeds of her husband conveying the lands in question to <em>Tod\u00a1 </em>and thereby relinquished her possibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>dower. That she intended to join in the deeds, there could be no doubt; the only question was, whether she had so executed her purpose, as to make the deeds binding on her, according to the provisions of the statute of conveyances of 1792? She actually signed, sealed and delivered the second deed of October 1803. As to the first deed, that of November 1801, she did not, indeed, <em>sign </em>it; but her husband signed, sealed and delivered it, and there was another seal put to it, which was intended to be hers, and which she recognized as hers in the acknowledgment of the deed made by her to the commissioners; and the very act of acknowledging it and consenting that it should be recorded, was a delivery of it. Therefore, this deed also must be taken to have been sealed and delivered by her, according to the provisions of the statute. Then, with regard to the commissions for her privy examination, and the certificates of the privy examination returned by the commissioners, which were precisely alike in respect to both deeds, he maintained, that, if they did not comply in words with the requisitions of the statute, yet they conformed with them in substance; <em>Langhorne </em>v. <em>Hobson, ante </em>224. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Borden, </em>2 Wash. 156. <em>Ware v. Cary, </em>2 Call 263. And he argued, that the statute prescribed the duty to be performed by the commissioners in the privy examination of a <em>feme covert, </em>but did not require that they should state, in their certificate, all the particulars of such privy examination ; and there being not the least reason here, to suspect unfairness in the transaction, it ought to be intended, that the commissioners performed their duty in the manner required by law. The extreme nicety and rigor, which would avoid the privy examinations in this case, would be alike applicable, doubtless, to very numerous cases, and would shake most of the land titles in the country derived from <em>femes covert.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-4\"><em>Leigh </em>said, it was clear that the appellee had not executed the first deed of November 1801, within the meaning of the statute of 1792; for the statute provided for the privy examination of a <em>feme covert </em>only in respect to deeds <em>sealed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>ang delivered </em>by husband <em>and wife; </em>and if the sealing and delivery by the wife might properly be inferred from her acknowledgment of the deed on privy .examination, the provision that she should have sealed and delivered-the deed, was nugatory and idle; since her acknowledgment of the instrument was required in every case, in order to make it binding on her; and if that were tantamount to sealing and delivery by her, it had been enough to require the acknowledgment. But the statute expressly required, that <em>the feme covert </em>should declare that she had willingly <em>signed </em>and sealed the deed: the <em>signing, </em>then was certainly necessary. As to the commissions for the privy examination of the <em>feme covert </em>in this case, he had thought that such commissions, under the statute of 1792, ought to prescribe to the commissioners the essential particulars of the duty which the statute required them to perform, and that if the commission omitted any of them, it was fatally defective: but the judgement in <em>Langhorne v. Hobson </em>obviated all his objections to these commissions; these being in the same form with the commission in that case, and the objections to the commission there having been disregarded, though very strenuously urged. But, certainly, the commissioners were bound to perform the duty required of them by the statute, in all essential particulars, and to certify the execution of the commission to the court. The manner and particulars of the execution of it, could only appear by the certificate <em>thereof: </em>that was to be recorded, in order that it might thereby appear, whether or no the <em>feme covert </em>had been duly examined, and had duly acknowledged the instrument. Now, the statute required that the <em>feme covert, </em>being privily examined by the commissioners, should <em>\u201c </em>declare that she willingly <em>signed </em>and sealed the writing, to be then <em>shewn and </em>explained to her.\u201d It was plainly intended that the deed should be shewn to the wife, in order to identify it; that she should be examined as to the identical <em>writing; </em>and that she should acknowledge her signing and sealing of <em>that: </em>but here, the <em>commissioners only </em>certified, that the wife acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>\u201c </em>her conveyance of the lands contained in the deeds,\u201d not these identical conveyances thereof, nor that she had signed and sealed any conveyance; and though they added that the deeds were annexed to their certificates, such annexations might have been and (for aught that appeared) were made, after the privy examinations were completed. The statute required, not only that the instrument should be <em>shewn </em>to the <em>feme covert, </em>but that it should be <em>explained </em>to her; that the commissioners should inform her of its contents and effect: it constituted them the judicial advisers of the <em>feme covert </em>as to her rights, in order to guard her against a surrender of them through ignorance or weakness : it intended to substitute them when the privy examination was made <em>in pais, </em>in place of the judges when it was made in open court. In <em>Langhorne </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>the commissioners certified that they <em>read </em>the deed to the <em>feme covert. </em>In the present case, they did not certify that the deeds were read to the <em>feme covert, </em>or that they were in any way explained to her, or even that they were shewn to her that she might get a knowledge of their contents for herself; and, for aught that appeared, the acknowledgment which they said she made before them, might have been made in perfect ignorance of <em>the </em>contents, purpose or effects of the deeds. If such privy examinations as these were good and effectual, it would be hard to imagine any that would be faulty and inoperative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVg\">III. <em>Sianard </em>insisted, 1. that if the appellee was entitled to dower of the lands in question, she was not entitled to be endowed thereof as of the increased value produced by the permanent improvements made by the purchaser, <em>Tod; </em>and 2. that she ought to have been endowed of the lands as of the value at the time of the alienation, not as of the increased value, produced by the appreciation of the property from any cause whatever, at the time the dower was assigned. He cited Harg. Co. Litt. 32.a note 8. from <em>Hale\u2019s MSS. </em>1 Rop. on Prop. 347. 4 Kent\u2019s Comm. 64.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayj7\"><em>Leigh </em>answered, 1. that it did not appear, that, in the assignment of dower to the appellee, the commissioners had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>given her any benefit from the permanent improvements made by <em>Tod; </em>and it was plain enough that they did not: for the attention of the parties had been drawn to the subject of <em>Tod\u2019s </em>improvements, since the court had ordered an account of them, and yet <em>do </em>exception was taken to the report of the assignment of dower on this or indeed any other ground. 2. He admitted, that the widow was not entitled to take any advantage of any increase of value produced by improvements made by the purchaser; but he contended, that she was entitled to the advantage of any increased value of the land produced by general causes, unconnected with the improvements made by the purchaser. This was chancellor <em>Kent\u2019s </em>opinion, upon a review of the authorities on the point, in his commentaries, vol. 4. pp. 65, 6, 7. and in a note there, he explained that that was the extent to which he intended to go in <em>Hale </em>v. <em>James, </em>6 Johns. Rep. 258. The point t\u00e1as most fully and learnedly discussed by <em>Tilgh man, </em>C. J. in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>5 Serg. &amp; Raw. 289. and by <em>Story, </em>J. in <em>Powell </em>v. <em>M. &amp; B. Man. Co. </em>3 Mason 347. And they held, that the widow was indeed to take no advantage of any increase of value produced by improvements made by the purchaser, but throwing those out of the estimate, she was to be endowed according to the value at the time of the assignment of dower; and, moreover, that there was never any rule of the common law to the contrary. It were.strange if there had been. The widow must sustain the loss in case of depreciation of the lands; yet the doctrine contended for denied her any advantage from the rise in value. Besides, the right of dower was a right to one third of the land in kind, of which the husband was seized at any time during the coverture; and it was admitted, that the husband could not by his alienation, bar her of that right: but, according to this doctrine, he might fix conclusively the price of her right of dower, which yet he could not sell, and bind her to take land to the value of one third of the price for which he thought proper to sell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>IV. <em>Stanard </em>objected, that the decree gave the widow profits from the death of her husband ; which, he said, she certainly was not entitled to demand against <em>Tod, </em>a purchaser from the husband in his lifetime. The common law gave the widow no damages. The statute of <em>Virginia, </em>1 Rev. Code, ch. 107. &lt;\u00a7. 4. p. 403. taken from the statute of <em>Merton, </em>20 Hen. 3. ch. 1. gave the widow damages only when she was deforced of her dower of lands <em>whereof her husband died seized; </em>and equity, following the law, could give her the profits only in that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-4\"><em>Leigh </em>said, the courts of chancery went further than the courts of law in respect to the profits of dower lands. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>2 Bro. C. C. 620. <em>Mundy v. Mundy, 4 </em>Id. 294. <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>9 Ves. 222. In <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>a widow filed a bill against the heir for dower; she and the heir both died pending the suit; and it was admitted that damages were not recoverable at law against a party who was dead ; yet the court decreed the profits to the widow\u2019s representative; and it was expressly said, that in decrees for dowresses, courts of equity give a remedy beyond what courts of law can give; 4 Bro. C. C. 628. He also cited 1 Rop. on Prop. 44-7, 8, 9. where it is said, that it is the course of the courts of equity to assign the widow her dower, and <em>universally </em>to give her an account of profits from the death of her husband ; and that her right to an account of them in equity, may be inferred against heir or alienee, or their representatives.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\"> The statute of 1792,1 Old Rev. Code, ch. 90. \u00a7 6. <em>Pleasants\u2019s </em>edi. pp. 157, 8. A copy of it is given in a note in the report of <em>Langhorne v.

The commissioners are commanded, 1. to examine the wife privily and apart from her husband ; 2. to take her declaration that she willingly signed and sealed the deed, which they are then to shew and explain to her; 3. that she consents that it may be recorded. And the commissioners are to return with their commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>a certificate, 1. of such privy examination; 2. of such declaration made; and 3. of such consent yielded. It was contended strongly, that the certificate must state also, that the deed was shewn and explained to the feme j but this seems to me to be adding to the requisitions of the law. It is clear, that the commissioners are directed to shew and explain the deed to her, on her privy examination ; but this need not be certified; for the law expressly limits the certificate to the privy examination, the declaration, and the consent. Words could not make this plainer, as it seems to me. The certificates are alike in the two deeds before us. They are to the following effect: \u201c We have this day gone to Mrs. <em>Baylor, </em>and examined her privily and apart from her husband\u201d (here is the first requisite of the law, the privy examination, clearly stated) \u201c who makes to us her acknowledgment of the conveyance of <em>the </em>320 acres of land contained in <em>the </em>indenture hereunto annexed, freely and voluntarily;\u201d that is, as I understand it, who makes to us her acknowledgment, or declaration, that she freely and voluntarily conveyed the 320 acres contained in <em>the </em>indenture thereto annexed; which, to my mind, is a perfectly substantial compliance with the second requisite of the law, namely, a declaration that she willingly signed and sealed the said writing. The certificate proceeds, \u201c and that she is willing the same shall be recorded in the county court of <em>Caroline:\u201d </em>here is the third requisite. My opinion is, then, that to every reasonable and substantial purpose of the law, this is a good and sufficient certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Upon an examination of the deed of 1801, it appears, that though it purports to be the deed of the wife, and she has thus acknowledged the execution of it, yet she has never in fact signed it. Upon the general doctrine, that <em>sealing and delivery </em>constitute the deed with the persons <em>sui juris, </em>and that, with a <em>feme covert, the privy examination </em>is the vital principle, I was strongly inclined to consider this deed binding on the widow. But the statute of 1792, by requiring the wife to declare on her examination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>that she willingly <em>signed </em>and scaled the deed, raises some doubt, whether the legislature did not contemplate her signing as necessary j and two of my brethren think the deed, for want of this, not binding on her. I therefore yield the inclination of my mind on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The next objection taken to the decree is, that it directs the dower to be allotted according to the present value of the land with all its present improvements, instead of the value at the time of alienation. I consider it the clear rule of the common law; that where a husband aliens during coverture, and the widow claims dower in those lands after his death, she shall not be entitled to dower according to the improved value of the land, but must take her dower according to the value at the time of alienation.

This doctrine seems to rest on ground similar to that of the recovery of a vendee of land against the vendor, on eviction ; which, on great consideration, we have fixed at the purchase money with interest, in <em>Stout </em>v. Jackson, 2 Rand. 132. and <em>Threlkeld </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh, </em>2 Leigh 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Another objection taken to the decree, is, that the chancellor has given rents and profits from the death of the husband. I think, in a case of alienation by the husband, this was wrong. At <em>law </em>such profits could be given only as to land of which the husband died seized ; and I think equity, which takes jurisdiction, in these cases, only from the superiour convenience of its proceeding, ought in this point to follow the law. But for a fuller view of this subject, I refer to the reasons and authorities which will be stated by the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"AabF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Brooke, <em>J. </em>The statute of conveyances of 1792, requiring that a <em>feme covert </em>shall declare to the commissioners for her privy examination, that she willingly <em>signed and sealed </em>the deed, leaves no ground for a construction that would dispense with that part of the execution of the deed by the <em>feme covert. </em>Although the <em>sealing and delivery </em>of the deed is, by the common law, the essence of its execution, and though when-the privy examination is before the court of record, that is all that is required by the statute; yet we cannot intend, that <em>sealing and delivery </em>is all the statute requires, when the privy examination is had before commissioners in the country, against the express letter of the statute.- It would be doing great violence to the language of the law, to dispense with <em>signing </em>by the <em>feme covert. </em>Since seals, except by mere scrolls, have gone out of use, <em>signing </em>is better evidence of the execution of a deed than <em>sealing with a scroll, </em>which may be at all times forged without the probability of detection. When the privy examination of a <em>feme covert </em>is bad before a court of record, the <em>signing </em>by her seems not to be required ; yet when it is had before commissioners in the country, the <em>signing </em>may have been required as an indispensable guard against fraud. I think, therefore, that the first deed was not duly executed by <em>Mrs. Baylor, </em>according to the statute of 1792.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">As to the second deed, which was <em>signed </em>by her, I think the certificate of her privy examination by the commissioners in the country, substantially good and sufficient; and that she has no claim to dower in the land conveyed by that deed. But as to the deed which she did not <em>sign, </em>though the certificate of the commissioners of her privy examination as to it, would also have been sufficient if she had signed it, she is not barred of her dower as to the lands thereby conveyed by her husband by that deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Whether she is entitled to be endowed, according to the value of the land at the time of the alienation by her husband, or at the time of the assignment of her dower, is another question. The 4th section of our statute of dower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>certainly does not embrace the case before us. It is, substantially, taken from the statute of <em>Merton, </em>which only provided for the case in which dower is claimed by a <em>feme covert, </em>of lands of which <em>her husband, died seized. </em>And this provision was an exception to the rule of the common law in all droitural actions, in which no damages were recovered ; and cannot be extended beyond tho provision, on any ground of policy or supposed hardship. In truth, in the case before us, it is more than probable, as the value of lands has generally fallen, that the value of the land was much greater at the date of the deed of alienation, than at this time; so that the rulo of the common law is a better rule for the <em>feme covert </em>than the rule under the statute. And tho rule of the common law is more consonant with the role established by this court, in the cases of <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Threlked </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh; </em>namely, that the value of the land at the date of the warranty, and not at the time of eviction, is the true measure of damages. It would be very hard on the alienee, to subject him to greater damages than he could recover upon the warranty of the husband against the heir, according to the decisions just mentioned. For <em>tho rule of the </em>common law in regard to such cases as that now before us, I refer to the authorities cited by judge <em>Carr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">On these grounds, I think the decree of the chancellor must be reversed, and the cause remanded for farther proceedings; in which dower is to be assigned to the appellee, of the lands conveyed by the first deed which she did not sign, according to the value at the date of the alienation by her husband, with the rents and profits from the suing out <em>the-subpoena </em>in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Tucker, <em>P. </em>The first question in this case, arises on the construction of the statute of conveyances of 1792. Disencumbering that section of <em>the </em>statute, <em>of those </em>words which are not immediately necessary in deciding this question, it provides that \u201c when husband and wife shall have <em>sealed </em>and <em>delivered </em>a writing purporting <em>to be </em>a <em>conveyance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>of any estate or interest, if, before two justices who may be empowered by commission <em>to examine her privily </em>and <em>take her acknowledgment, </em>the wife, being examined privily and apart from her husband, shall declare that she willingly <em>signed </em>and <em>sealed </em>the said writing, <em>to be then shewn and explained to her by them, </em>and consenteth that it may be recorded, and the said commissioners shall return with the said commission, and thereunto annexed, a certificate under their hands and seals of such privy examination and declaration, and consent yielded by her,\u201d then the deed shall be binding on the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\">According to this statute, the <em>commission </em>ought to recite, that the husband and wife had sealed and delivered a conveyance purporting to be a conveyance [here setting forth succinctly of what, or otherwise referring to the writing so as to describe it] and should empower the justices to examine her privily and take her acknowledgment of the said writing; and such commission, without more saying, would be good; for it is in the words of the law. And even if not literally in those words, yet if it be substantially so, it will suffice, or many titles in the country would be shaken. Thus, in the present case, though it is not stated, in terms, that the parties had sealed and delivered a conveyance, it is stated that \u201c by <em>indenture </em>(which is a writing sealed and delivered) dated the 12th October 1803, they had sold and conveyed\u201d an estate &amp;c. This is a substantial compliance, and therefore good.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Now as to the <em>certificate. </em>The law is not content with the justices merely echoing the commission, by certifying that <em>they had privily examined the wife, and she had aclcndwledged the writing; </em>but it goes on to prescribe what shall be certified by them. The wife, being examined privily and apart from her husband, must declare that she willingly <em>signed </em>and <em>sealed </em>the writing, <em>to be then shewn and explained to her; </em>and must consent that it be recorded. The justices are then to certify <em>such </em>privy examination (that is, that she was examined privily and apart from her husband) and such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>declaration made (that is, that she willingly signed and sealed the writing) and such consent yielded hy her (that is, that it be recorded). Nothing can be more clear than the construction of this clause, except as to the words \u201c to be then shewn and explained to her they do not seem, by a literal construction, to require the fact of shewing and explaining the deed to be expressly certified; for they stand out, as it were, from the rest of the clause, and seem merely directory. Yet, as in acts <em>in pais, </em>those presumptions are not usually made, that every thing has been rightly done unless the contrary appears, which are made by law in relation to the transactions of a court, it has been always my impression that, in strictness, this matter also must be certified or must in some form appear. If the question was now of the first impression, I should be for construing the statute with very great strictness. It prescribes the mode in which a person <em>may </em>convey, whose power of conveying was before circumscribed to the forms known to the common law. It is an innovation upon that law; it prescribes a form of conveyance unknown to it. It ought, therefore, to have been required to be strictly complied with : a literal compliance would not indeed have been demanded, but a substantial compliance in every thing material. I fear, however, that the practice of the country, ever since the introduction of the commission, has been very far from conforming to the requisitions of the law, with any thing like strictness. The alternative is therefore presented, of abating somewhat of this rigor, or of running the risk of shaking land titles. If the case of dower was alone in question, it would be less important, but conveyances of the maiden land of <em>femes covert </em>would also be involved. Our predecessors, accordingly, seem to have been cautious in their decisions upon the laws which were the originals of this statute. In <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Borden, </em>2 Wash. 156. it did not appear <em>from any part of the record, </em>that the commissioners were justices of the peace, as was required by the statute of 1748; they were not so styled in the commission : yet the court over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>ruled the objection, judge <em>Roane </em>saying, \u201c the law requires the cleric to direct it to such persons, and <em>he ought not to be presumed to have done wrong;\u201d </em>and judge <em>Fleming </em>said, \u201c I do not think that we carry the doctrine of presumption beyond its accustomed limits, when we say, that to support this deed <em>we ivill intend that the laiv has been obeyed </em>unless the contrary appear.\u201d In <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Cary, </em>2 Call 263. the <em>names </em>of the justices were omitted ; the commission was directed to \u2014-gentlemen justices; it was executed by two persons, who certified \u201c that they acted by virtue of the commission thereto annexed,\u201d but they did not say \u201cdirected to us,\u201d nor did they certify that they were justices of the peace : yet the objection was overruled. Influenced by like considerations in the recent case of <em>Langhorne v. Hobson, </em>this court overruled the objections to the commission and privy examination, and ratified the title of the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">What, then, let it be asked, is essential in the certificate? The answer is, that it should ascertain satisfactorily', in some form or other, those facts which the law deems essential to the transfer of the title of the yfeme. Those facts are, 1. her privy examination apart from her husband; 2. her knowledge of the nature of the act done; 3. her acknowledgment of the conveyance; 4. her declai-ation, that that acknowledgment is free and voluntary'; and 5. and last, her consent that it may be recorded. If these facts substantially appear, the certificate is good; and though not certified in so many words, if they satisfactorily appear, it will suffice. Now in this case, it is expressly certified, 1. that the <em>feme </em>was privily examined apart from her husband; and 2. that she acknowledged the conveyance of the 320 acres of land contained in the indenture thereto annexed. 3. Her knowledge of the nature of the act she was doing, appears from the certificate that she acknowledged the conveyance of <em>the </em>320 acres contained in <em>the </em>deed; for how could they certify that fact, unless she knew that that deed did convey that 320 acres ? 4. This acknowledgment was made freely and voluntarily; and lastly, she consented it should be recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>If this certificate be not sufficient, I fear there are few that are so in the commonwealth. I have examined the records of the circuit and hustings courts here. The following form is that which seems to have prevailed previous to 1819. It was printed at the foot of the printed commission. <em>\u201c </em>Pursuant to the within commission, we did this day examine the within named A. B. privily and apart from her husband, <em>and made known to her the contents of the annexed indenture, </em>when she acknowledged <em>the same </em>to be her act and deed, declaring to us that she did the same freely and voluntarily, without the persuasions or threats of her said husband, and was willing the said deed should be recorded.\u201d Here, there is no direct allegation that the deed was <em>shewn </em>to the <em>feme, </em>or that she acknowledged that she <em>signed </em>the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">I am, then, of opinion, that the deed of October 1803, was duly executed to bar the widow\u2019s claim of dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">I am however of a very different opinion as to the other deed, that of November 1801. For, though the certificate is the same, the fact is not according to the declaration and acknowledgment. When it is certified, that the <em>feme </em>acknowledged the deed, we may safely imply that she acknowledged that she had <em>signed </em>and <em>sealed </em>it, <em>if upon the face of the deed, </em>she <em>appears </em>to have <em>signed </em>and <em>sealed </em>it. But if the writing be in fact signed, without being sealed, her acknowledgment would not prove it to be <em>sealed; </em>and <em>e converso, </em>if it be <em>sealed </em>without being <em>signed, </em>the acknowledgment cannot justify the inference that it was <em>signed, </em>contrary to the express fact. And although we do not require the certificate to be in the express language of the law, neither do we dispense with any part of the law. We only consider the language used, as if it was the very language of the law. The purchaser\u2019s case can certainly be no better for its variance from that express language. Now, if the commissioners had followed the law literally, they would not have certified that the wife declared she had willingly <em>signed </em>and sealed, because she had not signed. Or take it to have been so certified; then it is certified that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>femes covert, </em>an exception to the rule may be inferred. Jt only remains on this part of the subject, to say, that I do not think the acknowledgment of the seal can be an acknowledgment of a signing, or that the insertion of the name of the <em>feme </em>in the body of the deed, can help the case. <em>signed, </em>when in fact she had not; so that the certificate or declaration is falsified. It was said, indeed, that this word <em>signing </em>has been here introduced inadvertently. But of this we are not entitled to judge : <em>it a lex scripta est. </em>It is more probable, that the legislature considered signing a necessary concomitant of every deed or conveyance. I am not prepared to dive into its motives, but if it be true at this day, that deeds are in general to be considered good though not signed, I think it is at least fortunate that in relation to</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The widow is, I think, clearly entitled to dower in the 300 acre tract, conveyed by the deed of November 1801.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">In this view of the case the decree must of course be reversed ; and, therefore, an examination whether it did or did not exclude the .improvements in the order to lay off the dower, is unnecessary. On that point, I shall only say, that I think the law very clear, that, in laying off the dower, the improvements <em>made by the purchaser, </em>should be excluded from the estimate, except that improvement in the productive character of the soil which arises from the course of husbandry. In like manner, I am of opinion, that the accession of value arising merely from the progress of society, and the general progressive increase in the value of lands consequent upon increasing wealth and population, cannot be thrown into the scale of the purchaser, or diminish the <em>quantity </em>of land to which the widow will be entitled. But on this point my brethren differ from me.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">As to the profits: I have always thought, that, as the alienee is not liable at law for rents and profits, because the statute of <em>Merton </em>copied in the 4th section of our statute of dower, only gave damages where the widow was deforced of lands whereof the husband died seized, so neither ought she to recover them in equity. It seems to me an absurdity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>that in matters of <em>concurrent </em>jurisdiction, there should be different measures of redress in the two courts. It is yet more strange, that when, with a view to affording facilities to the dowress, jurisdiction is entertained of her case, instead of leaving her to her legal remedy against a party claiming a legal title, her remedies should bo so vastly enlarged by this assumption of jurisdiction : and it is most of all strange, when the statute limits the damages to one class of cases, and excludes them from another, that a court of equity should repeal or add to the act of the legislature. I do not think there is an adjudged case to justify it, in the case of the alienee. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Curtis </em>was cited to prove that equity will go farther than the law in giving a remedy to the dowress : for although at law, the action against the heir as a deforceor, dies with him in respect to the damages, because it is in the nature of a tort, yet in that case, the demaud for profits was sustained though the heir died before the decree. But it is to be observed, that the court proceeded mainly on the idea that the dowress brought her suit in the lifetime of the heir, and waived the trespass by bringing her bill in equity; and I am aware of no case in which the bill lies for mesne profits, <em>unless filed before </em>the death of the heir. That cases have been decided in <em>New York, </em>on this point, favorably to the widow, cannot be denied; <em>Swaine </em>v. <em>Perine, </em>5 Johns. Ch. Rep. 492. <em>Hale </em>v. <em>James, 6 </em>Id. 258. But these cases are not authority for us, where they are neither sustained by the current of decisions of those tribunals from which we have drawn our law, nor are consistent with its acknowledged principles. There is no such current of authorities in favor of the widow\u2019s right to profits against the alienee. In <em>Dormer </em>v. <em>Fortescue, </em>3 Atk. 124. 131. lord <em>Hardwicke, </em>in deciding another point, incidentally mentions the case of a widow, and states that in some cases she will be decreed profits from the time her title accrued; but, even in this incidental remark, he takes a distinction : where the widow cannot proceed at law because of a term that is in her way, the court will give her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>profits from the time her title accrued ; but where the term is out of her way, and she has no need to come into this court, it would have been otherwise. That is, in effect, the court of equity <em>alone </em>having jurisdiction in the first case, administers relief at its pleasure; but having only concurrent jurisdiction in the latter, it 'follows the law, and gives profits only as the law would give them. It is proper to add also, that lord <em>Hardwicke </em>does not advert particularly to the case of the alienee. The case of <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Curtis </em>was a case against the heir as was also the case of <em>Mundy, </em>v. <em>Mundy, 2 </em>Ves. jr. 132. and so, I think, we must take <em>Oliver v. Richardson, </em>9 Ves. 222. There being, then, no direct controling authority, and the two jurisdictions being concurrent as to this matter, I think the court of equity should follow the law, and give no damages in dower against the alienee, except from the date of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">With these views, I am of opinion to reverse the decree and send the cause back for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"A-J\">Decree reversed, and the cause remanded to the court of chancery for further proceedings, in which dower should be assigned to the appellee of the land conveyed by the deed of her husband which she did not sign, (that of November 1801) according to the value of the land at the date of the deed; and an account should be taken of the profits, from the suing out of the <em>subpoena </em>in the cause.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
