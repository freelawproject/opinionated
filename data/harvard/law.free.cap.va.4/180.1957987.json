Whether, if a defendant in an execution gives a furthcoming bond for property which does not belong to him, or in which he has but a qualified interest, his seenritics in such forthcoming bond can be relieved in Chan-eery, on taut account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-6\"><em>Montague </em>recovered a judgment against Syme, for work and labour performed as a carpenter. An execution issued, which was levied on some negroes, and <em>Syme </em>and others, his sureties, entered into a forthcoming bond for their delivery to the sheriff, at the time and place of sale. <em>Syme </em>and his sureties then obtained an injunction from the Chancellor of the <em>Richmond </em>District, (the late Mr. Wythe,) stating, among other things, that <em>Syme </em>had been ruled into a trial of the action at lav/, although he had made affidavit of the absence of <em>some </em>of his witnesses, and of their materiality; in consequence of which a judgment for much too large a sum had been rendered against him; and that the negroes taken in execution were, in fact, not his property, but had been settled in a marriage contract upon two of his daughters. The Chancellor dissolved the injunction, and finally dismissed the bill. <em>Syme </em>and his sureties appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-8\">After argument by <em>Warden </em>and Randolph, for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARA\">and by the <em>Attorney General, </em>for the appellee, Judges Tucker and Fleming (Judge Roane declining to sit in the cause) delivered the following opinions.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b197-9\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"A92\">This case, stript of all the unimportant iJlegationii and evidence contained in the record, appears to be simply an application to the Court of Chancery to set aside, and reverse the proceedings and trial at law, for errors alleged to have been committed there. The reasons assigned by the Chancellor in his decree, for dissolving the injunction and dismissing the complainant\u2019s bill, \u201c that if the Court, before which the verdict was found, in the 5 action at common lav/, erred in rejecting the motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u201c continuance, the Court of Chancery for that reason award- \u201c ing a new trial, would usurp jurisdiction impertinently j\u201d and \u201c that if the verdict were contrary to evidence, or 44 were found upon insufficient evidence, application, which 44 ought to have been to the Court where the trial was had, 44 was with like impropriety addressed to the Court of Chan-44 eery for such other trial,\u201d are conclusive as <em>to John Symey </em>the defendant in that suit. As to the other defendants, how friendly soever their motives might have been for becoming <em>John Syrne\u2019,s </em>security in the forthcoming bond, to prevent the sale of property taken to satisfy an execution against him, though belonging wholly or in part to other persons, neither law nor equity can, I conceive, regard them in any other light than as securities for a debtor, .who by giving a bond, reciting (as is the usual form) that the execution was levied on certain slaves, the property of the debtor, are, as well as the debtor, estopped from setting up any title adv\u00e9rsary to that of the debtor. Their becoming his security, with any view to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s lien on the slaves taken as his property, would be such an intromission into the cause, as would not be permitted, in any Court, in favour of persons who did-not; claim the property as <em>their own. </em>They do not pretend any right to it themselves. They undertake for the production of it, as the property of the debtor on the day of sale. Whether the property were worth little or much, and whether <em>Syme\u2019s </em>interest therein were entire, or merely temporary, the not producing it according to the condition of the obligation subjected them to the payment of the whole debt. Nor do I conceive it competent to a Court of Equity to make any inquiry either of the actual value of the slaves, nor whether <em>Syrne </em>had an absolute, or merely a. qualified and temporary property therein. For those reasons I am of opinion the decree ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b198-8\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AsP\">I have perused and considered this lengthy record with great attention, and can discover no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>error in the decree. The reasons of the Chancellor for not meddling with the trial, and judgment at law between <em>Montague </em>and Syme, are cogent and satisfactory. As to the other plaintiffs, who were securities in the <em>forthcoming </em>bond, (the judgment on <em>which </em>they have sought to be relieved against,) Mr. <em>Randolph </em>contended, that they are entitled to relief, in consideration of the qualified interest <em>Syme </em>bad in the negroes taken iu <em>execution; </em>and took a distinction between a case where the insufficiency of the property to satisfy an execution, might arise from the qualified interest the debtor had in the property, and a case where the property <em>itself </em>might be insufficient for the purpose ; but to me it seems a distinction without a difference ; and, of whatever value the property might be, the bond taken for its forthcoming at the day and place of sale, became forfeited, if there was a failure in its delivery; and the securities became liable for the amount of the debt. I therefore concur in the opinion that the decree- be Ar-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
