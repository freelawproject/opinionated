The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the inquiry, and the court thinking it improper, would not suffer it to be answered. 2. The defendant\u2019s counsel (with the same view) asked the witness, whether <em>Mershon </em>and <em>Benier </em>had done any thing evincing ill feelings towards the defendant, and if so, what they had done ? The witness having answered the first part of this question in the affirmative, and going on, in answer to the latter, to speak of the papers referred to in the first question above mentioned, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the evidence, and the court stopt the witness, and would not suffer him to speak of those papers. 3. The defendant (still with the same view) asked the witness, whether be had ever heard <em>Mershon </em>and <em>Benier </em>repeat certain words, which they or either of them acknowledged they had written and published concerning the defendant, and which he offered to prove were violently abusive of him ? The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected, that the question was improper, and the court sustained the objection. And then, 4. the defendant offered testimony to prove the fact, that <em>Mershon </em>and <em>Benier </em>had written and published papers very derogatory from his character and abusive; but the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the evidence, and the court excluded it. To which opinions of the court, the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-4\">The <em>second </em>bill of exceptions stated, that, the defendant intending to impeach the credit of the plaintiff\u2019s witness <em>Mershon, </em>on the ground of his hostility towards the defendant, the plaintiff to sustain <em>Mershon\u2019s </em>credit, introduced a witness named <em>Tvtt, </em>who testified that he was well acquainted with <em>Mershon, </em>that his character for veracity was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>fair, and that his testimony in a court of justice was worthy of credit. On cross examination, <em>Tutt </em>said, that having heard, shortly before, that Mershon bad <em>been </em>making some statements concerning himself, for which <em>he </em>determined to call him to account upon sight, he had accordingly called upon <em>Mershon, </em>who denied having ever made such statements, with which denial he, <em>Tutt, </em>was satisfied. Whereupon, the defendant\u2019s counsel put this question to Tutt\u2014 \u201c Did you derive the information of <em>Mershon\u2019s </em>having made the statements about you, which he afterwards denied having made, from gentlemen in whose veracity you placed-the most implicit confidence ?\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the question, and the court sustained the objection; to which the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\">Verdict and judgement for the plaintiff for 300 dollars; from which <em>Rixey </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-5\"><em>Stanard </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-6\"><em>Briggs </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b356-7\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">The court is of opinion, that the circuit court erred in excluding a portion of the evidence, stated in thejfirsi bill of exceptions, the object of which was to prove particular facts, shewing that the witnesses, who had been examined by the plaintiff, had ill feelings towards the appellant. It is true, particular facts are not permitted to be proved, to impeach the credit of a witness when supported by general reputation ; but hostility towards one of the parties is not, in its nature, a matter of general reputation ; and if proved at all, must be proved by particular facts or circumstances. \u2022 The objection to the opinion of the circuit court stated in the <em>second </em>bill of exceptions, is not well founded. The court was right in refusing to permit the witness <em>Tutt </em>to answer a question intended to prove a particular fact, in order to discredit a witness, to whose general character for veracity he had before borne testimony. The credit of a <em>witness </em>can be impeached by general evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>only, and not by evidence as to particular facts. Stark.
