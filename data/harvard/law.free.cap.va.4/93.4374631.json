Soon after the marriage, <em>Taylor </em>sent to <em>Mr. Crutchfield </em>a family of negroes, among whom was a boy, <em>Isaac. </em>These slaves remained with <em>Crutchfield </em>in <em>Botetourt </em>until the death of his wife, in- the latter part of the year 1830; when all but <em>Isaac </em>were sent back to <em>Mr. Taylor\u2019s, </em>with the infant child of <em>Crutchfield.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-13\"><em>Isaac </em>remained with <em>Crutchfield </em>until <em>Crutchfield\u2019s </em>death in 1834, having once accompanied <em>Crutchfield </em>to <em>Mr. Taylor\u2019s, </em>and remained there with him whilst he <em>remained; </em>and on another occasion, having been sent by <em>Crutchfield </em>with some horses of his own, to <em>Mr. Taylor\u2019s, </em>where he remained for a part of the winter, and returned with the horses in the spring.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>On the death of <em>Crutchfield, </em>his executors took <em>Isaac </em>into their possession, and hired him out until 1837, when he ran away and went to <em>Mr. Taylor's, </em>who retained him, and claimed him as his own property; insisting that he had only lent him to <em>Crutchfield. </em>The executors of <em>Crutchfield </em>then brought an action of <em>detinue </em>against <em>Taylor </em>for the purpose of recovering said slave; and <em>Taylor </em>having died during the pendency of the action, it was revived against his executor; and when the cause came on for trial, there was a verdict and judgment in favour of <em>Taylor's </em>ex\u2019or.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AI4\">After the death of <em>Crutchfield, Beale </em>and <em>Christ </em>recovered judgments against his executors; and after the action of <em>detinue </em>had terminated in favour of <em>Taylor's </em>ex\u2019or, they caused executions which had been issued upon their judgments, to be levied on the slave <em>Isaac, </em>then in the possession of <em>Charles C. Taylor, </em>to whom he had been bequeathed by <em>James Taylor.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\">Upon the levy of the executions, <em>Charles C. Taylor </em>applied to one of the Judges of the General Court for an injunction to prevent the sale of the slave. In his bill he alleged that the slave was of peculiar value to him: that his father <em>James Taylor </em>died in possession of said slave, claiming him as his own, and insisting that he had only lent him to <em>Crutchfield; </em>and by his will had given him to the plaintiff, who had taken possession of him immediately, with the assent of the executor ; and had since held him as his own. He referred to the judgment which had been rendered in the action of <em>detinue </em>by <em>Crutchfield\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors against <em>Taylorls </em>ex\u2019or; and relied upon it as a conclusive bar to the claim of <em>Crutchfield's </em>ex\u2019ors and creditors: and making the sheriff, the creditors <em>Beale </em>and <em>Christ, </em>and the executors of <em>Crutchfield </em>parties, he prayed for an injunction to the sale, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-6\">The injunction was granted ; and thereupon, <em>Beale </em>and <em>Christ, </em>and the executors of <em>Crutchfield </em>answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the bill. They insisted that the slave had been given to <em>Crutchfield </em>by <em>James Taylor </em>as an advancement, That ho had been in the possession of <em>Crutchfield </em>from a period very shortly after his marriage until his death; and had then come into the possession of his executors. in whose possession he remained until 1837, when he ran away. That if the slave had been put into the possession of <em>Crutchfield </em>as a loan, and not as an advancement, he had been in his possession and that of his executors for more than five years before the executions had been levied upon him ; and that he was therefore liable for the debts of <em>Crutchfield. </em>And they alleged that the action of <em>detinue </em>was defended by the executor of <em>Taylor </em>mainly on the ground that the slave had never been in his possession; and that the cause had been decided on this point. They, therefore, deny that the judgment in the action of <em>detinue </em>is conclusive against the executors of <em>Crutchfield; </em>and insist that it certainly does not conclude his creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-5\">A great many depositions were fded in the cause, which left it doubtful whether the slave had been put into the possession of <em>Crutchfield </em>as a loan or advancement ; and also on what ground the executor of <em>Taylor </em>had succeeded in the action of <em>detinue.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-6\">When the cause came on to be heard, the Court held that after the judgment in the action of detinue, the slave could not be considered as assets of <em>Crutchfield\u2019s </em>estate; and that, therefore, the levy of the executions was illegal. But as the negro had remained in possession of <em>Crutchfield </em>for more than five years, and no writing evidencing a loan had been recorded, he was liable to <em>C}'utchfield\u2019s </em>creditors. And it being agreed that <em>Crutchfield\u2019s </em>estate was insolvent, and an account thereof being dispensed with, the Court appointed a commissioner to collect the hires of the slave, who had been hired out under an order of the Court, and to make sale of him at public auction, on a credit of six and twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>months; and make report of his proceedings to the Court. From this decree the plaintiff applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-4\"><em>Sheffey, </em>and <em>B. R.

And it must be taken as regards the representatives of said <em>James Taylor, </em>and as regards the appellant claiming only his title, by bequest in his will, and his executor\u2019s assent to the legacy, that the said slave was a loan from the said <em>James Taylor </em>to the said <em>Crutchfield.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">And the Court is of opinion, that the appellees, as creditors of said <em>Crutchfield, </em>are in no wise barred or precluded by the verdict and judgment against the executors of said <em>Crutchfield </em>in said action of <em>detinue, </em>from subjecting the said slave, as the property of their debtor, to the payment of their just demands: it appearing from the evidence in this cause that possession of said slave remained with said <em>Crutchfield </em>from the time of said alleged parol loan, by the space of five years, without demand made and pursued by due process of law on the part of the said <em>James Taylor, </em>the pretended lender; notwithstanding the time within the said period of five years during which the said slave, on one occasion, was at the residence of said <em>Taylor, </em>attending the said <em>Crutchfield </em>on a visit to the former, and on another occasion upon the farm of said <em>Taylor, </em>and with his assent employed in the business of and by the said <em>Crutch-field.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">And the Court is further of opinion, that if the said slave was merely loaned to the said <em>Crutchfield, </em>as alleged by the said <em>James Taylor </em>in his lifetime, and by his executor, and his legatee, the appellant, since his death, the contract of loan, notwithstanding the possession under the same for more than five years, was good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>between the parties and those claiming under them; and the said <em>James Taylor </em>in his lifetime having regained the possession of said slave, and held him till his death, and his executor having defeated the executors sa-id <em>Crutchfield, </em>in the said action of <em>detinue </em>brought by them to recover the said slave, who was thereafter held by the appellant, with the assent of the said <em>James Taylor's </em>ex\u2019or, adversely to the said <em>Crutchfield's </em>ex\u2019ors, the said property was not in contemplation of law, assets in the hands of said <em>Crutchfield's </em>ex\u2019ors, to be administered, when the executions of the appellees <em>Christ </em>and <em>Beale </em>were levied thereupon: and therefore that the said levy was unlawful, and the appellant might have maintained an action at law to recover such damages as he had sustained by reason of that unlawful levy. But the appellant in his bill having alleged himself to be the owner of said slave, and thereby presented a proper case, if he could establish it by proofs, for the interposition of a Court of Equity in his behalf, because of the peculiar nature and value of the property in controversy ; and the Circuit Court having at his instance restrained a sale of the said slave under said levy, and taken possession of said slave and his accruing hires, it is not for the appellant to object to the jurisdiction of the said Court, on the ground that he had failed to shew himself the owner of the property as against the appellees ; or to complain that the Court perpetuated the injunction which had been granted him, (though it appeared he was not the owner of the property,) and would have proceeded to give him further relief, by decreeing payment of said executions out of the assets, if any, of said <em>Crutchfield's </em>estate in the hands of his executors, (whom the appellant had properly made defendants by his bill,) and had ordered an account with that view, which was dispensed with in consequence of the admission of the parties that said <em>Crutchfield's </em>estate was utterly insolvent. And the Court having thus as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>sumed jurisdiction of the case at the instance of the appellant, it was proper that it should go on to dispose of the whole subject according to the rights of the parties, by applying the hires which had accrued from said slave while in the hands of the Court, towards the discharge of said executions, and providing for the satisfaction of the residue thereof, by a sale of said slave, and the proper application of the <em>proceeds; </em>a relief to which the said appellees would have been unquestionably entitled, if they had filed a cross bill for that purpose; and which filing of a cross bill, would, under the circumstances of the case, have been a mere formality.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that there is no error in the said decree of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The decree affirmed with costs to the appellees <em>Beale </em>and <em>Christ; </em>and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
