He gave a written notice, of his intention to move for a writ of <em>ad quod </em>damnum, to <em>Thomas </em>Coleman, u acting trustee and K executor of <em>Thomas </em>Rowlett, deceased,\u201d stating that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>the said <em>Coleman </em>had lands above the said place, on the said stream, <em>vested </em>in him in trust for certain purposes designated by the last will and testament of his testator, and that the object of the intended application was to ascertain what damages might be occasioned to him as acting trusr . , , <em>. . . ~ </em>te;e aforesaid, or to other persons, by erecting a dam o\u00ed the height of 15 feet 2 inches. In the petition and order hor the writ of <em>ad quod </em>damnum, as stated in the record, nothing was said of the height of the dam ; but the writ \u00b0 \u00b0 issued by the cleric directed the inquiry of damages to be made, upon the supposition that the height of the clam was to he as above mentioned. A notice was also given to <em>Coleman </em>of the time and place of meeting of the Jury, who found that, by a dam 15 feet and two inches high, no <em>J </em>0 mansion-house, offices, curtilage or orchard would be overflowed ; that the passage of fish and ordinary navigation would not be obstructed ; and that, in their opinion, the health of the neighbours would not be annoyed by the stagnation of the waters ; that three acres of-land belong-w \u00b0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>ing to the <em>estate of Thomas Sow It tt, deceased, </em>would be overflowed, together with <em>all other damages </em>to the value of fi iy dollars ; and that the estate of no other person would sustain any damage. Their inquisition so made was first signed and sealed by <em>John G. Baptist, </em>(the deputy-sheriff who attended them,) in this manner, \u201c Witness <em>John G.

Baptist. </em>On the return of the inquest, the Court ordered a summons to be issued to <em>Thomas Coleman, </em>\u201csole acting <em>executor and trustee </em>o\u00ed <em>Thomas Hewlett, </em>deceased,\u201d to shew' cause if any he could, why leave should not be granted to <em>Francis Moody </em>to build his mill agreeable to the inquisition and Jury\u2019s report there\u00bb upon. This summons was returned, executed by' <em>John (l. Baptist, </em>deputy of <em>William G.

No order was made directing the payment of the fifty dollars to <em>Coleman, </em>but the record stated that <em>Moody </em>produced the money at the clerk\u2019s table, and called on <em>Coleman's </em>attorney to receive it, who refused ; and no person entitled thereto appearing to receive it, it was ordered that the clerk should receive and keep it for the benefit of \u201c the proprietors or persons damaged agreea41 ble to the Inquest.\u201d</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b18-20\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>2.

If the Jury find that a certain number of acres of land will be overflowed, <em>sf together ei \u2018\u00bft&gt;ith all other damages </em>to the value of a specified sum,\u201d it is special enough, and will not bar an action for any damages not foreseen and estimated by them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b18-23\">. \u00ab'h An order of Court granting leave to erect a mill is valid, though no order be made directing payment of the damages found by the inquisition.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b18-25\">6; An inquisition in a mill case ought not to be set aside on the ground that the jurors, before they were sworn, and afterwards, when their verdict had been agreed upon, hut before they had signed it, ate and drank moderately at the expense of the appellant, no corruption appearing, and the opposite party having consented.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b18-26\">7. It is sufficient for the clerk to state in the record, that the writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>with the inquisition annexed, was returned by the <em>shenff, </em>without inserting a copy of the signature <em>of </em>the sheriff, or of his deputy, to the return ;\u2022 a copy of the inquisition itself with the signatures of the jurors Jbeing inserted in the record.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>On an appeal to the District Court of <em>Brunswick, </em>the order of the County Court was affirmed; whereupon <em>Coleman </em>again appealed to the Court of Appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-7\">A number of witnesses were examined before this Court, whose testimony (under the rule now established) was committed to writing ; but to mention even its substance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>in our report of the case, would be tedious and useless. Suffice it to say that the weight of evidence was in favour of establishing the mill, as greatly conducive to the convenience of the neighbourhood ; and the witnesses generally were of opinion, that the <em>quantum </em>of damages had \u25a0 been rather overrated by the Jury, for the purpose of satisfying Coleman, and putting an end to further controversy. One circumstance, however, must be noted. It appeared in evidence that the Jury met at <em>Moody\u2019s </em>house ; that the weather being very warm, and some of them having travelled a considerable distance, he set out some spirits, took a drink himself, and said he was disagreeably situated because he could not offer them any; that <em>Coleman, </em>who was present, said he had no objection to their taking some refreshment, and so saying, set the example <em>himself; </em>that thereupon most of the Jury, took a little spirits and water ; that when they had finished viewing the mill-seat and grounds on the creek, they returned to the house, at a late hour in the evening, after having agreed on their report ; and while the deputy-sheriff and surveyor who at-ended them were writing the inquisition, they again drank moderately and ate at <em>Moody\u2019s </em>expense'; that <em>Coleman </em>made no objection to their doing so, partook of the same refreshments, and stayed with them until they had all signed the inquisition; that some of the jurors might, perhaps, have <em>felt </em>what they drank, but none of them appeared intoxicated ; that one of them made a slight objection to part of the inquisition, before it was finished, but after-wards waived the objection, and approved of it as written.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-5\">On the p; v t of the appellee, for the purpose of proving that Coleman, as <em>proprietor </em>or <em>tenant </em>of the land, was the person who ought to have been summoned, the will of <em>Thomas </em>Rowlett, dated the 29th of December, 1805, and recorded the 13ih of January, 1806, was introduced and read ; (though not inserted in the record of the proceedings in this cause in either of the Courts below ;) but the Judges gave no opinion relative to its admissibility as evidence, From that document it appeared, that after certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>\u25a0viKiciiic and pecuniarv legacies, the testator directed all the 1 . , , . ' , , , , , residue of his estate, both real and personal, to oe cept together for <em>two </em>years after his death, and then to lx: sold by his executors, and \u201c after paying his debts, if any should be due, and the legacies aforesaid, that the whole \u201c of Ids estate <em>arising from the said sales, and the profits </em>\u201c <em>of his estate until the said </em>sales, be divided into three \u201c equal par\u00eds,\u201d &amp;c. <em>'Thomas Coleman </em>alone qualified as executor. The summons was issued <em>August </em>12th, and served <em>September </em>14th, <em>1807; </em>and the County Court acted finally on the subject in <em>December </em>following, before the two years in which the estate was directed to be kept together had expired. Parol evidence ivas also introduced (without any decision as to its being admissible) to shew that <em>Coleman </em>exercised acts of ownership, or such as evinced possession of the land, during those two years, by employing overseers and receiving the profits ; in the course of which investigation it appeared, that shortly after the decision, in the County Court, he sold the land at public sale, in obedience to the directions of the will, and became himself the purchaser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-8\">[Among other evidence the appellant offered to read the deposition- of <em>William W. </em>Green, taken by virtue of a commission issued from this Court on an affidavit filed, that the witness was, through infirmity, unable to attend. It appeared that <em>Coleman </em>had himself accompanied the person employed to give notice of the time and place, to the house of Moody, whose wife informed them that he was then in <em>North-Car </em>olina, and would not return until a day or two after <em>that </em>appointed for taking the <em>deposition; </em>that on their way, they had been told by others, that <em>Moody </em>was gone to <em>North-Car olina ; </em>that nevertheless, the notice was given to Mrs. <em>Moody </em>on a Saturday, and the deposition taken on the <em>Wednesday </em>following, being the 22d day of <em>March ; </em>that <em>Moody </em>returned home a day or two after-wards ; that <em>Coleman, </em>meeting with him at a public house, where the witness and two magistrates happened to be present, told him he might ask the witness any questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>he thought proper, before those magistrates, and the answers given might be read as evidence in the <em>cause; </em>but did not shew him the deposition, without seeing which, it was contended on his part, he could not have known what Questions to ask ; that indeed, the paper itself had, previously to this occurrence, been delivered to the Clerk of the Court of Appeals. It was also proved that <em>Bloody </em>was at <em>Blecklenbitrgh </em>Court (on his way to <em>North-Caro</em>lina) the <em>Thursday </em>before that on which the deposition was taken, and that <em>Coleman </em>was there also. <em>George K. Taylor, </em>counsel for the appellant, endeavoured to excuse his precipitation in taking this deposition before <em>Moody\u2019s </em>return, by stating that <em>Coleman </em>at that time expected the cause to be tried before the end of the <em>BTarch </em>term, and therefore thought it necessary to be expeditious in preparing for trial; though during that term, by consent of the counsel on both sides, but without his knowledge until after the deposition was taken, the 2d of <em>May </em>was appointed for the hearing. Mr. <em>Taylor </em>also solicited the Court (should they be of opinion that the notice was insufficient) to renew the commission, and grant a farther day in the term. But the Court unanimously declared- the notice not to have been reasonable, and rejecting the deposition, moreover refused to delay the hearing.]</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aqi\">\n<em>George K. Taylor,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2\">for the appellant, (besides contending that, on the merits, leave ought not to be granted to raise the dam to the height of 15 feet 2 inches,) made the following objections to the proceedings in the County Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ\">1. According to the 3d section of the act concerning mills,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the summons must be issued to the <em>proprietors </em>or <em>tenants </em>of the lands found liable to damage. It should have appeared, therefore, upon the record, that <em>Thomas Coleman </em>was <em>tenant </em>or <em>proprietor; </em>but here there is nothing to shew this. He is only styled <em>executor </em>and trustee, from neither of which characters can it be implied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>lie was entitled to, or in possession of the land. The case of <em>Tanner\u2019s </em>Administrator v. Sadler<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> fortifies this objection; for there, though it was decided that an administrator, being in possession of the land of his intestate for special purposes, cottld maintain a <em>caveat, </em>yet the fact <em>. . r </em>, . , . , of his possession was expressly found m the special verdict, and nothing was left to presumption, or extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-6\">2. The original motion was merely for a writ of <em>ad quod </em>damnum, in general terms, and the order of Court was made accordingly. By what authority then did the clerk mention in the writ, 15 feet 2 inches? By so doing, he precluded the Jury from stating the advantage or disadvantage of making the height less or more than that specified in the writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-7\">3. The Jury find \u201c <em>all oilier </em>damages,\u201d to the value of fifty' dollars ; not the injury to the land alone. The 7th section of the act of Assembly<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> provides, that an action shall not be barred for damages not foreseen by the Jury ; yet this comprehensive and indefinite finding of \u201c all other \u201c damages,\u201d would bar any7 future action. The verdict should have specially and distinctly stated each injury, and its value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-9\">4. After the Court had granted leave to erect the mill, <em>Moody </em>produced fifty dollars, and no person appeared to receive it. The inference is strong that <em>Coleman </em>was not the person in possession. Besides, no <em>order </em>was made that the money' should be paid to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-11\"><em>5. </em>The Jury7 drank at the expense of Moody, the party in whose favour their verdict was given; which is a fatal error, according to Lord <em>Coke </em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>though, in such case, if the verdict be <em>against </em>that party, it shall not be set aside.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-12\">Munford., for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agh\">observed, that <em>Moody </em>being-owner of the land on both sides of the stream, was not obliged to give notice of his intended application for the writ of <em>ad quod </em>damnum, or of the time and place of meeting of the Jury, to <em>Coleman </em>or any body else. Such notices are required by law7, only where the person applying, owns the land on <em>one side </em>of a water course, and shat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>on the opposite side, against which he would abut his dam, is owned by another person, to whom such notices must be given.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> It is true, then, that in this case the notices were works of supererogation <em>; </em>yet the first of them served t0 aPPr^ze t^ie appellant of the ground on which he was made a party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai\">It ought to <em>he. presumed </em>from this record, that' <em>Coleman </em>was either entitled to the legal estate, or in possession of the land, as he is repeatedly styled, and admitted to be, sole acting executor and <em>trustee </em>of the last will and testament of Rowlett, whose lands alone are found liable to damage. The notice first given informed him that the land was considered as <em>vested </em>in him for the purposes designated by the will; the summons also must have been understood by him in the same manner ; yet he no where denies his title to, or possession of the land, neither does the point appear to have been made by a bill of exceptions, or in any other way. This objection is evidently an afterthought, suggested by the fertile genius of his counsel in this Court, but which never entered into the mind of <em>Coleman </em>himself. If he was neither proprietor nor tenant of the land, he was not interested in the controversy, and therefore, ought not to have meddled with it. Yet we. find him in every stage of the proceedings, appearing by his attorney, or in person, and opposing every step taken by <em>Moody ; </em>but never on the ground that he was not himself interested in the point in dispute. If, indeed, that had been the case, he would have had no right to appeal from the order, according to the decision of this Court in the case of <em>Sayer </em>v. <em>Grymes.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL\">\u201e - ijirif , But, if the question be doubtful from the record, we have proved his <em>possession </em>by the copy of the will, and by parol evidence, which, in cases of this sort is always, admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-8\">- According to the will, even if the <em>legal estate </em>was not in Coleman, not being expressly devised to the executors, the <em>possession </em>was ; for he was the only person who had a right to hold the land, and keep it together until the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>two vears; there being no devise of the <em>land </em>to any other person. He was to receive the profits, and be accountable for them, towards the payment of debts and legacies, and finally to sell the land and divide the <em>money </em>among the distributees. He was therefore certainly as much to be considered in possession, as an executor or administrator of a person dying after the first day of <em>March.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-5\">As to the second point, the clerk\u2019s mentioning in the writ the height to which <em>Moody </em>wished to raise his dam, certainly could not have the effect of limiting the Jury in their inquiries. Their being directed to inquire what damages would result from a height of 15 feet 2 inches, did not preclude them from examining the subject in other aspects also, and stating if they thought proper, the comparative advantages and disadvantages of that and other degrees of elevation. But, in fact, the clerk acted correctly in mentioning the height of the dam ; because, in so doing, he submitted to the Jury the true point in dispute, as was evident from the notice, according to which, no doubt, the motion was made ; though in his concise manner of entering the order of Court in the minute-book, he did not express that circumstance in the order. The same thing is proved by all the subsequent proceedings, and by the conduct of <em>Coleman </em>himself, who should have moved to quash the writ of <em>ad quod </em>damnum, if it had issued incorrectly ; but never made such a motion, and ought not to be permitted to make it now at this late stage of the controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-6\">The third objection is a strange one indeed ! It amounts to this, that the power of the Junr is superior to that of a positive law ; that their finding that <em>all the damages </em>(which can only signify all the damages <em>estimated by them) </em>amounted to fifty dollars, could prevent the proprietor of the land from recovering, in an action, for other damages not foreseen nor estimated by them ; notwithstanding the act of Assembly declares that such action shall be maintainable. The law does not direct the Jury to state separately, (like items in an account,) damage:; for every inconvenience which may arise, from erecting the dam ; hut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ag\u00e9ner\u00e1l finding of the aggregate amount of damages, isv always considered as sufficient: neither was it necessary in this case, to mention the value of the three acres of land which would be overflowed <em>;\u25a0 </em>as it is to value the acre laid off for the abutment of a dam.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-11\">The fourth point is not more tenable than the last. That' no person appeared to receive the fifty dollars, is easily ex\u00bb plained by the spirit of opposition manifested by <em>Coleman </em>throughout; a spirit which would not permit him to re\u00bb eeive the money, for fear of giving some countenance to the motion of his adversary, and which has carried this' apparently unimportant dispute (to the great expense and vexation of both parties), through the County and District Courts up to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-12\">As to the circumstance that the Jury took a little spirit and water at the house of the appellee, before they were sworn, and after returning from their very fatiguing ser\u00bb vice, (which, in both instances, was done with the assent and co-operation of the appellant,) the objection is too captious and trifling to be countenanced in these enlightened timesj especially when it appears in evidence that the Jury was highly respectable, and far above being influenced by such a pitiful consideration. Neither is it by any means clear that the verdict was <em>in favour of </em>Moody, the party\" who treated them with this slight refreshment; for it is proved that the damages they allowed to Coleman, were, more than the value of'any injury the estate he represented could sustain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-13\">Upon the merits, the evidence clearly supports the mo\u00bb tion, and authorises the order upon every ground of pri - va!?. benefit and public expediency. But if this were doubtful, the concurrent decisions of the District and, County Courts, ought to be sanctioned here, as was done in the case of <em>Home </em>v. <em>Richards </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In <em>Noel </em>v. <em>Sale,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>also, the decision was presumed to have been right \u201c for \u201c reasons appearing to the Court.\u201d below, notwithstanding those reasons were not specified in the record.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Wickham, on the same side,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asp\">said there was no difficulty win the subject of the summons, because a trustee for the payment of debts or legacies is always considered as in possession of the legal estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-3\">Nothing in the law requires the Court to make any order about the money. The entry of <em>Moody\u2019s </em>offer to pay the fifty dollars, was the act of the clerk, and altogether unnecessary. The maxim therefore applies that \u201c <em>utile per </em>\u201c <em>inutile non </em>vitiatur.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-4\">It was also unnecessary to mention in the writ of <em>ad quod </em>damnum,' the proposed height of the <em>dam; </em>but its insertion cannot vitiate. Mentioning fifteen feet 2 inches, hound only and limited Moody, but could not benefit Limit takes latitude from him and promotes certainty. No human being is injured by it but the appellee. The appellant, therefore, if it was an error, cannot avail himself-of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-5\">The finding of the Jury in this case is rather more special than usual. Their mentioning the three acres was unnecessary, and as to the damages, all the verdicts I have ever seen were <em>general. </em>The record cannot be a bar to an action for any damages not foreseen and estimated by the Jury, because the act of Assembly says that it shall not be a bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-6\">The attempt to overthrow the order of Court on the ground of misbehaviour in the Jury, is now too late, for if any such existed, a motion should have been made in the County Court to quash the inquisition.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-7\">\n<em>Taylor.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO-\"><em>On this </em>point, this Court has <em>original </em>jurisdiction, as it has <em>appellate </em>on the other points in the cause.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-8\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOy\">The objection then should have been made by motion, before the hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-9\">But, in fact, there was no misbehavionr in the Jury. Lord <em>Coke </em>in his commentary on Littleton, lays down many rules which are no longer in force, and some which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>liberality of modern practice, has modified and relaxed from their ancient strictness. I understand the rule of law to be at present, that when a Jury are sent from the bar, they must not drink ; but that rule does not apply to inquests in the country. I think, indeed, if that venerable Judge were now alive, he would not be so hard-hearted, as to object to the moderate and necessary refreshment taken by the Jury in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-3\">Hay,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A61\">in reply, besides commenting on the evidence, observed, (on the points of law,) \u201c in this case an attempt is \u201c made to deprive my client of part of his freehold ; the \u201c right to do so is founded n\u00f3t on the common law, but the \u201c act of Assembly. The proceedings ought therefore to be \u201c strictly conformable to the act. My client owns the \u201c land <em>at present </em>by purchase under the will 5 but <em>the re- </em>\u201c <em>cord </em>ought to shew that he was tenant or proprietor <em>when </em>\u201c <em>he teas summoned.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-4\">\u2022 \u201c It is contended that the Court shall be presumed to \u201c have done right, until the contrary appears. But here \u201c the contrary does appear. The act requires the \u2022 <em>tenant (e Qr proprief0r </em>t0 be summoned, but <em>Coleman </em>was sum-<em>u </em>mone-d <em>only as executor and trustee. </em>Suppose a notice u was given to the person entitled in remainder, either \u00a3\u00a3 vested or contingent, would it be sufficient ? And where \u201c is the substantial difference between such a notice and \u201c this ? That the proof of every thing essential to the ap- \u201c plicant\u2019s obtaining leave to erect the mill, ought to appear \u201c in the record itself, and not by testimony aliunde, is evi\u00a3t dent from the cases\u2018of <em>Richards </em>v. Home, 2 <em>Wash. </em>36. \" and <em>Martin </em>v. Beverley, MS. in 1805. In those cases \u201c the several applicants for mills, being owners of the lands \u00a3\u00a3 on one side only, it was decided to be necessary to state \u00a3\u00a3 <em>on the </em>record, that the bed of the water-course belonged \u00a3\u00a3 to the applicant or to the commonwealth, and all other \u201c evidence as to that point was rejected.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-5\">[Here Judge <em>Tucker </em>asked Mr. <em>Hay, </em>if the <em>actual tenant </em>had, in reality, no notice, whether he might not yet sue for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>damages, or abate the nuisance ? Mr. <em>Hay </em>answered that, according to Mr. <em>Munford\u2019s </em>doctrine, that the County Court must be presumed to have done right, the tenant could neither sue nor abate the nuisance ; and he doubted himself whether he could with safety abate the nuisance until the proceedings were reversed, though he might have his action on the case.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-4\">2. Does the <em>law authorise </em>the cleric to insert the height of the dam in the writ of <em>ad quod damnum ? </em>The party might have been content with a dam not so high, yet the clerk confined the Jury in their inquiries, to a dam of that precise height.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-5\">3. The point as to the money has been misunderstood by Mr. <em>Wickham. </em>The County Court shewed by that enlr}, that they did not consider <em>Coleman </em>as the <em>tenant or </em>proprietor, and indeed were not informed what person held the land in either character, otherwise they would have directed the money to be paid to such person.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-6\">4. The Jury certainly contemplated other damages than those resulting from the lands being overflowed. If an action should be brought for any damage not foreseen or estimated by them, it may be said, upon the words of this inquest, that the Jury estimated that damage, the words being broad enough to cover <em>all possible </em>damages. The <em>onus probandi </em>ought not to lie upon any body ; the whole of the damages estimated, <em>and for </em>what, ought to appear in the inquest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-7\">It is said that the principle upon which a verdict is set aside for the Jurors\u2019 drinking, does not apply here ; but this is a mere <em>dictum. </em>One fact appears in evidence, that a change in the inquest after it was first written was pro* posed ; but objections gradually lost their force as liquor began to operate ; and no change was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-8\">Another fact in the record is worthy of observation. It does not appear that the writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>was executed by a sheriff or his deputy: no name of any sort is subscribed to the return, and the clerk\u2019s declaration, that the inquisition was returned by the sheriff, does not obviate the difficulty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The law concerning sheriffs,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> requires the under-sheriff i0 subscribe the name of his principal, as well as his own, to aU official returns made by him; but here he appears to have subscribed only in the capacity of <em>iwitness </em>to the signatures of the Jurors. The force of this objection is not impaired by the third section of the act concerning mills, requiring the inqUest to be made and sealed by the <em>Jurors </em>only. I admit there is no necessity for the sheriff to sign it, but he ought to return it according to law; and the return being defective, ought to be quashed. The doctrine is explicitly stated in Bac. <em>Abr. </em>tit. Sheriff, let. H. that the <em>deputy-sheriff </em>must always act in the name of the sheriff. It is only by yirtue of our act of Assembly, that he is authorised to use his own name ; and this act being in alteration of the common law, must be strictly followed by the deputy, or his returns are illegal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj4\">In answer to the new point made by <em>Hay, Munford </em>contended, that it did sufficiently appear that the writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>was executed by a deputy-sheriff. In another part of the record <em>John G. Baptist </em>is mentioned a? deputy of <em>William G. </em>Baptist, sheriff; and the name of <em>John G. Baptist </em>is subscribed to the inquest. He has also been examined as a witness before this court, and has stated on oath that he was the deputy-sheriff who attended the Jury. True it is,, in his signature he did not style himself deputy-sheriff, nor annex the name of his principal: but, if this was a neglect of duty, the only consequence is, that he is liable to a penalty, not that the inquest ought thereupon to be quashed.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> But this subject may be viewed in another light: the record expressly states, that the inquest was returned <em>by the sheriff </em>to the Court; and Mr. <em>Hay </em>has no right to contradict the record. The clerk has only omitted to copy the <em>signature </em>to the return, which doubtless was indorsed on the writ of <em>ad quod damnum s </em>probably thinking it sufficient to certify the fact that such return was made, without copying the signature into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>record. Neither* was it necessary to insert it, unless a question had been made concerning it. If in fact the writ W-s irregularly executed or returned, a motion to quash the inquest should have been made, and, if overruled, the point should have been reserved by a bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\">But, if this objection, that the sheriff\u2019s return, as writ\u00bb ten by himself, ought to appear in the record, should be thought material, its utmost effect would be to induce the Court to award a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to supply the omission.-</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-6\"><em>Wickham </em>observed,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AId\">it was the general practice of clerks in making out records, not to insert the return itself, with the signature of the sheriff, but merely to express it in general terms.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-7\"><em>Hay. </em>Mr. <em>Wickham</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALi\">is unquestionably mistaken as to the practice. The signature of the sheriff to his return on the writ is always certified by the clerk where the judgment is by default.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-8\">\n<em>Wickham,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATN\">Even admitting Mr. <em>Hay </em>to be right in this position, the order in this case does not resemble a judgment by <em>default: </em>for <em>Coleman </em>was heard by his counsel, and, after an argument on the merits, the decision was against him.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b31-9\"><em>Friday, May </em>26,</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"Ae\"> Judge \"Lyons was absent the whole of this term <em>(is well us the last) </em>liar\u00bb jhg been prevented from attending by indisposition</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b22-10\"><em>Rev.Code, </em>vol. 1. p. 198.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Aj\"> 2 <em>Hen. &amp; Munf. p. </em>370</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"ASq\"><em> </em>Rev.Code. vo1.1. p. l98.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"AB\">. 1 Inst. 157. b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AA\"><em>Rev.Code </em>vol. l. p. 197. c. 105. s. 1, 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"At\"><em> </em>1 <em>Hen. </em>&amp; <em>Munf.p.403.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-8\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b25-11\"><em> </em>Rev.Code vol. 1. p. 166, c. 92, s. 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-9\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b26-8\"> 2 <em>Call, 507.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-10\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b26-9\"><em> 1 Call, </em>495.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-11\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AUh\">\n<em> Rev.

There are two answers to this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">The first is, that the <em>original notice </em>of the intended application for leave to build a mill, is directed to <em>Coleman </em>as <em>acting </em>trustee and executor, &amp;c. and recites, that 65 he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>u hath lands above the said place on the said stream, <em>vested </em>\u201c <em>in him </em>in trust <em>for certain </em>purposes,\u201d &amp;c. The second is, that <em>Coleman </em>appeared, in consequence of the summons, and contested the petitioner\u2019s right, on the ground of inconvenience and injury to himself,- thereby admitting' himself to be the proprietor or tenant. And, having taken no exception to the summons on the ground now taken, he cannot do it in this Court; this case coming within the reason of the rule at common law, that appearance, and pleading to the action, cures all defects in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The second objection is, that the clerk had in the writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>taken upon himself to state the precise height, to which it was proposed to raise the mill-dam. This, however, was pursuant to the <em>original </em>notice, and was perfectly right. The Jury were not to inquire to what height it was necessary, for the petitioner\u2019s purposes, to raise the dam, but what injury would ensue to others, if h\u00a9 were permitted to raise his dam so high.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The third objection is, that the Jury have said that a dam of the proposed height will in their opinion \u201c over- \u201c flow three acres of land belonging to the estate of <em>Tho- </em>\u201c <em>mas </em>Rowlett, deceased, <em>together xuith all other </em>damages, \u201c to the value of fifty dollars,\u201d &amp;c. And that this finding will operate as a bar to a recovery against him for <em>any other </em>damages hereafter. This must depend upon circumstances. For the law declares that neither the inquest of the Jury, nor the opinion of the Court shall bar any prosecution or action, which any person would have had in law, other than such injuries as <em>were actually foreseen and estimated </em>by the Jury. Suppose it should happen that six acres of land, instead of three acres, should be overwhelmed: or that any house, office, garden, or orchard on the premises,' should, in fact, be injured or overwhelmed thereby. Would this return upon the inquisition bar an action in such cause ?</p>\n<p id=\"b32-14\">The fourth objection is, that several of the Jury, perhaps the whole, drank ardent spirits at the house of the pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>iitioner, before they proceeded upon the inquisition, and again before the same was completed and signed by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The purity of the trial by Jury, and more especially the incorruptibility of jurors, are subjects of supreme importanee, in a country whose constitution declares, that that mode of trial <em>ought to be held </em>sacred. And I am o\u00ed opinion, that the same jealous vigilance ought to be exercised in cases ol' inquests of office, as in trials at common law. The reason is even stronger. The latter are had under- the eye of a Court of justice, which, if it observer; my thing improper in tire conduct of a Jury, will immediately set aside the verdict. Inquests of office are taken <em>hi pais; </em>the supcrintcndance of the sheriff may not always be adequate to the prevention or discovery of improper practices. No kind of bribe, or other evil practice, so soon finds its way to the bead, as intoxicating liquors. Our act concerning roads (ed. 1794, c. 19.) prohibits a juror, <em>on pain of being </em>discharged <em>from the </em>inquest, <em>and immediately </em>imprisoned by the sheriff, from taking anything of meat or drink <em>from any person </em>whatsoever, from the time they come to the place until their inquest be sealed. The act for removal of the seat of government; to this place contains a similar provision, <em>(May,1779, </em>c. 21.) and both appear to me to have been dictated in the true spirit of the common law, and of consummate wisdom and foresight. The omission of a similar provision in the act concerning mills, probably proceeded <em>from the </em>opinion of the legislature, that a repetition of such a provision in every act authorising an inquest, was, upon the principles of the common law, unnecessary, as being implied in all cases of the kind. In the present case, the fact is not denied <em>; </em>on the other hand, Mr. <em>Coleman </em>was present, and is not only said to have consented that the jurors, who were assembled at a late hour of the day in the month of <em>'July. </em>should partake of the slight refreshment set before them, (a quart decanter of spirits brought out to a company of twenty or five and twenty persons assembled at the petitioner\u2019s house,) but, set them an example, by taking a glass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>of spirits and water himself, before they set out to view the lands. No other impropriety of conduct seems to be chargeable to the July, until they had <em>agreed on their report. </em>They ate and drank at the petitioners house, either before or immediately after the inquisition was <em>signed.\\ </em>which was sometime after night, Mr. <em>Coleman </em>staying with them and partaking of the same refreshments, and staying afterwards all night. These circumstances afford a strong apology for all that happened. Yet I am afraid of shaking great and fundamental principles. I dread the effect of the precedent, should we decide that they may in any case, except absolute, unavoidable necessity, be departed from. No line is so easy to define as a strait one ; and if the least departure from that be permitted, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to draw one capable of application' in all cases of this nature. On these grounds, I am inclined to think We ought (for the sake of avoiding what may operate as a dangerous precedent) to set aside this inquisition: though I am well satisfied with the judgment, both of the County Court and the District Court, upon every other ground.</p>\n<author id=\"b34-3\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"ATg\">Upon a thorough consideration of the testimony in this cause, I am of opinion that the appellee ought to have leave to raise his dam according to the prayer of his petition. If, however, the testimony were doubtful, I should certainly respect the concurring judgments of the County and District Courts, tribunals sitting in the neighbourhood, as was done by this Court in the case of <em>Home v. Richards, </em>2 <em>Call, </em>507.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">As to the objections taken to the regularity of the <em>proceedings, </em>none of them, in m'y view, are important.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The \u2019inquisition having found that damage would be done to'the estat\u00e9 of <em>Thomas Rowlett, </em>deceased, it became the duty of the <em>Court </em>to issue a summons to the tenant or proprietor\" thereof. The Court ordered one to be issued to <em>Thomas Coleman, </em>who is also stated therein to be tc trustee and acting executor of <em>Thomas Rowlett, </em>deceased.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>Coleman </em>appeared and contested the motion on the merits. After this, we are not at liberty to say without any evidence to that effect, (and thus convict the County Court of error in issuing the summons to an improper person,) that he was not, in fact, the tenant or proprietor ol the land within the meaning of the act. He might have been so, the description given to him, of \u201c trustee and execu- \u201c tor,\u201d notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\">As to the notice given to him by Moody, in that character, in the first instance, it was mere supererogation, and consequently will not affect his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">With respect to the objection to the writ of <em>ad quod </em>damnum, in that it <em>confines </em>the Jury in their estimation of damages to the height of fifteen feet two inches, the answer is that the writ corresponds in this respect with the real application to the Court, and being, besides, beneficial to the opposing party, cannot be objected to on this ground by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">As to the objection to this inquisition on the ground that the Jury drank some spirits and water at the cost of the appellee ; while I heartily join with the Judge who preceded me in wishing to keep the jury-trials as pure as possible, and also think, with him, that, in general, the same necessity for circumspection equally holds in relation to inquisitions of office which are held <em>in pais </em>and out of the sight or control of a Court of Justice, I must be permitted to say that nothing shewn in evidence in this case ought to impeach the present verdict. At the same time, also, that I readily make the foregoing admissions,, I do not agree that all the rigid doctrines of the ancient common law in respect to eating or drinking by a Jun , and which are laid down in relation to perhaps a <em>short </em>trial in a comfortable jury-room, equally apply to the laborious duties required by an inquisition in the country, where, from the necessity of the case, the jurors must have a reasonable refreshment. We must not be governed by the <em>letter </em>of the rule under every possible state of things, but take a more liberal and enlarged view of the circumsttiu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ces. I presume <em>it will </em>not at this day be contended, that in this laborious service the jurors might not have refreshed' themselves at their own expense: but we are to consider the case as it is, where the refreshment was furnished by one of the parties. In considering this case, we must recollect that the Jury in question was not acting in a populous city where they might have got refreshment at their own cost, and where a <em>party </em>could from no motive, except an interested one, have furnished it at his cost. The jurors summoned on this inquisition had perhaps most of them rode many miles that day ; there was, probably, no public house near, from which refreshment could have been <em>obtained; </em>the weather was, probably, very hot; and therefore a kind of necessity existed for the appellee\u2019s offering, and their accepting, the trivial refreshment now made the ground of opposition to the verdict. The cha-\u2019 <em>racier </em>for hospitality of our countrymen, too, ought not on this occasion to be entirely lost sight of. That circumstance, perhaps, taken in connection with the real necessity of the case, furnishes a clew for the offer in the present instance very distinct from any view to corruption on the part of the appellee. If the terms of the act concerning <em>roads </em>has expressly inhibited all kinds of refreshment to the Juries who are acting upon them, notwithstanding the possible hardships which may result therefrom to the jurors, the omission to insert a similar provision in the act respecting mills leaves those cases on the footing of the common law; in applying the provisions of which, however, we must adapt them to the circumstances of the case, and so as to effect a reasonable and <em>substantial </em>compliance therewith, rather than a <em>literal </em>one. So far as the provisions of the statute are express and imperious, let them prevail; but, as to any case not embraced by it, let such case be considered independently of its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">I need not, however, consider the present case in a general point of view. The testimony in the cause shews, abundantly, that <em>Coleman </em>consented that the Jury should take some refreshment, and set them the example. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>do not sit here to lay down mere abstract propositions, but to administer justice : and shall we set aside a verdict, in favour of a man who is proved to have <em>deliberate!y and </em>freely waived the objection which his counsel long after may think proper to set up ? We are in the habit, every day, of disregarding errors which are beneficial, or not injurious to parties, or to which they have bound themselves not to object. On this ground, and <em>referring particularly </em>to the testimony in the cause in support of this part ot <em>my </em>opinion, I must think the verdict in the present case ought not to be impeached, and that the judgment ought tO be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<author id=\"b37-4\">Judge Fi.emikg.</author>\n<p id=\"ATo\">The only difference in the opinion of the Court, arises from the circumstance of the <em>Jury </em>having taken a little refreshment of spirits and water, in the first instance, before they were impanelled and sworn, and after they had finished their examination and were on their \u00edeturn towards the house, they took a drink of grog ; (says <em>Baptist, </em>the sheriff;) and after returning to the house, they reported their verdict, and whilst he and the surveyor were writing the inquisition, they took some spirits and water ; hut neither the sheriff nor Mr. <em>^uie </em>(another respectable witness who spoke of these circumstances) saw any thing like intoxication in either of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Although the law, in order to preserve the purity of trials by Jury, (justly considered as one of the chief excellences of our constitution) has inhibited jurors from taking either meat or drink, or even the use of <em>fire </em>or <em>candle, </em>whilst consulting of their verdict, which, says Lord Coke, some books call an imprisonment,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> thos e rules are more strictly observed in <em>England </em>than they are, or ought to be, in this country, where the habits, manners and genius of our people are widely different. Though here, I should be far from countenancing or tolerating <em>embracery, </em>or any thing that might tend to corrupt or bias the minds of a Jury ; but in the case before us nothing of the kind, to my mind., appears : and I am persuaded that the appellee had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>no sinister object in view, in producing the spirits spoken of in the evidence, but was actuated <em>merely </em>from a motive of hospitality and kindness, for which our citizens are generally distinguished: and I am the more confirmed in this opinion, from the circumstances of his caution in consulting the appellant, (the only person to be affected by the verdict of the Jury,) who readily gave his assent, and set an example himself, by taking a drink of grog before either of the jurymen ; and it is laid down in <em>Co. Litt. </em>125. b. \u201c that all defects in <em>convening </em>or in the <em>qualifea- </em>\u201c <em>tions </em>of the jurors, arc aided by <em>consent </em>of parties <em>; </em>for \u201c the rule herein is, that <em>omnis consensus tollit erroremA </em>If, then, the consent of parties takes away <em>error </em>in the. <em>qualifications </em>of jurors, I can perceive no good reason why such <em>consent </em>should not take away the error of their taking a little refreshment in a hot summer\u2019s day <em>; </em>but the taking such refreshment before they were impanelled and sworn, is not prohibited by the strict law in <em>England $ </em>which, however, is admitted to be the law here also.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">On this view of the case, then, I am of opinion, that the verdict was uncorrupt, and ought to be sustained, and that the judgment of the Court below ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">By a majority of the Court, (absent Judge Lyons,) the judgment of the District Court was affirmed ; Judge Tucker dissenting on the point of the refreshment taken by the Jury, only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AN3\">\n<em> Co.
