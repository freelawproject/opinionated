The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>and the statute <em>of </em>limitations; but, it seemed, no effort was made to sustain the latter plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHm\">At the trial, the defendant filed a demurrer to evidence, jn wj-,ich the plaintiffs joined. The evidence therein stated, was\u2014That for some four or five years preceding the death of <em>Buzzard, </em>who was a tanner, <em>Gore </em>was in the habit of sending raw hides to <em>Buzzard\u2019s </em>tannery, and getting tanned leather from him; but he never transacted any part of these dealings in person, his raw hides having been always brought to the tannery, and the ta'nned leather always sent to him, by his slaves, without any written order from him, and indeed without a word passing between him and <em>Buzzard </em>on the subject; that since <em>Buzzard\u2019s </em>death, <em>Gore </em>had dealt with two other tanners in the neighbourhood, in the same manner, through the agency of his slaves; he always sending his raw hides and the tanners sending back tanned leather, by the slaves, without written orders from <em>Gore, </em>or a word said by him to the tanners; and the accounts of <em>these </em>tanners for the debts so contracted by <em>Gore </em>through the agency of his slaves, had been settled by him without dispute : that the items of <em>Buzzard\u2019s </em>account, namely, the charges for tanned leather sent <em>Gore </em>by his slaves, and the credits for raw hides brought by them, were first set down on a slate, and thence posted in a book by <em>Buzzard </em>himself ; but <em>Gore\u2019s </em>dealings with <em>Buzzard, </em>as charged in those accounts, amounted to about the same <em>per annum, </em>as his dealings with the other two tanners afterwards: that, in fact, it was the habit of <em>Gore, </em>to send his raw hides to some tannery, and to receive tanned leather in exchange, by his slaves, only giving verbal\u2018directions to <em>them, </em>to deliver the raw hides, and bring back what tanned leather he wanted: that, after <em>Buzzard\u2019s </em>death; <em>Gore </em>desired a witness to apply to his administrators for his account; which being sent him, he examined it, and said, he would not pay interest (which the administrators had charged) but that if they would give \u2022him the credits he was entitled to, he would pay the prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>cipal, if any should be due: and that <em>Gore </em>procured the assignment of a bond of one of <em>Buzzard's </em>administrators, saying, he expected the amount of that bond would be enough to meet the claim of <em>Buzzard's </em>estate against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-4\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs, subject to the opinion of the court on the demurrer to evidence. The county court gave judgement on the demurrer for the defendant. <em>Buzzard's </em>administrators appealed to the circuit court, which reversed the judgement of the county court, and gave judgement for them. And then <em>Gore </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-8\"><em>Nicholas, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXS\">1st, The evidence did not sustain either count of the declaration. If it proved any contract, it was not a contract for the sale of tanned leather by <em>Buzzard </em>to <em>Gore, </em>either for a price certain and agreed, or for the reasonable value, but a contract for the exchange or barter of raw hides for tanned leather, from time to time. The customer or the manufacturer, as the case might be, was only bound to make good the difference between the value of the manufactured articles furnished by the one, and the raw material furnished by the other, if and whenever such difference should occur, by the delivery of like articles. 2ndly, The law of <em>Virginia, </em>1 Rev. Code, ch. 111. \u00a7 19. p. 426. provides, that \u201c no person whatever shall buy, sell or receive, of, to or from, a slave, any commodity whatever, without the leave or consent of the master, owner or overseer of such slave,\u201d and imposes a penalty on any person dealing with a slave without such leave or consent. It would defeat the policy of this statute, and be of mischievous consequence, if a person may be allowed to carry on (as <em>Buzzard </em>did in this case) dealings for a series of years, with the slaves of his neighbour, receiving raw materials from them, and delivering the manufactured article they ask for, without a word said by or to the owner on the subject, before, during, or after such dealings, and then to recover from the owner what may be due on the transaction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>upon the implied leave or consent of the owner to the deal- . . <em>t </em>ings ot his slaves. The policy of the statute cannot be effectuated, but by requiring a person who deals with a slave, to have the express leave or consent of the owner, jjefore or at tj,e t\u00a1me 0p ^ dealings- Therefore, the evidence is insufficient in law to prove, that the agency of <em>Gore\u2019s </em>slaves in these dealings with <em>Buzzard, </em>was authorized by <em>Gore ; </em>and the judgement of the county court was right,\u2014as the judgement of a county court will generally be found to be, in all cases involving a question of <em>police.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AuS\">\n<em>Johnson, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZgN\">Supposing the objection arising from the agency of the slaves out of the way, the dealings fairly to be inferred from the evidence, consisted in sales of raw hides by <em>Gore to Buzzard, </em>and sales of tanned leather by <em>Buzzard </em>to <em>Gore; </em>for there is evidence, that <em>Buzzard </em>gave <em>Gore </em>credit for the value of the raw hides, and charged him with that of the tanned leather, in money; and that this account being rendered to <em>Gore, </em>he made no objection to the items of debit, but only claimed credits beyond what were allowed him, of which however, he never adduced any <em>proof. </em>And this evidence, moreover, suffices to <em>prove </em>a distinct admission by <em>Gore, </em>that the agency of his slaves in these dealings, was authorized by him; that his slaves received the tanned leather he wanted, which constituted the items of debit in the account, by his leave and consent, or rather by his express direction previously given to them. The authorized agency of <em>Gore\u2019s </em>slaves in his dealings with <em>Buzzard, </em>is also proved by the evidence of his dealing in that manner with two other tanners, and of his habit of dealing through the agency of his slaves,\u2014of giving verbal directions to <em>them </em>to deliver his raw hides at the tannery, and to <em>receive </em>the tanned leather he wanted. The statute referred to, does not prohibit the receiving of goods from the owner by the hands of his slaves; nor does it require that the leave or consent of the owner to the dealings of his slaves, even on their own account, shall be in writing. The just inference from the evidence in this case, is, that <em>Gore\u2019s </em>slaves acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>in these dealings by his directions and for him; in other words, by his leave and consent expressly and previously given : but, certainly, such leave and consent might have been <em>implied </em>from his subsequent conduct, without direct positive proof.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b259-6\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"At0\">A demurrer to evidence is always a dangerous course; and here, I think it was particularly ill-advised. For the evidence stated in the demurrer, giving it only fail-play, and drawing the inferences which a jury should reasonably have drawn from it, is quite sufficient to establish the appellee\u2019s claim to recover. The facts proved furnish the strongest grounds to infer, that for a series of years <em>Gore </em>was in the habit of getting his leather from <em>Buzzard's </em>tannery; that though his slaves were his agents, or rather his instruments, for carrying raw hides to the tanner, and bringing back tanned leather, yet it was he who sent the raw material and received the manufactured article ; and that he was to pay the difference, if any, between the values of what he thus bought and sold. When <em>Buzzard's </em>administrators rendered the account, at <em>Gore's </em>instance, he examined it, and did not object to any of the charges against him ; he only objected to the charge of interest, and said that if they would give him the credits he was entitled to, he would pay the principal. This was a plain admission of the justice of the account, except as to the interest, and as to the credits he claimed, which, however, he never attempted to prove; and this admission alone, affords a decisive answer to the whole argument for the appellant. The judgement of the circuit court is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The other judges concurred. Judgement affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
