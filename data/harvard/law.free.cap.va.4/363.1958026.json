In pursu- \u2022 it i anee of which) auditors were appointed by the Court; and) at a subsequent day) at the instance and on the motion of the parties, three other auditors were added to the former number, and any three of the whole, were directed to examine, state and settle all accounts be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>tween the-parties, which was accordingly <em>done; </em>and, nor exception being taken to their report or proceedings, final judgment was rendered pursuant thereunto, in fa-' vqur of <em>Brickhouse.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">To this judgment, Hunter, <em>Banks </em>\u00a3s? <em>Co. </em>preferred a bill of injunction to the Judge of the High Court of Chancery, who awarded the injunction. The accounts were referred to a Commissioner of the Court, who made a report which, on exceptions taken to it, was recommitted by the Court to the Commissioner, who made a second report, assigning reasons in support of the former, by which he had reported 118/, 9s. <em>Id. </em>3-4 to be paid to <em>Hunter, Banks Co. </em>with the. addition of <em>SOI. </em>paid by <em>Isaac Smith </em>on account of the judgment at law, the voucher for which had not before been produced j making in all 108/. 9s. <em>7d. </em>3-4. On the 29th of <em>May, </em>1800, the Commissioner certifies, that the parties appeared by consent at his office, and agreed, that if any supplemental report appeared necessary, it might be madg. But the Commissioner declined making any j ,after which, (as is presumablej) by <em>consent </em>of the <em>parties, </em>all matters in difference between them in that suit, were referred to the final determination of <em>Thomas Newton </em>and <em>William Pennock, </em>whose award, or that of an- umpire to be chosen by them, was to be made the final decree of the court. They made a report, declaring that they had examined the accounts between the parties, and could find no cause to disagree with the Commissioner in his report. \u201c Submitting, however, to the ' decision of \u201c the Court, the necessity of <em>Hunter, Banks </em>&amp;? <em>Go. </em>pro- \u201c ducing .vouchers to certain charges, (amounting to \u201c 133/. 9i.) objected to by Brickhouse(before the-Commissioner.) They add, having considered the, situation of the times (1781 to <em>1783, </em>during the <em>American </em>war) when much of the business was done, they, conceive it was not possible to obtain receipts, as, in rrumy instances. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>advances were made on the sea-shore roads, &amp;c. for the safety of removing goods; in which case only, memorandums of the advances could be made. Under which circumstances, they consider the Commissioner\u2019s report , . , . . to be as just as the times or transacting the business would admit of, which they submit to the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-11\">The Chancellor of the <em>Williamsburgh </em>district, to which the cause had. been removed, being of opinion that, <em>Brickhouse </em>being a partner, and having a right to inspect the books of Hunter, <em>Banks &amp; Co. </em>they were admissible evidence ; and concurring in opinion with the arbitrators, that, from the circumstances of the country, it would have been impossible to produce vouchers for every item in the accounts, decreed according to their <em>report; </em>from which decree an appeal was taken to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-13\">Randolph, for the appellant, relied on the following points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-14\">1. That the judgment in the action of <em>account </em>was not liable to be examined in equity, on any ground stated in the bill. If it be said that the submission to reference was a waiver of the objection to a want of jurisdiction in the Court, the answer is, that exceptions were filed at the coming in of the report of the referees, expressly objecting to the admissibility of the books of Hunter, <em>Banks </em>\u00a35\u2019 <em>Co. </em>as evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-15\">2. The referees do not substantially and independently decide the cause, but delegate the power given them to the Master Commissioner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-16\">3. The award is erroneous on its face: the referees only s\u00e1y that they see no cause to differ from the statement made by Master Commissioner Dunscomb, and submit to the Court the propriety of allowing certain items without vouchers. In fact, there was no other evidence before them than the books of Hunter, <em>Banks </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>^ Co. </em>which were not evidence for them in their own</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ayt\"><em>^Williams </em>and Warden, for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMg\">contended, that Brickhouse, by agreeing to the reference in Chancery, had opened the judgment at law, and waived all objection to the jurisdiction of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ax7f\">The award was final and conclusive between the parties. The only possible objection to it was, their submitting to the Court, whether, under the circumstances, .it was incumbent on <em>Hunter, Banks Co. </em>to produce vouchers in support of certain charges. They decide that vouchers were not necessary. This they had a right to do, and their decision upon the case in matters of fact, cannot be reviewed by the Court, when no corruption Or partiality appears.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Even if they had taken .the opinion of Master Commissioner <em>Duns comb, </em>the aT)irar(j would not have been erroneous on that account. Arbitrators may take the opinions of others as a guide to their own decisions; and when adopted, it makes it their own act.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANn\">The books of <em>Hunter, Banks &amp; Co. </em>who were partners with <em>Brickhouse </em>in the vessel which was the- subject of this controversy, were clearly admissible evidence under the authority of the case of <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Pollard.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2019j\u2019bey were <em>the </em>books of all the partners, <em>quoad </em>this transaction, each having a right to inspect them. . In truth, <em>Brickhouse </em>has received considerable credits -extracted from the books alone, and it is contrary to all principle, to permit a party to claim credits from books, without admitting their debits also.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AyD\"> 1 Ves.jun. 369. <em>2 Ves.jun. </em>15.

For the action of <em>account render </em>comes the nearest to the proceedings in a Court of Equity, of any other that I recollect at the common law.. But the voluntary consent of the parties to the reference made by the High Court of Chancery to the final determination of <em>Thomas Newton </em>and <em>William </em>Pennock, judges chosen by the mutual act and consent of the parties, appears to me to do away the objection to the Court\u2019s sustaining the bill, instead of dissolving the injunction upon the coming in of the answer of <em>Brickhouse; </em>and, though I was at first inclined to doubt whether the arbitrators had made an award or not, upon more mature consideration and inspection of it, I am satisfied it is a good award in equity, and therefore that the decree be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b383-5\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AWIM\">The reference by consent in this case, is a waiver of the objection, (if it would otherwise have availed the appellant,) that the appellees were concluded by the decision in the action of account in <em>Northampton </em>Court. . This cause (the injunction) made the merits of that decision a part of the matter in controversy to be decided on in <em>it; </em>and the whole case, including this question of law, was transferred from the Court to the arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The. award of the arbitrators <em>(Newton </em>and Penn\u00f3ck) adopts the report of the commissioner <em>Dunscomh </em>as their report, and decides that vouchers were not necessary to-be produced, for the reasons stated in the latter part of the award. It is true it also submits to the Court the propriety of this decision in point of law, and, as a guide for the Court in declaring upon it, states the grounds and reasons of their opinion in this particular. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>case, this award comes up to what seems to have been, required by this Court in the case of <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Ross,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>namely, that where an award is to be impeached on the ground of a mistake of the arbitrators as to . . facts or principles, such mistake ought to appear <em>on the face \u00b0f tlie award itself; </em>and that such mistake is not to-be proved by affidavits, which are only proper to establish \u00a1partiality or misbehaviour in the arbitrators, or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The award before us then is final; but it has gone on to aid the Court (by stating a special matter on the face of the award itself) to decide whether the arbitrators were mistaken in the <em>principles </em>of their decision or not; and this brings us to that -question.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">It seems to me, that for the reason assigned in the award itself, and more particularly for those assigned in the decree in question, vouchers were not necessary to be produced. Those reasons are, (as resulting from those two documents,) the situation of the times when the advances were <em>made; </em>that the appellant was a voluntary partner of the appellees, who acted as ship\u2019s husband, with his consent and by his <em>ratification; </em>that, as a partner, he had always a right, and undoubtedly the opportunity to inspect the books of accounts; that, from the confidence resulting from his being a partner, the less care would have been taken by the appellees to\u2018preserve the vouchers, than would be thought necessary .in the case of unconnected <em>strangers; </em>that, from the nature of most of the articles mentioned in the account, they seem necessary for a schooner engaged as <em>thq Buckskin </em>was; and that it is unreasonable that the appellant, who had availed himself of the books of the appellees when in his. favour, should object to them on the ground of the want of vouchers, when they* went to charge him.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">- On these grounds, I think the Court of Chancery rightly .judged that the <em>principles </em>on which the arbitrators went as to the point in. question, were not mistaken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>lior illegal; and this opinion making the \u00bfward perfect, the said Court was correct in decreeing pursuant thereto. I am therefore of opinion, that the decree shoukl he AFFIRMED.</p>\n<author id=\"b385-8\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"Aoq\">The reasons stated by the Chancellor himself, as the foundation of his decree, appear to be perfectly satisfactory. I have only to add, that the decree is to be affirmed, by the <em>unanimous </em>opinion of the Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\"> 1 <em>Wash. 158.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
