He survived <em>Calhoun </em>about five years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-13\">In 1835, <em>Thomas Shanks, </em>one of the executors of <em>Patton, </em>and <em>James L. Woodville, </em>one of the executors of <em>Calhoun, </em>made a settlement of the accounts between <em>Calhoun Sf Patton, </em>when <em>Patton\u2019s </em>ex\u2019or had paid in cash, and then transferred to <em>Woodville, </em>as the executor of <em>Calhoun, </em>bonds due the concern to the amount of 14,468 dollars 33 cents; leaving still due to <em>Calhoun\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>ex\u2019or, according to their settlement, the sum of 139 dollars 56 cents. For this amount of 14,468 dollars 33 cents, <em>Woodville </em>then executed his receipt to <em>Shanks </em>as executor of <em>Patton ; </em>and they agreed that if there was any error in their statement, it should be corrected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-4\">In <em>Patton\u2019s </em>lifetime, he had purchased a house and lot in <em>Pincastle, </em>from <em>Calhoun\u2019s </em>executors, for 1750 dollars, in three annual payments; and in February 1835, <em>Patton\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors transferred to Woodville, bonds to the amount of 2168 dollars 41 cents, which ho was to collect and apply to the discharge of the purchase money due for the house and lot; and pay over the balance to <em>Patton\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">In January 1841, <em>Patton\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors filed their bill in the Circuit Court of Botetourt, against <em>Calhoun\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors, in which, after stating the above facts, they alleged that no allowance had been made, in the settlement between <em>Shanks </em>and <em>Woodville, </em>to <em>Patton, </em>for carrying on the business of <em>Calhoun &amp; Patton </em>for eight months after <em>Calhoun\u2019s </em>death, or for settling up the business; and they claimed compensation therefor. They charged; too, that there was a balance due from <em>Woodville </em>as executor of <em>Calhoun, </em>on account of the bonds assigned to him, to pay for the house and lot. And in excuse for not having brought their suit earlier, they alleged, that soon after the making of the settlement by <em>Shanks </em>and <em>Woodville, </em>the former presented to the latter the claim for compensation for carrying on the business for the eight months, and for closing up the business of the concern; and that <em>Woodville </em>asked for time to submit the claim to the persons interested in <em>Calhoun\u2019s </em>estate; some of whom lived in <em>Ireland. </em>That the claim was repeatedly pressed upon <em>Woodville, </em>who postponed a final answer to it on the same ground, and promised that the delay should not prejudice the claim. That he had only a short time before refused to allow the claim; and the plaintiffs had immediately brought their suit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>enforce it. They therefore prayed to be permitted to surcharge the account settled by <em>Shanks </em>and <em>Woodville.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9F\"><em>Woodville </em>answered the bill, and insisted that as a general rule, a surviving partner was not entitled to comPensa(aon ^01' settling up the business of the concera; and that in this case especially, <em>Patton </em>was not entitled to compensation, as <em>Calhoun </em>had put in all the capital, in consideration of which, <em>Patton </em>attended to the business: and that <em>Calhoun, </em>in his lifetime, took no part in the management of the concern; but lived on his farm, some ten or twelve miles from <em>Fincastle.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">He said that as to the balance due on the bonds transferred in payment of the house and lot, he was always ready to account for that, and pay it over, after deducting his charges for collection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">In the progress of the cause, the Court directed a commissioner to enquire what would be a reasonable compensation to <em>Patton </em>for carrying on the business for eight months, and for settling it up: and to settle the accounts between the parties. In execution of this order, the commissioner reported a special statement according to the views of the plaintiffs, which allowing to <em>Patton </em>300 dollars for carrying on the business for eight months, and five per cent, on 14,600 dollars, the amount to which <em>Calhoun's </em>estate was entitled from the partnership, for bonding the debts, and allowing a credit for 261 dollars 50 cents, the balance of the bonds transferred to <em>Woodville </em>in payment of the house and lot, <em>Calhoun's </em>estate was made debtor to <em>Patton </em>in the sum of 1115 dollars 31 cents. The commissioner made another statement which, excluding the credits for compensation, reduced the amount due to <em>Patton </em>to 82 dollars <em>27 </em>cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-7\">The cause having been removed to the Circuit Court of <em>Rockbridge, </em>came on there to be heard in April 1845, when the Court held that the claim for compensation would have been inadmissible if it had been asserted at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the proper time, and pursued with due diligence; and if a valid claim originally, it was, under the circumstances, not to be enforced after the delay which had occurred in presenting it. The bill, therefore, so far as it sought to surcharge the account settled by <em>Shanks </em>and <em>Woodville, </em>was dismissed. But the executors of <em>Calhoun </em>not objecting to a decree against them for the amount reported due by the second statement of the commissioner, which was produced by charging them with the balance of the bonds transferred to <em>Woodville </em>in payment of the house and lot, the Court gave the plaintiffs a decree for the sum of 82 dollars 27 cents with interest; but decreed the defendants their costs, to be paid by the plaintiffs out of the assets of their testator. From this decree, <em>Patton's </em>executors applied to this Court for an appeal, which ivas allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-11\"><em>Cooke </em>and <em>F.
