He would never contend, that the rule of the Court for taking up such appeals as were merely for delay, out of their turn on the docket, should be evaded, by introducing into the record a frivolous bill of <em>exceptions; </em>but this, he observed, was not such a case. The principle involved in it had been recognised in the case of <em>Chisholm </em>v. <em>Anthony,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-9\">The case was this. <em>James Govan </em>brought an action of debt against <em>John Fox, </em>administrator, with the will annexed, of <em>Drury Ragsdale, </em>in the County Court of <em>King William, </em>on a bond of his testator. At the <em>March </em>term, 1807, the defendant pleaded <em>\u201cpayment </em>upon which issue was joined: at the <em>August </em>term following, he moved the Court for a continuance of the cause till the next term, on affidavit (made a part of the record) that \u201c he had been \u201c prevented, since the last Court, by indisposition, from M obtaining a settlement of his administration account, &amp;c. \u201c that commissioners were appointed for that purpose; and \u201c that he was desirous to obtain a settlement with all speed.\u2019* The bill of exceptions further states, that, by the next term, the defendant expected to have the settlement o his account aforesaid recorded in Court; \u201c so as that by aseen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>41 taming the state of the assets in his hands, he might know 4t whether it would be necessary for him to amend his plea.\u201d But the Court upon seeing, among the papers in the cause, a memorandum filed containing a statement of the bond on which suit was brought, with a calculation of interest up to the time of several payments which had been made ; and also a mortgage from the testator for the same debt, (which statement and mortgage are set out at large,) refused to continue the cause. A verdict was obtained aga'nst the defendant, and judgment thereupon, which, on appeal to the District Court of <em>King </em>and <em>Qiiee\u00f1 </em>was affirmed. From that judgment the defendant again appealed to this Court.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Auo\">A Court; m granting or refusing a cM&gt;tiuuijtce of <em>a </em>nine, aught to exerdiscretion. jjtherefore, a party be ule\u00ab\u00ed into a trial, when it appears from the tacts <em>stated in a bill of exceptions, </em>that he was entitled to a continuance, the judgment, obtained against, hint will, for that cause, be reversed by a Superior Court.</headnotes>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b172-5\"> 1 <em>Hen. &amp; Munf. </em>27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b173-7\">Judge Roane</author>\n<p id=\"A4x\">was opposed to taking up the case. There might be sufficient grounds for continuance. Where a bill of exceptions is palpably frivolous, and the Court can have no doubt of it, the cause will be taken up as a delay case. But, without giving any opinion on the merits, he did not think this such a case.</p>\n<author id=\"b173-9\">Judge Tucker</author>\n<p id=\"A0n\">thought there were <em>prima facie </em>good grounds for the indulgence asked for by the appellant; especially as the creditor had thought proper to commence an action on the bond, by which the executor might eventually be charged personally, instead of pursuing his remedy on the mortgage. He mentioned the case of <em>Hook </em>v. <em>Nanny and </em>others,<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> in which this Court had reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>a judgment, because the Court below had refused a conti~ nuance when it ought to have been granted. The case Chisholm v. Anthony,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> turned upon the equity of allow. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>ing an executor or administrator to amend his plea, as fur- , . . , , . tner information o\u00ed the state of the assets might render it necessary.</p>\n<author id=\"b175-7\">Judge Fleming</author>\n<p id=\"Asa\">said, it was the unanimous opinion of the Court, that the cause should not be taken up as a delay-case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b173-10\"> Hook <em>against </em>Nanny and others.</p>\n<p id=\"AUK\"><em>November 9, </em>1805.</p>\n<p id=\"AqLx\">Order Book, No. 5. p. 239.

I-Ie further stated, that lie had recently discuvered testj\"mony, which he conceived very material, in the State of Earth caro~ \" lisa, which he had not been able to procure. On these facts, the \"counsel for the defendant founded the motion for a continuance, as it \" was the first time the cause was called. But the Court overruled. \" the motion ; the counsel for the plaintiffs agreeing to admit a cer\"tam aflidavit taken by the defendant, which was said to contain some of the information thus lately discovered; and determined that the \" cause should come to trial: the defendant's counsel objected, and, \"to save the benefit thereof, prayed that this his bill might be sealed, \"which was done.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">TTerhct, that the plaintiITh were entitled to their freedom, and judg. ment thereon, in the County Court, from which an appeal was taken to the District Court, holden at the Sweet ~`pringr, where the judgment was affirmed, and Hook again appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Saturday, Noeember 9, 1805. The opinion of the Court was, that the judgments were erroneous in this \" that the cause ought to have \"been continued for one term, on the motion, and at the Costs of the \"said John Hook, for the reasons assigned by him in his first bill of \"exceptions.\" Judgments of the District and County Courts reversed, verdict set aside, and a new trial directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">[oZ7 In the case of Wood and Bemis v.
