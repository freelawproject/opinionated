The averment aforesaid, is respecting \u201c matter, which, if it exists, is matter of record, and ought M <em>to </em>be verified by the record, and is not so verified in and \u201c <em>by </em>the said plea; 3d. The said plea is otherwise Insufli- \u201c cient, defective and wants form.\u201d The tenant joined in demurrer, and, upon argument, the District Court adjudged the law to be for the defendant. Judgment was thereupon entered for him, and the demandants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-9\">This cause was argued at the <em>October </em>term, 1808, by <em>Gall, </em>for the appellants, and by IVilliams, for the appellee. On account of the numerous and important points involved in it, the Judges took time till this term, to consider of their judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-11\">Call, for the appellants, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au4\">that the plea was insufficient on two grounds : 1st. On the merits; 2d. In setting forth defectively the matter intended to be relied upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-12\">As to the merits, the question chiefly turns on the meaning of the word \u201c averment\u201d in the act of Assembly,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> which ought to be taken in the sense in which it was generally received, both in law and equity, at the time of passing the act. According to the authorities, the averment permitted is not of any matter <em>dehors </em>the will, but only of its construction, or of an implication .evidently deducible from its <em>words,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>because the <em>-whole </em>devise must be in <em>. </em>. <em>writing.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVS\">It is a rule in pleading, that the legal <em>effect </em>and not the <em>words only </em>of an instrument mus\u00ed be set forth.- In <em>Cook </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Sims,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the note in. writing which contained a promise, was actually set forth in the declaration ; yet the judgment was reversed, because the <em>assumpsit </em>(which was the legal effect) was not expressly laid. In 2 <em>Sound. </em>97. c. the case of <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lade, 3 Lev. </em>291. is quoted, in which the judgment was reversed in K. B. because the defendant had pleaded the words of the deed, without stating to what purpose he intended to use them ; and other cases to the same effect are there cited. When, therefore, the words of the will are not expressly, that the estate devised shall be in lieu of dower, the tenant must aver that the estate was so devised, and prove it by the implication. Parol evidence is not admissible, except to explain some latent ambiguity, or to prove a latent fact, relative to the situation and nature of the estate, but not inconsistent with the words as in the case of a bequest to the testator\u2019s son <em>John, </em>there being two sons of that name ; or of a bequest of 150/. to the wife, and 150/. to another person, where the whole estate is worth only 200/. there the collateral fact of the <em>value </em>of the estate, may be proved by parol <em>evidence; </em>because, if the wife were to have her dower as well as the 150/. the other legatee would be defeated altogether.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-6\">Even in equity, (except in <em>such cases,) </em>no averment <em>dehors </em>the will is admitted. 2 Ves. jun. 572. <em>French </em>v. <em>Davis. </em>3 <em>Ves. </em>jun. 249. <em>Strachan v. Sutton. 1 Cruise\u2019s Dig. 203. </em>citing 3 <em>Atk. </em>8. <em>Tinney v. Tinney. </em>4 <em>Bro. Ch. Cas. </em>410. <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>Cator. </em>6 <em>Ves. </em>jun. 615. <em>Gretorex v. </em>Carey, are dear and positive authorities to- this point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-7\">Every statute should be construed so as to prevent mischief, if possible. The mischief of a different construction of the act now in question would be, that the statute of <em>frauds </em>would be repealed as to this case, which would injure the rights of a defenceless part of the community; and this, too, without any reciprocity in the rule ; for the widow cannot by parol evidence, get more than the words give her\u00bb The legislature could not have intended to introduce so- great a mischief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Both statutes according; to my construction can have effect. There is also internal evidence in the statute relative to dower of an intention to conform to the existing laws ; lor the jointure to be effectual as a bar to dower, jrust in the first place be o\u00ed <em>real </em>estate,; 2dly. It must take effect in the widow\u2019s own possession, immediately on the death of her husband; 3dly. It must continue during her life at <em>least; </em>and, 4thly. Be determinable by such acts only as would forfeit her dower at common <em>law; </em>in all which respects our act agrees with the pre-existing law. The fair inference is, that the existing law was in the conten\u00ed \u2019 plation of the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-3\">2. This plea is defective in not saying that the husband was seised in fee, and capable of conveying an estate sufficient to bar the dower. In 3 Lord <em>Raym. </em>151. the pleadings in <em>Laurence </em>v. <em>Dodwell</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>are <em>inserted; </em>and there the: husband is stated to have been seised \u201c in his demesne as \u2018\u2018 of fee whereas, here, <em>John LI. Norton </em>is only said to have been seised of a <em>freehold. </em>In Dyer, 361. b. <em>Beamond </em>v. Deane, the tenant having pleaded in bar an assignment of rent made by himself to the demandant, on demurrer, the plea was held to be bad, because it did not allege that he was seised of the land, &amp;c. at the time of die assignment and that it could not be supplied by intendment. <em>Co. Litt. </em>303. b. <em>Plowd. </em>104. and <em>Bac. Max. </em>340. prove that no implication can be made for the pleader in such a ease as this; for if the words of a plea are capable of two intendments, it must be taken most strongly against him who pleads it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-4\">3. Another defect. The plea does not aver that the devise was <em>accepted. </em>In <em>Story\u2019s </em>Pleadings, 358. such is the form, taken from a plea of the late Lord <em>Camden. </em>In the case from Lord Raymond., the plea expressly stated that the widow entered \u201c <em>by virtue of the </em>deviseBut in this case it is merely stated that she <em>entered. </em>The inference is as fair that she entered tortiomly, as that she did so by virtue of the d\u00abvis\u00ab. This not being averred, the words must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>taken most strongly against the pleader according to the rule before mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-12\">4. Again; it should have been averred that she took the estate, <em>in lieu of dower, </em>by virtue of the words of the will, or by virtue of some latent ambiguity or latent fact as aforesaid. The rule is that, where a record or will is relied on, the verification must conclude \u201c as in the said \u201c record or will more fully appears;\u201d<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and if a latent ambiguity or latent fact is relied on, such ambiguity or fact must be specially <em>stated.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-13\"><em>5. </em>Another objection is, the plea states sundry things as devised in lieu of dower, yet does not say that she accepted the whole, but only the <em>greatest </em>part, to wit, the mansion-house and lot. Now the whole was intended as the bar, or nothing. Her getting a part only was not sufficient. The pleader ought to have shewn what became of the rest. So, in accord and satisfaction, <em>part </em>satisfaction is not sufficient, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_1\">It may be urged that this is on a demurrer ; and that several of these objections which were not assigned as causes of demurrer, must be considered as on a <em>general </em>demurrer: but either way, the effect is the same <em>; </em>for these exceptions are of the <em>gist </em>and essence of the bar. As to the seisin, and as to the <em>acceptance, </em>each of them is an essential pivot on which the cause turns. So, the testator intended the <em>-whole </em>devise, or no part of it, as a bar; and it is essential to shew that she accepted the <em>whole. </em>If issue had been taken on this plea, and a general verdict found for the defendant, judgment might have been arrested, because the plea left every thing in <em>dubio; </em>and whatever is ground for a repleader, applies more strongly, on a demurrer, against the person pleading.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-22\">Williams, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arz\">The first question to be considered is, whether the matter stated in the plea is a bar to the appellant\u2019s claim of dower; 2dly. If so, is the matter sufficiently pleaded <em>upon this demurrer P</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>1. The language of the act of Assembly is, \u201c If any estate he convey ed by deed <em>or will, either expressly or by averment, </em>&amp;c. The legislature certainly intended by this word averment, someth,i!g more than was expressed in thp died, or will; lor otherwise the first part of the sentence would have answered their purpose ; but they use the term atan expression which is not to be found in the statute <em>27 Hen. VIII. </em>c. 10. and therefore, if the construe don of that statute had been such as Mr. <em>Call </em>contends, it doer, not follow that a similar construction should be applied to our act. Besides, the statute <em>27 Hen. </em>VIII. speaks only of deeds, but our act speaks of <em>wills </em>also. In consequence of the silence of the statute as to <em>wills, </em>Lord <em>Coke, </em>in his commentary upon <em>Littleton, </em>3G. b. says, that a gift by <em>will, </em>unless expressly in lieu of dower, is not a <em>bar; </em>but he admits that a <em>deed </em>made to the wife, or for her use, anil accepted after coverture, although not expressed to be in lieu of dower, is a bar, and may be so averred. This point is also settled in 4 <em>Co. Rep. </em>3. <em>Vernon's casc.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Co that, though, <em>the </em>words \u201c by averment,\u201d are not in the <em>English </em>statute, yet an averment of a matter not expressed in the deed, was even there allowed. The cases of <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Kempstead and wife,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> Villa Real </em>v. Lord <em>Galvay,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> Jones </em>v. <em>Collier,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> Wake </em>v. <em>Wake,</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Pearson,</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>are all to a similar effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-6\">It is objected by Mr. <em>Call, </em>that in the case of a <em>will, </em>nothin\" can be averred but what can be gathered by impli- \u00b0 , , 1 cation or construction from the will, itself, or a latent ambiguity. But, according to his own ideas, the legislature must be supposed to have understood the distinction between a deed and will, established by the <em>British </em>authorities under the statute of <em>Hen. </em>VIII. and therefore, as our act of Assembly lias put a gift by <em>will </em>on the same footing with a- gift by <em>deed, </em>those authorities must now apply to the case'of a <em>will </em>in the same manner as to that of a <em>deed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-11\">He say?s, too, that permitting the averment would amount to a repeal of the statute <em>o\u00ed frauds, </em>which is incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>into our act concerning wills.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The second section of that' act saves to the widow her dower ; and the clause now under consideration of the act relating to dower, (passed the same session,) provides that she may have her dower, but that, if she claims as devisee, it may be averred that she was not to claim dower also. Is there any inconsistency in this ? . <em>J </em>or can our construction of the latter clause operate as a violation or repeal, of any part of the act concerning wills ? She takes by the will: but the legislature says that, under such a state ofthings, she shall be barred of her dower at common law; provided.it appears that such was the testator\u2019s intention. So, no estate can pass but by <em>deed, </em>fkc. yet a consideration not expressed in the deed may be averred. In the case of a legacy, too, it may be <em>presumed to </em>be in satisfaction of a debt due from the testator to the legatec.(Z&gt;) '\u25a0 <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ\">In this case the plea states, that he devised to her 200/, to be paid annually out of his estate, and gave her the. mansion-house, &amp;c. which she entered into, and has occupied ever since his death, in lieu of dower. If it had been necessary to draw the averment from the will, his charging his estate with payment of an annuity, would fairly lie in averment that it was in lieu of dower. But,</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-11\">2. It is said, that the matter is not sufficiently set forth in the plea. To this I answer, that the demurrer is general, except as to two causes, viz. <em>1. </em>That he avers things out of the will 5 2d. That the plea respects matters of record, and ought to be verified by the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJq\">The other objections made by Mr. <em>Call, </em>being only matters of <em>form, </em>and not having been mentioned in the demurrer, he cannot now avail himself of them.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> The averment is, that the said several bequests and devises <em>were in lieu of </em>dower, and that after the death of the testator, she actually entered and enjoyed the <em>greater </em>part, (being all the <em>real </em>property devised,) and that she hath ever since been in possession thereof, <em>in lieu of her dower aforesaid. </em>If this plea is not sufficiently formal, it certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>rontains the substance of the bar, and would have been good after verdict, or on a general demurrer. The rule is that, where a plea sets forth a good bar defectively, upon a general demurrer it will be good; but, if it sets forth a defective title or bar, it is otherwise. Here the real <em>gist </em>of the bar is the devise for life in lieu of dower; and this is set forth substantially. The want of a <em>profer\u00ed </em>of the will is .unimportant; for a will is not such a paper as the law requires to be pleaded with a <em>profer\u00ed; </em>it being sufficient to set out the substance, as far as it relates to the case. A <em>profer\u00ed </em>need never be made of a paper of which <em>oyer </em>cannot be demanded: but <em>oyer </em>cannot be -demanded of a <em>will;' </em>because it is in the custody of the law, and equally open to the examination of either party. Eesides, in this case, the averment is not made upon the will alone, but upon matter <em>dehors </em>the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-4\">However, even admitting the plea to be as defective as Mr. <em>Call </em>supposes, the <em>count </em>is defective also ; for the demand is of the third part of <em>a freehold </em>only; whereas dower cannot be claimed except of a <em>freehold of </em>inheritance, or an inheritance in <em>fee-simple, </em>The demandants, therefore, having committed the first fault in pleading, cannot have judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-5\">\n<em>Call.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amn\">There is nothing in the exception taken to the <em>count; </em>as it is conformable to all the precedents.

F. Norton. </em>The count demands one-third pare f\u00f1, \u00bfa I in a <em>freehold, </em>of a certain part or proportion of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>lot in <em>the </em>town of Winchester, by metes and bounds. The tenant pleads, first, that the said <em>J. H. </em>Norton, or any other person to his use, was not at any time during the coverture, &amp;c. seised of an estate of inheritance therein, and thereupon issue was joined. Secondly, that the demandants ought not to have or maintain their action, &amp;c. because he says, that during the coverture, &amp;c. the said <em>J. H. Norton </em>duly made and executed his last will and testament, whereby the said <em>John </em>devised that the said <em>Catharine </em>his wife should receive an annual income of 150/. during her life, out of the estate of the \u2018said John, and that, she should have the full use of the mansion-house and other houses of the said John, where the said <em>John </em>did then live, <em>(not saying tvhere or in what </em>county,) together with the ground on which they stand, and the garden, stable, aftd stable-lot, daring the life of the said <em>Catharine ; </em>likewise the free use of all the household and kitchen furniture, &amp;x. for her <em>life; </em>and the said <em>John </em>did, in. and by the said will, also give and bequeath to the said <em>Catharine, </em>mulatto <em>Hannah </em>and her issue ; and the said <em>John </em>did afterwards, during the coverture, &amp;c. duly make and publish a codicil to his said will, whereby he bequeathed to the said <em>Catharine </em>200/. during her life, <em>(not saying by the year,) </em>in lien of the 1 <em>SOI. </em>bequeathed to her in the said will, and did moreover bequeath to her black <em>Betty </em>and her issue. And the said <em>John </em>did also, during the coverture, &amp;c. duly make and publish one further codicil to his said will, whereby he bequeathed to the said <em>Catharine </em>all the plate to which he was entitled on the death of <em>M. P. </em>which said will and the codicils annexed thereto, have-, since the death of the said <em>John, </em>been duly proved and <em>recorded </em>in the <em>Court </em>of <em>Frederick County, </em>and are now in full force. And the said tenant in <em>fact </em>saith, that the said several <em>bequests </em>and <em>devises </em>in the said will and <em>codicils </em>before set forth, were <em>in lieu of the said Catharine\u2019s </em>right of dower, in the estate of the said John, and that the said <em>Catharine </em>did, after the death of the said John, and before the commencement of this suit actually <em>enter into and.-oc- </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>. <em>up] the </em>greatest part of the property so as aforesaid devised to her, to wit, the mansion-house and other houses, where the said <em>John </em>did live, <em>{[not saying -where or in \u2022what </em>county,) and the stable, &amp;c. and hall) ever since been in the possession and occupation thereof in lieu of her dower aforesaid, and this he is ready to verify, &amp;c. and therefore prays judgment, &amp;c. To this plea the demandants demurred specially ; and for causes of demurrer they say, 1st. That the averment in the said plea is of matter not contained in the said will and codicils, or either of them, or any part thereof, and the said tenant ought not to aver any thing out of the said will and codicils. 2d. The averment aforesaid is respecting matter, which, if it exists, is matter of record, and ought to be verified by the record, and is not so verified in and by the said plea. <em>3d. </em>The said plea is otherwise insufficient, defective, and wants form. The tenant joins in the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">As this is the first case that has occurred in this Court, wherein a similar plea in bar has been pleaded, since the passage of the act concerning dower, wherein it is enacted, among other things, \u201c That if any <em>estate </em>be convened by <em>il deed </em>or <em>will, </em>either <em>expressly </em>or by <em>averment, </em>for the join- \u201c ture of the wife in lieu of dower, to take effect and con- \u201c tinue as in the act is expressed, such conveyance shall \u201c bar her dower,\u201d &amp;c. 1 shall enter somewhat at large into the consideration of the questions arising upon this demurrer. *</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">As to the first of these points; I conceive that whatever averment might have been made in <em>England, </em>in respect to a deed of lands, as meant, or intended, to be made in satisfaction of dower, may, since the act concerning dower, ed&gt; 1794, c. 94. s. 11. was made, be made in this country in respect to a will, as well as a deed ; the intention and design \u00a9f that act, being to put any provision made for the wife, by way of jointure, subsequent to the marriage, upon the same footing to all intents and purposes, whether made by <em>will or deed. </em>By the common law, according to the resolution <em>m Leake </em>and <em>Randall\u2019s </em>case, cited 4 <em>Co. </em>4- if aman devised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>lands to his wife for term of life, generally, it could no'i be averred to be for the jointure of the wife, and in satisfaction of her dower, for two causes: 1st. Because a devise implies a consideration in itself, and therefore a devise cannot be averred to be to the use of another than the devisee, if it be not so <em>expressed </em>in the will; no more can a devise be averred to be for a jointure if it be not <em>expressed in the will. </em>But it shall be taken for a benevolence. 2d. The <em>whole zvill </em>concerning lands ought to be in writing, and no averment ought to be taken <em>out of the </em>will, which <em>cannot be </em>collected <em>by the zvords in the zvill. </em>But, if it were <em>expressed </em>in the will, that the devise was made in lieu and satisfaction of dower, the same was good by way of jointure, and bar of dower; if she accepted the same. 4 <em>Co. </em>4. <em>Co. Litt. </em>36. b. And this case was cited and approved by the whole court of B. <em>R. 1 </em>Lord <em>Raym. </em>438. in <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Dodwell. </em>In a report of the same case by <em>Lutw.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Treby, Ch., J. said, if it had teen said (in the will) that the devise to the demandant was for her jointure, it had been good ; and so, although the word <em>jointure </em>had not been in the will, if there had been other words therein <em>tantamount; </em>as if it had been said, that the devise was for a <em>provision </em>for the wife, or other words of the like kind, so that the intention <em>of the testator might appear by the </em>wolds <em>of the </em>will ; but no evidence out oe the will <em>can be admitted; </em>for then, one part of the will would be in writing, and the other not: <em>parol discourses </em>out of the will are of no signification, for it must be entirely in writing. And to the same effect is Lord <em>Raymond\u2019s </em>report of that case, who says, that judgment was given for the demandant by the whole . Court; because the -averment, (in that case,) being matter <em>out of the </em>will, <em>and not contained </em>in it, ought not to be allowed.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> And the same rule as to averments, I apprehend, applies also to a deed, as well as a will; the general rules 0f construction being the same, as to both : and therefor<em>e </em>n0 implications can be allowed but such as are necessary<em>, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>or </em>at least <em>highly probable ; </em>and not merely <em>possible </em>implications.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In the case of <em>Tinney </em>v. <em>Tinney </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where a bill was brought in the High Court of Chancery for dower, the heir at law insisted that the husband, in his life-time, gave a bond for 1,000/. in trust, to secure to his wife 560/. in case she survived him, and that it was intended at the time in lieu of dower, and that she acknowledged it to be so, and offered to read evidence of her acknowledgment. But Lord <em>Hardivicke </em>was of opinion that parol evidence could not be allowed in that case, <em>being -within the statute of frauds and </em>perjuries, and that a <em>general </em>provision for a wife was not a bar of dower, unless <em>expressed </em>to be so ; but that a bond to secure a sum of money, <em>for her livelihood and </em>maintenance, had been decided to be within the equity of the statute of <em>H. </em>VIII. of jointures. This is perfectly conformable to the opinion upon the will, in the case of <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Dodwell; </em>and since the provisions of the <em>English </em>statute of frauds and perjuries are ingrafted into ours respecting wills and conveyances, the construction ought to be the same here as there. Now certainly there is no expression in the will, so far as the same is set forth in the plea, by which it can appear to the Court, whether the devise of the dwelling-house, &amp;c. was intended to be in <em>satisfaction </em>of dower, or not: for, if it were so intended, it ought to be in satisfaction of her <em>whole </em>dower, and not of <em>a part </em>only.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> But by the terms of this averment, it would appear that the devise of the <em>house and lots </em>was only <em>in part </em>satisfaction. For the words are, \u201cand \u201c the said tenant in fact saith, that the said several <em>be-1 </em>4\u2018 <em>quests </em>and <em>devises </em>in the said <em>will </em>and <em>codicils </em>before set \u201c forth, were in lieu of the said <em>Catharine's </em>right of dower \u201c in the estate of the said <em>John </em>which shews that the devise of the dwelling-house, See. must, <em>at </em>law, be in <em>part </em>satisfaction only and not for the <em>whole. </em>And if they were in <em>part </em>only, the devise thereof is no bar, 4 <em>Co. </em>3. <em>Co. Litt. </em>36. for a bequest of <em>personal </em>estate is no bar of dower in <em>lands, </em>as was adjudged in this Court in the case of <em>bhvnf </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>v. Gee.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The case of <em>Eastwood </em>v. <em>Vinke,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is in prmciple not unlike the present. A man on his marriage gave a bond to a trustee in a penalty, conditioned that if, within four months, he should settle and <em>assure </em>freehold lands of the value of 100/. <em>per </em>ann. the bond to be void. The husband soon after the marriage made his will and devise<em>d </em>certain freehold and <em>copyhold </em>lands, lying intermixed, of the yearly value of 88/. to his loving wife and her heirs, and died within the four months. The Master of the Rolls said, \u201c as money and lands are things of a different nature, \u201c one shall not be taken in <em>satisfaction </em>of the other. \u201c Whatever is given by a will is <em>prima facie </em>to be intend-<em>u </em>ed a bounty, or benevolence. The devise of such of the (&lt; land as is <em>copyhold </em>cannot possibly be taken towards \u201c <em>satisfaction </em>of the 100/. <em>per ann. </em>which was to be free\u00ab tc <em>hold. </em>Nay, supposing the whole 88/. <em>per. ann. iverc freehold, </em>it would not go towards <em>satisfaction </em>of the a 100/. not being so expressedand this decree was affirmed by the Chancellor. The averment, therefore, is so far from being proved by the words of the will and codicils, that to me they seem to contradict it, in express terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">But it may be objected that the bequest of the annuity out of the testator\u2019s estate, must be taken as a devise of a <em>real </em>estate, and therefore, coupled with the devise of the dwelling-house and lots, must be intended, as a satisfaction for the <em>-whole </em>and not a <em>part </em>only, of her right of dower. To this there are several answers. 1st. It is not averred that the testator had lands to that value, and therefore the devise may fail. 2d. It is not shewn out of what lands (if he had any) the annuity should be paid ; but only that it should he paid <em>out of his estate; </em>which might he wholly <em>-personal </em>except this lot; nor when it should commence j-nor that any power of <em>distress </em>or <em>entry </em>was given, in case it should be withheld ; nor is it shewn whether, if he had lands to that value, he had <em>such an estate </em>therein, as trun her estate therein should not he forfeitable, or determina <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>?jie by such acts only as would forfeit her dower at the common law. For if he were tenant for a hundred or a thousand years, of lands to the value of the annuity, a devise thereof would be no bar of dower. So, if he were tenant <em>pur autre </em>vie, or even for several lives ; for peradventure the term may expire, or he forfeited by the <em>actual </em>tenant\u2019s committing waste, or some breach of condition, in deed, or in law, without her fault.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">There is another ground upon which it may he questioned whether this plea and averment are so pleaded as that the Court can judge whether the devise is to be taken as a bar and satisfaction of dower or not. <em>By </em>the statute against fraudulent devises, any creditor by bond or other specialty, wherein the testator and his heirs were bound, might maintain his action of debt against the heir and devisee jointly, by virtue thereof. Now suppose a bond creditor were to bring suit against the widow upon the bond of her husband, could she plead in bar of the demand, that the devise to her was in satisfaction of her dower, unless it were so expressed in the will? What then, is the situation of a widow? If, when she accepts of a benevolence, from her husband in his will, it may he averred that it was in bar of her whole dower, (although not so expressed or apparent,) and that she accepted the same in satisfaction, thereof; the next day comes a creditor by bond; she cannot aver that the devise was in satisfaction of her dower, because not so expressed or apparent in the will, and the creditor sweeps the devise. Can this be right, or is it at all consistent with law, equity or moral justice ? Again; suppose (as is very common) the testator shall have subjected his whole estate to the payment of his debts, <em>previous </em>to any devise or legacy, therein contained, taking pffect; could this operate as a bar of a <em>legal </em>right, founded upon a valuable consideration, the marriage? Surely not. Ought not the will then to have been set forth at large, and pleaded with a <em>profert in </em>curia, that the court might judge upon the <em>whole of the </em>will, whether this devise was such a one, as could operate as a bar of dower, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>cording to the terms of our statute, which are so emphatical, that I must beg leave to recite them. \u201c Also if any <em>\u201c </em>estate CONVEYED by deed or will, either expressly, or \u201c by averment, for the iointure of the wife, in lieu of her dower, <em>to take effect in her </em>own possession, immediate- \u201c ly <em>on the death of her </em>husband, <em>and to </em>continue <em>during </em>\u201c <em>her life </em>at the least, <em>determinable by such acts </em>only, <em>\" as would forfeit her dower </em>at the <em>common </em>law, such con- \u201c veyance shall bar her dower of the residue of the lands, \u201c which at any time were her said husband\u2019s.\u201d Can a devise <em>after </em>payment of debts,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> or a devise of an estate by law, <em>subject </em>to the <em>payment </em>of <em>debts by specialty;</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or of an estate determinable in any manner during the life of the wife, by any act which would not amount to a forfeiture of dower at the common law, or by <em>any other </em>cause, be aver-. red to be in satisfaction of the dower of the wife, unless the testator\u2019s intention to that effect, be either <em>expressed </em>in, or <em>apparent </em>upon, the face of his will? And, if not, can this Court decide the question of such intention, without having the whole will and codicils before them ? And if that be necessary, ought there not to be in every case, a <em>profert in curia </em>of the will, or an authentic copy thereof, that the Court may, upon inspection, judge of the testator\u2019s intention, and of the operation of the law upon the devise&gt; taken with the rest of the will, as such a satisfacdon, as the law requires, to be a complete bar of dower ?<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIY\">Another objection to this plea and averment is, that it alleges that the widow after the death of the husband, and before the commencement of the suit, did actually enter into, and occupy the <em>greatest part </em>of the property so as aforesai\u00bf devised to her, to wit, the mansion-house and 0ther houses, where the said <em>John </em>did live, <em>(not sailing </em>*' ' <em>J </em>* xvhere, <em>or in what </em>county,) and the stable, stable-lots and , . i garden, and hath ever since been in the possession and ocCUpatjon thereof, in lieu of her dower as aforesaid. Now (hese things which are thus alleged to constitute the <em>greatest. J:art </em>(\u00a1.hat js a part <em>on hi) </em>of the several <em>devises </em>and. - v , . . <em>bequests </em>before set forth, cannot, according to the authori <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ties before cited, be <em>averred </em>to be in <em>satisfaction </em>of the whole; consequently, the entry into, and occupation of that part, could not operate as an <em>acceptance </em>thereof, in satisfaction <em>of the </em>whole. Because this tart, the mansion-house, &amp;c. is the only <em>real </em>estate devised to her; all the rest, for aught that appears to the contrary, being <em>merely personal </em>estate, and therefore no satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"AUH\">Again ; the entry into, seisin, and occupation of, the mansion-house, with the stable and garden thereto belonging, are matters of <em>fact, </em>which ought to have been so pleaded and averred as that a trial of those facts might have been had. But it is no where in the plea or averment mentioned, where, or in what county those premises lie; so that there is no <em>venue </em>laid. This appears to me to he a substantial defect in the plea. For by our law, \u201c until 44 dower shall be assigned to a widow, it shall be lawful for 44 her to <em>remain </em>and <em>continue </em>in the <em>mansion-house, </em>and the 44 messuage <em>or </em>plantation thereto belonging, without being 44 chargeable to pay the heir any rent for the same, any 44 law, usage or custom <em>to the </em>contrary in any wise not-44 withstanding.\u201d<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The law then gave her a right to remain and continue in the <em>mansion-house, </em>&amp;c. whether devised to her or not; or whether <em>accepted </em>by her in satisfaction of her dower or not, until such time as her dower (or full satisfaction for the same) should be assigned, or made to her. This then being a legal right, of which she could not be deprived, the fact of the entrit, and, in <em>what right </em>such entry was made, ought to have been so pleaded as to be triable by a Jury of the vicinage. But the mansion-house, into which the entry is alleged, not being alleged to lie in any particular County or place, the plaintiff might not be prepared to repel the evidence which might be offered to prove the fact. For, if the husband had more than one mansion-house, evidence might be offered of an entry into one, as well as another; so that the plaintiff might be unable to meet it. And I hold it to be an invariable maxim in pleading, that every substantive plea in bar, in which any new matter of fact is alleged, affirmatively, and with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>out reference to any matter of fact before alleged in the pleadings, must be pleaded so as-that an issue in fact may be made and joined thereon ; or, in other words, that there must be such circumstances of time and place alleged, as constitute a <em>venue </em>in law, otherwise such plea is substantially bad.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> If a special justification, or other \u25a0matter pleaded in bar, be local, the defendant must plead it in the proper County where the matter arose ; and, at the common law, the cause must have been tried <em>there ;\u2022 </em>otherwise it was error.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> And it is a general principle, that the want of a <em>venue </em>is only curable by such a plea as admits the fact for the trial whereof it was necessary to lay a <em>venue : </em>and, though it is aided after a verdict, in. England, by statute 16 and <em>17 Car. </em>II. yet there is no such provision in our statute of <em>jeofails.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">But, it may be objected, that this is a <em>special </em>demurrer <em>; </em>and this omission to lay a <em>venue </em>is not assigned as a cause of demurrer. I have already said, the omission to lay a <em>venue </em>is matter of <em>substance ; </em>and, though it be true, that a demurrer confesseth all such facts as are <em>sufficiently </em>pleaded, matters not sufficiently pleaded are not admitted by a <em>demurrer.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And though it be also true, that he that demurs specially can take no advantage of any other matter of form, than what he hath expressed in his demurrer $ yet he may of any other matter of <em>substance.</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Where the defendant pleaded Queen <em>Elizabeth's </em>letters patent, (as the defendant in this case hath the will of the husband,) without a <em>profert in </em>curia, in bar to an action of trespass, <em>to </em>which the plaintiff demurred, and for cause of demurrer, alleged that the defendant\u2019s plea amounted only to the general <em>issue; </em>judgment was given for the plaintiff for this reason; because there was <em>no profert in curia made </em>of the letters patent, which was matter of <em>substance. </em>Here, then, the plea is <em>substantially </em>bad, in my opinion, not only because there is no <em>venue </em>laid, which I hold to be matter of <em>substance; </em>but because there is no <em>profert in curia </em>of the husband\u2019s will; (or of a certified copy thereof at least;) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>but a <em>part </em>only, and not the <em>whole </em>of the will is set forth in the plea <em>; so </em>that the Court cannot make such a construction thereof as the law requires, viz. that the construction be made upon the entire deed, or will, and not merely on disjointed parts of it.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In <em>Vernon\u2019s </em>case,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> where the demandant in her replication relied on the will of her husband, we are told that <em>she shewed all the will in certain. </em>And the same ought to have been done here. ' Then, with respect to the venue, as to the entry into the mansion-house, in the same case, the tenant pleaded, that the husband was seised of other lands (besides those whereof dower was demanded) <em>in the same </em>County, in his <em>demesne as of </em>fee, and by deed enfeoffed certain trustees and their heirs, to the use of himself for life, and after bis decease to the use of the demandant, his wife, for her life, &amp;c. and averred that the said estate, limited for life to the demandant, was for her jointure, and in full satisfaction of her dower ; and that after the death of her husband, the demandant entered into the said land so limited to her for her jointure, and agreed to the same. And therewith all the forms agree ; which shews that the laying the <em>venue </em>in such a plea is matter of substance : it shews, moreover, that the estate of the husband in the lands settled, or devised, ought to be shewn, that the Court may judge whether the estate of the wife therein be such, as is <em>determinable </em>only by such acts as would forfeit her dower at the common law. But the case of <em>Ilderton </em>v. <em>Ilderton,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which to a plea of <em>ne ungues accouple in loyal marriage </em>it was replied by the demandant, that she was married at <em>Edinburgh, </em>in Scotland, without laying a <em>venue </em>in England, and the replication was held good upon a special demurrer, for that cause, may be considered as overruling the objection to this plea, for want of a <em>venue, </em>But I am of opinion it does not; First, the fact of the marriage was alleged to be in another kingdom ; to which, the process of the Court did not extend.

Thirdly, it was a collateral and transitory fact, which might happen in any County, and therefore the trial of the <em>principal </em>matter, where there was a <em>venue </em>already laid, would draw to it the trial of this <em>collateral </em>and <em>transitory </em>matter. See also <em>Mostyn </em>v. Fabrigas, Cowper, 176, 177. with respect to the distinction between <em>local </em>and <em>transitory </em>matters. Fourthly, that case turned upon the question, whether the practice in respect to replications, <em>must be governed </em>by the same rules, as were <em>admitted </em>to prevail in declarations and pleas ; and the Court held, that there were no precedents, by which the same strictness was required in replications, as in declarations, and pleas in bar</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">After what I have said upon the first point, and upon the merits as connected with it, \u00ed deem it unnecessary to say any thing upon the second point.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">But an exception was taken to the <em>count </em>by Mr. Williams, Which at first appeared to me to contain great weight: to wit, that the demand is of the third part of a freehold, and not of a freehold of inheritance, or of an inheritance in fee-simple. But the cases cited by Mr. Call, from <em>Booth on Real </em>Actions, <em>166.Co. </em>Entries, 176. 179. <em>Rastall\u2019s </em>Entries, 229. as well as in later books of practice, <em>(Crompton\u2019s Pr. 316. 10 Wentworth\u2019s Plead. 157. </em>163.) and the decision in <em>Davenport </em>v.

Rep. </em>679. that where a <em>seisin </em>is alleged in pleading, it shall be intended a seisin in fee ; for that, in pleading, the <em>larger </em>estate is always presumed - (which last case I recollect to have heard Judge <em>Lyons </em>rely on, in this Court ;) have fully satisfied me that there is nothing in that exception.'</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Upon the whole matter, I am of opinion the demurrer to the plea ought to have been sustained; and consequently that the judgment of the District Court ought to be reversed, and the cause sent back to be tried upon the issue joined on the first plea.</p>\n<author id=\"b59-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai9\">This is a writ of dower <em>unde nihil </em>hahet, brought by <em>Ambler </em>and wife for dower in a lot in the corporation of <em>Winchester, </em>which Mrs. <em>Ambler </em>claims as of the endowment of <em>J. 11. Norton, </em>her former husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">The tenant pleads two pleas : 1st. That the said <em>J. 11. Norton </em>was never seised <em>of </em>an estate of inheritance in the premises duringthe coverture; on which issue is joined; and, 2d. That the demandants ought not ,to have their action, because, during the coverture aforesaid, viz. on the <em>19th of Nov. 1792, </em>the said <em>J. 11. Norton </em>duly made his will, whereby he devised that the appellant, Catharine, (his then wife.) should receive an annual income of 150/. during her life, out <em>of </em>the estate of the said <em>J. H. </em>Norton, and have the full use of the mansion-house and other houses where he then lived, garden, stable, &amp;c. <em>during the life </em>of the said <em>Catharine, </em>(as also various bequests of personal property for life and in absolute property,) which will (with two codicils) was duly recorded in the Court of <em>Frederick, </em>since the death of the said <em>John, </em>and are now in <em>full force. </em>The plea goes on to <em>aver </em>that the several bequests in the said will and codicils mentioned, were <em>in lieu of her dottier, </em>and that she did, after the death of the said <em>John IF. Norton, </em>and before the commencement of this suit, <em>actually enter into </em>and occupy the <em>greatest </em>part of the property <em>so as aforesaid devised to her, viz. </em>\u201c the mansion-house, lot,\u201d &amp;c. (stating ail the <em>real </em>property devised,) and hath ever since been in the <em>possession and occupation </em>thereof, <em>in lieu of her dower </em>aforesaid ; and this he is ready to verify, &amp;c. To this second plea the demandants filed a demurrer, stating as causes thereof, 1st. \u201c That the averment in the said plea is of \u201c matter <em>not contained </em>in said will or codicils, or either of <em>\u201c </em>them, and that the said tenant ought not to aver any \u201c thing out of the said will and codicils and, 2d. \u201c That the averment <em>aforesaid </em>is respecting matter which, if it exists, is matter of record, and ought to be verified st by the record, and is not so verified in and by the said \u201c plea.\u201d To this demurrer there is a joinder j and, im <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>arguing the demurrer, the Court adjudged the law for thei defendants ; from which judgment there is an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">The question propounded by the first cause of demurrer, appears to have been a vexed question, perhaps, in <em>England, </em>as it relates to wills : but the most modern and satifsactory opinion seems to be, that where the devise is <em>expressed </em>to be in satisfaction of dower, or such seems to be <em>the clear and manifest intention of the testator, </em>the wife shall not have both dower and jointure.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> This doctrine would be undoubtedly rendered more clear in favour of the <em>\u25a0iaverment, </em>since the decisions in <em>Kennon </em>v. <em>M'Robert,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Shermer </em>v. <em>Shermer</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In those cases it was admitted to be law, that in collecting the <em>intention </em>of the testator as from the will itself, the <em>-words </em>of the will are to be explained by the relative situation of the parties, and circumstances of the testator: facts derived from these sources^ thus sanctioned, in relation to the construction of wills, may be as imperious as any <em>expressions </em>whatsoever, in the will, to import an intention to substitute the jointure for the right of dower. But the words of our act are so clear and explicit as to put this matter entirely at rest. They are, \u201c if any estate be conveyed by deed or will, \u201c either expressly, <em>or by averment, </em>for the jointure of the \u201c wife, in lieu of her dower, to take effect in her own pos- \u201c session, immediately on the death of her husband, and \u201c to continue during her life at the least, determinable by \u201c such acts only as would forfeit her dower at the common \u201c law, such conveyance shall bar her dower of the residue \u00c9t of the lands, tenements or hereditaments, which at any \u201c time were her said husband\u2019s.\u201d The intention of th\u00e9 Legislature to this effect is still further manifested by the provision contained in the 12th section, (not to be found in the statute of <em>lien. </em>VIII.) that where any estate <em>intended </em>to be in lieu of dower, shall, through any defect, fail to be a legal bar thereto, and the widow shall demand dower also, the estate limited to her <em>with intention </em>to bar dower shall thereupon cease. This provision, taken in addition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>to the clear expressions of the act as aforesaid, puts the question beyond all doubt : it adopts that equity which alwav s leans against a double provision : it overrules the \u25a0\u201d grounds on which a jointure, unless so expressed m the deed or will, had been held to be <em>no </em>bar to dower, and which in 3 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>712. are said to be, (as they are,) <em>contrary to justice ; </em>and places the subject on the true ground of <em>intention </em>as it relates to the devisor; saving to the wife, in case of a jointure made during the coverture, the right to make her election after she becomes <em>sole. </em>While another clause of our act provides, that a widow expulsed from her jointure-land shall recover dower <em>pro </em>tanto, the clause just mentioned, on the other hand, confines her to dower only, where the jointure estate should fail through \u201c <em>any </em>defect\u201d to be a bar thereto. This expression \u201c any defect\u201d embraces a defect of the want of averment, as well as any other, and the whole case is put upon the ground of <em>intention. </em>If it be said that this construction contravenes the spirit of the statute of frauds, the answer is, 1st. That the words of the act in question are express and positive ; 2d. That the Legislature had power as well to depart from as to enact that statute ; and, 3d. That the principle settled, or rather recognised, in <em>Kennon </em>v. <em>M\u2018Robert, </em>and <em>Shermer </em>v. Shermer, will suffice for rverv purpose of the averment, and was not considered by the Court in those cases as. infringing that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">As to the second cause of demurrer, the demandan Is (after having complained, in the first, that the matter averred was not contained in the will or codicil) object that the s\u2018 <em>averment </em>aforesaid\u201d is of matter of record, (meaning, 1 suppose, by the probate and recording of the will,) and ought to be verified by the record. It will readily occur here that the averment of a matter not contained in a will cannot be proved by the will: but,perhaps, the objection intended was, that the will itself should have been set out at large in the plea. As to this, it was rightly said by the appellee\u2019s counsel that the <em>substance </em>of a will, as far as it \u25a0relates to the ease, may he averred, and that the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>will need not be set out in the plea. In <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Dodwell,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the will was not <em>set out: </em>it is true indeed that <em>Powell, </em>Justice, stated, as his opinion in that case, that, if any intent in the devisor had appeared that the devise was to be in bar of dower, the devise should have been pleaded at large: but this is only the declaration of a single Judge; no decision is found to support it; nor do the <em>forms of pleas bear out the idea </em>that it is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The causes of demurrer assigned in this case being therefore incompetent to overrule the plea, let us seo whether there are any other grounds competent to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">This case being upon a special demurrer, we are not to regard \u201c any defect in the plea, except those assigned ; \u201c unless something so essential thereto, as that judgment \u201c according to law and the very right of the cause cannot \u201c be given, shall be omitted.\u201d<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">Notwithstanding the comprehensiveness of the above terms, we must have enough in the plea to enable us to give judgment \u201c according to law and the very right of the \u201c cause.\u201d On this subject, I am of opinion, that what is substance, or not, is to be determined in every action according to its nature.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> I also think we ought to adopt a principle, in relation to demurrers, analogous to that adopted in relation to general verdicts. In respect of \u00bfhem, it is held that, although a matter must have been proved to the Jury, and the <em>general words </em>of <em>the </em>act of <em>jeofails</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>would seem to extend to <em>all </em>such cases, yet that the <em>gist </em>of the action must be laid in the declaration, or else a judgment thereupon cannot be given ; so, in the case of a plea, the <em>gist </em>of the <em>bar </em>must be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">Under this distinction, I will briefly examine the object tion that the plea ought to have stated that the testator, \u201c <em>being seised in fee of the </em>premises,\u201d made the jointure in question. It is not denied that this is the <em>regular </em>form of pleading: but the question is whether this is <em>indispensable </em>upon a general demurrer. I have seen no decision shewing that it is. In this respect the plea is <em>as ample </em>as the act under which it is pleaded. That statute does not en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>actli </em>that where <em>one seised of an estate of </em>inheritance, &amp;c. 6\u2018 shall convey by will,\u201d ike. but that \u201c if an estate be conveyed by deed or will, either expressly, or by averment, \u201c for the jointure, &amp;c. it shall bar dower,\u201d Sec. This provision of the act would seem to determine what the <em>gist, </em>of the pica really is; and this <em>gist </em>is stated in the plea in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">When, in addition <em>to </em>this, it is provided <em>by the </em>act, that if the jointress shall ever be evicted, she shall recover her dower <em>pro </em>tanto, why may we not, according to the very right of the cause, give judgment against her, if the averment be proved or admitted <em>to be </em>true ? She can, in .no event, be left destitute 5 and, in making her election to accept the jointure, undoubtedly took into her consideration her husband\u2019s right to the premises conveyed in jointure. As it must appear to the Court that the estate conveyed in jointure has the requisites of the law, the widow, on the other hand, is to judge whether her husband was <em>capable </em>to convey it.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">Again it is said that it ought to appear to the Court, that the devise of the jointure was to take effect in possession <em>immediately </em>on the testator\u2019s death, and not after <em>payment </em>of his debts. I answer that nothing of this is stated in the plea in the case of <em>Lawrence </em>v. Dodwell<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> or any other pleadings that I have seen. As to the estate taking effect immediately, that is the natural inference from the facts stated in the plea, (and which are admitted to be true by the demurrer,) unless an <em>intervening </em>estate had been shewn to have been limited, which ought to have been shewn on <em>the </em>part of the demandants; and (as to the latter part of this objection) although a title to dower, having relation to the date of the marriage, is held to be discharged of judgments, statutes, mortgages, &amp;c.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> yet the husband has no power to exempt jointure-lands therefrom ; nor is such exemption essential to the validity of a jointure. We are told by <em>LUackstone,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that there are some advantages attending tenants in dower that do <em>not </em>\u201cxteud to jointresses; and <em>vice versa. </em>He states then? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>particularly. If this exemption, from incumbrances, ike. exists in favour of dower, whereas it does not in favour of jointures ; so, on the other hand, the jointress finds an <em>equivalent </em>in her right to <em>enter </em>at once into her jointurelands, and in their exemption from forfeiture for treason j privileges which do not exist in relation to <em>dower </em>lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">It is also said that it ought to appear that the devise was not clogged with any condition whatever, other than such as the law imposes as a forfeiture of dower. The answer is, that the plea sets forth an unclogged devise for life, which is admitted, and it is not shewn on the other side to be otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Again, it is said, that the jointure-land, not being <em>solely </em>(but only in connexion with other property) devised for the jointure, is not a satisfaction for the <em>whole </em>dower. In the case of <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Lawrence</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> legacies </em>were coupled with <em>thejointure-land, </em>and did not prevent it from being held to be an adequate bar to the whole dower ; as it would have been adjudged to be if in other respects the jointure had been held sufficient. As to its not being shewn that the widow entered into more than the <em>real </em>estate, she could not do so ; but her entering into <em>that </em>shewed her election to take the jointure.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">It is objected that the plea does not state that the devise was <em>accepted </em>in lieu of dower. But it does state that the jointure-land was \u201c entered <em>tipon\u201d </em>and enjoyed \u201c in lieu. \u201c of dower.\u201d In saying that- she <em>entered </em>on such land, it is conclusive that the wife did not merely <em>remain </em>in the mansion-house and hold it, under the law, until dower was assigned. Besides; although the mansion-house entered into was the mansion-house at the date of the will, and, consequently, the one intended in the willy <em>non </em>constat, for it is not averred nor stated, that it was the mansion-house at the time of the death of the testator; and, if not, the. wife could not have <em>entered </em>upon it <em>except under </em>the will\". she could not have remained therein under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>This objection, and several others of similar character, if there was otherwise any thing in them, would stand interdicted by the effect of the special demurrer filed in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Another objection is taken, however, by the Judge who has preceded me, which was not taken at the bar <em>; </em>namely, that the <em>County </em>in which the jointure-lands lie is not stated in the plea. This objection may be considered in two points of view : 1st. That the plea is alleged to be defective in not laying a <em>venue; </em>and, 2d. In not having that particularity and certainty which the law requires a plea to have. As to this last view of die plea ; while it is readily conceded that a demurrer admits the truth of such pleas only as are properly pleaded, (bearing in mind at the same time the effect resulting as to this point from a <em>special </em>demurrer,) it is a rule equally true that a plea need only contain a reasonable certainty of time, place and persons.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> It seems also to be a just rule on this subject, that less particularity is necessary in relation to matters which equally lie within the knowledge of the <em>adverse </em>party, than in relation to such as lie only within the knowledge of the party pleading. The plea before us stands justified by both these rules of construction. The locality and certainty of the jointure-kind must have been at least as well known to the wife as to the tenant. Independent of this consideration, the plea, in respect of certainty, is entirely sufficient: it has every datum, whence to acquire a precise know ledge of the identity of the land, except the name of the County or Corporation in which the land lies. It is confined to land devised by a' will of <em>Nov. </em>19lh, 1792 ; and is further ascertained by being described as the mansion-house, See. in which the testator then lived. I will ask <em>cui bo?w </em>insert the <em>County </em>on the ground of <em>certainty f </em>Even then we must resort to the above <em>criteria </em>to ascertain the land in question ; for there may have been more than one mansion-house within <em>n </em>given County or Town : on the other hand, this plea re\u00bb fierring to the mansion-house in which the testator lived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>on the 19th of Nov. </em>1792, affords an unerring standard. \u25a0 There is no want of <em>certainty </em>therefore in this plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">With respect to laying a <em>venue </em>in this plea, there was no-necessity for it. In <em>England, </em>as all writs emanate from Court of Chancery, and the kingdom is divided into Counties, it is necessary to lay a <em>venue </em>directed to the Sheriff of the County in which the injury is supposed to have been committed; and then the trial must be had in the County in 'which the <em>venue </em>is laid.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> I mean-not to say at present (as being unnecessary) how far this doctrine of <em>venue </em>is applicable to this country, owing to the different organization of our Courts: but having remarked the above as the true ground of the doctrine on this subject, I will test this case <em>by </em>it, on a supposition that wc were now in <em>England.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">In that country it is held that the laying a <em>venue </em>is sometimes <em>substantial </em>and sometimes <em>formal </em>only: It is <em>sub-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\"><em>stantial </em>when the action is <em>in </em>rein, as in ejectment; for there the Sheriff must deliver possession, which he could not do unless the <em>venue </em>was laid in the proper County : but it is only <em>formal </em>where the action is transitory <em>; </em>but yet <em>some </em>County must be laid to which the process must go to bring a Jury from. And this <em>formal </em>idea of a <em>venue </em>is carried so far as even to justify a <em>fiction; </em>as where a bond on the face of it was made at Bengal, itmust be stated to have been made at some place in <em>England </em>under a <em>videlicet. </em>These points are laid down with great force and perspicuity in the case of <em>Mostyn </em>v. <em>Fabrigas.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I infer from this that a <em>venue </em>is not a matter of substance, unless the cause of controversy^ be <em>local; </em>unless the proceeding be <em>in rem ; </em>in which case also the <em>real </em>County is to be laid. This doctrine would shew the necessity of a <em>venue </em>in the action for the dower ; for it is local, and the Sheriff is to deliver possession of the land : but, in relation to the jointure-land, <em>that </em>would <em>equally </em>bar dower, if <em>it </em>lay in another country. In that case, if its locality were mentioned, :t need only be mentioned, by a fiction, to be in <em>Virginia. </em>As the suit in question is not to recover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>jointure-land, but the dower-land, and the question concerning the former comes in only collaterally, if a <em>venue </em>were necessary in relation to it, which it is not, it would be merely of the <em>formal </em>and not of the <em>substantial </em>kind. In <em>Ilderton v. Ilderton</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in a replication to a plea of <em>ne unques </em>accouple, in a suit for dower alleging a marriage in <em>Scotland, </em>it was held not to be necessary to state by way of <em>venue, even by a </em>fiction, that the marriage was held in <em>England. </em>The best reason given for it is, that the Court had already possession of the cause, and this matter arose incidentally ; and that the want of it could not be <em>taken </em>advantage <em>of even on a special demurrer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">By the statute of 16 <em>Car. </em>II.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> the want of a <em>venue </em>is aided after verdict. This shews it is not matter of <em>substance ; </em>for we have often held here (as I have before said) T.hat a want of substance going to the cause of action is not cured by a verdict, although the matter thereof must of necessity have been given in evidence to the Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">By the same statute, c. 8.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> it is enacted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the \u201c want of a right <em>venuef </em>and all \u201c such omissions, \u201c variances and defects, and other matters of a <em>like </em>nature* <em>\u2022i not being against the right of the matter of the </em>suit, 11 shall be amended after verdict.\u201d This is an express legislative declaration that the want of a <em>venue </em>does not go to the very right of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">When to this we add, that by our act we arc not to regard itny defect or imperfection in a plea, other than what shall be specially alleged as causes of demurrer, unless something, so essential to the defence as that judgment, according to law, and the very right of the cause, cannot be given, shall be <em>omitted,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the want of a <em>venue </em>(a mere <em>formal </em>matter in a case like the present, even in <em>England) must not </em>impede a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The statute of 4 <em>Ann. </em>c. 16.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> in <em>England, </em>(which is not stronger than ours as to the point in question, and from which our act was taken,) expressly overrules defects not stated as causes of demurrer, \u201c notwithstanding such defect or omission might heretofore be taken to be <em>matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>u </em>substance.\u201d If, therefore, this want of a <em>venue </em>had, before our act, been held to be a matter of substance, <em>non constat </em>that it would prevail since the enaction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">On every ground, therefore, I am of opinion that there was no necessity for laying a <em>venue </em>in the plea in question and, if there was, the omission to do it is not such a matter of <em>substance </em>as to justify the <em>demurrer; </em>since it was not set down as one of the causes thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">My opinion is to sustain the plea, overrule the demurrer, and affirm the judgment; and not, by sustaining the demurrer, to give the demandants the land if they shall, on the first plea, be able to shew that the testator was <em>seised </em>of the land sued for during the coverture. In that case, when we consider that a jointure was made by the testator, and accepted by the appellant after the coverture, the judgment would not only give a double provision to the widow, but be equally reprobated by the justice of the case and the law of the land.</p>\n<author id=\"b68-11\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">The principal question in this case is, whether the Court below erred in overruling the demurrer to the defendant\u2019s second plea, or whether that plea, in the form it appears on the record, was not, if sustained, a legal bar to- the demandant\u2019s action ?</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">In considering the question, I shall briefly state so much of the plea as seems to be material j and, secondly, state the substance of the demurrer, and endeavour to apply the law to the case, as it appears on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">The plea is, that the said <em>John II. </em>Norton, by will, duly made, &amp;c. devised that the said Catharine, his wife, should have the full use ef the mansion-house, and other houses of the said John, <em>where he did then live ; </em>together with-the ground on which they stand ; and the garden, stable and stable-lot,- <em>during the life of the said </em>Catharine, (and-then- mentions two codicils to the said will, by which a considerable personal estate was bequeathed to her,) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>which said will, and the codicils annexed thereto, have u since the death of the said <em>John, </em>been duly proved and 44 recorded, in the Court of <em>Frederick </em>County, and are \u201c now in full force ; and that the devises, 8cc. in the said \u201c will and codicils, before set forth, <em>were in lieu of Ihe </em>\u201c <em>said Catharine\u2019s dower in the estate of the said John ; </em>\u201c and that the said <em>Catharine </em>did, after the death o\u00ed the said \u201c John, and before the commencement of this suit, ac- \u201c tually enter <em>into </em>and occupy the said mansion-house, and 44 other houses <em>where the said John did live, </em>and the stable, \u201c stable-lot and garden, so as aforesaid devised to her, in lieu of her dower aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">To this plea there is a special demurrer; and for causes thereof, the demandants shew, 1st. \u201c That the averment in 44 the said plea is matter not contained in the said will and 64 codicils, or either of them, or any part thereof ; and the 44 tenant ought not to aver any thing out of the said will 44 and codicils,</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">2d. 44 The averment aforesaid is respecting matter c: 54 record, and ought to he verified by -(be record, and 1?, 44 not so verified by the said plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">1st. With respect to the first cause of demurrer, it was formerly held that a jointure by <em>deed, </em>though not expressed to be in lieu of dower, might be <em>averred </em>to be so <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but that a <em>devise </em>to a wife for life, cannot be averred to be in satisfaction of dower, unless it be so expressed in the will.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Because, say the books, it shall be considered as a kindness and benevolence of me testator.</p>\n<p id=\"A88\">But our act of Assembly, 44 <em>reducing into one the seve</em>44 <em>ral acts relating to dower f </em>passed the 6ih <em>Dec. 1 </em>T92, places the provision made for the wife, by <em>deed, </em>or by <em>will, </em>on the same ground <em>; </em>in which it is enacted (section 11.) that, 44 if any estate be conveyed by <em>deed, </em>or by <em>will, </em>either 44 expressly, or by <em>averment, </em>for the jointure of the wife, in 44 lieu of her dower, to take effect in her own possession., 44 immediately on the death of her husband, and to con-44 tinue during her life, at least, determinable, by such grw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u2018\u2018 only as would forfeit her dower at common law, such <em>ci </em>conveyance shall bar her dower of the residue of the \u201c lands, tenements and hereditaments, which at any time \u201c were her said husband\u2019s. But, if the said conveyance \u201c were before the marriage, and during the infancy of the \u201c feme, or if it were made after marriage, in either case, \u201c the widow may, at her election, waive such jointure, and \u201c demand her dower.\u2019? And in the 12th section, it is enacted, that, \u2018\u2018 when any conveyance, intended to be in lieu \u201c of dower, shall, through any defect, fail tobe a legal bar \u201c thereto, and the widow, availing herself of such defect, \u201c shall demand her dower, the estate and interest conveyed \u201c to s,uch widow, with intention to bar her dower, shall \u201c thereupon cease and determine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">By this act, it appears to be the will of the Legislature, that a widow shall not have both jointure and dower, whether the former be by <em>deed </em>or by <em>will; </em>but, in certain cases, may make her election.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The first recited section shews, clearly, that where a testator, by his <em>will, </em>makes provision for his widow, intending (but not expressing or declaring) it to be in lieu of her dovrer, the proper and only mode of shewing it to have, been so, is by <em>averment; </em>and therefore the <em>averment </em>in the case before us, that the devises in the will of <em>John H. Nor</em>ton, to his widow, were in lieu of her dower, was proper, and no good cause of <em>demurrer ; </em>and the same answer may suffice for the second cause, that the averment \u201c aforesaid is respecting matter of record, and ought to be \u201c verified by the record, and is not so verified for it seems to me not necessary that the averment should have been verified by the record ; the will, in which the devises averred to be in lieu of her dower were made, being particularly referred to in the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">But it is contended, that the plea is faulty and cannot be supported, because there is no <em>venue </em>laid therein ; and it is not stated that the mansion-house, &amp;c. are situate in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>town of <em>Winchester </em>and County of Frederick, or at any other particular place.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\">If we inquire into the reason why laying a <em>venue </em>is necessary, in pleadings, where the subject in controversy is local, I conceive it to be, to identify the subject, and to prevent surprise on the adverse party ; and it seems necessary on the part of the demandant also, that m case o\u00ed a recovery, process may issue to the proper officer lo gh c possession of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">If I am correct in this position, the object is fully attained by the plea, in this <em>case; </em>in which it is stated, 44 that the mansion-house, &amp;c. devised to the said <em>Catha</em>'4 <em>ri\u00f1e, </em>during her life in lieu of her right of dower, in the estate of the said <em>John, </em>is the mansion-house, &amp;c. 44 where the said <em>John </em>did <em>then </em>live, and that, after the 44 death of the said John, and before the commencement of 44 this suit, the said <em>Catharine </em>did actually enter into and 44 occupy the said mansion-house, &amp;c. where the said <em>John </em>44 did live, and hath ever since been in the possession and 44 occupation thereof, in lieu of her dower aforesaid.\u201d The plea refers to the will of <em>John II. </em>Norton, \u201c <em>proved </em>44 <em>and recorded in the Court of Frederick County </em>and, as the law directs, that if wills be proved in a County Court, the proof shall be in the Court of the County wherein the mansion-house, or place of residence of the testator is, it consequently follows that the mansion-house of <em>John II. Norton </em>was in the County of Frederick, though not stated to be in the Town of Winchester, which appears to me to be as complete a description of the mansion-house, garden, stable and stable-lots, as if he had added, 44 lying in the Town of Winchester,\u201d which I consider as matter of <em>form </em>merely, the <em>substance </em>having been sufficiently stated iu the plea, in which the premises were so particularly described, that the demandants could not, I conceive, have possibly mistaken their identity; and I am the more confirmed in this opinion, as neither the counsel below, in the <em>..demurrer, </em>nor the able counsel in the argument at this bar. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>took the smallest notice of the omission. And, in my ap prehension, the plea tendered a fair issue to the demand-ants, on which they might have tried the cause on its true merits, and the <em>onus probandi </em>would have been on the de~ fendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">But, admitting that the omission would have been fatal, had it been alleged as a cause of demurrer, it is now too late to make the objection; for, by the act for limitation of actions, &amp;c. passed the 19th <em>Dec. </em>1792, section 27. it is enacted, \u201c that where a demurrer shall be joined in any ac- \u201c tion, the Court shall not regard anv other defect, or im~ \u201c perfection in the writ, return, <em>declaration </em>or <em>pleading, </em>\u201c than what shall be specially alleged in the demurrer, as \u201c causes thereof <em>; </em>unless something so essential to the ac- \u201c tion, or defence, as that judgment according to law and \u201c the very right of the cause, cannot be given, shall be \u201c omitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The question then occurs, whether there is not sufficient matter stated in the record to enable the Court to give-judgment according to law, and the veryright of the cause 1 and I have no difficulty in saying, that I am of opinion there is. The demurrer, I conceive, admits the fact, that the demandant Catharine, under the devise aforesaid, entered into and occupied the mansion-house, garden, stable and stable-lot, &amp;c. and hath ever since been in the possession thereof; but denies it to be in lieu of her dower; and that the defendant ought not so to have averred it, in his said plea, as it is matter not contained in the said will and codicils, or either of them, or any part thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">By the act of Assembly, relating to dower, above recited, a widow shall not have both dower and lands intended to be in lieu thereof ; and the demandant Catharine, having accepted and occupied the lands, mansion-house, &amp;c. (wherever they be,) devised to her by her late husband\u2019s will, is not entitled to dower in any other of his lands or <em>tenements; </em>as it appears to me that they were intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>to be in lieu of her dower, though not so expressed in the will. I am therefore of opinion that the judgment of the District Court ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A2S\">By a majority of the Court, (absent Judge I.tons,) the judgment of the District, Court ae\u00ed'\u00edjimed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A8D\"><em> </em>Vol. 1. p. 737 old ed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AVKI\"><em> 1 </em>Lord <em>Raym. 438 Vide 3 </em>Lord <em>Raym. </em>151. where the plea in that case will be found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AV\">\n<em> 2 Black.
