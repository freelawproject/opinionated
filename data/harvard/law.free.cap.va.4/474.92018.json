Rice, </em>afterwards in an action against one <em>Lewellen, </em>to whom <em>White </em>had sold the slave, <em>recovered the </em>same; and so by means of the deceit practised on him by the defendant <em>Rice, </em>whereby he was induced to give a full price for the absolute property of the slave, <em>White </em>not only lost the property, but was compelled to incur great expense in defending the title <em>he. </em>The defendant pleaded two pleas in bar, the entry whereof in the record, and of the issues thereon, was in these words: \u201c And the defendant by his attorney, comes and defends the wrong and injury, when Sic. and for plea saith, that he is <em>not guilty </em>in manner and form as the plaintiff against him hath complained ; and the defendant for further plea, pleads <em>the statute of limitations; </em>and of this he puts himself upon the country; and the plaintiff likewise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-4\">At the trial of the issues, several bills of exceptions were filed by the defendant\u2019s counsel to opinions of the court; but it is not necessary to state them, as none of the points thereby presented were noticed in the argument here, or touched by the court, in its decision of the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-5\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff on both issues, and assessed his damages to 459 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-6\">Whereupon the defendant moved the court to set aside the verdict, and direct a new trial, 1. because the verdict was not warranted by the evidence; 2. because the jury had given excessive damages; and 3. because tbe action in point of law could not be maintained against the defendant. The judge, at his instance, certified, that the following facts were proved at the trial, <em>viz:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AY_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>That <em>Rice, </em>the defendant, in the year 1811, as the agent of his mother, <em>Ann Foster, </em>sold the slave in question to the plaintiff, <em>White, </em>for 220 dollars; and part of the purchase money was applied to the discharge of a debt then due <em>by Mrs. Foster, </em>and the balance to a debt due by the defendant himself, to the plaintiff; that, at the time of this sale,' the defendant knew that <em>Mrs. Foster </em>had only a life interest in the slave, and that the reversion belonged to the executor of <em>M. Rice </em>deceased, <em>Mrs. Foster\u2019s </em>first husband and the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>father; and he did not disclose these facts to the plaintiff: that <em>Mi's. Foster </em>died in 1817; and then the executor of <em>M. Rice </em>brought an action of <em>detinue </em>against <em>Mary Lewellen, </em>to whom the plaintiff had in the meantime sold the slave, and recovered judgement against her for the slave or the alternative value thereof, and damages for the detention; which value was ascertained by the jury to be--, and the damages for the detention were assessed at-: that <em>Mrs. Lewellen </em>then brought suit against the plaintiff, to recover of him retribution of what had been recovered of her by <em>Rice\u2019s </em>executor; and in that action recovered a judgement, and sued out execution for the damages and costs adjudged to her, amounting to the sum of 459 dollars [which w\u2019as the amount of damages assessed to <em>White, </em>by the verdict of the jury in this suit]; but the defendant insisted, that, if the plaintiff was entitled to recover in this action at all, the measure of damages should be the purchase money paid <em>by the </em>plaintiff for the slave, with interest thereon from the time the right of action for her accrued to <em>M. Rice\u2019s </em>executor.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>this state of facts, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a new trial, on the grounds above mentioned. The court overruled the motion, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-3\">Judgement was then given for the plaintiff, for the damages assessed by the jury and costs; from which the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-4\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellant, and <em>Leigh </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-5\">I. <em>Johnson </em>insisted, that the proper measure of damages was the purchase money, with interest from the time when the action of <em>Rice\u2019s </em>executor for the slave sold to <em>White </em>accrued. And <em>Leigh, </em>earnestly contended, that the actual amount of damages, which the purchaser sustained by reason of the defect of the title, and the deceit practised upon him in regard thereto, was the just measure of retribution due to him, which was ascertained, in this case, by <em>Mrs. Lewellen\u2019s </em>recovery against him. Otherwise, he said, no one could ever safely purchase a female slave; for, if she should have increase, she would herself be of little profit to her owner, and the children would be a charge during their childhood; and then, the mother and all her increase might be recovered of the vendee, and he, after being at the charge of rearing the children, would only get back the purchase money he had paid for the mother. But this point, though very fully debated at the bar, was not noticed by the judges, in their opinions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-6\">JI. <em>Johnson </em>maintained, that upon the state of facts proved at the trial, as certified by the judge, the verdict ought to have been for the defendant upon the issue joined on the plea of the statute of limitations. He said, the <em>deceit </em>practised by <em>Rice </em>in the sale of the slave to <em>White,, </em>was the only cause of action, which <em>White </em>could have against <em>Rice ; </em>and the action for the deceit accrued immediately upon the sale, which was in 1811; but this action was not brought till April 1826. He cited <em>Baitley </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Ald. 288. <em>Short </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>Id. 626. 5 Eng. C. L. R. 288. 403. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>Granger </em>v. <em>George, </em>5 Barn. &amp; Cress. 149. <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Young, </em>Id. 259. 11 Eng. C. L.

Rep. 456. <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Plummer, </em>4 Peters 172.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-6\"><em>Leigh </em>said, that the <em>fraud </em>was sufficient to take the case out of the statute of limitations; <em>Bree </em>v. <em>Holbech, </em>2 Doug. 656. That, in this action for <em>deceit, </em>the cause of action accrued when the deceit was discovered ; for the effect of the deceit was not only to defraud the party injured, but to conceal the fraud from him; and to give the wrongdoer the benefit of the statute of limitations, <em>during the </em>time the injured party was lulled into security by the very deceit practised upon him, was, in effect, to allow him to derive from his own wrong, all the advantage he could have derived from perfect fairness in the transaction; it would exempt him from responsibility for the deceit, unless, by chance, it should be discovered before the time of limitation should expire. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Hougham, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Cress. 149. 9 Eng. C. L. R. 47. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>2 Brod. &amp; Bing. 73. 6 Eng. C. L. R. 25. <em>The first Massachusetts Turnpike v. Field, 3 </em>Mass. Rep. 201. <em>Sherwood </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>5 Mason 143. it might be said, that, if the action for the deceit accrued when it was discovered, yet the fact of the deceit being discovered within the time of limitation, ought to be put in issue by a replication in avoidance of the plea of the statute; and this, as a general proposition, might be true : but, in this case, the statute of limitations was not formally pleaded, and the same regularity of pleading on the plaintiff\u2019s part, ought not to be required of him, as if the defendant\u2019s pleading had been regular. It was the design of both parties to dispense with form, and to put in issue the whole merits of the defence founded on the statute of limitations. The defendant pleaded \u201c the statute of limitations,\u201d without saying how the statute operated as a bar, and tendered an issue; and the plaintiff, without saying how his action was within the time, accepted the issue. The pleadings left both parties (and were intended to leave them both) at large, to shew when the action accrued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>Johnson </em>replied, that the defendant\u2019s plea of <em>\u201c </em>the statute of limitations,\u201d though irregular, was as good after issue taken upon it, as if it had been ever so formal and technical; and the authorities cited for the appellee shew that the matter of avoidance now relied on in argument, ought to have been pleaded in a replication, in order that it might have been put in issue, or demurred to. But it was questionable, to say the least, whether the fact of the deceit having come to the knowledge of the plaintiff within the time of limitation, would have sufficed to avoid the operation of the statute <em>; Callis v. Waddy, </em>2 Munf. 511. <em>Troup v. Smith, </em>2 Johns. Rep. 33. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Pitney, </em>5 Wend. 30.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\"> This bill of exceptions did not slate the date of the institution of the suit of <em>Rice\u2019s </em>executor against <em>Mrs. Lewellen, </em>nor the date of his judgement against her, nor the alternative value of the slave ascertained by that judgement, nor the damages assessed for the detention; and these facts appeared no where in the record. Neither did this bill of exceptions state the date of the institution of <em>Mrs. Lewellcn's </em>suit, or of her judgement against <em>White; </em>but it appeared from the record of that suit, set out in another bill of exceptions filed at the trial, that it was commenced in February 1825, and the judgement recovered in November following. This suit of <em>White </em>v. <em>Rice </em>was commenced in April 1826.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b503-5\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQN\">The counsel for the appellant, in the argument, confined himself to the bill of exceptions taken to the refusal of the court to grant a new trial, which contains a statement of the facts proved at the trial, certified by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The suit was brought in 1826. The declaration charged fraud and deceit practised by the defendant on the plaintiff, in the sale of a female slave in 1811. The pleas were not guilty, and \u201c the statute of limitationson both which issue was directly taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">It was contended, by the appellant\u2019s counsel, that the evidence shewed a case, which, on the plea of the statute, proved the verdict to be against both law and evidence; and, consequently, that the court erred in not granting a new trial. I was exceedingly struck with the argument of the appellee\u2019s counsel in reply, and was strongly inclined to believe with him, that the statute could not fun in <em>such </em>a case till the fraud was discovered. But an examination of the cases has compelled me to think, that, in the actual state of the pleadings, the decision refusing the new trial was .wrong. The statute says, \u201c the action shall be brought within five years next after the cause of such action or suit and not after.\u201d The question then is, when did the action accrue? It seems to me, that it must be said to have accrued when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the fraud in the sale was perpetrated. Suppose, that in a month after he had received the slave, and paid his purchase money, the plaintiff had discovered the cheat; could he not instantly have brought suit for it? What should prevent him? Could the defendant ward off <em>the action by </em>pleading that the plaintiff had received no injury, and possibly never might? surely, not: the injury was in the fraud; \u2022in selling him a slave out and out, to which he knew his mother had no title longer than her life. This doctrine is held, explicitly, in many cases cited at the bar. I do not undertake to decide, how the question would have been, if to the plea of the statute, the plaintiff had replied, that the defendant had fraudulently and deceitfully concealed from him the cheat he had practised upon him ; and that the suit was brought within five years after the discovery. In that case, there must have been either a demurrer, which would confess the fact, and put the case upon the law; or an issue, and then the fact would be directly in issue. But here, the issue is different; it is taken directly upon the statute; that is, upon the question, whether the suit was brought within five years after the cause of action arose. I think the judgement should be reversed, and the cause sent back for a new trial, when the plaintiff may move to amend his pleadings, if he shall be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\">Cabell and Brooke, J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Tucker, <em>P. </em>Our first attention, in this case, must be turned to the state of the pleadings. (He stated them). Upon the trial of the issues a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff upon which the defendant moved for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AM84\">If the plea of the defendant be an immaterial plea, it is obvious, that no new trial ought to be granted ; for it would be vain and futile to award a new trial for an immaterial matter; of a matter which, even if found for the defendant, could not entitle him to a judgement. But here, the plea of \u201c the statute of limitations,\u201d only seems to be an informal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>and not an immaterial plea. Tf pleaded formally, it would be a bar; and, accordingly, we find it was so considered in <em>Cook </em>v. Darby, 4 Munf. 444. That was trespass on the case against a common carrier for embezzlement; pleas, not guilty and \u201c the act of limitations\u201d in those words only, and issue : the plaintiff\u2019s evidence proved embezzlement fifteen years before the action: the defendant moved the court to instruct the jury, that the statute of limitations barred the action; but the court instructed the jury, that the statute did not apply: exceptions were taken, and a <em>supersedeas </em>allowed by this court. The appellant\u2019s counsel contended, that the statute did not apply to the case, as the declaration charged a fraud : but the court, <em>nemine dissentienie, </em>reversed the judgement, on the express ground that the statute \u25a0well applied to the case. Now, this could not have been, if the court had not considered the plea, as pleaded, a material and substantial plea, however informal. It was expressly assailed as being defective, and was likened to the plea of \u201cjustification,\u201d which it is admitted is not good; <em>Kirtley </em>v. <em>Deck, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 388. But the objection did not prevail; the distinction, indeed, being evident, between the plea of \u201c the statute of limitations,\u201d which offers a distinct and specific ground of defence, without any thing more, and the plea of \u201cjustification,\u201d which unless carried out, is utterly nugatory. The first gives the plaintiff fair and full notice of the defence set up; whereas the second subserves no purpose of pleading, as it does not give notice of the character of the \u2018\u2018 justification,\u201d on which the defendant will rely. <em>Kerr </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>2 Call 319. It is true, that in the case of <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Foote's ex'ors, </em>3 Call 248. the court seemed to think, that the plea of <em>non assumpsit </em>within five years, referred to the time of the plea, according to the decision of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>1 Wash. 135. and that it was, therefore, an immaterial plea ; but as, in every case, it is not held to be the settled rule that <em>\u201c actio non\" </em>goes to the commencement of the action, the plea ought certainly not to have been gratuitously considered as violating this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>rule. If the short minute of the plea is to be considered as sufficient after verdict, it is because the court will intend it to be carried out into proper form. It certainly would not intend it to be extended into an improper form, unless its terms required it. This case, therefore, must yield to the case of <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Darby; </em>and the rather, as it does not seem to have been much considered, nor was the point essential to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Taking the plea as substantially good, there is no doubt that it was fully sustained by the evidence. For, in an action of deceit in the sale of property, the cause of action arises at the instant; and the plaintiff might, in this case, have sued the next day after the perpetration of the fraud, and have recovered his damages to the value of the purchase money paid. The numerous authorities cited at the bar to this point, are satisfactory and conclusive: I shall only mention, particularly, <em>Battley </em>v. Faulkner, <em>Short </em>v. <em>M\u2019Carthy, </em>and <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Young. </em>In this last case <em>Holroyd, </em>J. says, <em>\u201c </em>whether the plaintiff elects to sue in one form of action or another [either for a breach of <em>promise, </em>or for a breach of <em>duty\\ </em>the cause of action, which in either form is substantially the same, accrued at the same moment of time : and the breach of promise, or of duty, took place as soon as the defendant took insufficient security.\u201d In the case before us, therefore, the plaintiff might have brought his action the day after the sale, and recovered damages, if he had then known of the defect of title and the fraud practised on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">But it is said, he did not know it; that it does not appear that the fraud was discovered more than five years before the suit brought; and that, therefore, the bar of the statute does not apply. Had the plaintiff replied that matter, I should have been unwilling to disturb the verdict on the ground of the statute. But he has not done so. He has joined issue on the plea, instead of replying the matter which would have avoided it. He cannot, therefore, avail himself of this matter in avoidance of the statute. He ought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>have replied it, that the defendant might have taken issue on the fact of discovery. <em>JYon constat </em>but that the defendant might, if he had been called upon to do so by such a replication, have proved the knowledge on the part of the plaintiff, of the defect of title, on the next day after the sale. On general principles, it is as necessary that the defendant should be informed by the replication of the particular avoidance of the statute, in order that he may rebut it, as that the plaintiff should be informed of the ground of defence by plea, that he may be prepared to meet it. Nothing is more clear than that exceptions to the statute must always be replied, or any other matter which avoids its influence. <em>Bogle </em>v. <em>Conway\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors, 3 Call 1. In <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Hougham, 2 </em>Barn. &amp;c Cress. 149. the plea was <em>non assumpsit </em>within six years; replication, that the defendant did assume within six years. <em>Bailey, </em>J. said, in reference to certain evidence given in the case, \u201c The question how far fraud may prevent the operation of the statute of limitations, does not properly arise in this case. On the form of the replication adopted, the only question is, when did the cause of action accrue? In order to take advantage of the fraud, there should have been a special replication.\u201d And of the same opinion were the other judges.</p>\n<p id=\"AAx\">I am therefore of opinion, that the statute was a good bar to the action, and was sustained by the evidence. The verdict being, then, against the evidence, should be set aside, and a new trial awarded. When the verdict is set aside, the plaintiff may have leave to withdraw bis informal replication, and reply that the fraud was discovered within five years before the commencement off.the action, which would be, I think, a sufficient answer to the plea. <em>Bree </em>v. <em>Holbech, 2 </em>Doug. 632. <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Earl of Warrington, </em>4 Bro.
