Chapman </em>instituted a proceeding of unlawful detainer against <em>James A. Dunlap, </em>to obtain possession of a tract of land in the county of <em>Monroe. </em>On the trial of the cause the defendant took exceptions to opinions of the Court admitting certain evidence, and refusing to give instructions asked for by him; and a verdict and judgment having been rendered against him, he obtained a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment from the Judge of the Superior Court of <em>Monroe. </em>When the cause came on to be heard in that Court, the judgment of the Court below was reversed; whereupon <em>Chapman </em>applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to that judgment, which was awarded. Whilst the cause was pending in this Court, the appellee <em>Dunlap </em>died; and the question then arose whether the appeal could be revived.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-12\"><em>Price </em>and <em>William Smith, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-13\"><em>M\u2019 Farland, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b106-14\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Aah\">The death of the defendant in error having been suggested at a former term, and the Court being of opinion that the cause is in its nature incapable of revival, it is ordered that the writ of <em>supersedeas </em>awarded by this Court be abated; which is ordered to be certified to the said Circuit Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
