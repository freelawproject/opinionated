Wise, </em>joint merchants and partners, under the firm of <em>Crippin </em>and <em>Wise, </em>brought an action of trespass against <em>Thomas Broxvn, </em>for taking and carrying away the goods and chattels of the plaintiffs <em>; </em>and laid their damages at <em>ten thousand dollars. </em>On affidavit of one of the partners, that the defendant had taken a schooner of their property, with certain goods on board, and that in the event of a recovery, they would not be able to obtain the effect of their judgment, <em>the defendant not being a resident of this </em>State, a magistrate, by endorsement on the writ, directed <em>bail </em>to be taken, which was accordingly given by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-6\">The writ was returnable to the <em>February </em>term, (which in that County is a Court of Quarterly Session,) and at the <em>March </em>Court following, (31st of March, 1809,) the defendant, by his attorney, preferred a petition to the Court, in which he stated that he was a lieutenant in the navy of the <em>United States, </em>and a citizen of the State of <em>Pennsylvania ; </em>that a writ of trespass <em>de bonis captis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>et </em>asportatis, had been issued against him, from the office of the Court of <em>Accomack </em>County, by <em>Samuel Cripp'm </em>and <em>John E. </em>Wise, merchants, (which writ is prayed to be taken as part of the petition,) in which damages were laid at <em>ten thousand </em>dollars, and <em>the </em>petitioner held to bail on the execution thereof, by virtue of an endorsement made by a magistrate, grounded on an affidavit which states the petitioner <em>not to be a resident of this State.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\">The prayer of the petition was, that the cause might be removed to the next Circuit Court of the <em>United States </em>for the District of Virginia, pursuant to the act of Congress, in that case made and provided ; the petitioner further stating, that he was ready, with good and sufficient surety, for his entering in such Court, on the first day of its session, copies of such process against him, and also for his there appearing and entering special bail in the cause, if required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">The County Court refused to permit the removal of the cause, on two grounds <em>; </em>1st. \u201c Because it was not shewn to them that the defendant was an,-alien, or a citizen of \u201c a State other than the State of <em>Virginia.\u201d </em>2dly. \u201c Be- \u00ab cause the defendant was not personally present to exeu cute a bond, conformable to the 12th section of the A act of Congress, entitled - <em>\u2018'An act to establish the Judi~ u cial Courts of the United States.\u2019 \u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-7\">The defendant, by his counsel, offered, as proof of the <em>first </em>point, [his being a citizen of another State,] the writ and endorsement thereon, in the cause. He also offered parol proof of the declarations of the defendant, both before and after the issuing of the writ, that he was a native of Philadelphia, in the state of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>and a resident of that city, where his father then resided ; and also of like declarations as to the residence of the defendant, from the crew of the gun-boat commanded by him. As to the <em>second </em>point, he tendered .certain persons as sureties, acknowledged by the Court <em>to </em>be good and sufficient, but who, the Court said, coyld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>- ioi </em>be \u201c taken without the defendant was also present to <em>u </em>execute the bond m person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIB\">At the Superior Court of Law, for the County of <em>Ac</em>comack, held on the 6th of <em>May, </em>1809, the defendant moved the Judge of that Court for a <em>mandamus </em>to the County Court of <em>Accomack, </em>commanding that Court to remove the cause to the Circuit Court of the <em>United States, </em>on the above statement of facts appearing in the record. But the Court being of opinion that there was no error in the decision of the County Court, refused to grant the <em>mandamus. </em>From which decision an appeal was taken to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-5\"><em>Hay, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A84\">1st. The County Court ought <em>to </em>have allowed the prayer of the petition ; the defendant having brought himself within the <em>express </em>terms of the act of Congress.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Neither of the reasons assigned by the Court, for their refusal, are sufficient. As to the fact of <em>non-residence, </em>it was established not only by the plaintiff\u2019s own affidavit, endorsed on the writ, but was proved by other evidence. The objection that the defendant was not <em>personally </em>in Court to join in the bond? has no <em>weight; </em>for neither the words nor the policy of the act require his presence, and all the purposes of the law may be attained without it <em>; </em>as by a bond executed by others, or by a deed of trust, or a deposit of money, &amp;c. Besides, it might be highly inconvenient to require the presence of the <em>party; </em>because, being a resident of another State, he would be compelled to wait till the meeting of the Court, however distant it might be from the time of serving the writ. But tin language of the 12th section of the judicial act of Congress, differs from that formerly used in our statute, which required the <em>parly </em>to enter into bond. This law. however, having been found inconvenient, it was provired dial bonds for prose curing appeals, writs of error, <em>supersedeas, </em>certiorari, or <em>any other </em>cause, may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>given by any <em>responsible person and </em>security, though not a <em>partly.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANA\">2d. This provision for removing a cause from a State Court, where a non-resident is a party, is a wise one, calculated to avoid the effect <em>of </em>those prejudices which too often exist <em>; </em>and which have been manifested by the refusal of the Court, in the present case. It is a privilege, a right, which the law gives, and, in withholding it, the Court erred. The only way in which the error of the County Court could be corrected, was by <em>mandamus. </em>A writ of error or supersedeas would not lie, because they are only grantable after <em>final </em>judgment.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Nor would an appeal have been the proper remedy ; because it comes within the meaning of the law relating to writs of error and supersedeas. An appeal will only lie from the <em>judgment </em>or <em>sentence </em>of a Court <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that is, from that which <em>decides </em>the cause : otherwise, there might be an appeal from a decision on an incidental <em>point; </em>as on a motion for a continuance, or for admitting a deposition to be read. But an appeal, if granted, would not have answered the purpose. Nothing but the record of the <em>motion </em>would have gone up. In the mean time the suit would have progressed, and the cause have been tried. If the Court above had decided, on an appeal, that the County Court did wrong, it could have reversed the <em>opinion </em>of that <em>Court; but </em>could have done nothing more. It might have said that the party was entitled to the privilege of removing his cause, but it would still have remained in the County Court. There was no mode by which the judgment <em>of </em>the Superior Court could be <em>enforced </em>but by <em>mandamus.</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-14\">It has been suggested, that this process should have been applied for to the <em>Federal </em>Court, and not to a <em>State </em>Court, under the <em>14th </em>section of the judicial act. The Courts of the <em>United Stales </em>are authorized to issue \u201c all \u2022\u201c writs not specially provided for by the statute, <em>which </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>M <em>may be necessary for the exercise of their respective </em>jtr- \u201c risdictions.\u201d But the Circuit Court of the <em>United States </em>had no jurisdiction till the cause was brought before it. When a jurisdiction has <em>attached </em>in a Federal Court, it rnav be maintained; but it cannot be <em>acquired </em>in that way. The consequences of such a clashing of jurisdictions between the State and Federal Courts would produce an eternal state of hostility. It never was contemplated that a <em>Federal Court </em>should issue process, commanding a <em>Slate, Court </em>to do any act. It must be presumed, that all the Courts will do their duty, and act within the sphere of their own jurisdictions; and if an inferior Court refuse to exercise its proper functions, it is the duty of a superior Court to compel it. Again, the thirteenth section of the judicial act specially provides for issuing writs of <em>mandamus; </em>but they can only be directed to persons <em>holding office </em>under the <em>United States; </em>and this power if, expressly confined to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-5\">No counsel appeared for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\"> By an act of the General Assembly, which took effect on the first of <em>January, </em>1809, a Superior Court of Law is to be held by one Judge, in each County, in lieu of, and possessing the jurisdiction of the District Courts, formerly established.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\"> See L.

At the succeeding Com;, <em>Crown </em>preferred a petition to the Court for the removii of the suit to the next Circuit Court of the <em>United States, </em>to i&gt;o holtiui for this district, wherein he styles hims-df a citizen of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>and refers to the writ and order of bail, and offered to give security as required by ..he act of the first Congress, 1 sess. c. 20. s. 12. which the Court refused; first, because it was not shewn to them that the defendant was an alien, or a citizen of auy other State ; .md, secondly, because the deiendant was not per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>sonally present to execute a bond, conformably to the 12th section of the act of Congress. Afterwards, application was made to the Superior Court of <em>Accomac </em>County, to award a <em>mandamus </em>to the County Court, commanding them to remove the cause, which was also refused ; and from that decision there is an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">' By the act of Congress above mentioned, if a suit be commenced in any State Court against an alien, or by a citizen of the State in which the suit is brought against a citizen of another State, and the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds 500 dollars, and the defendant shall, at the time of entering his appearance, file a petition for the removal of the cause into the next Circuit Court of the <em>United </em>States, to be held in the District, and offer good and sufficient surety for his entering in such Court, on the first day of its session, copies of the process against him, and also for his there appearing and entering bail in the cause, if special bail was originally requisite therein, it shall then be the duty of the State Court to accept the security, and proceed no further in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The removal of the cause in such a case is a matter of right which ought not to be refused to any defendant, who makes out his case, and complies with the terms of the law. The order for bail endorsed on the writ, obtained on the application and oath of one of the plaintiffs, and stating that the defendant was not a native of this State, superseded the necessity of any proof of that fact to the Court, on the part of the defendant. The security offered was admitted by the Court to be good and sufficient, and ought to have been accepted. The law does not prescribe that a <em>bond </em>shall be taken. A person taken upon a writ of <em>capias ad respondendum </em>may be in close <em>custody; </em>and while the superior Courts of this State had jurisdiction over several, and often very remote Counties, it might have been impossible to bring the defendant before the Court during the term, to give bond in the presence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Court. In such case, the wise provision of the act of Con-gross would in ninety-nine case out of a hundred be dcfeated. A stipulation in nature of a recognisance taken in Court, (as is every day\u2019s practice in entering special hail in the County Courts,) would have answered every purpose of the law. Both reasons for refusing the prayer of the petition were, therefore, utterly without foundation. And the refusal of the <em>mandamus </em>by the superior Court, appears to me to be equally against right. A <em>mandamus </em>is a writ of right in every case where it is the proper remedy. Being of opinion that the County Court refused to perforin a duty which was enjoined by law, a mandamus, at that stage of the cause, was the only remedy. The defendant could neither appeal, nor obtain a writ of error, or of supersedeas, until the final decision of the suit, when it might be too late. I do not know that a writ of <em>certiorari </em>would lie from the Circuit Court of the <em>United States </em>to a County Court, to remove a cause under such circumstances. But of this I have no doubt, that neither the Constitution of the <em>United </em>States, nor any act of Congress, does, or can, (so long as the twelfth article of the amendments to the Constitution of the <em>United States </em>remains in force,) deprive the superior Courts of this Commonwealth of that control over the proceedings of the inferior Courts, which the laws of this country give to them. I have therefore no doubt of the right of the Superior Court of <em>Acco~ mac </em>to grant the mandamus, nor that it erred in refusing it. 1 am therefore of opinion, that the judgment he reversed, and the cause sent back with directions to that Court to award the writ of <em>mandamus.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-8\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"AyX\">Judge Roane</author>\n<p id=\"AA8\">concurred, as to the judgment agreed to he entered.
