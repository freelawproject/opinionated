Code, ch. 194. \u00a7 10. p. 78.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-11\">The declaration stated the note, as a promissory note in writing, commonly called a negotiable note, dated the 8th June 1826, made and delivered by the defendant <em>Barrett </em>to one <em>Southall, </em>for 300 dollars, payable to <em>Southall </em>or order ninety days after date without set-off, negotiable at the office of the bank of <em>Virginia </em>at <em>Petersburg; </em>and, after alleging the indorsement thereof by <em>Southall </em>to the plaintiff <em>Wills, </em>averred, that, afterwards, when the note came to maturity, the same was presented for payment at the'said office of the bank, and payment thereof demanded there, but the same was then and there not paid, and yet remained wholly due and unpaid. Plea, the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-12\">At the trial, the defendant filed exceptions to an opinion of the court, stating, that the plaintiff, to support the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>on his part, offered in evidence the note in the declaration . . , 7 , mentioned, which was set out in <em>hcze verba, </em>and was a note made <em>negotiable </em>(but not <em>payable </em>also) at the office of the bank of <em>Virginia </em>at <em>Petersburg; </em>and that, <em>there being no other proof, </em>the defendant\u2019s counsel thereupon moved the court to instruct the jury, that the plaintiff could not maintain his action, without proving the averment in his declaration, that the note was presented for payment at the time and place mentioned in the note and declaration; which instruction the court refused to give the jury; and the defendant excepted to the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff \u201c for the debt in the declaration mentioned, with interest from the 10th <em>September 1826, </em>subject to a credit for 53 dollars paid on the 26th September 1826 ;\u201d and the court gave judgement for the plaintiff, pursuant to the verdict, for the debt and interest thereon, subject to the credit of 53 dollars. <em>Wills </em>applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgement which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-7\"><em>Allison, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-1\">took three objections to the judgement\u20141. That, as the declaration averred the presentation of the note for payment at bank, <em>Wills </em>was bound to prove the fact of such presentation there, in order to maintain this action. And adverting to the circumstance, that the note was only made <em>negotiable </em>at the bank, without being expressly made <em>payable </em>there also, and was so described in the declaration; he insisted, that a note made <em>negotiable </em>at bank, is, by force of that term of the contract, <em>payable </em>there. 2. That it was distinctly stated in the bill of exceptions, that there was no other proof in the cause but the <em>note; </em>that is, no proof of the hand writing of the maker, or of the indorser; without which, certainly, the indorsee was not entitled to a verdict. 3. That the judgement was irregular and uncertain : that the verdict, or if not the verdict, the judgement, at least, should have ascertained the exact sum due, instead of being for the debt claimed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>interest, subject to a credit for the sum paid at the specified date; <em>Grays </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>4 Munf. 437.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AGJ\">There was no counsel for the defendant in error.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b140-6\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AO4\">As to the first objection,\u2014it is a general rule in pleading, that the declaration must contain an averment of all such facts as are necessary to maintain the plaintiff\u2019s action; but if, in addition to the necessary averments, it contain- one idle and impertinent, so that it may be struck out without affecting the action, such averment is mere surplusage, and the plaintiff will not be held to proof of it. Is the averment here of this character, or is it one necessary to be stated in the declaration, and proved on the trial, to maintain the plaintiff\u2019s action ? Since the case of <em>Row v. Young, </em>2 Brod. &amp; Bing. 165. 6 Eng. C. L. R. 58. it may be considered as settled in <em>England, </em>that where a promissory note is made payable, or bill of exchange is accepted payable, at a particular place, it is necessary, in an action against the maker or acceptor, to aver and prove a presentment at the place. But the point has been decided differently in the courts of <em>New York, </em>4 Johns. Rep. 183. 17 <em>Id. </em>248. And in the case of <em>U. S. Bank </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>11 Wheat. 171. it is strongly doubted by the supreme court whether such averment and proof be necessary, in a suit against the <em>maker </em>of a note, though it is decided that they are, as against the <em>indorser. </em>This question, however, does not arise in the case before us; for the note is not made <em>payable </em>at any particular place; it is only made <em>negotiable </em>at the office of the bank of <em>Virginia </em>at <em>Petersburg. </em>The counsel, indeed, contended that this, of course, made it payable there; but he cited no authority for this, and I can find no decision to that effect. It would seem strange to me, if it had been so decided. There is no necessary connexion between the bank where a note is made <em>negotiable, </em>and the place where it is made <em>payable; </em>they are very different operations. In <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>Union Bank, </em>9 Cranch 11. chief justice <em>Marshall </em>said\u2014\u201c By making a note <em>negotiable </em>at a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>bank, the maker authorizes the bank to advance, on his eredit, to the owner of the note, the sum expressed on its face.\u201d But the payment of that note by the maker is quite another matter; it may be payable at large (and is always so where no place is named for payment), or payable at the bank where it is negotiable, or at a different place. This is all matter of express stipulation. In the case just cited, of <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>Union Bank, </em>there are two instances of notes negotiable at one bank, and payable at a different bank. The note, then, in the case before us, was payable at large, and the averment in the declaration wholly immaterial and idle, of which no proof was necessary. The circuit court, therefore, was right in refusing the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The next objection is to the form of the verdict and judgement : They are objected to for uncertainty, but I can perceive none. The counsel, in support of his objection, cited the case of <em>Grays </em>v. <em>Hines. </em>In that case, a judgement on a bond was entered for the penalty, to be discharged by the sum in the condition, \u201c subject to a deduction for <em>the said </em>credits indorsed on the said bond :\u201d here was much uncertainty; the sums to be credited were not specified; the judgement, instead of being complete in itself, referred to another document, which was liable to be changed by the clerk or others. The two cases are wholly different; and I think there is nothing in the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Another objection was relied on in the argument; that the band writing of the maker, and of the indorser, were not proved. But the record presents no such point. There is a general verdict for the plaintiff on the note; without any objection at the trial for want of such proof; without any motion to the court for instructions on the point; without any demurrer to the evidence. This is an attempt to supply the defect, by making the bill of exceptions operate as a demurrer to evidence; but that point has been too often decided here, to be now stirred.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The other judges concurred, and the judgement was affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
