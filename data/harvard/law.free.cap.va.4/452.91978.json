There were also two money counts; one, for money paid, laid out and expended; and the other, for money had and received. <em>Coiner </em>pleaded the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-11\">At the trial, the court, on the motion of <em>Coiner\u2019s </em>counsel, instructed the jury, that, if they should find from the evidence, that <em>Hansbarger, </em>without authority from or consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>of <em>Coiner, </em>had made an arrangement with <em>White, </em>the obligor in the assigned bonds, whereby the payment of the money due thereon was postponed, as to part for two months, and as to the .residue for four months, and that <em>White </em>actually paid the part he agreed to pay at the end of the two months, in such case, <em>Coiner </em>was discharged from his liability to <em>liansbarger, </em>as assignor of the bonds; but the court left it to the jury to decide, upon the evidence, whether a direction given by <em>Coiner </em>to <em>liansbarger </em>not to bring suit on the bonds till required by him, or any other circumstances proved in the cause, amounted to an authority or consent, on <em>Coiner's </em>part, to the arrangement made by <em>Hansbarger </em>with <em>White.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-4\">And then, the court, on the motion of <em>Ilansbarger's </em>counsel, instructed the jury, 1. That if they should find, that at the time of <em>Coiner's </em>assignment of the bonds to <em>Hansbarger, White </em>the obligor was insolvent, and that nothing could have been got from him by suit, in such case, <em>Hansbarger, </em>the assignee, was not bound to bring a suit against the obligor, but had a right to recourse against <em>Coiner, </em>the assignor. 2. That if the jury should find, that <em>White </em>the obligor was insolvent at the date of <em>Coiner's </em>assignment to <em>Hansbarger, </em>and continued insolvent till the commencement of this action, in such case, <em>Coiner </em>became immediately liable upon the assignment to <em>Hansbarger ; </em>and a subsequent arrangement, made by <em>Hansbarger </em>with <em>White, </em>whereby <em>Hansbarger </em>agreed that upon the payment of half the debt within two months, he would give <em>White </em>four months time for the balance, with which agreement <em>White </em>failed to comply,\u2014did not impair <em>Ilansbarger's </em>right to recover against <em>Coiner, </em>the assignor, in this action. And <em>Coiner's </em>counsel, thereupon, moved the court to instruct the jury, that unless they should find that the money could not have been obtained from <em>White, </em>either with or <em>without </em>suit, at the time the arrangement was made between <em>Hansbarger </em>and <em>him, </em>then that arrangement did discharge <em>Coiner </em>from his liability as assignor; but the court refused to give this instruction. 3. The court instructed the jury, that if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>should .find, that, after the arrangement made by <em>Uansbarger </em>with White, whereby time was given him for the payment of the debt due on his bonds, <em>Coiner </em>was informed of that arrangement, and sanctioned it, and promised payment of the tQ <em>jjansl,arger) </em>\u00a1n such case, though <em>Coiner </em>was ignorant of the legal consequences of such arrangement between the assignee and obligor, his promise of payment to <em>Hansbarger </em>was binding on him. To these instructions of the-court, <em>Coiner\u2019s </em>counsel filed exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWi\">There was a verdict and judgement for <em>Hansbarger. Coiner </em>appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the judgement; and then he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AG4\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afg\">The second instruction given by the county court to the jury was wrong. There is a plain analogy between the situation of an assignor of a bond, who is bound to make good the debt to the assignee, if it cannot be collected from the obligor, and the responsibility of a surety for his principal. It is not material, in the case of the assignor, that the obligor with whom the assignee makes a new contract, giving him time for the payment of the debt, is insolvent, any more than it is material, in the .case of a surety, whether the principal, to whom the creditor by a new contract gives further time, is solvent or insolvent. In the first case, the assignor ought to be held to be absolutely discharged, by the new contract made by the assignee with the obligor, upon the same principle, that the surety is held to be discharged by the new contract made by the creditor with the principal. <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Crummey, 2 </em>Rand. 228. <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Jett, </em>4 Id. 104. <em>M\u2019Kinney </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>1 Leigh 434. <em>M\u2019Lemore v. Powell, </em>12 Wheat. 554. The third instruction of the court to the jury, was also erroneous. If, by reason of the new contract of the assignor with the obligor, giving h\u00a1m indulgence for the debt, without the consent of the assignor, the assignor was discharged from liability on his contract of assignment, then his promise to pay the debt himself, was a promise without any consideration to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>it, and therefore not binding on him. In the case of mercantile paper, indeed, where the holder has not used due diligence, the promise of the drawer or indorser to pay the money to the holder, made with full knowledge of the fact of negligence, has been held to preclude him front relying on such negligence, in his defence against an action on the bill or note. <em>Goodall v. Dolley, </em>1 T. R. 712. <em>Hopes </em>v. <em>Alder, </em>6 East 16. <em>in notes. Lundie v. Robertson, </em>7 East 231. <em>Stephens v. Lynch, </em>12 East 38. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Rayworth, </em>13 East 417. This, however, is not because the promise is considered binding <em>per se, </em>but because it is considered as an acknowledgment that due diligence has been used (such as giving due notice of dishonor) which dispenses with proof of such diligence; or as an admission, that the defendant is, in all events, the proper person to pay the debt. So, in <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Rayworth, </em>lord <em>Ellenborough </em>said, that the defendant\u2019s promise to pay, was evidence that he was conscious of his liability to pay the note, which must be because he had due notice of dishonor; and <em>Bailey, </em>J. considered the promise, either as an acknowledgment that he had due notice of the dishonor, or that without such notice, he was the proper person to pay the note, as the party for whose use it was drawn. The truth is, a very rigid measure of diligence is required of the holder of mercantile paper; and negligence, in many particulars, often not at all affecting the substantial justice of the claim, is fatal. Hence, the promise of the defendant has been taken, not as binding <em>per se, </em>but as a waiver of objection to negligence, or as equivalent with proof of diligence, or as dispensing with such proof. But, in the case of assignor and assignee of a bond, where no such rigid rules are prescribed for the conduct of the assignee, and where the measure of diligence required varies according to circumstances, the subsequent promise of the assignor to pay, after the assignee has by his negligence lost his recourse against him, must be held binding <em>per se, </em>or not at all; and binding <em>per se </em>it cannot be, unless it is founded on some consideration; on some legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>or moral duty to pay the debt. Here, there was no consideration whatever to support the promise.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A4l_\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABKB\">The only diligence required of the assignee of a bond, in order to entitle him to recourse tbe assignor, is, that he shall <em>promptly </em>bring and prosecute suit against the obligor; and if the obligor be insolvent at the time of the assignment, so that a suit against him would be wholly unavailing, it is unnecessary for him to bring the suit. <em>Brown v. Ross, </em>6 Munf. 391. In the present case, then, immediately upon <em>Coiner's </em>assignment to <em>Hansbarger </em>of the bonds of <em>White, </em>who was at the time insolvent, <em>Hansbarger\u2019s </em>right of action against <em>Coiner </em>accrued. Any effort that he made afterwards, to get the money of <em>White, </em>without a suit, was a voluntary effort made for <em>Coiner\u2019s </em>benefit, which, certainly, could not exonerate him from his liability, already complete and absolute, to make good the debt. These considerations alone suffice to shew the propriety of the first and second instructions. The appellant\u2019s counsel regards the third instruction, as wholly independent of the second, and indeed, as proceeding on the supposition that the second was erroneous. Take it so. The instruction was, that if <em>Coiner </em>was informed of the arrangement made by <em>Hansbarger </em>with <em>White, </em>giving him indulgence for the debt, <em>and sanctioned it, and promised payment, </em>the promise was binding. His express sanction of the arrangement shewed, that he knew it was beneficial to himself; that it was the best, perhaps the only, method of getting any thing from the obligor, and so of preventing the necessity of recourse to him. His sanction of the arrangement made it his own; such sanction was equivalent with the giving of previous authority to <em>Hansbarger </em>to make it. His promise to pay the debt, was an acknowledgment, that he was conscious of his liability for it; an acknowledgment, that what had been done by <em>Hansbarger, </em>had been rightly done; so done as to preserve <em>Hansbarger\u2019s </em>recourse against him. There is, therefore, no question about the consideration to support the promise. The principle of the cases, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>which the holder of a bill of exchange or note, has omitted what due diligence'required, and get a subsequent promise of the drawer or indorser to pay it, he being aware of the negligence, has been held binding on him for the debt, seems applicable, <em>a fortiori, </em>to the case at bar: the cases on the subject are all collected in 4 Petersd. Abr. Bills and Notes, p. 480. The only question upon the last instruction was, in truth, whether <em>Coiner\u2019s </em>ignorance of the legal effect of <em>Hansbarger\u2019s </em>proceedings (supposing the legal effect would have been to discharge him from liability as assignor) destroys the effect of his <em>sanction </em>of those proceedings, and of his <em>promise </em>to pay the debt. But this is no longer a questionable point. <em>Bilbie </em>v. <em>Lumley, 2 </em>East 469. <em>Stevens v. Lynch, 12 </em>East 38. <em>Brisbane </em>v. <em>Dacres, </em>5 Taunt. 144. 1 Eng. C. L.
