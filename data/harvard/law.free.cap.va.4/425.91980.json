And then he contended, that the subsequent suing out of the <em>ca. sa. </em>by <em>Rogers fy brothers, </em>and the service thereof on <em>Lane, </em>did not destroy the lien of the judgement. For, he argued, that though the effect of the suing out and service of the ca. <em>sa. </em>at common law, might have been to deprive the judgement creditors of their right to sue out an <em>elegit </em>on their judgement, and so to destroy the lien of the judgement on the debtor\u2019s lands, yet the law was altered, in this respect, by the provision in the statute of executions, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 134. &lt;$&gt; 10. whereby the <em>ca. sa. executed </em>was made a lien on the whole of the lands of the debtor from the time of levying the writ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The <em>judgement </em>was a lien on a <em>moiety </em>of the debtor\u2019s lands, which continued in full force till the <em>ca. sa. </em>was served on the debtor; and then, this provision of the statute made the <em>ca. sa. executed </em>a lien on the whole of them. That which gave a lien on the <em>whole, </em>could not justly be construed to take away the previous lien on the moiety. This statute, he insisted, was intended to give the creditor suing out the <em>ca. sa. </em>a more beneficial lien on the debtor\u2019s lands, than his judgement gave him; not to destroy the lien of the judgement on the <em>moiety, </em>but to preserve and include it in the lien of the ca. <em>sa. executed </em>on the <em>whole. </em>And he referred to the ease of <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Rootes, </em>as an authority in point. In that case, he said, certain creditors had obtained a decree against <em>Rootes; </em>after which <em>Rootes </em>executed a deed of trust, conveying real estate for the benefit <em>of </em>other creditors, of whom <em>Fox </em>was one: the creditors claiming under the decree, sometime after the execution of the deed of trust, sued out a <em>ca. sa. </em>upon their decree against <em>Rootes, </em>which was executed on him, and he discharged from custody under the act for the relief of insolvent debtors: and this court held, that the creditors claiming under the decree, were entitled, notwithstanding their <em>ca. sa. executed </em>on <em>Rootes, </em>to have satisfaction of their decree out of the lands which had been mortgaged in the meantime by <em>Rootes\u2019s </em>deed of trust, in preference to <em>Fox, </em>whose debt was secured by the deed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-4\"><em>Leigh, for </em>the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As3\">said it was clear law, that <em>the </em>lien of a judgement on the lands of the debtor, was only the consequence of the capacity of the creditor to sue out an <em>elegit </em>on his judgement, and extend the lands to satisfy the debt; and that if a <em>ca. sa. </em>be sued out on a judgement, and the debtor be actually taken and charged in execution under that process, the creditor can never afterwards have an <em>elegit </em>on his judgement. The 10th section of the statute of executions made a <em>ca. sa. executed </em>a lien on the whole of the debtor\u2019s lands, from the time of the service of that process; but this lien was wholly distinct from, and indeed incompatible with, the lien of the judgement. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Heiskell, </em>1 Leigh 257. 270. 278. it was agreed by the counsel, and it was the opinion of the judges, that a judgement creditor who sues out an execution against the body of his debtor, and levies it, surrenders the lien of his judgement by having elected this process of execution; that the lien of the judgement can never be revived but by the death of the debtor in execution, or his escape or rescue; that in lieu of the lien of the judgement, so surrendered, he obtains the statutory lien of the <em>execution, </em>commencing at the date of its levy; and that this lien has no relation back, so as to affect any prior right of creditor or purchaser, but every fair purchaser and creditor, whose rights are prior in time, have preference by law. As to <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Rootes, </em>be said, it was heard before a court of three judges, and there was such a remarkable diversity of opinion among them on the several points involved in the case, that the judges themselves, sensible that the adjudication could settle no principle, desired that it should not be reported. It was manifest from the decree, that the opinion, in that case, on the point mentioned by the appellants\u2019 counsel, was founded on the very peculiar circumstances of the case.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>II. <em>Johnson </em>said, that supposing the principle of the decree r'ght, yet the bill ought not to have been dismissed as to the appellees : they should have been retained in court, in order that the chancellor might compel the execution of the trust for the benefit of the <em>cestuis que trust and of the </em>judgement creditors, and appropriate the surplus, if any, to the satisfaction of the judgement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-5\"><em>Leigh </em>said, this was a matter of very little importance. It was plain enough there could be little or no surplus; and whatever there might be, would vest in the sheriff for the benefit of the <em>ca. sa. </em>creditors, at whose suit <em>Lane </em>was in custody when he took the oath of insolvency; and some of them, who are not parties to this suit, had priority over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>Rogers brothers. </em>Besides, the object of the bill was to set aside the deeds; and it was only in case they should be set aside, that a sale of the subject was prayed.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-7\"> The case of <em>Fox's adm'r </em>v. <em>Rootes and others </em>was an appeal from a decree of the superiour court of chancery of Fredericksburg, which was decided in December 1828. There were only three judges present at the <em>hearing\u2014Cabell, Coalter </em>and <em>Carr. </em>The following is a copy of the decree :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At8\"><em>\"A </em>majority of the court is of opinion, that the plaintiffs claiming under the deed from <em>Rootes </em>senior to Fox, dated the 1st March 1821, are purchasers for valuable consideration, and as such, within, the protection of that part of our statute of frauds, which is substantially taken from 27 <em>EYiz. </em>ch. 4. \u2018They have, therefore, an undoubted right to apply to a court of equity for the purpose of removing out of their way, any obstruction to the fair and just enforcement of their incumbrance. With respect to the deed executed by <em>Thomas Rooies </em>senior to his son <em>Thomas </em>Rootes, bearing date the 18th February 1813, purporting to convey to his son the <em>Gouldhill </em>tract of land in the proceedings mentioned, and which deed it is the object of the bill to set aside, it appears to a majority of the court, 1. that this was a voluntary deed; 2. that it was not recorded until eight years after its date; 3. that, during all the intervening time, the existence of the deed was carefully concealed from the world; the grantor remained in full possession of the land from the year 1817, and exercised over it every act of ownership, with the knowledge and assent of the grantee. A majority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the court is, therefore, of opinion, that as to the purchasers under the deed to <em>Fox, </em>and the decree creditors, also parties to this suit, the said deed of 1813, is fraudulent and void. With respect to the priorities between the purchasers under <em>Fox\u2019s </em>deed, and the decree creditors, the court is of opi nion, that all these creditors take precedence of the purchasers: <em>Baylor\u2019s </em>\u25a0creditors, 1. on the ground of actual notice; and 2. <em>because at the date of the deed to Fox, the lien of their decrees was in full force: Dunlop, </em>because though it does not appear, that he had taken out execution within the year, yet as his decree is stated in <em>Fox\u2019s </em>deed as an existing debt, and provision therein made for its payment, those claiming under that deed are purchasers with full notice of the decree, and cannot be received, especially in equity, to contest its priority nf lien. As to the decree creditors before the court, it appears that they are, 1st, <em>Dunlop, </em>who obtained a decree in 1818; and 2ndly, <em>Baylor\u2019s </em>creditors, namely <em>Martirds ex\u2019ors, Graves, Hoomes, Giiy, Jones\u2019s ex\u2019ors, Taliaferro, Chiles\u2019s adm\u2019r, Pemberton </em>and <em>Tenant </em>(these nine being represented by Battaile), also <em>Catlett, Davis, Grinnan, Green </em>and <em>Patton, </em>all of whom obtained decrees in the same suit in 1820. A majority of the court is of opinion, that as between these two classes of creditors, <em>Dunlop </em>has priority; though it has been decided, that a judgement creditor, who has suffered the year to elapse without taking out execution, cannot afterwards overreach in equity, a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser of the debtor\u2019s land (such purchase being made after the year), yet this applies, neither in terms nor in principle, to a subsequent judgement creditor, who has not laid out his money on the land, nor trusted the debtor on that fund, but on his general credit; and the same majority considers it a settled rule, that when, in equity, the question is as to the priority of judgement creditors, they are ranked according to the date of their judgements, without inquiring, as between them, whether such judgements have been kept alive by process; the capacity to renew by <em>scire facias </em>being, in such case, considered in that <em>forum </em>as sufficient proof of the lien; provided it appears, that these judge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>ments are still due. Cinder this rule, the majority of the court think, that <em>Dunlop </em>must be first satisfied; next <em>Baylor's </em>creditors, <em>pari passu. It appears, that most of these creditors have issued writs of </em>ca. sa. <em>on one of their </em>instalments, <em>which have been served on </em>Rootes, <em>and under which he has taken the benefit of the insolvent debtor's oath. It is the opinion of a majority of the </em>court, <em>that this proceeding </em>cannot, <em>in a court of </em>equity, <em>postpone these creditors, as to that </em>instalment, <em>to the purchasers under </em>Fox\u2019s <em>deed; because that deed being made, for the security both of the purchasers and those creditors, whatever effort the latter made to procure from another source, satisfaction of their decrees, was an effort to assist and benefit the purchasers, by lessening the amount for which their security was liable. </em>As it does not appear with certainty, what has been made under the executions of <em>Baylor s </em>creditors, and what are the balances due them, the chancellor very properly referred this matter to a commissioner, and also correctly ordered, that in the meantime <em>Gouldhill </em>should be sold, and the proceeds held subject to the future disposition of the court. It is the opinion of a majority of the court, that whatever of this fund shall remain after satisfying the decree creditors aforesaid, shall be applied in the order directed by <em>Fox's </em>deed, to the payment of the purchasers under that deed; and should there s1 ill be a surplus, it is not the intention of the court, by any thing in this opinion or decree, to affect the disposition thereof. The court says nothing in this opinion and decree, on the subject of the deed of 1813, conveying the slaves from <em>Rootes senior </em>to <em>Rootes junior, </em>or as to the disposition of said slaves, because it does not consider that subject to be before it; nor is it intended by this decree, to decide at all as to the validity or character of the deeds, from <em>Rootes senior </em>to <em>Vrosser. </em>Therefore, it is decreed and ordered, that so much of the decree aforesaid as conflicts with the foregoing opinion, be reversed and annulled, and the residue thereof affirmed &amp;c. And it is ordered, that the cause be remanded to the said court of chancery to be further proceeded in according to the principles of this decree.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AAPz\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"APGj\">The principal argument relied on by the counsel for the appellants, was, that when the deeds of trust were executed, the property was subject to the lien of the judgement recovered by <em>Rogers fy brothers </em>against Imub, and passed, thus incumbered, to the trustee, <em>Marshall; </em>and that the subsequent issuing of the <em>ca. sa. </em>upon the judgement, and the service thereof upon <em>Lane, </em>did not affect the lien of the judgement: for, though it was admitted that the issuing of the <em>ca. sa. </em>and taking the body of the debtor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>execution, would, at common law, have destroyed the lien of the judgement, which springs from the capacity of the creditor to take out an <em>elegit, </em>it was contended, that the provisions of our law of executions changed all this, by making a <em>ca. sa. wjien levied, </em>a lien on the whole estate of the <em>debtor, </em>real and personal. The judgement, it was said, bound half of the land to the moment of levying the <em>ca. sa.; </em>and how, it was asked, could that destroy the lien on the <em>half, </em>which gave to the same party a lien on the <em>whole % </em>It is, certainly, the rule of the common law, that if the debtor\u2019s body be taken on a <em>ca. sa. </em>it is a satisfaction of the debt, and the creditor can have no other execution, and especially he cannot have an <em>elegit. </em>The few exceptions to this rule, as was justly said by counsel in the argument of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Heiskhell, </em>\u201c are founded on after circumstances, which defeat the effect of the process, and disappoint the creditor of that satisfaction, which the law supposes such process to afford; as rescue, escape, or death of the debtor in execution.\u201d The authorities for this doctrine are cited in that case. In that case, too, the judge\u00e1 who were inclined to give the <em>ca. sa. </em>lien the greatest extent (and whose opinions for going so far, have been since overruled, <em>Foreman v. Loyd, </em>2 Leigh 284.) admitted, that no creditor, after taking out a <em>ca. sa. </em>and getting it executed, could stand upon the lien of the judgement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The appellants\u2019 counsel relied upon the decision in the case of <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Rootes; </em>on that point in the case, where the court, in comparing the liens of the creditors under the decree, and the purchasers under the deed of trust, did not consider the deed as destroying the lien of the decree creditors, though they had sued out writs of <em>ca. sa. </em>on their decree, on which, the debtor\u2019s body bad been taken in execution, and he was discharged on taking the oath of insolvency under the act for the relief of insolvent debtors. It might be a sufficient answer to that case, to say that, according to the rule of this court, it is not authority; being the decision of a majority only of a court of three judges: but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>in justice to my brethren, with whom I sat and from whom I differed as to that point, I must observe, that they by no means intended to lay down this as general doctrine, but simply as the result of the peculiar circumstances of that case. This is apparent from the language of the decree, which is as follows : \u201c It appears, that most of these creditors [the creditors by decree] have issued writs of <em>ca. sa. </em>on one of their instalments, which have been served on <em>Rootes, </em>and under which he has taken the benefit of the insolvent debtor\u2019s act. It is the opinion of a <em>majority </em>of the court, that this proceeding cannot, <em>in a court of equity, </em>postpone these creditors as to that instalment, to the purchasers under <em>Fox\u2019s </em>deed; <em>because that deed being made for the security both of the purchasers and these creditors, whatever effort the latter made to procure from another source, satisfaction of their decree, was an effort to assist and benefit the purchasers, by lessening the amount for ivhich their security was liable.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Another objection to the decree was, that it dismissed the bill of the plaintiffs as to the appellees, instead of keeping those parties in court, and superintending the sale of the mortgaged subject, and distribution of the proceeds, so that, in case of any surplus, it might have been applied to the judgement of these plaintiffs. The answer is, that the bill had no such object; it was brought simply to remove these deeds out of the plaintiffs\u2019 way as fraudulent. It is too, apparent enough, that the fund was utterly inadequate to the satisfaction of the prior liens; and the knowledge of this, was probably the reason, why the plaintiffs preferred to take an appeal from the decree immediately, instead of asking the court to take management of the fund, and give them any surplus which might remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">I think the decree must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b457-7\">Cabell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQY\">I have been always surprized to hoar the case of <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Rootes </em>referred to as authority; at least, as to those points which received the sanction of two only of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the three judges who sat in the case. This court consists of five judges; and although three of them, being a majority, constitute a court competent to decide any case which may be brought before it, yet a point decided on the opinion of two only of the three judges so constituting a court, is never regarded as authority; such opinion decides the case as between the parties, but does not settle the law of the land. In consequence of this well established principle, the case of <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Rootes, </em>though most elaborately and ably argued at the bar, and most gravely considered by the court, was directed not to be reported ; and such was the diversity of opinion among the judges, the majority consisting on some points of one set of judges and on others of another, that they determined not even to deliver their opinions in court, but simply to embody in the decree, the points, on which the court, or a majority, were found to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\">That case has been referred to in the argument of this, as establishing the general principle, that a person obtaining a judgement, and having a <em>ca. sa. </em>levied on the body of his debtor, who is duly discharged under the insolvent law, still has the benefit of the lien of his judgement, so as to overreach an incumbrance created by the debtor between the date of the judgement and the levy of the execution. I sat in <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Rootes, </em>and was one of \u201c the majority of the court, who thought that, <em>under the circumstances of the case, </em>the creditor by decree, who had resorted to the <em>ca. sa. </em>and had pursued bis debtor to insolvency, did not lose the lien of his prior decreeand I well remember, that I came to that opinion, not as the result of any general principle, but as the result of the particular circumstances of the case. Indeed, this is manifest from the language of the decree itself, as has been shewn by my brother <em>Carr. </em>Whether the circumstances relied on by the majority of the court, justified their opinion on that point, it is not material to inquire, there being no such circumstances in the case now before us. \u25a0 We have now nothing to decide but the general principle ; and I am clearly of opinion, as I was when I decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>Fox </em>v. <em>Rootes, </em>that, in the absence of particular circumstances, a creditor who resorts to his <em>ca. sa. </em>and pursues his debtor until he is discharged under the insolvent act, loses the lien of his decree or judgement; that particular lien being merged in the superiour lien of the <em>ca. sa. executed, </em>and being forever discharged by the <em>ca. sa. </em>having had its full effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">I, therefore, think the decree before us was right, as to the main point in the cause. And I concur with judge <em>Carr, </em>for the reasons given by him, as to the propriety of the dis-mission of the bill. If there is really any probability that a surplus will remain after the satisfaction of the creditors under the deeds of trust, the appellants will be at liberty, notwithstanding the dismission of this bill, to institute a new suit for the purpose of reaching it. I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b459-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AZ8\">I concur with my brethren on the main point; but I am of opinion that the decree is erroneous in dismissing the hill as to the appellees; because, though they have preference, yet this being, in effect, a bill by a judgement creditor to redeem prior incumbrances, they should be a party to the decree. To sell an equity of redemption at public auction, subject to a deed of trust, the amount due upon which cannot be known, as the original debt may have been reduced by payments, is inadmissible. Whoever purchases must purchase at hazard, and of course the sale must always be a sacrifice; ruinous to the mortgagor, or perhaps to other creditors. In such cases, it is therefore always proper that the junior incumbrancer should convene all the prior incumbrancers before the court. Gilm. 133. There is a further reason, I think : as a general rule, sales ought not to be made where the legal title does not pass by the sale. Purchasers of equities always purchase at risque, and sales at risque always tend to sacrifices. To decree a sale at risque would seem, indeed, at variance with the principles of the court, though I will not say no case can occur in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>which it would be permitted. My opinion is that the decree should be reversed, with the intimation however of the opinion of this court, that the <em>cestuis que trust </em>creditors have a preferable right to payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
