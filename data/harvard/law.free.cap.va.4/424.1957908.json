The deed to the latter was dated on the 20th <em>October </em>following, and attested in like manner.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-19\">Mr. Wirt, the counsel for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfP\">stated, that the name of the <em>third </em>witness to each deed was subscribed yesterday, which, as it does not appear, he thought it was his duty to state, and he observed that whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>might be the fate of the deed to <em>Jennings, </em>yet as the deed <em>to Robinson </em>bore dat\u00e9 within eight months last past, and might be proved or acknowledged within that time, he presumed it was a valid deed, as it would have rela' tion back, upon either of those events.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b441-7\">\n<em>By the Chancellor.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Acx\">The deed to <em>Jennings </em>is clearly void as to creditors, and as to subsequent purchasers for <em>a </em>valuable consideration without notice, as it was not recorded in the time and manner prescribed by <em>law; </em>and so this Court said in the case of <em>Moore\u2019s Executors </em>against <em>The Auditor, </em>3 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>M. </em>p. 232. This Court determined, in that case, that all deeds of trust and mortgages of slaves or other personal estate, not provedpby <em>three </em>witnesses, or acknowledged and recorded as prescribed by law, were void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration without notice thereof. This case went to the Court of Appeals, and, in October, 1808, was affirmed. The deed to <em>Robinson </em>can only be considered as a valid deed as to creditors, from the time the third witness subscribed his name to it on yesterday, and therefore creditors and subsequent purchasers without notice, for valuable consideration before that day, cannot be affected thereby. But again, this is a proper case at law, and this Court should not interpose at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Motion for the injunction denied\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
