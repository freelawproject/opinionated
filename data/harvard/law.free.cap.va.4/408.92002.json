In case he should die without a son and not sell the land, I give the land to my son <em>George; </em>and if he should die under age, then the land to be sold by <em>John Herbert; </em>and divide the money among all my children then alive or their children that may be alive at that time.\u201d The plantation on which the testator lived, was the land now in controversy. <em>George Cooper, </em>the lessor of the plaintiff, was the testator\u2019s son <em>George, </em>mentioned in the devise, who claimed the land under the limitation over to him therein contained. The testator\u2019s son <em>William, </em>to whom the land was devised in the first instance, attained to full age, married, and died leaving issue one daughter, but without leaving or ever having had a son, and without having sold the land. <em>Melson, </em>the defendant, claimed under <em>William Cooper. </em>The question referred to the court, was, Whether, upon this state of facts, <em>George Cooper, </em>the lessor of the plaintiff, was entitled to the land ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-10\">The circuit court held that he was, and gave him judgement accordingly; from which <em>Melson </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2E\">insisted. 1. that, even throwing out of view the unlimited right clearly given to <em>William </em>the first taker, to sell the land, the devise to him and his heirs, and if he should die without a son, then over, would have given him an estate tail, which the statute for abolishing entails would have converted into a fee simple, and barred the contingent remainder to <em>George: </em>he cited <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>1 Burr. 38. 3 Bro. P. C. (Tomlin\u2019s edi.) 180. S. C. and <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>1 Rolls\u2019s Abr. 837. pl. 12. But 2. he said, here was a manifest intent to give <em>William, </em>the first taker, an unlimited and absolute right to sell the land, when, how, and to whom he pleased; he might have sold the fee simple ; and, therefore, he took the fee simple by the devise, and though he did not sell, he died seized of the fee simple. Upon this point, he cited <em>Riddick </em>v. <em>Cohoon, </em>4 Rand. 547.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-5\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1I\">admitted that the case of <em>Riddick </em>v. <em>Cohoon </em>was in point and conclusive, unless a distinction could be made between a bequest of <em>personal </em>property with a general power to sell it at pleasure, which was the case there, and a devise of <em>real </em>estate, with a general power to the devisee to sell it, which was the present case; and he confessed he could see no ground on which he could maintain such a distinction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-6\">Cars, and Cabem,, <em>J. </em>founding their judgement on the last point (as the reporter understood) that a general absolute unlimited power to sell the land, was plainly given to <em>William Cooper </em>by the devise, held, that he took a fee simple, and therefore that the judgement was erroneous.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-7\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"Aij\">doubted on both points, and, upon the whole, inclined to the opinion, that the judgement of the circuit court was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Judgement reversed, and judgement entered for the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
