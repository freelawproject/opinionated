This paper commenced, \u201cThis Indenture,\u201d <em>&amp;c., </em>and was signed by <em>James Ayres, </em>with a scroll affixed to his name, but the scroll was not recognized as a seal either in the body of the instrument or in the attestation clause. The paper, however, had been acknowledged by <em>James Ayres </em>as his deed before the County Court of <em>Bedford, </em>and by order of the Court had been admitted to record. The Court excluded the paper, and the defendant <em>excepted; </em>and then there was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs ; whereupon, the defendant applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-9\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqn\">referred to 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99, \u00a7 1, p. <em>361; </em>Id. ch. 128, \u00a7 94, p. <em>510; Currie v. Donald, </em>2 Wash. 58. And he insisted that the instrument commencing \u201c This Indenture,\u201d \u00abfcc. and conveying land, of itself shewed that the scroll affixed to the name of the grantor, was intended as a seal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-11\">He insisted further, that the instrument having been acknowledged by the grantor in Court as his deed, that was a recognition of the scroll as a seal. <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Hewlett, </em>9 Leigh 511.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>No counsel for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b304-4\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AL8\">delivered the opinion.of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The Court is of opinion, that as a valid conveyance of land could only be made by an instrument under seal, and as the statute authorized a conveyance to be recorded on the acknowledgment of the party in Court, and it furthermore appearing that this instrument was acknowledged by the grantor in Court as his deed, such acknowledgment is a sufficient recognition of the scroll as a seal. The Court is therefore of opinion, that the Circuit Court erred in rejecting the instrument in the bill of exceptions mentioned, offered to be read in evidence as the deed of <em>James </em>Ayres, from going to the jury. The judgment is therefore reversed with costs, the verdict and judgment is set aside, and the cause remanded for a new trial, on which said deed is to be admitted in evidence if again offered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
