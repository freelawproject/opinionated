Preston </em>against \u00b0 . <em>John Preston, </em>to compel contribution to the satisfaction of a debt for which they were the sureties of <em>William P. Floyd. </em>The facts are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-8\">In September 1841, <em>James Rhea </em>recovered a judgment against <em>William P. Floyd, John B. Floyd, </em>and <em>John Preston, </em>on a bond for 1000 dollars ; and in April 1842 he recovered a judgment on the same bond against <em>Thomas L. Preston. William P. Floyd </em>was the principal in this bond, and the other parties were his sureties. On the first judgment an execution was issued, which was levied on the property of <em>John B. Floyd; </em>and he thereupon executed a forthcoming bond with <em>Thomas L. Preston </em>as his security. An execution afterwards issued against <em>John B. Floyd </em>and <em>Thomas L. Preston </em>on the forthcoming bond ; and at the same time a separate execution was issued against <em>Thomas L. Preston </em>on the separate judgment recovered against him. Both <em>William P. Floyd </em>and <em>John B. Floyd </em>had then become insolvent j and <em>Thomas L. Preston </em>paid off the debt; paying the principal and interest of the debt on the separate execution against himself, and the costs of the forthcoming bond and the execution thereon, on the execution against <em>John B. Floyd </em>and himself. He then filed this bill against <em>John Preston </em>for contribution ; who objected that he had been released by the plaintiff\u2019s joining in the forthcoming bond <em>; </em>and especially, as by his so doing the property of <em>John B. </em>Floyd, which had been levied on, had thereby been released. And he charged, that by agreement between <em>William P. Floyd </em>and <em>John B., </em>the latter had undertaken to pay the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>When the cause came on to be heard the Court dismissed the bill; and the plaintiff thereupon applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A63\"><em>B. R. Johnston, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ABj\">\u201e ,, Sheffey, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b110-10\">Allen, <em>J</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">The Court is of opinion, that by the principles of equity, the right accrues to one security having paid the debt of the principal, in the event of the insolvency of the principal, to receive contribution from the other securities ; and where all the sureties are solvent each surety is liable for his share of the sum so advanced and paid to relieve them from a common burthen. The Court is further of opinion, that there is no evidence of any contract or obligation on the part of <em>John B. Floyd, </em>one of the sureties, to pay the debt in exoneration of his <em>cosecurities; </em>and if when the execution was levied on the property of said <em>John B. Floyd, </em>he had paid the debt instead of giving a forthcoming bond, he would have been entitled to receive contribution from the other sureties. And as the forthcoming bond was executed by said <em>John B. Floyd </em>and one of the cosecurities, against whom judgment had not been obtained, and no new party was introduced, the execution and forfeiture of said bond alone, in the absence of any other circumstance affecting the liability of the parties, could not of itself operate so as to destroy the right of the security for the original principal, having paid the debt, to call for contribution <em>; </em>although such security was also a security in the forthcoming bond. And whether the security who so paid the debt elected to pay the same on the judgment against himself for the original debt, or on the judgment on the forthcoming bond, the substance of the transaction, as it respects the original debt and the legal costs incurred in the discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>thereof, was the same, the relieving of the cosecurities from a burthen resting on all, and from which neither had been exonerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The Court is further of opinion, that where a security seeks for the application of a rule growing out of the general principles of equity, and not affected by any specific contract of the parties, the relief given should be regulated by the circumstances of the case ; that though if one security is insolvent, his share, as a general rule, should be apportioned amongst the solvent sureties, in this case the appellant is not entitled to charge his solvent cosecurity with a moiety of the share of the said <em>John B. </em>Floyd, alleged to be insolvent; for as it appears that the execution which issued on the first judgment was levied on the property of said <em>John B. Floyd, </em>if no forthcoming bond had been executed the proportion of the said <em>John B. Floyd </em>would have been made out of his property. Justice between the securities required that the remaining two should have paid their proportions, leaving the property of said <em>John B. Floyd </em>liable for his. By uniting with said <em>Floyd </em>in the forthcoming bond, the appellant disturbed the relation which then existed between the sureties, so far as to enable the said <em>Floyd </em>to withdraw from the lien of the execution the property which had been levied upon ; and if in consequence of the subsequent insolvency of said <em>Floyd, </em>he is unable to contribute his proportion, the loss occasioned thereby should not be borne by the cosecurity who did not join in the forthcoming bond, but was merely passive. The Court is further of opinion, that the cosecurity, <em>John Preston, </em>is not responsible for the costs in awarding execution on the forthcoming bond, as that was given for the benefit of the said <em>John B. Floyd, </em>alone ; and for such costs the appellant was entitled to an immediate decree against said <em>John B. Floyd. </em>But the Court is of opinion, that the appellant was entitled to a decree against the principal debtor for the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>amount paid by him, with interest, except the costs of awarding the judgment- on' the forthcoming bond ; and in the event said decree should prove unavailing, then to a decree against said <em>John Preston, </em>for one third of amount \u00b0f the sum so decreed against said <em>William P. </em>Floyd, the principal, or any residue remaining unsatisfied ; and to a decree against said <em>John B. Floyd </em>for the remaining third of the amount decreed against said <em>William P. Floyd, </em>or any balance which remained unsatisfied!.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that said decree was erroneous, and the same is reversed with <em>costs\u201cj/and </em>the cause is remanded, with instructions to render a decree in favour of the plaintiff against said <em>William P. Floyd for the amount </em>paid by <em>the </em>appellant on account of said judgments in the bill and proceedings mentioned, deducting therefrom the costs of the award of execution on the forthcoming bond, and a second commission, should the same be included in the sum paid by the <em>appellant; </em>and also a decree against said <em>John B. Floyd, </em>for the costs of the judgment on the forthcoming bond, and such second commission if included in the amount of the receipts. And to retain the case, with leave to the appellant to apply to the Court for decrees against said <em>John Preston </em>and <em>John B. Floyd </em>respectively, for their parts <em>of the </em>decree against their common principal, <em>William P. Floyd, </em>in the event of the decree against him proving unavailing, or for one third of so much thereof as may not be collected from said <em>William P. Floyd, </em>according to the principles aforesaid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
