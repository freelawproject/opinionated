The governor commissioned twelve of these, and declined to commission the others. A portion of those commissioned, applied to the County Court to be permitted to take the oaths prescribed by law in open Court, but the Court refused the motion. They afterwards took the oaths before a justice of the peace of the county in the courthouse on a Court day, and then presented the certificates of the justice of their due qualification, and moved the Court to direct the clerk to enter the certificates of record, and that they might be admitted to act as justices. This motion the Court overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-8\">The persons who had thus applied to the County Court, then applied to the Judge of the Circuit Court for a <em>mandamus </em>to the justices of the County Court, to compel them to record the certificate of the qualification of the petitioners before the justice, and to admit them to act as justices. The <em>mandamus </em>was issued; and a majority of the justices of the county returned in answer thereto:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-9\">1st. That the governor had no authority to commission a portion of the persons recommended, and to refuse to commission the others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Axy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>2d. That it was not competent for the persons commissioned, to take the oaths of office before a justice of the peace, but that it must be done in open Court. And therefore they were justified in refusing to admit the certificates \u00b0f the justice to record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQW\">The petitioners objected to the return as insufficient, and the Circuit Court sustained the objection, and directed a peremptory <em>mandamus </em>to the justices of <em>Frederick, </em>to admit to record the certificates of the justice that the petitioners had taken the oaths of office before him ; and further, to allow them to take their seats on the bench of said County Court as constituent members thereof. The justices having excepted to the opinion of the Court, applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-6\"><em>Cooke, for </em>the appellant, insisted :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-7\">1st.
