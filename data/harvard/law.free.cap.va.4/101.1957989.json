Hi. current money <em>; that </em>though the said conveyance was absolute, it was enly meant and intended to operate by way of mortgage for the said sum of money, which was a debt due from the complainant to the said Sadler, payable on the 7th of March, 1791; <em>that Sadler, </em>at the time when the deed was delivered, executed and delivered to the complainant a difeasance, whereby he agreed, that on payment by the complainant of the said sum of money on or before the 1 <em>J </em>7th of March, 1791, the right of <em>Sadler </em>to the slaves should cease ; that it was understood and agreed that the complainant should keep possession thereof, paying interest on the money, for which, on the 10th of March, 1788, and the 10th of March, 1789, he executed a wriling, promising to <em>pay </em>the said <em>Sadler </em>the sum of 6/. <em>6s. \u20acd. </em>which, though it was expressed to be for the hire of the said slaves, was meant and agreed to be for interest on the said debt: that the complainant continued possessed of the said slaves till about the 8th of December, 1789, when he being some short time absent from home on nc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>cessary business, <em>Sadler took </em>out an attachment against him as an absconding debtor, which was levied on the said slaves and a child, the increase of one of them, and obtained a judgment for the sum of <em>1391. 4s. </em>that thereupon the slaves attached were sold by the sheriff on the 13th of May, 1790, and the whole were purchased for 159/. by <em>Sadler </em>himself, who took them into possession, and held them (except one whom he sold) until his death, which happened about the year 1793. The prayer of the bill was, that the complainant be permitted to redeem the slaves by paying whatever balance should be found due from him oh a settlement; that <em>Sadler\u2019s </em>estate be charged with the price of the slave sold by him, and with the hire of the other slaves since he took possession, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-8\">The joint and several answers of the defendants admitted the complainant to have been indebted to their testator when the deed of <em>March </em>7th, 1788, was executed ; but insisted, that the said deed, being absolute, amounted at law, and in equity, to a positive transfer of the slaves, and that the paper, called by the complainant a defeasance, did not convert the said bill of sale into a mortgage, but only secured to him the privilege of repurchasing them. The defendants believed it to be true that he remained in possession thereof, until about the time when he absconded ; but neither knew, nor had any reason to believe, that any agreement was made between the said <em>Sadler </em>and him, that he should retain them, paying interest annually on any sum supposed to be due. They denied the attachment to have been unfairly obtained, averring the proceedings thereon were fair and just; that when it was issued, the complainant, being in embarrassed circumstances, was actually absconding, (leaving to his creditors no prospect of being ever paid,) and, with his family and property, and all the said slaves, (except a woman and three children,) was on board a vessel in <em>White\u2019s </em>Creek, about seven or eight miles below his former place of residence, privately removing from this Commonwealth ; at which place a for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>t\u00fanate calm taking place, the Sheriff was enabled to levy the <em>attachment; </em>that, at the sale of the slaves, which was made by the Sheriff, after public notice duly given, <em>Sadder </em>purchased only a woman and three children, at 60/. the Sheriff himself bought another woman and child, and afterwards sold them to <em>St dler ; </em>that the negro, said in the bill to have been sold by Sadler, was bought by a certain <em>Mordecai </em>Gregory, and was never in <em>Sadler\u2019s </em>possession. The respondents were informed and believed, that the complainant instructed the Sheriff to pay the surplus money resulting from the sale, (which exceeded the amount of the judgment,) to a certain\u2014\u2014 <em>Lowry, </em>to whom the complainant was indebted <em>; </em>and concluded with insisting; on the title <em>of Sadler </em>to the slaves so purchased as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-4\">Two witnesses fully supported the allegations in the answers relative to the complainant\u2019s being actually abscond - ing when the attachment was levied ; and no depositions on his part appeared in the record.

The original contract, was not a mortgage, but a conditional sale. No attempt has been made to shew any acknowledgment by Sadler, that it was intended as a mortgage. No agreement is proved but that in writing; in which there is no covenant for repayment of the money, but only that <em>Green </em>might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>reliase </em>the slaves within three years. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Turner</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is not so strong as this case ; for <em>there </em>the writing mentioned that the negro vvas put into <em>Turner\u2019s </em>hands \u201c <em>as security </em>but no sue\u2019&gt; words, nor any equivalent, were used here. If it was a conditional sale, <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Davenport</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>puts an end to the question : for, in such case, the person wishing to avail himself of the privilege oi repurchasing, mast pay punctually to the day, and cannot redeem after the time has elapsed.

Whether it was a conditional sale or mortgage, the purchase hy <em>Sadler </em>under die execution, vested in him a new and absolute right. The issuing of the attachment was produced by the conduct of the appellee himself; and he must ansvfer for all the consequences in the same manner as if the sale had been bv his own consent. The case of <em>Moore's Executor </em>v. <em>Aylett\u2019s </em>Executor<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> shews that the surplus only ought to be paid, where the sale by the <em>martgagee </em>is with the consent of the <em>mor</em>tgagor.

Blakey<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> vested in them an absolute title. I admit that <em>five </em>or even <em>ten </em>years\u2019 possession will not bar the tide of the mortgagor, where the mortgagee holds <em>as mortgagee : </em>but <em>Sadler </em>held by virtue of his purchase of the Sheriff in <em>May, </em>1790, and not as mortgagee'. His possession was therefore <em>adverse, </em>and his title good by length of time.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-6\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APTC\">If this was not a mortgage, I know not in what terms a mortgage can be defined. It is true there was a bill of sale, but there was also a cotetnporaneous defeasance ; and its being on a <em>different-, </em>instead of the <em>same </em>piece of paper, makes no difference. If the defeasance had been incorporated with the bill of sale, no doubt could have been entertained. What is it that con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>stitutes a mortgage but the reservation of a right to redeem, or repurchase, the property by payment of the money <em>i </em>The person who sells the negroes in this case <em>remained in </em>possession, always, having power to redeem. The interest of the money, and the nominal hire of the slaves, agree exactly. This is conclusive, to shew that a <em>loan </em>only was in contemplation. In <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Norvell</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>possession passed with the deed, and hire was paid ; yet it was decided to be a mortgage. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Wheeler</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is up to the same point. In that case, though the parties, \u201c through fear of a Chancery suit,\u201d would not make it a mortgage, the Court decided it to be one. No attempt of the parties can defeat the justice of a Court of Equity, which will always give the mortgagor relief, wherever the real object of the contract was a <em>loam. </em>No argument can be drawn from the absence of a covenant to pay the money. In <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Novell, </em>there was no such covenant. In <em>Chapman </em>v. Turner, the object was a <em>purchase ; </em>and testimony of this contravened the natural effect of the writing. It is said, 2 <em>Call, </em>429. that the <em>special circumstances </em>of that case determined it to be a conditional sale ; and that the great <em>desideratum </em>in all such cases is to ascertain whether the object was a <em>purchase, </em>or a <em>loam </em>Certainly, if there was any doubt here, the proceedings at law are conclusive in our favour on this point. <em>SadleCs </em>own attachment considered it as a <em>debt, </em>and demanded it as such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvW\">As our right is purely <em>equitable, </em>we cannot be barred by any proceedings <em>at law. </em>The sale under the execution was long before the period for redemption had passed. The sale, therefore, did not take away the right to redeem. It is true the money was raised by it before the time allowed ; but justice has not been done. <em>Sadler </em>should be considered as a trustee for <em>Green </em>for so much as the value of the slaves exceeded the debt and inerest j and, according <em>to Whichcote v. Laurence,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Walker,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a trustee having a right to <em>sell, yet purchases, </em>clothed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the original trust. In <em>Newby's Administrator </em>v. <em>Blakey,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>there was <em>no trust, no equity. </em>The act of limitations is not <em>pleaded, </em>as it must be when relied upon in a Court of <em>Equity ; </em>neither does it appear at what time this bill was filed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-9\"><em>Hay, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3Fc\">Whether this was a mortgage or conditional sale, must depend on the words of the written contract, and the circumstances in evidence. In the contract, it is expressly declared to be <em>a. purchase ; </em>and privilege is given to <em>repurchase, </em>without saying any thing about security for a <em>debt. </em>On the face of the papers, then, it is a conditional sale. I admit that, in many cases, contracts, <em>appearing </em>to be conditional sales, have been decided to be mortgages; the only question being what is the real intention of the parties. But \u00abhere, <em>in terms, </em>a contract is a conditional sale, it is incumbent on the party, who contends it is a mortgage, to shew it by evidence. In this case, there is not one deposition shewing the. contract to be different from what it appears on its face. There is no reciprocity on this subject. The parties stand on very unequal terms. If all the negroes had died, <em>Sadler </em>could not have come before a Court of Equity, contending that his bill of sale was a mortgage, and have claimed his debt out of other property. The evidence, therefore, which <em>Green </em>should be required to produce to prove it a <em>mortgage, </em>ought to be strong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-10\">As to the circumstances, independent of the face of the written contract, (which, according to <em>2 Call, 429. </em>we have a right to examine,) the inequality between the value of six negroes and 126/. 11 .?&gt; for which they were sold, is relied on ; but this inequality does not appear in the record. There is no proof of the ages or values of the slaves. Mr. <em>Wickham </em>relies on <em>Sadler's </em>having sued out an attachment, as conclusive evidence that the original contract was a <em>mortgage. </em>Perhaps <em>Sadler </em>was improperly advised. If a purchaser, and not a creditor by mortgage, his proper re* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>mecly was by writ of <em>ne exeat: </em>but it was a desperate case,, a case of necessity ; and his counsel probably thought the shortest cat the best. However, as this act of <em>Sadler </em>was long subsequent to the contract, and induced by necessity, it ought not to be considered as evidence of the true construction of that contract. The time that elapsed between the dates of the bonds given for hire, and the date of the original contract, shews it was not understood erf <em>that timet </em>that <em>Green </em>was to retain the possession. The bonds were given annually. The inference is, that a subsequent agreement for the hire of the slaves took place. 1'he coincidence, between the amount of the hire, and the amount of the interest on the consideration money, is admitted. But where is the evidence that the hire was <em>inadequate ?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-8\"><em>Green </em>was a fraudulent character who attempted to carry away property, to which <em>Sadler was </em>entitled, whether it were by a mortgage, or by a conditional sale. Such a person is not entitled to presumptions in his favour.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-9\">But, admitting it was a mortgage, I contend that <em>Sadler\u2019s </em>right under the <em>execution </em>was good. Is the slave purchased by another man at the same sale <em>now </em>redeemable ? If not, whji should those purchased by <em>Sadler </em>be liable to redemption ? Mr. <em>Wickham\u2019s </em>position, that relief in equity is never barred by proceedings at law, is not true in many eases. For example, would the Court decree the specific execution of a covenant for land, in favour of a man who had been sued at law, and suffered judgment for breach of the contract ? The case here equally proves th\u00e9 position to be too general, and not universally'true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-10\">But it is said that <em>Sadler </em>was a trustee, and purchased subject to the trust. Every part of this proposition is erroneous. <em>Sadler </em>was not a <em>trustee. </em>Even if he was a mortgagee, the characters are very different. The purchase was not made under the mortgage or trust, but in a distinct right. The rule tliat a trustee purchases subject to the trust, (laid down in <em>Whichcote v. Laurence, </em>3 <em>Ves. </em>jun.740.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>applies only to trustees for the purpose of selling; and even such trusiees may purchase, being accountable for profits made by them. <em>Ibid. 750. </em>But here the <em>Sheriff, </em>and not Sadler, was the trustee for selling.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-3\">The act of limitations does apply, though not specially pleaded. I draw this inference from <em>Newby's Administrator v. Blakey. </em>The ride is, that \u201c <em>equitas sequitur legem </em>and, wherever the act cannot he availed of <em>at law, </em>without pleading, the course is the same <em>in </em>equity.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Since, then, <em>in </em>detinue, it is not necessary to plead the act, there is no reason for requiring it to be pleaded to <em>a bill in equity </em>brought for asimilar purpose, viz. to recover slaves.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b125-4\">Monday, <em>May </em>22.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AHl\"><em> </em>1 <em>Call, 8</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AYUU\"> <em>1 Wash 125.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"AK3\"> <em>1 Hen. </em>&amp; <em>Munf. 29.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"Auh\"><em> 3 Hen. </em>&amp; <em>Munf. 57</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A_t\"> l <em>Wash. 14</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"ALg\"> 2 <em>Call, 424.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b122-3\"> <em>3 Ves. </em>jun. 740.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-8\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"Ar5\"> Ibid.678.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-9\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\"> <em>S Hen. </em>&amp; <em>Munf </em>p. 57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-10\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AVO\"> <em>2 Ves. jun. 83 Edsel </em>v. <em>Buchanan.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-11\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b125-5\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"AM3\">The bill states, that <em>Green, </em>being indebted to <em>Sadler, </em>on the 7th of March, 1788, executed a deed to him for six negroes, to secure the payment of the debt, and that <em>Sadler </em>executed at the same time a defeasance, whereby he agreed that, on payment of 126/. 11s. (the debt before mentioned,) in three years, the right of <em>Sadler </em>to the slaves should cease. That <em>Green </em>was <em>to </em>keep possession of the slaves, paying interest on his debt, for which <em>Green </em>at different times gave his notes, under the name of hire, for the slaves. That <em>Green </em>being absent from his home for a short time on business, in <em>December, </em>1789, <em>Sadler </em>took out an attachment against his estate, which was levied on these negroes ; judgment in the attachment suit was obtained against Green, and the slaves sold under an execution issued upon that judgment; and that they were all purchased by Sadler, for <em>1591. </em>The object of the bill is to set aside the sale, and redeem the negroes.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The defendants admit that <em>Green </em>was indebted to <em>Sadler </em>at the time he executed the bill of sale, which they insist was an absolute conveyance and transfer of the property both at law and in equity. They then proceed to state, by way of defensive allegation, that Green, before suing out the attachment, had absolutely absconded, and was on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>board a vessel with the negroes, and other effects, six miles from his home, when he was overtaken by the Deputy Sheriff, in a calm, who levied the attachment on the slaves. This fact is proved by the testimony of two witnesses ; <em>one </em>of whom (the Deputy Sheriff) says, that <em>Green, </em>after some conversation, observed that, if there had not been an unlucky calm, he should have been far enough out of reach, and thinks he said he should have been in <em>Carolina. </em>That the bill of sale given by <em>Green </em>for the negroes, was intended only as a security for his debt to <em>Sadler, </em>and not as an absolute conveyance, or even a conditional sale, is, I think, obvious, not only from the papers themselves, but from the admission in the answers, that there was a <em>previous debt </em>due <em>from Green to </em>Sadler, which distinguishes it from the case of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Turner,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and brings it within those of <em>Ross </em>v. Norvell<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> and <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Wheeler.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I consider the original transaction between the parties, therefore, merely as a mortgage ; and I hold that, if a creditor by bond, or other legal right which,he is enabled to prosecute with effect at law, obtains from bis debtor a mortgage by way of security for the same, and then prosecutes a suit at common law, and having obtained a judgment for his debt, levies the execution upon the mortgaged property, which is sold by the Sheriff, and purchased by the creditor, the <em>debtor\u2019s </em>right to redeem is not extinguished by this proceeding at law, but bis equity of redemption continues as fully and completely as before the execution was levied, or the judgment obtained. And this upon principle ; for the creditor having accepted of the security for his debt, is bound by every condition that a Court of Equity might impose upon him ; nor can he by his own act absolve himself from any such equitable obligation. The case of Lord <em>Cranstown </em>v. <em>Johnson,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is a much stronger case than the one I have put; and shews that acreditar purchasing property, sold under execution to pay his own debt, may, under circumstances, be considered as holding-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the same only as a security for his debt, and the charges he has been put to. But there are several features in this transaction which give to this particular case a very differ-<em>t </em>cut complexion- <em>Green </em>is proved to have absconded fraudulently, with his family and property, among which were all, or a considerable part of these slaves, and had actually embarked on board a vessel, and proceeded, some distance on his way to another State, or some other quarter of this State, where he could conceal himself and his property from ihe very creditor to whom he had pledged it as a security. One of the soundest maxims of equity is, \u201c that \u201c he who hath committed iniquity, shall not have equi5\u2018 ty ;\u201d<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> that is, as is explained by Fonblanjue, b. 1. c. 2. s. i3. note (p), where such person is (as in the present case) plaintiff. <em>Willingham </em>v. <em>Joyce</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is not so fslrong a case as this ; for here the present plaintiff did all in his power to defraud his creditor. The latter was driven to seek his redress at law : whether the proceedings in the cause were regular or erroneous, cannot be inquir Cil into in a collateral way. The judgment must be, taken tobe right, the sale lawful, and the purchase by the creditor the same as the purchase by any other person. The fraud of <em>Green </em>has utterly deprived him of the aid of a Court of Equity, which ought never to interpose to deprive a fair creditor, as <em>Sadler </em>was, of a legal advantage, gained in a due course of law, in consequence of a most flagrant attempt on the part of the debtor to defraud him. The stalencss of the claim, postponed till after <em>Sadler\u2019s </em>death, and barred at law by the act of limitations, furnishes additional reasons in support of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Iam, therefore, of opinion, that the decree be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<author id=\"b127-10\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AWH\">There is no doubt but that the agreement of <em>March </em>7th, 1788, taken in connection with the defeasance, and all the circumstances of the case, imported a mortgage, and not an absolute sale of the slaves in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>question. The general right of a mortgagor to redeem may be waived, however, or the party may come into Court, asserting it under circumstances so unfavourable, that the door of the Court of Equity may be shut against him. The appellee\u2019s conduct, in the case before us, partakes of this latter character, and was clearly fraudulent and iniquitous ; but I am not entirely prepared to say, that on this ground <em>alone </em>we ought to deny relief. There is one circumstance, however, which turns the scale with me, and that is, that it is neither alleged nor proved that the slaves in question were sold for less than their value, and it is also shewn that the surplus of the proceeds was applied to the benefit of the appellee by his consent and direction. I consider this, therefore, as a ratification of the sale ; and as the appellee (taking the sale to have been for <em>full </em>value) is, perhaps, substantially in the same situation as if the negroes had been sold under the mortgage and the surplus paid over to him ; I am of opinion, on these two grounds, (but principally the last,) to reverse the decree and dismiss the bill.</p>\n<author id=\"b128-3\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"A8NK\">I have not a doubt but the deed o\u00ed bill of sale for the negroes, with the defeasance under the hand and seal of Sadler, (though on a separate paper,) was intended merely to secure the debt of 126/. Us. with interest, and ought to be considered, in all respects, to have the operation of a <em>mortgage; </em>and had <em>Green </em>conducted himself with honesty and propriety, there can be no question but he Would have been entitled to his equity of redemption of the mortgaged, negroes, of which he would have been quieted in the possession, on his paying the original debt, with legal <em>interest; </em>but, when we see him fraudulently attempting to defeat not only Sadler, but his other creditors also, of their just claims against him, by endeavouring, clandestinely, to remove, as well the mortgaged negroes, as his other property, out of the reach of the law, and prevented only by the fortuitous circumstance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>of a calm, he has, in my conception, forfeited all preten\u00abion to the aid or countenance of a Court of Equity; and I do not recollect a case where the rule more forcibly apt t i \u2022 plies, than m the present, that he who comes mto a Court of Equity to ask relief, ought to shew that his own conduct has been upright, equitable, and pure. I therefore concur in opinion with the other judges, that the decree is erroneous, and ought to be reversed, and tho bill dismiss\" cd with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\"> 1 <em>Call. </em>280.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\"> 1 <em>Wash. </em>14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\"> 2 Call, 424.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b126-11\"><em> 3 Ves. </em>jun. 170.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Aos\"> Francis's <em>Max. </em>2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AMKy\"> 3 Ves. jun. 168.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
