The property was so situated, that a fair and equal division thereof could only be made by selling the mill and mill seat, and dividing the proceeds of sale among the parceners; and in a suit in chancery in the county court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>of <em>Chesterfield, </em>in which some of them were plaintiffs, and the others defendants, the county court, satisfied that a sale 0f this property was the only means of making a just division of the estate, decreed, that the mill and mill seat should be at auct\u00a1onj on a crec\u00a1\u00a1t 0f twelve months-, and that the proceeds of the sale should be divided among the parties according to the statute of descents; and appointed commissioners to make the sale and to divide the proceeds accordingly. The commissioners sold the mill and mill seat, in pursuance of the decree, and made report thereof to the court, in which it was stated, that <em>John Boast </em>was the purchaser, at the price of 610 dollars. And after twelve months had elapsed and the purchase money had become due, the court made another interlocutory order, directing the commissioners to execute a deed conveying the property to the purchaser <em>or purchasers </em>at the sale, and to make a report of their proceedings in order to a final decree. The commissioners thereupon executed a conveyance to <em>Boast, </em>the purchaser mentioned in their report of sale; and most of the heirs of <em>Covington </em>executed another deed, conveying the property to <em>Boast </em>and <em>Joseph Heywood, </em>who, as they understood, had in fact been jointly concerned with <em>Boast </em>in the purchase at the sale made by the commissioners. The deed of the commissioners to <em>Boast, </em>was tendered to him. But, in the interval between the sale made by the commissioners, and the interlocutory order of the court directing them to make a conveyance of the property, the mill dam had been swept away, and the mill house removed from its scite, by a fresh; and therefore <em>Boast </em>refused to accept the conveyance tendered to him, and complete the purchase. The commissioners made no report to the court of their proceedings under the last order; nor were any further proceedings ever had in the cause, which remained, and yet remains, in the county court, undetermined, and neglected by the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-4\">But the heirs of <em>Covington </em>exhibited their bill against <em>Boast </em>and <em>Heywaod </em>in the superiour court of chancery of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>i <em>Richmond, </em>setting forth all the proceedings in the cause in 1*7 II* 111 the county court; charging, that, though it appeared by the report of sale made by the commissioners, that the property had been sold to <em>Boast </em>alone, yet <em>Heywood </em>was in fact his partner in the purchase, jointly and equally interested therein; and praying a decree for specific execution of the contract of purchase against both, if in truth they were joint purchasers, or if <em>Boast </em>was the sole purchaser, against him alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-7\"><em>Boast </em>and <em>Heywood </em>put in a joint answer, in which they stated, that <em>Boast </em>was the sole purchaser at the commissioners\u2019 sale, and that it was <em>afterwards </em>agreed between <em>Boast </em>and <em>Heywood, </em>that the latter should be jointly and equally interested in the purchase : that they were, at the time, anxious and ready to complete the purchase immediately ; and they applied, repeatedly, both to the commissioners and to <em>Covington\u2019s </em>heirs, to make a conveyance of the title, and had deeds prepared to be executed by them, respectively, conveying the same; but neither the commissioners, nor the parties interested, paid any attention to this request, for more than twenty months, and not until the mill dam and the mill had been so injured by a fresh, that it would have required an expenditure of 500 dollars to put them in such a state of repair as to make them fit for use : and that, in consequence of the neglect of the vendors to complete the purchase on their part, by making a conveyance of the title, the vendees had never taken possession of the property, and thought themselves now exempted from any obligation to complete the purchase on their part. And, finally, they pleaded the statute of frauds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-8\">The depositions taken in the cause, left it somewhat doubtful, whether <em>Heywood </em>was originally jointly concerned with <em>Boast </em>in the purchase at the commissioners\u2019 sale, or whether <em>Boast </em>was originally the sole purchaser, and <em>Heywood </em>became jointly interested in the purchase by a subsequent verbal agreement between him and <em>Boast </em>? But upon the whole, it appeared, that, though <em>Boast </em>alone ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>peared as bidder at tbe sale, <em>Heywood </em>was, from the first, jointly interested with him in the purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-9\">The chancellor declaring that the plaintiffs were entitled to demand specific execution of the contract from both the defendants, decreed against them both, that they should pay the plaintiffs the purchase money, 610 dollars, with interest from the date when it should have been paid &amp;tc. And <em>Heywood </em>applied, by petition, to this court, for an appeal from the decree; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-10\"><em>Spooner, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5HD\">insisted, 1. That, under the circumstances of the case, the plaintiffs were not entitled to a specific execution; they having been themselves in default, in not promptly executing the contract, and in not taking any step towards the execution of it, on their part, till the property had been most materially injured, and rendered almost valueless. 2. That the vendors ought to bear the loss arising from the injury to the property by the freshes, in the interval between the sale by the commissioners and the confirmation of their report of sale by the county court. And 3. That, seeing that the suit in the court was still pending there and undetermined, and involved the whole subject in controversy, the superiour court of chancery could not properly entertain this bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-11\">There was no counsel for the appellees.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b400-12\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AOz\">If the mill and mill dam were materially injured by freshes, after the sale and before the report of sale was. confirmed, I should think, upon the authorities, that yfne Ip s^sf\u00edp uTd%)t fall upon the vendee, provided there was * 'rntf'fault inTSa\u00edf. In <em>Davy </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>2 Atk. 489. <em>Blount v. Blount, 3 Id., 636-8. </em>it was held, that a purchaser must /\u2019 *p\u00e1y \u00cdBi\u00c1livds4\u00fcR&amp;g in; if so, he cannot be charged with <em>i </em>lqB|gS\u00a3. And <em>in ex parte Minor, </em>11 Ves. 559. and <em>Twigg </em>v. <em>Fifield, </em>13 Id. 517. it was held, that the purchaser ought to lie fcoatffdered as having the purchase only from the time of the confirmation of the report of sale. But in <em>Anson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Towgood, </em>1 Jac. &amp; Walk. 619. lord <em>Eldon </em>said the confirmation of the report related back, and thus unsettled the doctrine in <em>Twigg v. Fifield. </em>And see the course it behooves the purchaser to pursue to confirm his purchase, Sugd. Law Vend. 39. 40.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> So that it is possible the purchaser, in this case, may not be absolved. But the point cannot now be determined ; for the case is clearly <em>coram, non judice. </em>The superiour court of chancery could not entertain the bill, pending the suit in the county court. Therefore, the decree must be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-15\"><em> Ingraham's </em>edi.
