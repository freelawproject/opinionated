May </em>10, 1786 ; and by <em>Emanuel Walker </em>to the plaintiffs on the 10th of <em>March, </em>1787. The defendant (with-4 ^ 4 out filing any plea) brought into Court the principal and interest upon the bond, from the 20th of March, 1793, and moved the Court to have the suit dismissed at his costs, praying tobe discharged from the interest which accrued on the said bond between the day when it was payable and the said 20th of March, 1793 : on the ground that an attachment in 7 0 _ _ Chancery on behalf of the executors of a certain <em>Theodorick </em>\u2022 i <em>rrir r </em>. n <em>Bland </em>(a creditor of the above-mentioned <em>Theodorick Bland) </em>was depending in the County Court of <em>York, </em>against him the said <em>Tazewell </em>as a garnishee, and restrained him during that time from paying the principal. The plaintiffs, claiming the said interest, refused to accept the money so brought in: but the Court was of opinion that the sum brought into Court ought to be received by the plaintiffs without any interest, pending the suit in Chancery in <em>York </em>Court, and directed the suit to be dismissed at the costs of the defendant; to which opinion the plaintiffs filed a bill of exceptions <em>stating the case imperjectly. </em>This judgment was therefore reversed by the Court of Appeals on the 21st of <em>April, </em>1798, and the cause remanded for farther proceedings, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-28\">The defendant having afterwards died, the suit was revived against his executor ; and at a Court held for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>District aforesaid, in <em>September, </em>1802, the defendant moved to withdraw the motion made by his testator, and now to plead pat ment; which the Court permitted him to do, upon his agreeing that the money paid into Court might be paid over to the plaintiffs, and, \u201c this payment being \u201c made since the institution of this suit,\u201d that he should pay the costs of this suit. The defendant excepted to this opinion of the Court, but, nevertheless, pleaded \u201c payment \u201c by his testator,\u201d on which plea issue was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-9\">The Jury found a special verdict, stating, (in addition to the circumstances already mentioned,) that interest on the bond had not been paid from the 25th day of December, 1786 to the 19th <em>o\u00ed March, 1793; </em>but that all the residue of the said bond had been <em>paid; </em>that the process to stay the effects of <em>Theodorick Bland </em>in the hands of the defendant\u2019s testator, was issued on the 19th, and executed on the 24th of <em>May, </em>1786 ; that the bill in Chancery was filed in <em>September, </em>1786 ; that an order was made by the Court of <em>York </em>County in <em>May, </em>1187, making <em>John Barrett Co. </em>(\u201ehe present plaintiffs) parties in the said suit in Chancery, and restraining the defendant\u2019s testator from paying away the debt due from him to <em>Theodorick Bland, </em>which debt so restrained was the same debt now claimed by the <em>plaintiffs; </em>that <em>John Barrett &amp; Co. </em>filed <em>his </em>answer in said suit in 1789, claiming this debt as due to them by assignment as above ; and, in <em>August </em>in the same year, \u201c it was withdrawn,\u201d and the suit <em>as \u00a1.q him dismissed; </em>that an attachment issued in <em>March, </em>1787, to compel the defendant\u2019s testator to answer the bill; that he filed his answer in <em>September, </em>1792, and on the 19th of <em>March, </em>1793, the said restraining\" order of <em>York </em>Court as to him was set aside; that in <em>January, 1787, </em>the defendant\u2019s testator had notice that the bond was assigned to <em>Emanuel Walker &amp; Co. </em>on the 10th of <em>May, </em>1786; and that, whether the restraining order of <em>York </em>Court be considered as operating upon the debt due by the bond in question, or not, yet the opinion of both <em>John Barrett Co. </em>and <em>Henry Tazewell </em>was, that they <em>were </em>thereby restrained, The conclusion of the verdict was as follows ; \u201c and if, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>\u201c </em>the whole matter, the Court shall be of opinion, that the 44 plaintiffs are entitled to the interest during the period last 44 aforesaid, we find for the plaintiffs -the debt in the decla- \u201c ration mentioned, to be discharged by the payment of the 44 int&lt; rest during the period last aforesaid, to wit, from the 44 25th of <em>December, </em>1786, to the 19th of March, 1793; but if 44 the Cour shall not be of that opinion, we find for the de44 fendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\">On this verdict the Court gave judgment for the plaintiffs ; whereupon the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-5\">Wickham, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACY\">observed, that the bond in this case contained <em>no stipulation </em>for payment of interest; that interest, therefore, could accrue only on the default of <em>Tazewell </em>to pay the principal; and the bond having been <em>assigned </em>before it became due, there could be no <em>default </em>until it was presented to him by the assignee, and payment <em>demanded. </em>The creditor having thrown the bond into circulation, the debtor was not bound to <em>seek </em>the person of the assignee. So, if the creditor goes without the limits of the Commonwealth, interest is not recoverable.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> <em>Bland </em>the obligee, had left the country, and the debt was attached in <em>Tazewells </em>hands before the bond was payable, by the endorsement of the Clerk on the <em>subpoena </em>in Chancery; which endorsement was effectual for that purpose, as was decided in the case of <em>M'Kim </em>v. <em>Fulton </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>During the pendency of the attachment he could not pay the money, and therefore should not be liable for interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-7\">The notice in <em>January, </em>1787, of the assignment was not sufficient. The assignee, to entitle himself to interest, must not only give notice, but demand payment, and, to make the demand, must seek out the debtor.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-8\">\n<em>Call, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlG\">If the attachment was not <em>solicited </em>by <em>Tazewell, </em>he availed himself of it to procrastinate the payment of the debt. Immediately after the bond fell due, he had notice. It is admitted the assignee was bound to give notice ; but that was done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Why did not <em>Tazeivell </em>file his answer? The attachment was served in 1736, and could not be discharged until he answered : yethis answer was not filed until 1792; and then, through compulsion, by process of contempt.. In the mean time he surely made interest of the money. If a party is sued in Chancery about a sum of money, he may relieve himself by bringing it into Court, and praying the direction of the Court, as was said by this Court in <em>Macon </em>v. <em>Ambler, (MS.) </em>In that case it was even an <em>unliquidated </em>demand. In <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>and <em>Dunlop </em>v. Jones, in the High Court of Chancery, (in 1794,) it was decided that, if a <em>garnishee </em>fails to bring money into Court, he is compelled to pay- Interest. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-13\"><em>M'-Call v.

But in another case the Court held, that, where one of the creditors was in this country, the debtor should pay interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-14\">It is objected there was <em>no stipulation </em>for interest; but this was of no consequence ; the bond being with a <em>penalty, </em>which the act of Assembly says shall be discharged by the payment of the principal and interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-15\">It should be remarked, too, the attachment was only for 400/. and the bond for 900/.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b278-16\"><em>Monday, November </em>13.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Au0q\">The Judges Fleming and Roane (Tucker not sitting in the cause) delivered their opinions.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b275-29\"><em> </em>See 1 <em>Call, </em>223. <em>Barrett &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Tazewell.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b277-16\"> <em>M'Call v.

In the case of <em>Hunter </em>v. Spots<em>wood, </em>this Court affirmed a decree of the Chancery, giving interest against <em>Herndon, </em>who had, as Sheriff, received mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ney produced by die sale of attached effects under an order requiring him to pay the same to <em>Hunter, </em>he giving security therefor. <em>Hunter </em>declining to do this, the money remaiaecl (and, <em>it was said, </em>had died by depreciation) in v 7 \u201c . <em>' Herndon's </em>hands. It is supposed that this interest was creed on the ground that the identical money was not kept by <em>Herndon, </em>but that he had used it, and, perhaps, made a profit on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">On the ground of the principle established by this decree, I concur that the decree of the District Court be \u25a0UIIKMED.</p>\n<author id=\"b279-8\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AEl\">The only remaining question in this case is, whether the appellant\u2019s testator has shewn good legal cause why he should have been exempt from the payment of interest on his bond from the 25th of <em>December, </em>1786, the time it was payable, to the 20th of <em>March, </em>1793, when he was dismissed out of <em>York </em>Court. The ground of his claim to such exemption was, that <em>during all that-time, </em>his hands were tied, by the restraining order of the County Court of <em>York, </em>and he knew not to whom the money was to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\"><em>In order </em>to a correct decision, let us take a short view of the progress of the business from its origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">The bond in question to <em>Theodorick Bland, </em>was dated the 30th of <em>March, </em>1785, and payable the 25ih of December, 1786. On the 10th of <em>May </em>preceding, it was assigned to <em>Emanuel Walker &amp; Co. On </em>the 19th, process in Chancery issued from <em>York </em>Court, against <em>Theodorick Bland., </em>the obligee, and the defendant <em>Henry Tazewell, </em>on whom process was served on the 24*th of the same month. In September, 1786, the bill was filed in <em>York </em>Court. In <em>January, </em>1787, (if not before,) <em>Henry Tazewell </em>had, notice that, the bond was assigned to <em>Emanuel Walker </em>\u00ed\u00bf? <em>Co. </em>In <em>March </em>following, an attachment issued to compel him to answer; and on the 20th of the same month, <em>Walker </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>assigned <em>the </em>bond to <em>J. Barrett </em>Es1 <em>Co. </em>On the 21st of <em>May </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>made an'order of <em>York </em>Court, restraining the defendant from disposing of any debts or effects of <em>Theodorick Bland, </em>anc^ <em>John Barrett </em>&amp;? <em>Co. </em>made defendants to the <em>suit; </em>who t^le*r answer'&gt; which in <em>August </em>the same year was with- and the bill dismissed as to them. In September, 1792, <em>Henry Tazewell </em>filed his answer ; five years and a half after the attachment, and in <em>March </em>following, the suit in Chancery was dismissed as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In <em>September, </em>1794, <em>J. Barrett </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>instituted a suit on the bond, in the District Court of <em>Williamsburg-, </em>against <em>H. Tazewell, </em>who brought into Court 539/. 10s. <em>5d. </em>which he tenderedin discharge of his bond, claiming an exemption from the payment of interest from the 25th of <em>December, </em>1786, till ihe 20th of <em>March, </em>1793, when the suit in Chancery was dismissed, as to him. <em>Barrett </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>refused to receive the money on those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"AX2\">Upon the assignment of the bond to <em>Walker </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>which was done previous to the issuing of process in Chancery from <em>York </em>Court, Mr. <em>Tazewell </em>immediately became their debtor, and was no longer the debtor of <em>Theodorick Bland </em>and it is stated in the original bill of exceptions, as agreed by the parties themselves, and certified by Judge <em>Parker, </em>that he had notice of the assignment of the bond to <em>Walker </em>Si? <em>Co. </em>before it became due, but subsequent to the process of <em>York </em>Court being served on him ; though it is found in the verdict, that in January, 1787, the defendant\u2019s testator had notice that the bond was assigned to <em>Emanuel Walker Co. </em>on the 10th day of <em>May, </em>1786, which does not contradict what had been previously agreed by the parties, that he had notice of the assignment before the bond became payable. But, admitting that he had no notice till a month afterwards, what ought he then to have done ? He knew that the bond carried interest on the amount of the condition, irom the day it became payable, and that the person or persons entitled to the principal debt, had also a right to the accruing interest; and, whilst the matter was suspended by the Chancery process of <em>York </em>Court, he ought (if he meant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>to exonerate himself from the payment of interest) to have brought, and deposited the money in Court, there to abide its subsequent order, on the same principle that a defendant in debt, upon a bond with condition for the payment - , of a lesser sum at a certain day, who would avail himself o\u00ed a plea of tender, and that he was, and always had been, ready to pay ; in order to avoid damages for the detention of the debt, must also bring the money into Court. And he ought immediately, or in a reasonable time, to have answered the bill; and stated (which he might have done in a few words) the assignment of the bond to <em>Walker </em>Si? <em>Co. </em>by which it would have appeared to the Court, that he was no longer the debtor of <em>Bland; </em>he would consequently have been immediately dismissed from the suit in Chancery, and all difficulties respecting the <em>creditor </em>of the bond, would have ceased, as it was payable to the last assignees ; but instead of doing what was incumbent on him, he failed to answer until, in <em>March </em>following, an attachment was awarded against hint for his contempt; <em>and five years and a half thereafter </em>he filed his answer, and was soon after dismissed out of <em>York </em>Court; keeping in suspense and withholding the debt all this while from <em>John Barrett &amp; Co. </em>to whom the bond had been assigned on the 20th of March, 1787, about three months after it became due. When the bond was put in suit in the year 1794, the defendant brought into Court the sum of 539/. 105. <em>Sd. </em>which he tendered in discharge of his bond, claiming an exemption from the payment of upwards of six years\u2019 interest, on account of difficulties which arose from his own negligence and misconduct; and it is a sound maxim in law, that no man shall take advantage of his own <em>laches </em>to the prejudice of another. The case of <em>MlCall </em>EsP <em>Turner </em>was cited, and relied on by the appellant\u2019s counsel; but that case is essentially different from the present. There the obligee was beyond sea, where he remained from <em>Aprils </em>1775, to April, 1783, and it was not known in whose posses, slon he left the bond, or whether he took it with him ; and it is well known that a debtor is not obliged to seek his cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>&lt;^tor *n a foreign country ; and it was upon that <em>ground </em>that the interest was extinguished during <em>MLCall's </em>absence be\u00bb 3'oni^ seai added to the obstructions to the ordinary course of business, during the revolutionary war. I am of opinion, upon the whole, that the appellant\u2019s claim of exemption from the payment of interest, is altogether unsustainable, both in law and equity ; and that the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b278-9\"> 1 <em>Wash. </em>45.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
