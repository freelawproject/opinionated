The controversy turned upon the construction of his last will, and particularly of the following clause : \u201c I \u201c give and bequeath to my daughter <em>Jane Reno </em>a negro \u201c woman and her increase, named <em>Sib, </em>to her and her heirs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201c for ever, also a negro wench named Delph, she and her \u201c increase to her and her heirs lor ever.\u201d It appeared that, bef\u00b0re tbe dace \u00b0f will, <em>Sib </em>had two children, <em>Aaron </em>and Lucy, and afterwards, before the testator\u2019s death, a daughCharlotte, all which were claimed by the plaintiffs as comprehended in the bequest of <em>Sib </em>and her <em>increase.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aag\">1 he testator commenced his will with saying that, \u201c re- \u201c fleeting on the necessity of having his estate divided among \u201c his children by will to prevent disputes among them after \u201c his death,\u201d and \u201c as for what worldly property it had plea- \u201c sed God to bless him with, he disposed thereof in the fol- \u201c lowing manner.\u201d He then proceeded to make sundry specific devises and bequests, but did not mention the children of <em>Sib, </em>except as above. In one clause he bequeathed to his son <em>George </em>a negro woman Celia, and her children, <em>Rachel </em>and Lidge, <em>mentioning their names; </em>in another,, to his daughter Dolly, a negro woman <em>Nell and her </em>increase, and yet bequeathed to his son <em>Francis </em>a negro boy named Ben, who was a child of the same woman <em>Nell. </em>Before the concluding clause the following was inserted : \u201c It is my \u201c will that Bob, and <em>James </em>and <em>Kate </em>shall be sold or hired \u201c to them that they like, and what stock, household furni- \u201c ture <em>and </em>remains, and the money arising from the sale \u201c after deducting the legacies and pacing all just debts and \u201c charges, to be equally divided among my children.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-7\">The defendant <em>Enoch Reno </em>opposed the claim of the plaintiffs ; stating in his answer that he never heard the testator make any declaration of his intentions whether the said negro children should pass by the said devise, to the complainant <em>Jane </em>or not, but conceived it manifestly appeared from the wifl itself, that when he devised a negro woman <em>and her increase </em>he meant the <em>future </em>increase, and not children which she had at the time of making the will; in support of which opinion, he relied on the above-mentioned clauses containing bequests to his son George, his daughter Dolly, and his son <em>Francis. </em>He further contended, that since a will takes effect oniy <em>from the death, </em>of the testator, the children of \u00e1 female slave devised in the manner in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>Sib </em>was devised, born before the death of the testator, do , , not pass to the legatee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-5\">The defendant, <em>Bailis </em>Reno, filed a separate answer, in which he declared himself to have been always willing to give up the negroes in question to the plaintiffs, but that the same were in the possession of <em>Enoch Reno; </em>that he was <em>certain </em>it was his father\u2019s intention that the complainant <em>fane </em>should not only have <em>Sib </em>and Delph, but also all the children that they might have <em>from the time of making his will </em>afterwards, because, whenever the said slave <em>Sib </em>was delivered of a child, and application was .made by the midwife for pay, he sent her to the complainant fane, saying that <em>Sib </em>was <em>her property, </em>and, as he had nothing to say to her, the said complaiuant must pay thejees; and also, \u201c be- \u201c cause when a child was born it was considered as well by \u201c this defendant and his testator, as by others, to be the \u201c property of the complainant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-6\">A number of depositions were taken to shew the intention of the testator, from declarations made by him at sundry times, and from other circumstances, to bequeath the children of <em>Sib, </em>as well as their mother, to the complainant fane.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-7\">The County Court decreed to the plaintiffs the negro girl <em>Charlotte, </em>bom (as aforesaid) <em>after the will was made, </em>and dismissed the bill as to the other two children, <em>Lucy </em>and Aaron. The plaintiffs appealed to the. High Court of Chancery, where the following decree was pronounced by the late Chancellor Mr. <em>Wythe. </em>\u201c This Court is of opinion that, in \u201c a bequest of a female slave <em>and her increase, </em>the term <em>in-</em>u <em>crease </em>is a <em>synonyme </em>with <em>offspring, </em>comprehending all her \u201c progeny <em>whenever born. </em>To confine the term to such as \u201c shall be bom after the testator\u2019s death,. additional words \u201c seem necessary. Accordingly, where that restriction is \u201c intended, the epithet <em>future (future </em>increase) is usual. If \u201c the woman <em>Sib </em>had not been bequeathed to the daughter <em>\u201c fane, </em>but to some other, and the testator had bequeathed \u00ab the <em>increase </em>of <em>Sib </em>to that daughter, the legatee would un\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201c doubtedly have been entided to <em>Lucy </em>and <em>Aaron, </em>She \u201c would have been entitled likewise <em>if Sib had died before the </em>\u201c <em>testator. </em>If the word <em>increase zvere </em>equivocal, (as, if it, \u201c <em>ex vi </em>termini, necessarily comprehended not <em>all </em>the chil<em>\u2018i </em>dren of Sib, it must be,) this is an instance of that <em>amphi- </em>\u201c bology, (verbal ambiguity,) where a testator\u2019s meaning may \u201c be proved by extraneous testimony. Here is abundant \u201c testimony that the testator intended his daughter <em>fane </em>\u201c should have all the offspring of <em>Sib. </em>That such was his \u201c intention is proved by several of his family; by his \u201c friends ; by her who performed the obstetric office at the \u201c parturition of one, if not all of the slaves in controversy.\u201d The Court, therefore, reversing that part of the decree of the County Court which dismissed the bill as to <em>Lucy </em>and Aaron, decreed them, together with Charlotte, to the plaintiffs <em>; </em>from which decree <em>the </em>defendants, <em>by </em>counsel, prayed an appeal, which ivas allowed ; but no <em>appeal-bond </em>appeared in the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-15\">The executor <em>Bailis Reno </em>refused to prosecute this appeal, and in writing directed it to be dismissed; whereupon <em>Botts, </em>for the appellees, moved to abate it for that cause. In support of this motion, he contended, that a direction to dismiss an appeal is equal to a <em>release of errors ; </em>that a release of <em>errors </em>by <em>one </em>executor is as good as a release of a debt; and that a release of a <em>debt </em>by <em>one </em>executor is good as to all, even after summons and severance.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> A decree might have been confessed by <em>Bailis Reno </em>to bind both ;<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> and a dismission of the appeal has all the effect <em>here </em>that a decree confessed would have. It may be said that the Court will prefer the course elected by the executor who wishes to prosecute, as being most beneficial to. the estate <em>; </em>but what is most beneficial depends on the cause. <em>Enoch Reno </em>is for running the estate to expense against the opinion of his coexecutor and of the Chancellor. It is the duty of an executor to avoid useless expense. If he gr es up improperly <em>he </em>is liable, but the act is binding on the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-16\">The doctrine of summons and severance is applicable t\u00ae <em>original </em>plaintiffs only, but not to plaintiffs <em>in error,</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\n<em>Wickham, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahe\">There are direct precedents in favour of one executor prosecuting a writ of error without the other.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The judgment being against them both, and the securities of both being liable, each is interested to relieve himself and his securities. The cases put by Mr. Botts, as analogous, of an executor confessing a judgment, and the like, will not hold; because, it is evident, that the executor, and his securities only, are <em>personally </em>liable, though the <em>assets </em>in the hands of both are bound.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-4\">By an express act of <em>Assembly,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>any one of several parties may appeal.

And the question made was, wnether tnis release should bar <em>both </em>or neither of them. And ail the Court, after argument, resolved it should bar him only who released; for the plea being by way of action to discharge themselves of damages which were recovered against them, and to be restored to the possession (of lands) which was lost by the first judgment, and they being joined, in the first action, by the act of the plaintiff and not by their own act, it is not reasonable, that the act of one should charge or prejudice the other. (But if they had been plaintiffs in record by their own act,' (as . in debt 'upon an obligation,) and had been barred in judgment, in error upon that judgment, the release cf one should bar the other.) Wherefore it was adjudged that the judgment should be reversed as to him who <em>did not release ; </em>and that he should be restored to all he had lost; and, as to the other who had released, that he should be barred of his writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">The same reasons, I conceive, will apply to the present \u2022 case, and therefore am of opinion that the motion be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Judges Roane and Fleming, were of the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">The Court overruled the motion, \u201c so' far as it related to . \u201c the abatement of'his suit as to the appellant <em>Enoch; </em>being \u201c of opinion that the said <em>Bailis </em>may discontinue the said \u201c appeal as to himself, but that such discontinuance will be \u201c no cause for an abatement thereof as to the other appellant, <em>u </em>nor any bar to his prosecution thereof alone ; and, it ap- \u201c pearing to the satisfaction of the Court that the said <em>Bailis </em>\u201c had refused farther to prosecute this appeal, it was ordered \u201c that the same be discontinued as to him,\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b305-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>Baits, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p id=\"ARX\">relied on the preamble to the will, and the general testamentary clauses. The testator, after parcelling out his estate among his legatees, disposes of his household stuff, stock, and <em>remains, </em>to his children equally, as residuary legatees. If the word <em>remains </em>will cover the two children of <em>Sib, </em>who were then in existence, they will pass by that residuary clause ; but it is impossible to suppose that he should <em>particularize </em>his household stuff and stock, and yet not mention <em>slaves, </em>if he intended to comprehend <em>theni </em>in that clause. Unless, then, the word \u201c increase\u201d will include the children born as well before as after the will, he died intestate as to them. <em>Kennon </em>v. <em>M' Roberts,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Davies </em>v. <em>Miller,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> Frogmorton, ex </em>dimiss\u2019 <em>Brantstone, </em>v. <em>Holyday and others,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Busby </em>v. <em>Busby,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>are all cases in which the declaration by the testator of an intention to dispose of his <em>whole </em>estate has influenced the construction. The word <em>increase, </em>according to its explanation in <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>dictionary, naturally imports issue born as well before as after any particular time; and the constant usage is to insert <em>u future </em>where it is intended to Confine it to future increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">But if the word be ambiguous, then parol testimony may be admitted to explain it. <footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But, if it were doubtful upon all the other parts of the will whether the testator meant <em>past </em>as well as <em>future </em>increase, humanity alone should induce the Court to adopt the construction contended for by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>appellees, to prevent the separation of children from their mothers, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>'Thursday, November 23. </em>On the <em>merits, Wickham </em>argu\u00e9d that, by the word \u201c increase,\u201d children born after the death of the testator only passed ; for at the time of the death and not until then, the will speaks. This is a question of intention.

The decision then was, that parol evidence was admissible to rebut an <em>equity. </em>Again, there were various negroes of the same name, and others given on particular plantations. Parol evidence was therefore admitted to shew the situation of the estate. <em>Fleming </em>v. Willis, and the case from <em>Term </em>Reports, went no farther than <em>Sheltons </em>v.

But there is another circumstance in the will that leaves no doubt on my mind, as. to the intention of the testator; and that is, that, after disposing qf a number of negroes, all except the two in question, specially byname, he adds \u201c and what stock, household u furniture and <em>remains, </em>and the money arising from the c\u2018 sale, (I suppose he meant the sale of the three negroes di'\u2022c rected to be sold,) after deducting the legacies and paying 41 all just debts and charges, to be equally divided among <em>f </em>my children,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Can it be, for a moment, believed that the testator, after having specially disposed of a number of negroes, would have left the two infant children of <em>Sib </em>(one of them probably at the breast\") to be with his stock, household furniture, * . \u2019 \u25a0and remains, divided among his eleven children r It could never, I think, have been his intention; and the word <em>remains </em>might be well satisfied with the kitchen furniture, plantation utensils, &amp;c. which he thought too minute to be particularly mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">So much for the <em>construction </em>of the <em>will, </em>unaided by oral testimony, which I think was admissible to explain the intention of the testator; but, without such aid, I am clearly of opinion the decree is correct, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(f)\">\n<p id=\"AHi\"> 1 Cro.892.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A6o\"> 2 Cro.117.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\"><em> See </em>1 <em>Bro.
