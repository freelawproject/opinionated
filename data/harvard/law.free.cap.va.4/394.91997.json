It was true, the county court, at November term 1815, gave <em>Calloway </em>leave to reinstate the injunction before awarded to him, and dismissed at the preceding September term ; but that, in fact, was an award of a new and distinct injunction, on new matter alleged, to which the injunction bond had not, and could not have, any relation. The county court could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>not, at November term, <em>reinstate </em>the former injunction awarded on the original bill, which had been dismissed at September term. The injunction which remained to bo disposed of, was the new injunction awarded at November term 1815; and the order of the superiour court of chancery, overlooking the injunction of November 1815, and dissolving the injunction of August 1814, which had already been dissolved, and the bill on which it was awarded dismissed, by the county court, was wholly nugatory.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-4\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-fh\">said, it was now quite immaterial, whether or no the county court could properly <em>reinstate </em>the original injunction, after the bill on which it was awarded had been dismissed at a previous term; for the county court, in fact, did reinstate, and intended to reinstate, the original injunction ; and this at the instance of <em>Calloway. </em>But however that might be, there was no material variance between the record adduced to prove the breach, and the allegation of the breach, in the declaration. The declaration alleged, that the injunction referred to in the condition of the bond (namely, the injunction awarded by the county court on the 9th August 1814) was dissolved by the superiour court of chancery; and the record shewed an order of the superiour court, dissolving the injunction awarded by the county court on the 9th August 1814. The argument, that that injunction had been previously dissolved by the county court, was founded on a nice criticism : the record stated, exactly what the declaration alleged, that the injunction was dissolved by the superiour court. If the decree of the superiour court was wrong, it could not be thus impugned. Besides, the substantial part of the allegation was that the injunction had been dissolved ; and it could not be material whether the plaintiff\u2019s history of the injunction cause was exactly accurate or not.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b421-11\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9W\">I have seen few cases that, in my apprehension, present less difficulty than this. The only question is, whether the record was admissible evidence. The appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>brings his action on an injunction bond, against the surety; in his declaration describes the bond and sets out the condition with perfect accuracy, and, in assigning the breach of the condition, alleges that the injunction, which had been awarded by the county court of <em>Campbell, </em>was dissolved by the superiour court of chancery of <em>Lynchburg. </em>The defendant pleads conditions performed ; and the issue is made up on that plea. The plaintiff to prove the breach laid in the declaration, offers in evidence the record of the injunction suit; and this record shews the whole proceedings in the county court, and the removal of the cause, by <em>certiorari, </em>to the superiour court; and states, in so many words, the decree of the superiour court, that the injunction awarded to <em>Calloway </em>by the said county court, on the 9th August 1814, be dissolved ; which is the very injunction, on granting which the injunction bond, now sued on, was given. Could the court say that this evidence was not pertinent to the issue? not admissible under the pleadings? Unquestionably not. Here was the decree of a competent court dissolving the very injunction, the dissolution of which was the fact in issue. Whether that order of dissolution was a cor-, rect decree or not, was a question, surely, that could not be adjudged in this side way, on a question as to the admissibility of the record in evidence; the decree itself remaining in full force, nowise impeached, and no appeal taken from it. I think the judgement must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Tucker, P. In <em>Mowry </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>3 Leigh 561. which was an action for a malicious prosecution, the declaration set forth an examination and acquittal on the 7th <em>October, </em>and on the trial the plaintiff produced in evidence the record of an acquittal on the 7th <em>November. </em>The introduction of the record was objected to because of the variance. This court took a distinction between the case as it appeared, and that of a misrecital. We considered the declaration as merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>alleging tlie fact of acquittal, and not as undertaking to recite the record ; and (upon the authority of <em>Purcell </em>v. <em>Macnamara, </em>9 East 157. overruling <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>4 T. R. 590. and sustained by <em>Philips </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Aid. 435.) affirmed the judgement. These cases establish, that where the time of the trial of a particular fact is not material, a variance from the date, in alleging the trial and the result, will not be material, although it is to be proved by a record, provided the time be not alleged as descriptive of the record by means of a <em>prout patet per rccordum </em>or otherwise. Although these cases are not <em>ad idem </em>with the case before us, the principle is, I think, altogether applicable. Here, the substance of the allegation in the declaration, is, that the injunction was dissolved. There is no attempt to recite the order of dissolution, nor is there any mention of its date. But instead of alleging, as was the fact, that the injunction was dissolved in the county court, it is erroneously-stated, that it was dissolved by the superiour court of chancery :\u2014I say <em>erroneously, </em>because i do not think it necessary to go into the inquiry, how far the defendant <em>Anthony </em>was, on the one hand, bound to respect the order of the county court reinstating the injunction, or, on the other, how far he was at liberty to disregard it, because irregularly made. If he was bound to respect it; if it was in fact a restraint upon him, which he had no right to set at defiance, until it was removed by the same court or a superiour tribunal j and if, as I think, the reinstatement is to be considered as the <em>old </em>injunction,' though most irregularly revived, then, the declaration strictly conforms to the fact. The injunction was dissolved by the superiour court of chancery of <em>Lynchburg. </em>But if <em>Anthony </em>was at liberty to disregard this irregular reinstatement, or if it is to be considered as a new order of injunction, it is certain that the declaration erroneously describes the court, at which the dissolution took place. This, however, was not the <em>point </em>of the allegation. The substance of it was <em>the fact </em>of dissolution, which was to entitle the plaintiff to his action, and the date of the dissolution to as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>certain the extent of his demand. It is. not improbable, that the declaration would have been considered faulty on special demurrer in this latter respect, as the day of dissolution is blank. But that defect cannot affect the judgement now. The only point in question is, the mistake as to the court in which the injunction was dissolved, which I have already said I do not consider as forming a material part of the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The case of <em>Busby </em>v. <em>Watson, 2 </em>W. Black. 1050. is not inapplicable to shew, that the mistake of the court is as immaterial as the mistake of the date. There, in case for malicious prosecution,, the declaration alleged that the defendant procured the plaintiff to be indicted at the general quarter sessions of the peace for <em>Middlesex ; </em>and a record was introduced, proving indeed the fact of indictment, but that it was at the general sessions, instead of the general <em>quarter </em>sessions. These courts are different, for the general <em>quarter </em>sessions, have more extensive jurisdiction than the <em>general </em>sessions. The evidence was rejected at <em>nisi prius </em>for this variance; but the court of common pleas thought otherwise; and ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Judgement affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
