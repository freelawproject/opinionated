A record frpm the General Court of the proceedings in a suit in Chancery instituted in 1738, by <em>Landon Carter </em>against the other patentees, for partition of that land ; from which it appeared that partition was made by Commissioners appointed for that purpose, (the surveyor attending,) by certain <em>metes and bounds, </em>according to a plat returned to the Court, which partition the Court confirmed. The plat returned by <em>John </em>Grant, the surveyor, under date of <em>October </em>3d, 1739, exhibited the area of the whole tract to contain 38,553 acres. According to an explanation of his, accompanying the plat, the dividing line M.

C. to the stony hill, without running into the land in controversy ; that <em>Robert Carter </em>and <em>W-ormeley </em>Carter, in the year 1797, took a lease from the defendant of part of the land in controversy ; and that one of the lines of the said lease was bounded by the last mentioned line ; that <em>Landon </em>Carter, the lessor of the plaintiff, was then alive, and until 1801; and that <em>Wormeley Carter </em>never had right to the said land in the life-time of the said <em>Landon Carter.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-3\">The question between the parties was, whether the <em>marked </em>lines described as aforesaid should be established? or the line M.

The concluding part implies a misconception of the question presented by the record, since it only imports an opinion that the line <em>expressed in the decree </em>of the General Court was established, (a point not disputed,) whereas the question was, <em>which </em>of the conflicting lines \u201cexpressed,\u201dor,rather, comprehended in the decree,should be established; and this question ought to have been decided in favour of the <em>marked </em>and <em>reputed </em>lines, according ' <em>r\" Clements,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Seekright, Lessee </em>of Glasscock.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABN\">Whatever might have been the ef-</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZg\">fect. of this argument, before the <em>Jury, </em>this Court have nothing to \u00f3 o ivith it. The instruction left the cause at large for the production of every argument which either partv might think proper to urge to the Jury. The only point was, where did <em>Grant's </em>dividing line begin. The Court did not say where it began ; but, wherever it did begin, it was admitted on all hands to be the true line. The Jury were to decide, and were left perfectly at liberty to take one line or the other. It would not have been proper Jbr the Court to instruct the Jury, that the <em>marked </em>line should have been preferred ; because this would have been giving an opinion on a matter of <em>fact. </em>It was a <em>circumstance </em>to be weighed by them, and they did weigh it ; but it was counteracted by another circumstance, that <em>Grant </em>says he began at a <em>corner in the patent </em>line, and ended at a corner, whereas on the <em>marked </em>line there is no such corner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-3\"><em>In reply, </em>it was said, it does not appear at whose instance this instruction was given; but this Court must inquire whether it was <em>legal </em>or not. The question whether the <em>marked </em>lines were to be preferred to aline <em>\u25a0which never had been marked, </em>was a question of law, and the Court should have instructed the Jury to regard the marked lines in the first place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-4\">But the Court did limit and mislead the Jury by this instruction ; because it confined them in the conclusion to be drawn from the identity of the line A. P. run by Kemper, with the line M. C. <em>laid dozen in Grant's plat, but never run by him. </em>What right had the Court to say that, from such identity, it followed that <em>Kemper's </em>was the true dividing line i The conclusion was erroneous ; because the <em>marked </em>line might, nevertheless, have been the true line intended by <em>Grant, </em>though by mistake he laid it down incorrectly in his <em>plat, </em>as appears from his own explanation annexed to it; according to which, the point of intersection between the lines M. C. and I. P. is said to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>at a white oak near Bull Run on a stony </em>hill, when, in fact, the line M.

According to these principles, regard should always be had to the following circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">1. If a patent or deed refer to any notorious land-marks, or natural boundaries, which cannot be mistaken, and are not liable to change <em>or decay, </em>as the corners or angles of a plat, such notorious land-marks are to be regarded as <em>termini, </em>from whence straight lines are to be run from one to the other, without regard to the correspondence of either course or distance, which may in such cases be mistaken in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">2. If lines and corners be proved to have been actually run, and agreed on as a boundary between parties holding' adjacent lands, those lines and corners are from thence* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>forth to be regarded as the limits of the <em>possession </em>of each ; and from the period of running such lines, if they continue to he acquiesced in, the acts of limitation may be considered as beginning to run, so as to control the courses and distances mentioned in the deed, by establishing an <em>adversary possession </em>in either party, according to the lines so run.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">3. Where, in a grant or deed, courses and distances <em>only </em>are mentioned, beginning from a certain point, but not referring to any certain point for the termination, otherwise than by reference to the distance, according to the course prescribed; in such case, courses and distances, as expressed in the deed, are only to be regarded, unless an actual survey, <em>duly </em>authorized, be proved to have been subsequently made, according to the courses and <em>distances </em>prescribed by the deed-</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">4. Where courses and distances, with <em>marked lines </em>and corners, are referred to in a deed, in such case <em>lines </em>and <em>corners </em>corresponding <em>most nearly </em>with the <em>courses </em>and distances, lines and <em>corners </em>mentioned in the deed, are to be regarded as the <em>true </em>courses, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><em>5. </em>If partition be made between two joint-tenants, <em>o\u00ed </em>tenants in common of land by deed, or by virtue of a decree, if iu the deed or decree it be expressed* that A. shall have all the lands which lie west of a line drawn from one notorious land-mark or natural boundary to another, and B. all that lie east thereof, although this line be never actually run, each is from thenceforth seised of his proper part, according to the <em>true </em>course to be run from one of those points to the other; but if a line be run and <em>marked., </em>by mutual consent or agreement, or by order of Court, and confirmed in the decree, and that decree be acquiesced in, the <em>possession </em>of each commences from that period, acj cording to the <em>line so </em>marked., although that line be <em>ever so erroneous j </em>and the act of limitations may operate upon that possession, so as to render <em>such erroneous </em>line, in process of time, the <em>legal boundary </em>between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>In the present case, the parties claim under a grant from the proprietors of the northern neck, to <em>London Carter </em>and five others, for about 40,000 acres of land, in the year 1724, whereof .partition was made by a decree of the Ge- \u2022 neral Court, upon a bill filed, and <em>consent </em>\u00f3f parties, its the year 1739. The commissioners, for that purpose 'appointed, made a report, with a survey annexed, made by <em>John </em>Grant, in which, among other things, they say that they have allotted to <em>London Carter, </em>under whom the plaintiff in the ejectment claims, the lot on the plat No. 1. separated (as by the plat appears) from the residue of the tract, by a straight line drawn from letter M. on the south side of the plat, to letter C. on the north side thereof, a distance above six miles, according to <em>Kemper\u2019s </em>plat. They describe this line as running north 3 deg. east, and beginning at a white <em>oak, </em>marked R. C. near <em>Young\u2019s </em>plantation, being a <em>corner tree </em>of the patent, and ending at another <em>white oak, </em>on <em>Piney Branch, another Corner </em>of the patent*</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\">To <em>Mann Page, </em>under whom the defendants claim, they allotted the lot No. 2, on the plat. Separated from the first lot, as described on the plat, by the line M. C. before . mentioned ; and from the third and fourth lots, by a line thus described : \u201c The dividing line, I. P. N. 80 degrees \u201c east, begins at a white oak, marked R. C. on a high <em>u </em>bank of the south branch of <em>Bud Pun, </em>and ends at a <em>a xohite oak </em>near Bull Run, in the line M. C. on ac\u2018 stony hill,\u201d which is accordingly designated in that plat by the letter P. as in the straight line between M* and C.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The point P. thus designated in the plat <em>returned to </em>the General Court, constitutes a corner between lot 1. and lot 2. and between lot 2. and lot 3. The report was-confirmed, and a decree accordingly; the parties, therefore,. became seised in severalty of their respective shares? according to the terms of that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>There are two plats of surveys made in this cause ; in rone of which, made by <em>Charles </em>Kemper, there is a straight line drawn from a point A. on the south side of the plat, to a point P. on the north side thereof, a distance of 1,944 poles, (or more than six miles,) without meeting a single marked tree in all that distancce, except one two miles or more from the lands in controversy, where, by the surveyor\u2019s report, he intersected a plain marked line, nearly at right angles (it would appear from the plat) with the line he was then running.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">In the other plat, made by <em>Henry D. Hooe, </em>a similar line appears to have been run from the same points, the distance 1,925 poles, and not a line tree discovered in all. that course. By direction of the defendant\u2019s attorney, the surveyor then began at a point marked little red a, 8S poles distant from the beginning of the first mentioned line, and nearly at right angles with it; and, having run the course designated on the plat by the red dotted line, <em>red a, red h, </em>at right angles therewith, and at the distance of eight poles eastward of that point, a stump at red <em>c </em>was shewn him, by two witnesses, <em>on a </em>stony hill, near the south branch of Bull Run, which tree they said they knew when standing, and that it was marked with R. C. In running this line, it appears that, a little on the right hand thereof, designated by the red doited line, red \u00ab, red c, they passed a large number of <em>ancient marked </em>trees. From the corner red C. to red F. there is a line of marked trees, corresponding pretty nearly with the dividing line, I. P. reversed in the plat, and report made to the General Court, in the year 1739.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The Court instructed the Jury, that if they were satisfied from the evidence, that the plaintiff\u2019s beginning in the survey made by <em>Kemper </em>at A. was at the same corner of the patent described by <em>John </em>Grant, (whose survey was made the foundation of the decree of the General Court,) at the point marked M. in that survey, and that the termination of that line at P. to run by the plat in <em>Kemper\u2019s </em>sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>vey, was at the corner described in <em>Grant\u2019s </em>survey, by the' letter C. the line so run by the plat in the survey in this cause, should be considered as the true dividing line between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">there had been no evidence whatsoever in the cause, by which it had appeared that any line had ever been actually marked from one side of the patented lands to the other, in the direction, or nearly so, with the course laid down in <em>Grant\u2019s </em>survey, which was returned to the General Court, or if no such stony hill near Bull Run could be found, as that mentioned by the commissioners who made the division between the parties, to have been <em>in the line M. C. </em>in the plat returned by them to the General Court, this direction might have been correct. But the termination of the line I. P. (which constituted a corner, not only between the parties in this cause, but between the party under whom the defendant claims, and another joint-tenant, or tenant in common, under the original grant,) being expressly declared to be in the line M. C. and, moreover, to end at a <em>white </em>oak, near Bull Run, and ON A STONY HILL ; <em>those </em>PERMANENT, NATURAL <em>land-marks </em>ought not to have been <em>overlooked </em>or disregarded by the Court in its instruction ; neither ought regular lines of ^marked trees, leading to such a point, and there terminating from different directions, to have been overlooked or disregarded, especially if they should appear to have rus in a manner corresponding in any reasonable degree (of which the Jury were to judge) with the lines expressed in <em>Grant\u2019s </em>survey, and\u2019made the basis of the decree of the General Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">My opinion, therefore, is, that the judgment be reversed, and a new trial be had, with the following instruction: <em>u- </em>That if, upon such new trial, any instruction to the Jury \u201c be prayed by either party, the Court ought to instruct n the Jury that, if the Jury shall be satisfied from the evi* <em>m </em>deuce which shall be before them, that the point little <em>n </em>red <em>c </em>in the plat made in this cause by <em>Henry D. Hooe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>45 surveyor of <em>Prince William </em>County, is the same <em>u </em>with the point P. <em>at a white oak </em>near Cull \u201c Run, <em>in the line M. C. </em>on a stony hill, (as de- \u201c scribed in the plat and report made by <em>John Grant, </em>and 44 the commissioners appointed to make a division of the \u201c lands comprised in a patent granted to <em>London Carter </em>44 and five others, and returned to the General Court, in the \u201c year <em>1739, </em>by whom the same was confirmed and made \u201c the basis of the decree for a division,) they ought to con-44 sider that point as a <em>corner </em>between the parties, or those u under whom they claim, from which <em>corner </em>other lines, 44 corresponding with the courses mentioned in that plat 44 and report, ought (if necessary) to be drawn, by rever44 sing the courses of the line M.

The cases of <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Clements,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Herbert and wife </em>v. <em>Wise and others,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Seckright, Lessee of </em>Glasscock,<footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in this Court, shew the sense of the Court in favour of marked and reputed boundaries, when in oppogi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>tion to mistaken descriptions in deeds or surveys, or to mere course and distance. It is said in those cases that, in a conflict of the kind, the Juries have very wisely and generally, in this country, disregarded the latter, and adhered to the former criteria, as being more stable and permanent, and less liable to mistakes and misconception. Referring particularly to those cases for the doctrine I mean to adopt on the present occasion, it will be found that the decision in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Seekright, Lessee of Glasscock, </em>is perhaps a complete authority in opposition to the Instruction of the District Court. In <em>that </em>case, parol evidence was admitted to establish a <em>marked </em>line, which did not correspond with that mentioned in the deed either as to course of distance. It was so admitted, on the ground that the description in the deed may have been <em>piistaken ; </em>whereas the marked and reputed line, being more stable and permanent, ought to prevail, or, at least, be submitted without prejudice to the consideration of the Jury. So, ia the case before us, it is very possible that the surveyor may have erred in his description of the two points beginning and ending the line in controversy ; he may have mistaken this in the <em>fgure. </em>itself, and corrected it (as <em>he seems to </em>have done) in the notes or explanation attached to and made part of his report of the survey. So, also, this <em>possible </em>mistake may perhaps be shewn to have been corrected by him, by actually <em>running and marking </em>the line, claimed by the appellant; at least, however, this is an inquiry proper for the consideration of the Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">But the instruction of the District Court does not admit the possibility of a mistake in this respect in the survey ; it is imperious on the Jury, in the event of the two points in <em>Kemper\u2019s </em>survey being proved to correspond with <em>twa </em>in <em>Grant\u2019s </em>survey. That instruction, therefore, omits to give to <em>marked </em>and <em>reputed </em>lines, their due weight with the Jury, according to the uniform decisions of this Court on the subject; it counts as nothing the, various strong circumstances shewn in evidence by the appellant in favour c\u00a1\u00a3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ais pretensions, but sets up as infallible, and as outweighnig every thing else, a criterion not entitled under the deeisions of this Court, or the usage of Juries in this country, to such preeminence. In fine, bottoming the instruction upon die mere proof of correspondence as aforesaid, it deprives the Jury of the right to go into the whole evidente, and to give their verdict upon a general consideration thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Such being the character of this instruction, which may have misled the Jury, the verdict ought not to stand. On the new trial to be awarded, if any instruction at all is necessary to be given to the Jury, it should authorize them to take into consideration all the circumstances given in evidence in the cause, and especially the <em>reputed </em>and <em>marked </em>lines proved and relied upon by the appellant.</p>\n<author id=\"b153-6\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AiP\">There being no difference of opinion among the judges as to the merits of the cause, the following is to be entered as the judgment of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">44 This Court is of opinion, that the instruction given 41 to the Jury by the District Court was erroneous; there-44 fore it is considered that the said judgment be reversed, 44 &amp;c. and it is ordered, that the Jury\u2019s verdict be set aside, 44 and that a new trial be had in the cause ; and that, if \u201c upon such trial, any instruction to the Jury be prayed by either party, the instruction be, that if the Jury shall be, 44 satisfied, from the evidence which shall be before them, 44 that the point, little red c, in the plat made in this cause 44 by <em>Henry D. </em>Ilooe, surveyor of <em>Prince William </em>County, 44 is the same with the point P. at a white oak near <em>Bull </em>44 Run, in the line M. C. on a stony hill, as described in the 44 pl-at and report, made by <em>John Grant </em>and the commis44 sioners appointed to make a division of the lands com-44 prised in a patent granted to <em>Landon Carter </em>and five others, 44 and returned to the General Court in the year 1739, by \u201c whom the same was confirmed and made the basis of the 44 decree for the division, they ought to consider that point 44 as a corner between the parties, or those under whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u201c they claim, from which corner, other lines correspond- \u201c ing with the courses mentioned in that plat and report, \u201c ought (if necessary) to be drawn by reversing the \u201c courses M, P- and I. P. in <em>Grant\u2019s </em>survey respectively, \u201c unless the Jury shall, from the evidence, be further sa- \u201c tisfied, that an ancient line, Corresponding with the line .\u201c M. C. in <em>Grant\u2019s </em>survey, has been actually run and mark-<em>u </em>ed from the point little red <em>a, </em>(or any other point on that \u201c side of the plat, as to the Jury may appear,) to the point \u201c little red c in the said <em>Hooe\u2019s </em>plat described, either by the said Commissioners appointed by the General Court as \u201c aforesaid, or by the parties respectively under whom the present parties claim, or their agents authorized for that \u201c purpose, in which case, if no contravening evidence sa- \u201c tisfactory to the Jury be offered, they ought to establish \u00ab the line so proved to have been run and marked as the \u00ab true dividing line between the parties.\u201d Which is ordered to be certified, &amp;c.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b146-5\"><em> See 1 Call, Shaw v.
