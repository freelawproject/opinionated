The declaration excused the production of the record of the action and judgement, by stating that since the judgement was rendered, the clerk\u2019s office had been consumed by fire, and this record among other papers wholly destroyed. <em>Newcomb </em>put in a special plea in bar, alleging that the proceedings and judgement in the action of assault and battery against him were erroneous, and shewing particularly wherein they were supposed to be so, and that he had filed a bill of exceptions to the proceedings, taken an appeal from the judgement, and given an appeal bond, but that before his appeal was or could be prosecuted, or any steps taken to prosecute it, the clerk\u2019s office, and this record therein contained, had been wholly consumed by fire; concluding with a verification. And upon this plea an issue was made up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-8\">At the trial in the county court, <em>Newcomb </em>filed a bill of exceptions to an opinion of the court, stating, that <em>Drummond </em>having proved, by parol testimony, the rendition of the <em>judgement </em>in the action of assault and battery against <em>New-comb, </em>and <em>NewcomVs </em>appeal from the same, and due execution of the appeal bond, and the subsequent destruction of the clerk\u2019s office by fire, and of the whole record of the action of assault and <em>battery,\u2014Newcomb, </em>thereupon, moved the court to instruct the jury, that <em>this </em>action of <em>Drummond </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>could not be maintained ; but the court refused to give such <em>. </em>... instruction, and instructed the jury, on the contrary, that though the effect of <em>Drummond\u2019s </em>judgement was suspended by the appeal taken by <em>Newcomb, </em>yet the judgement was an evidence of <em>Drummond\u2019s </em>demand; to which opinion <em>Newcomb </em>excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A47\">There was a verdict and judgement for <em>Drummond. </em>The circuit court of <em>Gloucester, </em>upon a <em>supersedeas </em>awarded at the instance of <em>Newcomb, </em>affirmed the judgement of the county court. And then he applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgement of the circuit court; which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-6\"><em>Johnson </em>for the plaintiff in error;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"APUx\">no counsel for the defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b82-7\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AF\">There is no error in the judgement. In considering the case, it shall be taken for granted, that the plea sets forth, distinctly, the fact that an appeal bad been taken and consummated by giving bond, but that by the burning of the record the party could not take steps to prosecute his appeal. The <em>appeal </em>of a party can have no greater effect upon the judgement appealed from, than <em>a writ of error </em>awarded by a superior tribunal: if there be a difference, that difference would preponderate in favor of the considerate act of a court, rather than the arbitrary appeal of the party. Now, it is no bar to an action of debt upon a judgement, that a <em>writ of error </em>has been awarded. The writ of error is, indeed, so far a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgement, that an execution cannot regularly be issued upon it, and if issued will be quashed. But an action of debt may, nevertheless, be brought upon it j and unless for some cause, deemed adequate by the court, the proceedings be suspended, the plaintiff will be entitled to his judgement. 2 Wins. Saund. 101. h. 1 Tidd 574, 5, 6. On the judgement so obtained, an execution will not, generally, be permitted, until the writ of error is determined ; but the rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>not uniform, but depends upon circumstances. Thus, where the plaintiff obtained judgement in the second action, before the writ of error sued out to the first, he was permitted to take his execution. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Best, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Ald. 275. 5 Eng. C. L. R. 281. And in <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Emerton, </em>1 Stra. 526. where the plaintiff got the second judgement against the bail, on a <em>scire facias, </em>pending the writ of error, the execution levied on their bodies was not set aside; the court saying that as the party did not apply to stay the proceedings, the court would not set them aside. In the present case, then, <em>Drummond </em>was entitled to the second action on the judgement. Nor was it a vexatious one; for the destruction of the <em>record </em>rendered it the most proper, as it certainly was the fairest, course. Therefore, the instruction of the court was not erroneous to the prejudice of <em>Newcomb ; </em>for if he could have produced the fullest evidence of an appeal or writ of error, it could not have <em>barred </em>the action. The plea was, in fact, an immaterial plea; and had the verdict been for <em>Newcomb, Drummond </em>would have had judgement <em>non obstante veredicto. </em>The verdict having been for <em>Drummond, </em>the judgement upon it cannot be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">It must be observed, too, that the plea distinctly admits, that by burning of the papers, the party could take no steps to prosecute his appeal. Ilis appeal then was not prosecuted. Patting technicalities out of view, it may be asked, whether a plaintiff who has obtained a verdict of twelve jurors and the judgement of a court in his favor, shall be debarred of his judgement by an appeal which his adversary has never prosecuted, and which he certainly cannot now prosecute. The destruction of the record may have operated a prejudice to him perhaps: but if this unprosecuted appeal, which cannot now be prosecuted, is to have the effect of a <em>reversal </em>of the judgement out and out, the plaintiff will sustain greater injury. In a question whether the consequences of this accident should fall on the plaintiff who has the verdict of a jury and the judgement of a court in his favor, or on the defendant who complains that that court erred in its decisions, we should not hesitate.</p>\n<p id=\"AgV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>There was a mode, perhaps, in which the appeal might have been prosecuted. The facts might have been ascertained as to the bill of exceptions and the consummation of the appeal by the execution of the appeal bond, under the provisions of the statute, 1 Rev. Code, cb. 130. and then, it is possible, the transcript of the evidence obtained might have been acted on by the court of appeals. It struck the court, at first, that <em>Drummond </em>could only have been permitted to prove his case by evidence taken under that statute ; but, as there was no objection to the testimony introduced, as there was no proof that a board of commissioners had ever been appointed and had acted, and as independently of the statute, a record which has been burnt or destroyed, may be set up by parol evidence, according to' the common law, there is no good ground of objection on that score.
