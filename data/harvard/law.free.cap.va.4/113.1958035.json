Because the deed from <em>Bibb </em>and wife to <em>Graves, </em>states a different consideration from that mention - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ad in the bill to have been given for the land, and admits the whole thereof (as well in itself as by the receipt thereto annexed) to have been fully paid. <em>Ars </em>Clericalis, 391. and 2 <em>Dyer, </em>169. <em>a. Wilkes </em>v. <em>Leuson, </em>shew that neither the <em>bargainor, </em>nor his heir, can aver that his deed made on a different consideration from that expressed therein. He has not a right to set up any thing in opposition to his own deed, because otherwise, purchasers would be entrapped. The deed, with the receipt in full, having been recorded, <em>Duval, </em>when he purchased of Graves, had no reason to expect that the consideration money, or any part thereof, had not been paid. The parol agreement that <em>Bibb </em>should remain in possession notwithstanding the deed, was of no effect. The statute executes a deed of bargain and sale, where to the bargainee\u2019s use, and conveys the possession.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The word <em>\u201c prantj </em>made the land pass by way of use, and there was no need oi actual entry.0 <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> <em>Graves, </em>therefore, was in possession by virtue of the deed; and, as he never reconvcyed the land, <em>Bibb </em>could not be considered, <em>legally, </em>as in possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-10\">2. No notice that any part of the purchase-money was clue, is proved to have been given to <em>Duval, </em>or to <em>Dane, </em>or <em>Pleasant Tounghusband, </em>until the year 1795, which was after the date and recording of the last deed from <em>Graves.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-11\">3. There was no necessity of such an account as the decree directed ; but, if it was to be taken, credit should have been allowed to <em>Graves </em>for the value of the <em>Kentucky </em>lands, for which the appellee had accepted the bond of <em>Edward </em>and <em>Thomas Waltons. </em>It is true the assignment of that bond by <em>Graves </em>was not \u201c <em>-without recourse </em>but the deposition of <em>John </em>Poindexter, who drew the writings, proves that he so understood the intention of the parties. Besides, if <em>Graves </em>were ultimately responsible for those lands, <em>Bibb </em>ought to have used due diligence in endeavouring to recover of the Waltons, before he could look to <em>Graves; yet </em>he has never brought suit on that bond, though so many years have elapsed since its date. But, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>any rate, <em>Duval, </em>the <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of the <em>Louisa </em>land, ought, in no event, to be liable for the default of the <em>Waltons, </em>or of <em>Graves.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARm\">4. The legal representatives of <em>Graves </em>ought to have bee\u00bb made parties ; a balance being alleged to be due from <em>him, </em>and an account directed to be taken, which could not be rendered by <em>Duval. Graves\u2019s </em>representatives are interested on his warranty to <em>Duval, </em>and, at law, would have been called in as <em>vouchees. </em>It is a rule in equity, that all persons interested should be made parties. <em>Mitf. 39.

Mr. <em>Warden </em>is mistaken in saying that <em>Duval </em>had no notice. It appears from his own answer, that he had notice before the last deed from <em>Graves </em>to him ; and this notice binds him to the same extent, and in the same manner, as <em>Graves </em>was bound. <em>Sug. </em>L. Vendors, 484. The previous mortgage was of no consequence, for that was for indemnity only, and there is no proof that the indemnity was required. The evidence clearly proves, that <em>Bibb </em>was to retain possession of the land, Until the contract on the part of <em>Graves </em>should be <em>fully complied </em>with, and that he actually did retain it, which in itself was sufficient. It is said that <em>Walton\u2019s </em>land was taken by <em>Bibb at all risks ; </em>but the nature of the transaction precludes the idea. The bond was assigned by <em>Swann </em>to <em>Graves </em>\u201c <em>without </em>recoursebut from <em>Graves </em>to <em>Bibb in general terms. </em>It cannot be believed, then, that <em>Bibb </em>meant to take the land without the warranty of <em>Graves. </em>Let it be considered, too, that <em>Bibb </em>was selling himself out of house and home <em>; </em>and it would have been insanity in him to part with his own land,' without any security for a good title to that which he took in its stead. The testimony of <em>John Poindexter </em>is only as to his \u201c <em>apprehensions </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u2022m which he might have been mistaken ; and even Readmits that <em>Graves </em>was to see that the <em>Waltons </em>made a deed. He never did see to it, and the land is actually lost, as appears from the deposition of <em>Edward Walton </em>himself, who swears that other persons now hold it by prior titles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-4\">As to the want of proper parties, the case of <em>Brace </em>v. <em>Harrington</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>furnishes the general reasoning on the subject. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Griffith</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is strongly in our favour, shewing, that where there are two joint and several obligors in a bond, and one dies, the executor of the deceased may be sued in equity, without making the surviving obligor \u00e1 party ; and that in such case it is incumbent on the <em>defendant </em>to compel the other obligor to contribute towards payment of the debt. So here, if any contribution is to be demanded of <em>Graves\u2019s </em>representatives, <em>Puval </em>must sue them for that purpose. But he has taken on himself the defence, and has not suggested the propriety of calling on them for contribution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-5\"><em>Wyatt\u2019s Prac. Reg. </em>302. 314. and 3 <em>P. Wms. </em>97. note [A], also, by analogy, support the doctrine I contend for. In. note [I], to 3 <em>P. Wms. </em>311. it is said to be a general rule, that no one need be made a party against whom the plaintiff can have no decree. Neither was it necessary to make <em>Graves\u2019s </em>representatives parties, in order to get evidence from them, because it might have been obtained in the ordinary way, by taking their depositions.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b135-11\">Thursday, <em>June 1.</em></decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"An23\">The Judges pronounced their opinions.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A_vv\"> 2 <em>Mod. 253.

A <em>purchaser </em>of the <em>legal </em>title is not \u201c to be affected by any <em>latent </em>equity, whether founded on \u201c trust, fraud, or <em>otherwise, </em>of which he has not <em>actual no- </em>\u201c <em>tice, </em>or which does not <em>appear in some deed </em>necessary \u201c <em>in the deduction of the title, </em>so as to amount to construc- \u201c tive notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\"><em>Duval then </em>could not be affected by any latent equity, or <em>secret condition, </em>between <em>Bibb </em>and <em>Graves, </em>which is not expressed in the deed itself. The mortgage of the 11th of <em>February, </em>1790, therefore stands unimpeached, both at law and in equity, since he had neither <em>actual </em>notice of <em>Bibb's </em>private agreement, nor is there any thing i\u00f1 <em>Bibb's </em>deed to <em>Graves, </em>that could have led him <em>tofurther </em>inquiry. On the contrary, the information to be collected from it was conclusive, in <em>favour </em>of a purchaser j otherwise, the laws which direct the recording of all deeds of lands must prove a snare, instead of a security to purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">The deed of <em>February </em>11th, 1790, is to all intents and purposes an absolute conveyance in fee-simple, at law. The proviso is in the nature of a condition subsequent. The object of the deed is the perpetual security and indemnity of <em>Duval, </em>against a recovery which might be had against him by <em>Currie or </em>his heirs. Equity cannot deprive him Of that security ; and, so long as he may by possibility be exposed to the danger of a recovery, his estate at law remains absolute. Any future conveyance from <em>Graves </em>to him could only operate by way of a <em>release of his equity of redemption ; </em>for <em>Graves </em>had nothing else left in himself. If, upon the faith of such a release, he advanced money to <em>Graves, </em>or became security for him in any of his pecuniary transactions, his <em>legal right </em>would at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>tacli thereto an <em>equitable </em>priority against any other equita<em>ble claim, </em>especially if his engagements, as security for Graves, were actually prior to <em>actual notice </em>of such <em>latent </em>claims. If a third mortgagee can, by purchasing the first mortgage, attach a priority to his own over the second, by thus acquiring the prior legal title, and the union of his own mortgage with it, will not the same reason apply more forcibly in <em>DuvaPs favour ? </em>He therefore had a right to a <em>perfect </em>indemnity, not only from the events intended to he provided against in the mortgage of <em>February </em>11, 1790, but from all other damages which be may have incurred, or still be exposed to, from his suretyships for <em>Graves ; </em>nor could a Court of Equity deprive him of either. Why then, might he not commute a contract for <em>future indem</em>nity, into one for <em>present </em>indemnity, by taking a release of <em>Graves\u2019s equity of redemption </em>of the lands, the <em>legal </em>title of which was already vested in himself ?</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">According to the decision of this Court in <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Randolph,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Duval, as a <em>purchaser for a valuable constderation, </em>is at liberty to aver and prove the <em>real consideration paid or agreed on, </em>between himself and <em>Tounghusband </em>on the one part, and <em>Graves </em>on the other, for the lands, as conveyed by the deed of <em>November 28, </em>1793. He states that they had become bound as securities for <em>Graves </em>to <em>William Alexander </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>The amount of that suretyship, and the time when it was undertaken by them, are therefore, it may be presumed, susceptible of proof. Nor must the security intended by the mortgage in <em>February, </em>1790, be lost sight of, if it can be proved that it entered into the view of the parties, when contracting for the absolute sale of the lands: <em>DuvaPs </em>equity must, therefore, prevail over <em>Bibb\u2019s, </em>as far as these matters extend. But, for any <em>actual payments </em>made by <em>Duval </em>to <em>Graves, </em>posterior to the information which the former received from <em>Bibb </em>at the house of <em>Johnson, </em>(if any such were made,) I think <em>Bibb </em>is fairly entitled to recover the amount thereof, with interest, towards the satisfaction of his claim against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>Graves </em>for any part of the purchas .--money of the land which may still remain due to him from Graves, but nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the Chancellor\u2019s decree be reversed, and the cause remanded for an account to be taken of any actual <em>payments </em>which may-have been made by <em>Duval </em>to Graves, subsequent to the <em>notice received </em>at <em>Johnson's </em>house, &amp;c. That an account of the balance due from <em>Graves </em>to <em>Bibb, </em>upon his bonds of the 13th of <em>December, </em>1788, for 200/. and for the three negroes, if any, upon a full settlement of all accounts between those parties, (except as to the <em>Kentucky </em>lands, for which <em>Bibb </em>appears to have taken an assignment of the <em>Waltons' </em>bonds, without any agreement on the part of <em>Graves </em>to be responsible, in case the lands were lost,) ought to be taken ; and for that purpose the personal representatives of <em>Graves </em>ought to he made parties to the suit; that <em>Duval </em>be considered liable for any <em>actual balance </em>due from him to <em>Graves, </em>as also for any <em>actual payments </em>made by him to <em>Graves </em>since the time of <em>Duval's </em>receiving <em>notice </em>of <em>Bibb's </em>equity, as before mentioned j and that the cause be sent back with directions accordingly-</p>\n<author id=\"b138-4\">Judges Roane and Fleming</author>\n<p id=\"AMi\">agreed that the deci-ee be reversed; and the following was entered as the unanimous opinion of the Court: \u201c The Court having maturely con- \u201c sidered, &amp;c. is of opinion that the said decree is erro- \u201c neous in this ; that the appellant, <em>William Duval, </em>having obtained from <em>Francis Graves, </em>before he had notice of \u00a3\u00a3 any equitable claim which the appellee, <em>Robert Fleming' </em>\u00a3( <em>Bibb, </em>might have on the lands sold by him to the said \u201c <em>Graves, </em>a conveyance in fee-simple, by way of mortgage, \u201c as a security against certain contingent damages to which \u201c the said appellant might be exposed from a claim-of \u201c <em>James Currie </em>to the houses and lots, before that time t\u00a3 sold and conveyed by the said <em>Graves </em>to the said appelst lant, and having, as he hath alleged in his answer, like-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>i* wise become bound, together with a certain <em>Isaac Young-</em>41 <em>husband </em>as a security to <em>William Alexander &amp;
