A., the defendant demurs to the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence; and by the evidence stated iu the demurrer, it appears, that R. A. died seized; there is no positive proof, that the plaintiffs, his heirs, ever entered after his death; but there is proof, that, the defendant\u2019s possession did not commence till a year after R, A.\u2019s death: Held, that, on this evidence in a demurrer to evidence, it may fairly be inferred, that R. A.\u2019s heirs entered into possession immediately upon their ancestor\u2019s death; and that, therefore, they are entitled to recover.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-8\">This was an appeal from a judgement of the district court held at <em>Hay Market, </em>rendered in May 1808. The cause had remained in this court, neglected by the parties, ever since until this term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-9\">It was an action of trespass <em>quare clausum, fregit, </em>brought by <em>Marsteller and wife </em>and others against <em>Coryell, </em>for a trespass on a half acre lot of land in the town of <em>Alexandria. </em>The defendant pleaded the general issue. And upon the trial, he demurred to the evidence of the plaintiffs, who joined in the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-10\">The evidence, set out at large in the demurrer, shewed, That the title of the lot in question was originally vested in the trustees of the town of <em>Alexandria, </em>and that they, by deed dated the 13th May 1765, conveyed the same to <em>James M\u2019Leod. </em>That <em>James M\u2019Leod, </em>by a verbal contract, sold the lot to one <em>Joseph Watson, </em>and put him in possession, hut made no conveyance thereof. That <em>Watson, </em>by verbal contract likewise, sold it to <em>Edward Higdon </em>and put him in possession; <em>Higdon </em>died in 1772, having by his will devised this lot to bis widow <em>Elizabeth Rigdon; </em>who sold it, by verbal contract, and delivery of possession, to <em>Richard Arell. </em>That, in the meantime, <em>James M\u2019Leod </em>had died, leaving <em>Robert M\u2019Leod </em>his son and heir at law; and that <em>Robert M\u2019Leod, </em>by deed dated the 15th September 1784, conveyed the lot to <em>Arell. </em>That <em>Arell </em>con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tinued to hold possession during his life, and died in actual possession, leaving the plaintiffs his heirs at law. And that the defendant entered upon the lot about a year after <em>ArelVs </em>death, lhis was the trespass complained of. There was nQ evi(jence to shew, that <em>ArelVs </em>heirs ever actually <em>entered </em>upon the premises after his death; nor any evidence to shew in whom the actual possession was, or that any one was in actual possession, during the interval between the death of Arell, and the taking of possession by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\">Verdict for the plaintiffs for 1230 <em>dollars, subject to the </em>opinion of the court, on the demurrer to evidence, whether the plaintiffs were entitled to recover in this action ? The court held that they were not, and gave judgement for the defendant; from which the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-6\"><em>Nicholas, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-7\"><em>Botts </em>and <em>Briggs, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b350-8\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AJRT\">The trustees of the town of <em>Alexandria </em>conveyed the premises in question <em>to Janies M'Leod, </em>who died leaving <em>Robert M\u2019Leod </em>bis heir at law; he conveyed to <em>Richard Arell, </em>who died leaving the plaintiffs his heirs at law. Thus, the title is complete. <em>Arell </em>had received possession from a purchaser by verbal contract under <em>James M\u2019Leod, </em>held possession for many years, without interruption, till his death, and died in possession. <em>Coryell </em>took possession a year afterwards; which was the trespass complained of. The point on which the district court decided the cause, was, doubtless, that there was no entry by <em>ArelVs </em>heirs after his death; for until entry, the heir cannot maintain trespass against an intruder. But, as there is proof that <em>Arell </em>died in possession, we think that, on a demurrer to evidence, an actual possession in his heirs <em>eo instante </em>that he died, may fairly be presumed; and, therefore, that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Judgement reversed, and judgement entered for the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
