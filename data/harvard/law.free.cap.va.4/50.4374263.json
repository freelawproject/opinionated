They fix the corners of the dividing line, and intend that the division shall be by a straight line from one -of these corners to the other: and the line is so described in their report, and so laid down on the plat which they return to the Court. In fact, however, the land being covered with a thick wood, the line which they mark is not straight. In cross actions of ejectment and trespass between the owners of the two tracts. Held : The line as it was intended to be, and not the marked line, is the true division line.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-14\">These were first, an action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit </em>by <em>Davis </em>v. Smith, and second, an ejectment by <em>Smith </em>v. Davis, in the Circuit Court of <em>Botetourt </em>county; and the only question in dispute was which was the true division line between their respective tracts of land. Both tracts had been parcel of a larger tract owned by <em>James M\u2019Crery </em>in his lifetime, and which was divided by commissioners among his heirs, after his death. <em>Davis </em>claimed by purchase from one of the heirs, and <em>Smith </em>had married another.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-15\">Both the corner trees of this division line were standing, and claimed as the true corners by both parties ;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_e\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>and the commissioners intended the dividing line should be a straight line, and directed the surveyor so to run it ; but the land being covered with a thick wood, the surveyor without intending it, ran and marked a curved line, so as to throw into the tract owned by <em>Davis, </em>near five acres of land, which if the line had been run straight, would have belonged to <em>Smith\u2019s </em>tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-4\">After the division line had been thus run and marked, the person under whom <em>Davis </em>claimed built a fence along it, which had remained there about eight or ten years; but <em>Smith </em>having had the lino run by a surveyor, and thus ascertained the fact that the marked line was not a straight line, he shortly thereafter removed the fence from the curved to the straight line, but putting it on his side of the straight line. <em>Davis </em>thereupon brought this suit, and <em>Smith </em>then brought his.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">The causes were tried together, and on the trial <em>Smith </em>moved the Court to instruct the jury \u201c that if they believed from the evidence that the commissioners who divided the land intended to run the said division line as a straight line between the two ascertained corners, then a straight line was the true division line between these parties, unless the jury should believe from the evidence, that the wife of said <em>Smith </em>agreed to the running of the crooked line <em>; </em>and she and her husband the said <em>Smith, </em>had acquiesced in said crooked line as the true division line between them and the said <em>Davis, </em>or the person under whom he claimed, for fifteen years before the ejectment was brought.\u201d The Court refused to give this instruction <em>; </em>and instructed the jury, that if the division line was actually run and marked at the time the division of the land was made between the heirs of <em>James M\u2019Crery </em>deceased, and that the line then marked was the crooked line laid down on the plat returned by the surveyor, then they ought to find for <em>Davis, </em>although the call of the plat and report of the commissioners who made the partition, may bo for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>straight division line. The jury found a verdict for <em>Davis </em>in his action of trespass, and for <em>Smith </em>in his ejectment; whereupon the Court refused to set aside the first, but. set aside the second verdict; and <em>Smith </em>having excepted to the opinion of the Court, applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-2\"><em>John T.

Therefore, the judgment is reversed with costs, the verdict and judgment is set aside, and the cause remanded for a new trial of the issue joined.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
