And, as to the <em>time </em>of <em>Ambrose Lee\u2019s </em>purchase, she relied on an account of <em>William </em>Cabell, jun. against <em>Carter </em>Braxton, to show that the said <em>Ambrose </em>was alive on the 9th of <em>October, </em>1762, and that a survey of the land which <em>he </em>purchased of <em>Carter </em>Braxton, was <em>then </em>made for <em>him; </em>that the date of the said <em>Carter Braxton\u2019s </em>birth appeared, from an inscription on a tomb-stone erected by his father (the patentee of the land in question) over the body of his mother, to have been the 10th of September, 1736, which would scarcely have left time for him to sell . land to <em>Ambrose </em>Lee, after he came to full age in the year 1757; circumstances which, when connected with the date of the deed for the land in question, from <em>Carter Braxton </em>to <em>Francis Lee, </em>son of <em>Ambrose, </em>(which was <em>May </em>3d, 1765,) 44 rendered all the allegations, in the bill, suggest-44 ing <em>error, </em>improbable.\u201d This part of the answer seems intended to counteract <em>the ex parte </em>44 deposition\u201d or 44 affidavit\u201d of <em>Frances </em>Tucker, late <em>Frances </em>Lee, widow of the said <em>Ambrose </em>Lee, which stated that, he purchased the land of <em>Carter Braxton </em>in the <em>summer of </em>1757.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-4\">The deposition of <em>David Woodroof, </em>taken after the answer was filed, proved \u201c that <em>Ambrose Lee </em>acted as 44 overseer or steward for <em>Carter </em>Braxton, prior to the \u201c year 1760, and some years after; that he resided on 44 the said <em>Braxton\u2019s </em>land, and purchased land of him at 44 different times; and that the land on which Mrs. 44 <em>Nancy Shields </em>(late <em>Nancy Lee) </em>now resides, is a part 44 of the first purchase, <em>-which was made prior to the </em>44 <em>year </em>1760; but the witness did not know when the 44 said land was paid for, nor when the deed for it was 44 made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ac8e\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>It had been proved by evidence filed in the original suit, that Mrs. <em>Braxton\u2019s </em>marriage with <em>Carter Braxton, </em>took place the 15th of <em>May, 1760. </em>The account in the hand-writing of <em>William Cabell, </em>jun.

That <em>Cat ter Braxton\u2019s </em>seisin of the absolute <em>legal </em>estate at the time of the marriage being proved, and no conveyance thereof having been made by him until afterwards, the appellant was certainly entitled to dower. As in the case of <em>Claiborne and wife </em>v. <em>Henderson,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was decided that, before the act of 1/85, a widow was not dowable where the husband had held only the <em>equitable </em>estate, (having no deed, though in possession of the land,) it would be hard that she should not have dower where the legal estate remained in him until after the marriage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-4\">Judge Roane suggested a point, whether advantage could be taken of <em>any </em>error in the process or proceedings previous to the decree, upon a bill of review for error <em>upon the face of the decree, </em>and referred to <em>Quarrier </em>v. <em>Carter\u2019s </em>Representatives.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-10\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARj\">It should appear from \u2022 the proceedings, that the <em>answer </em>was filed ; and <em>this </em>should be considered as part of the decree. If there was no answer, there should have been process of contempt <em>; </em>and, to shew this, the burthen of proof lies on the other side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-11\">Rut, even if an answer had been filed, the decree should have given the infants leave to open the cause at a future day, the answer of a <em>guardian </em>being of no consequence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-12\">On the <em>merits, </em>on that branch of the question which relates to the discovery of <em>new </em>matter, the original decree was pronounced on the principle that <em>Braxton sold the land after </em>the marriage : the bill of review was on the ground that he had sold it, and put <em>Ambrose Lee </em>in possession <em>before </em>the marriage, though the <em>deed </em>was not made until after the marriage ; which allegation is fully proved by the testimony of <em>David Woodroof.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-13\">Such being the case, the question resolves itself to this ; jf a bachelor, seised in fee of lands prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>year <em>1760, </em>contracted to sell them, received part of the purchase-money, delivered possession to the purchaser without making a deed, and, having afterwards married, made a deed, during- the coverture, and died in <em>1797 </em>; whether his widow, having had notice of the purchaser's possession before the marriage, is entitled to dower of such lands ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-3\">The question, thus stated, was argued at some length by <em>Randolph </em>against, and <em>Warden in favour of the widow ; </em>but, for the sake of brevity, this argument is omitted, the Court having been of opinion that the <em>facts </em>presented by the evidence did not render the point necessary to be decided in this case.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b398-4\">Saturday, <em>Nov. 11.</em></decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AjgJ\">The Judges Tucker and Roane pronounced their opinions ; Judge Fleming being absent through indisposition.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\"> 3 <em>Hen. &amp; Munf. </em>322.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\"> <em>Ante, </em>p. 242.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b398-5\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak_\">Mrs. <em>Braxton </em>brought a bill against several persons, and, among others, the appellants, for dower, and obtained an absolute decree against them, without any plea or answer in their behalf, by their mother, who was appointee: guardian <em>ad </em>litem, but who is neither shewn to have appeared, or to have been served with notice of that order, neither was there any decree nisi, or notice of such a decree against these defendants or their guardian, to be discovered in the record, in the original suit. Afterwards, they brought a bill of review by their next friend, and assigned the following reasons for setting aside that decree : First, that the yearly profits of the dower lands were rated too high by the Commissioners appointed by the Court to value the same ; secondly, that they were not defended in the <em>suit; </em>and, thirdly, \u201c that they have discovered since the said \u201c decree was pronounced, that <em>A. </em>Lee, their grandfather, <em>11 </em>purchased the lands in question of <em>Carter </em>Braxton, and, they are informed and believe, was let into poses-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>4* slon thereof by the said <em>Carter Braxton, prior - </em>to 44 his marriage with the complainant Elizabeth, although 44 the deed conveying the legal title <em>night </em>not have been 64 made until after the marriage j wherefore they conceive 64 that she has no title to dower iu the lands, which, in 44 equity, belonged <em>to </em>another before her marriage with '\u25a04 the said <em>Cat ter B axicn\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">As to the first of die points&gt; there is no proof in the record, that I can discover, that the lands were estimated too high by the Commissioners. But, inasmuch as the hill against them was not regularly taken for confessed, nor any decree <em>irsi </em>in the cause either served upon them, or tfcvir guardian appointed by the Court to defend them in that suit, ncr does any such decree appeal- to have been everrarde in the cause, as to them or their guardian, nor any proof that the person so appointed guardian, either liad notice of such appointment, or voluntarily appeared to defend the suit, nor that any day was given to the infants to shew cause against the decree when they should respectively come of age, I think the decree, as to them, was not only erroneous, but absolutely void ; and, consequently, the decree of the Chancellor, reversing that decree upon this bill of review, as to those defendants, is so far perfectly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">As to the abstract question which was argued, whether, . if a man seised of lands in fee-simple, aliene the same for a valuable consideration, and <em>gives </em>the purchaser possession of them, and then marides, and then cxeccutes a conveyance for the lands ; whether, in this case the wife shall not be barred of her dower in a Court of Equity ? ft is, I conceive, not necessary to decide it at present. Cases ur-iy be put, which I think would operate as a bar of dower. As if a seised of lands in fee-simple, should marry h woman privately, and then, with her privity and consent, sell his lands for a valuable consideration, and execute a convcvance for them to the purchaser, and die, and then the wife should demand dower of the lands so aliened, and show that the same was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>done after her marriage ; yet in that case she ought te be barred by reason of the fraud and covin on her part., as well as on the part of the husband; and this, notwithstanding she might have been an <em>infant </em>as well as a <em>feme covert </em>at the time of the alienation. For <em>covin </em>and consent, as Sir <em>Edward Coke </em>expresses it, in such a case should <em>suffocate </em>the right which appertained' to her, and the wrongful manner avoid the matter that is lawful <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and this at common law as well as in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\">But the record before us presents no such case. The suggestions in the bill are extremely vague, and the evidence of <em>David Woodroof </em>the only witness to that point, (for I throw the affidavits taken before the bill filed, out of the question,) is equally so. If the fact were, that <em>Lee </em>purchased as early as the year <em>1757, </em>and that he continued in <em>Braxton\u2019s </em>employ as his steward, residing upon the principality in extent, which <em>Braxton </em>held in a remote county, and made purchases from him from, time to time, without demanding conveyances for the lands so purchased, the charge of covin and concealment might, perhaps, be retorted upon him. At least, such <em>laches </em>on his part, would afford a strong argument in favour of Mrs. <em>Braxton\u2019s </em>claim to her dower. Besides, the clause of warranty in <em>Braxton\u2019s </em>deed, was probably intended to afford a compensation to <em>Lee </em>from <em>Braxton\u2019s </em>heirs, incase his* wife should survive him and, demand her dower of these lands. And such a warranty was at that time an ample security for such compensation ; as <em>Braxton </em>had more than twenty times as much land in the tract upon which <em>Lee </em>resided as his steward. Having accepted the warranty under such circumstances, I think he ought not to be let in to defeat the legal rights of the widow, but left to his remedy against the heirs of Mr. Braxton, upon the warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The whole merits of the case being brought before th&amp; Chancellor by the bill of review, and the defendant\u2019s answer thereunto, and the cause being equally open as up-\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>jn a rehearing,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> I think the Chancellor ought to have decreed to the complainant in the Original suit, her dower in the lands of the complainants in the bill of review, to be assigned to her by Commissioners for that purpose to be appointed, and a valuation of the annual rents and profits thereof to be made by them, from the\u2014\u2014 day of June, 1800, when the original bill was filed against the present appellants ; and to be paid to the present appellee by the appellants or their guardian, unless the parties, to avoid the expense of such Commissioners, should agree to the former report, survey, and allotment, in the original <em>suit; </em>or should agree to make a new allotment only, without any other report or survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">A regular consequence of the preceding opinion is, that the decree upon the forfeited forthcoming bond, taken upon a writ of <em>fieri </em>facias, sued out in behalf of the appellant, against the appellees, on the first mentioned decree, ought to remain as a security, so far as it will extend, for the payments of the rents, issues, and profits, which may be awarded to the appellant in pursuance of the decree now to be made, and her costs of suit: and, therefore, that the decree, reversing that decree with costs, is erroneous, and ought to be reversed, and the cause sent back, with directions to be proceeded in according to the principles in the decree now to be made.</p>\n<author id=\"b401-6\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"ASRZ\">The decree of the 26th of March, 1802, is erroneous, so far as it relates to the present appellees, in this, that no day is given them, being infants, to shew cause against the same, after they shall have attained their age. It is also erroneous in this, that the decree v/as rendered without any answer being filed on. the part of the appellees, nor was the bill regularly taken for confessed as to them : and both these errors are. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>t0 </em>considered, as errors apparent on the face of the decree itself.</p>\n<p id=\"Afc7\">For this cause, then, and not on the ground of new matter, or of an excessive allowance for profits, (admitting the cause to have been regularly heard,) the bill of review-was rightly ordered, to be received by this Court. This ground of error went to the <em>-whole </em>decree; and, therefore, the Chancellor\u2019s <em>partial </em>allowance of the bill was erroneous. From anote I have of the case when it was formerly before the Court, <em>this </em>was; the real ground on which the bill of review was directed to be received <em>; </em>though the Chancellor might have been misled in this particular, by the transcript of the judgment of this Court, it stating, (after having said that the bill should not have been rejected,) that \u201cthe appellants should \u201c have been permitted, in the ordinary course, to prove \u201c the allegations thereofwhence it might be inferred, that the bill was allowed by this Court on the <em>merits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">If, upon those merits, the cause were now in <em>favour </em>of the appellees, although it was not regularly proceeded in as to them, the decree of reversal ought, perhaps, to be simply confirmed, and the cause entirely ended: and this brings us to consider those merits. As to the allowance of <em>profits </em>by the Commissioners, they state that the one third of the land which fell to the widow, was superior in value to the other two thirds of the tract: they regret this, and submit it to the consideration of the Court; but, perhaps, the Court can find no remedy therefor, inasmuch as the law seems to require that, in dower, the land is to be divided into three equal parts, and then <em>allotted; </em>which was done in this cas\u00e9. The profits of the whole land are estimated by the Commissioners at 150 dollars <em>per annum; </em>and, certainly, therefore, fifty dollars are not an extravagant allowance for <em>this </em>third. The proofs, too, by the appellees\u2019 witnesses, only reduce the value, severally, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the opinions of the witnesses, to forty and forty-five dollars <em>per annum. </em>If, therefore, the decree had been regular in other respects, no objection would lie to it on account of an excessive allowance for profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">With respect to the <em>new </em>matter; it is said to have been discovered since the former decree, that <em>Ambrose Lee </em>purchased, and was put into possession of the lands in question, prior to Mr. <em>Braxton\u2019s </em>marriage j but the allegation goes on to <em>admit </em>that the deeds might not have been made from <em>Braxton </em>to Lee, until <em>after </em>the marriage. This allegation is therefore a complete <em>felo de se, </em>unless, this sale and possession were known to Mrs. <em>Braxton </em>at the time of the marriage, (which is not charged in the bill, nor proved,) and unless Mr. <em>Randolph </em>is also correct in placing purchasers by marriage on the same footing, in equity, in this respect, with other subsequent purchasers with notice. This is a very important question ; but the facts in the present case do not make its decision absolutely necessary. I have found no cases placing a wife on a common footing with other purchasers with notice. So many considerations superior to that of <em>interest, </em>combine together with it, in relation to marriages, that I think it at least doubtful whether the ordinary doctrines with respect to <em>money purchasers </em>will apply also to the case of <em>marriage. </em>It seems unreasonable to require the wife, in the language of those cases, as soon as an adverse title is discovered, to stop her hand from completing the marriage, especially after the affections are engaged: on this point, however, I give no con - clusive opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">But, admitting for the present, that a wife stands on the same footing with other subsequent purchasers, let us test this case by the ground on which such purchasers are postponed in equity to prior purchasers who have not a <em>legal </em>title. In the case of <em>Le Neve </em>v. <em>Le Neve,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is said that the intent of the registration act being to secure subsequent purchasers against <em>secret </em>con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>veyaqces, a subsequent purchaser shall be postponed to a prior-unregistered deed, if he had <em>notice </em>thereof; for that then ]le could n0t be prejudiced- This clear principie of equity will run through, and apply to every analogous case: and, accordingly, it is applied in the same act to the statut\u00e9 of enrolments of <em>27 'Hen. </em>VIII. which is pretty similar to our act of 1710; in short, it is applied to a case which is precisely the case at bar, if the wife is to be considered merely in the light of a subsequent bargainee for money. In that case it is held, that such subsequent bargainee shall be affected with <em>notice </em>of a prior right, in the same manner as if the prior purchaser had been by <em>feoffment </em>with livery of seisin. The ground on which these decisions go, (both on the acts of registration, and enrolment,) is that, \u201c although \u201c the subsequent purchaser has the <em>legal </em>estate, he is \u00a3- yet left open to any equity which a prior purchaser \u201c may have, and is postponed, because, having notice, he \u201c might have stopped his hand from pr\u00f3ceeding.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYv\">The ground, more particularly, on which this postponement takes place is, that the taking the legal estate after notice of a prior purchase, makes the party a <em>mala fde </em>purchaser; that it is <em>&amp; fraud, </em>and a species of <em>dolus malus ; </em>and that it is a <em>machinatio ad circumveniendum.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But when fraud and an unjustifiable machination is to be imputed, the proof of <em>notice </em>must be clear : and, accordingly, it is held in <em>Hinc </em>v. <em>Dodd,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that \u201c a mere \u201c <em>suspicion </em>of notice\u201d is not sufficient to induce the Court to break in upon an act of parliament; and that there must be clear and undoubted notice, to be a proper ground of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In the case before us, independently of its not being charged or shewn that Mrs. <em>Braxton </em>knew of the sale to, or possession by, <em>Ambrose Lee, </em>that possession, at most, was very equivocal: it was, at most, but \u201c a mere suspicion of notice.\u201d It was of a piece of <em>wood land </em>connected with a larger tract, of which it was originally part, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>liolden by a steward, who also held the whole tract; and therefore his possession did not afford that clear <em>indicium </em>of property, which results from a separate, exclusive possession of a distinct and separate tract of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">This case, therefore, is deficient in facts whereon to oust Mrs. <em>Braxton </em>in equity of her <em>legal </em>title to dower ; even admitting that, in general, she is to be considered as an ordinary purchaser for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Upon the whole, my opinion is, that the decree now before us is correct in reversing the decree of <em>March </em>6th, 1802, and the decree of <em>March </em>12th, 1803, founded thereon ; but that, the reversal being justified in part on the ground that the original decree was rendered without the cause being properly matured for hearing as to these appellees, the decree before us is erroneous in not having further provided for a regular procedure against them from the bill upwards <em>; </em>which being done, the cause would come on regularly to be tried on the merits: therefore, reversing the decree on this ground only, I am of opinion, that the cause be remanded for further proceedings from the bill, as amended, so as to make the appellees parties; and that the appellees should recover their costs, as the party substantially prevailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">The following was entered as the opinion of the Court, viz. \u201c that there is no error in the said decree of the 44 Superior Court of Chancery, reversing so much of the \u201c decree of the 26th of March, 1802, as relates to the \u201c present appellees, and the decree of the 12th of March, \u201c 1803, founded thereon ; the said first mentioned de- \u201c cree having neither allowed the appellees (being <em>in-</em>44 <em>fants) </em>a day <em>to </em>shew cause against the same after they 44 attained their age, nor was grounded upon any an- \u201c swer of the appellees by their guardian or next friend, 44 regularly exhibited, nor, in default thereof, was the bill 46 as to them decreed to be taken for confessed: but that 4{ the said decree is erroneous in not setting aside all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>CC ^le proceedings in the said cause, as relative to the \u201c present appellees, subsequent to the bill, and provi<em>a </em>ding that the cause should be regularly matured for \u00ab trial on the merits, but instead thereof, barring the pre- \u201c sent appellant from a recovery td which she may be \u201c justly entitled: therefore, it is decreed and ordered, \u201c that the said decree be affirmed as far as it goes, and \u201c that the appellant pay to the appellees, as the parties \u201c substantially prevailing in this Court, their costs by \u201c them about their defence in this behalf expended. \u201c And this Court, proceeding to make such decree \u201c as the said Superior Court of Chancery ought to have \u201c made, doth further decree and order, that all the pro- \u201c ceedings in the cause, in which the decree of the 26th \u201c of March, 1802, was rendered, be set aside, subsequent \u201c to the amended bill by which the appellees were made \u201c parties, so far as they relate to \u25a0 the present appellees ; \u201c and that the cause be regularly proceeded in and ma- \u201c tured for a hearing by the said Superior Court of \u201c Chancery, in order to a just decision upon the merits; \u201c for which purpose the cause aforesaid is remanded to \u201c the said Superior Court of Chancery.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A9t\"> <em>Co.
