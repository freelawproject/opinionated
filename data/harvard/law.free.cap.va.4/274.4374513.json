Sperry &amp; Co. </em>and endorsed by <em>Joseph Slagle, </em>for the accommodation of the makers. This note was renewed from time to time, with <em>Slagle </em>as the only endorser thereon until June 1833. During this period, he had taken a deed of trust on a house and lot in <em>Winchester, </em>to indemnify him against loss on account of his endorsement. In 1833, <em>Sperry &amp; Co. </em>becoming embarrassed, the bank made an order requiring another endorser on the note, or that the property conveyed to indemnify <em>Slagle </em>should be insured. Under this order, <em>Jacob Cooper </em>became the endorser of the note <em>; Slagle </em>being first, and <em>Cooper </em>second endorser. The bank, however, was not satisfied with <em>Cooper, </em>and continued its order; and in May 1834, <em>Peter Rust </em>endorsed the note as last endorser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-4\">At the time <em>Rust </em>endorsed the note, he knew that <em>Sperry &amp; Co. </em>were embarrassed, and he endorsed it on the faith of <em>Slagle\u2019s </em>solvency, of which <em>Sperry &amp; Co. </em>were fully aware; though it does not appear that either <em>Rust </em>or <em>Sperry &amp; Co. </em>so informed <em>Slagle.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\">The note continued to be renewed and discounted at the bank until September 1835, with the same endorsers in the same order, <em>Slagle </em>being the first, <em>Cooper </em>the second, and <em>Rust </em>the third; and <em>Rust, </em>who lived some miles from <em>Winchester, </em>was accustomed to endorse blank notes, which were left with <em>Sperry &amp; Co. </em>for the purpose of renewing the note, with his name written on the face of the note, under the words \u201ccredit the makers.\u201d The note which was discounted in September 1835, had been thus endorsed by <em>Rust </em>and left with <em>Sperry &amp; Co.; </em>and it was made payable, not to <em>Slagle, </em>as had been previously done, but to <em>Cooper, </em>and <em>Cooper </em>endorsed it, writing his name so close above <em>Rust\u2019s </em>that there was not room between them for <em>Slagle </em>to write his name. It was then taken to <em>Slagle </em>by one of the makers, and <em>Slagle </em>wrote his name below <em>Rust\u2019s. </em>When the note was handed by <em>Sperry </em>to the bank ofii<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>cer, it was objected to on the ground that <em>Must </em>had, by writing his name under the words \u201ccredit the makers,\u201d transferred the proceeds to <em>Sperry &amp; Co., </em>and that therefore nothing passed to <em>Slagle: </em>and to obviate the objection, he suggested that <em>Slagle\u2019s </em>name should be erased, the name of <em>Sperry </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>should be endorsed next under <em>Rust\u2019s, </em>and then <em>Slagle </em>should endorse after them, and should also write his name under <em>Rust\u2019s </em>on the face of the note. This was accordingly done, and the note so endorsed was discounted, and when it fell due, was protested for nonpayment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-14\">The bank afterwards brought separate actions against <em>Slagle </em>and <em>Rust, </em>as endorsers on the note, and obtained judgments, and having sued out execution on the judgment against <em>Rust, </em>it was levied on his property, but before a sale thereof, he died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-15\">After the death of <em>Rust, </em>his administrator <em>Griffin Frost </em>enjoined the sale under the execution, on the ground that <em>Rust </em>had endorsed the note of <em>Sperry &amp; Co. </em>expressly on the faith of the prior endorsement of <em>Slagle; </em>and that the bank and <em>Slagle </em>had, without his consent, changed the order of the endorsements to his prejudice. He made the bank, <em>Slagle </em>and others, defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-16\">The bank having been enjoined from proceeding on their execution against <em>Rust, </em>issued an execution on their judgment against <em>Slagle; </em>whereupon he enjoined the proceeding upon that execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-17\">The Court afterwards dissolved both injunctions, and the amount of the debt was paid to the bank by <em>Slagle. </em>And the causes coming on together to be finally heard, the Court held that, as between <em>Rust\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r and <em>Slagle, </em>the latter was bound to pay the debt; and it was decreed that the bill should be dismissed as against the bank without costs, and that <em>Slagle </em>should pay the plaintiff his costs; and the bill in the second suit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>dismissed with costs. From this decree, <em>Slagle </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-4\"><em>Brooke </em>and Cooke, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-5\"><em>Patton </em>and Robinson, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b297-6\">I3r the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A-i\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
