AUergue </em>(who was the mother of the plaintiff and of this defendant) and <em>.Lodowiclc Brown, </em>the surety of <em>Raymond </em>in his administration bond; charging, that <em>Raymond </em>had settled his accounts of administration before a commissioner appointed by the hustings court of <em>Petersburg, </em>and by that account appeared to be indebted to bis intestate\u2019s estate in a balance of 872 dollars, of which the plaintiff as his codistributee was entitled to a moiety, and that he had never paid the same to her; surcharging and falsifying that account in several important particulars specified in the bill; and praying an account, and a decree for the plaintiff\u2019s share of the just balance which should be found due thereon, against <em>Raymond </em>and <em>Brown </em>his surety. <em>Raymond </em>did not appear and answer, and as to him the bill was regularly taken <em>pro confesso. </em>But <em>Brown </em>put in his answer, in which he alleged, that a full and final settlement had been made between <em>Raymond </em>and the plaintiff his sister; that he transferred to her, and she received property to the full amount of her share of their mother\u2019s estate, and she thereupon released him, formally by deed, from all demands on this account; and that this settlement was made, in order that <em>Raymond </em>might fulfil the purpose he then had, of leaving the country, without exposing his surety to loss, and he had since gone away; and he insisted, therefore, that the plaintiff was not entitled to the account prayed in her bill. The truth of the answer was proved. And the cause coming on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>for hearing as to <em>Raymond </em>by default, and as to <em>Brown </em>on t[le bill, answer, replication thereto, exhibits and depositions, the chancellor dismissed the bill both as to <em>Raymond </em>and <em>Brown, </em>and gave them both a decree for costs. From this decree, the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-4\">The cause was argued by <em>Allison </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnIY\">and <em>Spooner </em>for the appellee. There was some discussion upon the merits, whether the proofs established the defence set up in <em>Browrfs </em>answer; but of that the court saw no reason to doubt. The only point of law was a question of practice ; namely, whether, as the allegations of the bill stood confessed as to <em>Raymond, </em>he standing out in default, it was proper to dismiss the bill as to him as well as <em>Brown </em>?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b604-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AWC\">Though the bill was taken for confessed as to <em>Raymond </em>for want of an appearance and answer, yet his codefendant and surety answered, denied (as far as he could deny) the allegations of the bill, and has disproved them. He is then entitled to a dismissal, clearly. Now, his defence did not rest on matter separate, distinct, and applying only to himself. Admitting <em>Raymond </em>to be indebted, the surety had no defence. He defended himself by disproving the charge against his principal, for whom he was bound. They are conjunct in interest. If <em>Raymond </em>had wasted or purloined the estate, the other defendant was bound as his surety, and could not be discharged. The case is therefore clearly within the principle of <em>Clason </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>10 Johns. Rep. 524. Were it otherwise, it would lead to this absurdity, that after dismissing the bill as to the surety, and decreeing against <em>Raymond, </em>the plaintiff might immediately bring her suit on the bond against the surety, and recover at law, though he had been discharged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
