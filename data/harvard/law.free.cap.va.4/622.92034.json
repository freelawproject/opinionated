That execution was sued by <em>Alcock, </em>and delivered to the sheriff; and if <em>Alcock </em>had not suspended proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>thereon, the debt might have been levied o&amp;the property of the principals; they being solvent at the time; but <em>Alcock, </em>without the consent or knowledge of the plaintiff <em>Pitman IIill, </em>gave written directions to the sheriff, to suspend proeeedings on the execution till he should give further instructions. That <em>Richard Hill, </em>one of the principal debtors, had delivered a slave to one <em>llore, </em>to be sold, and the proceeds applied to the discharge of the debt due to <em>Alcock, </em>of which <em>Alcock </em>was informed, and afterwards offered the slave for sale himself, and might have sold him at any time, or procured the sale; and it was because <em>Alcock </em>had the means thus placed in his own hands or power, of obtaining satisfaction of his demand, that he directed proceedings on his execution to be suspended. That the plaintiff <em>Pitman Hill, </em>being also apprised of these facts, took no steps to secure indemnity against loss by reason of his suretyship. That <em>Alcock </em>forbore any further proceedings for many years, until all the other obligors in the forthcoming bond had become insolvent, but had lately sued out an execution, and caused it to be levied on the property of the plaintiff. Therefore, the bill prayed an injunction to inhibit <em>Alcock </em>from further proceedings, on his last mentioned execution, against the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-4\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-5\"><em>Alcock, </em>in his answer, said, that when the plaintiff <em>Pitman Ilill, </em>became surety in the forthcoming bond, he did so, because he was told by the sheriff, and therefore expected, that indulgence could be obtained from <em>Alcock, </em>by the principal debtor <em>Richard Hill, </em>so soon as the debt should be secured by a forthcoming bond ; and it was because <em>Alcock </em>was apprised that this assurance had been given, and was content with such security, that he directed the sheriff to suspend proceedings on the execution, which was after-wards issued by the clerk on the forthcoming bond : that his suspension of proceedings was a mere indulgence given without consideration, and he did not thereby preclude himself from proceeding whenever he should think proper, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>he would have proceeded at any time, if the sureties had required him to do so: and that, if <em>Richard Hill </em>did deliver a slave to <em>Hore </em>to be sold for the purpose of satisfying the debt, it was a transaction between <em>Hill </em>and <em>Hore, </em>to which he, <em>Alcock, </em>was nowise privy: he never offered the slave for sale, nor had any power to make such sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-4\">It appeared in proof, that when <em>Pitman Hill </em>joined in the forthcoming bond as surety, he was told by the sheriff, that <em>Alcock </em>would give <em>Richard Hill, </em>the principal, time to discharge the debt, provided satisfactory surety was given in the forthcoming bond ; and that <em>Alcoclc </em>obtained an award of execution on the forthcoming <em>bond; </em>and an execution having been issued, he then directed, in general terms, that proceedings should be suspended till further instructions. It appeared also, that <em>Richard Hill </em>did deliver a slave to <em>Hore, </em>to be sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of the debt due <em>Alcock, </em>and that this slave died in <em>Hore\u2019s </em>possession. But it was doubtful upon the evidence, whether the other allegations of the bill in respect to this slave, were true; namely, that he was delivered by <em>Richard Hill </em>to <em>Hore, </em>before the forthcoming bond was executed, with power to sell him, and with authority to <em>Alcock </em>to direct the sale, to pay the debt due him, and that this was the consideration on which <em>Alcoclc </em>gave the indulgence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\">The chancellor thinking that the allegations of the bill were proved, perpetuated the injunction. And this <em>court, </em>upon the petition of <em>Alcoclc </em>allowed him an appeal from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-6\">The cause was argued by <em>Stanard </em>for the appellant, and <em>Briggs </em>and <em>Leigh </em>for the <em>appellee.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABP\">The argument turned chiefly on the controverted question of fact above stated.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b648-7\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aj6\">It was admitted by the appellee\u2019s counsel, that <em>Alcoclds </em>suspension of proceedings on his execution, would nowise impair his remedy against the surety, if that suspension was merely voluntary on his part. But they insisted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>that it was in consequence of an agreement upon valuable consideration, which tied up <em>Alcock\u2019s </em>hands, and therefore released the surety ; an agreement, namely, that one of the principal debtors should put a slave in <em>Alcock\u2019s </em>hands, or under his power, to be sold for the debt, and that in consideration of this the execution should be suspended ; which agreement, they said, was complied with by the delivery of the slave to <em>More </em>to be sold by him for the purpose, or to be sold when <em>Alcock </em>should so require. If this case had been made out by the proofs, the counsel would have had pretty strong grounds to stand on. But to my mind, the evidence <em>proves </em>no such agreement. On the contrary, I think the evidence proves that the slave was put into <em>Horc\u2019s </em>hands, but never into the possession or under the power of <em>Alcock; </em>and that this was a transaction between <em>Richard Hill </em>and <em>Hore, </em>to which <em>Alcock </em>was not a party, and which, indeed, was subsequent to the indulgence given by <em>Alcock, </em>and was nowise the consideration on which <em>Alcock </em>gave the indulgence. The circumstances detailed iu the evidence, instead of disproving, corroborate <em>Alcock\u2019s </em>answer. This case, therefore, belongs to that class of cases, in which it has been held, that a voluntary indulgence given by a creditor to the principal debtor, does not impair the creditor\u2019s remedy against the surety. The case of <em>Waller </em>v. <em>M\u2019Kenny, </em>1 Leigh 434. is in point for the appellant. The decree should be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Cabell and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Tucker, <em>P. </em>The direction given by <em>Alcock </em>to the sheriff, to suspend proceedings on his execution, against the principal, till further directed, was not of itself sufficient to discharge the surety. If, indeed, a creditor engages, for a good consideration, to give indulgence, so as to tie up his hands from proceeding at any moment he may be required by the surety to do so, the surety is absolved, unless such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>indulgence is given with his assent. The constituents of ..... , ... <em>r . , </em>this principle, are, 1. a consideration ; lor without it, a promise to indulge is not binding : 2. a promise or agreement to indulge; for without it, the hands of the creditor are not tied, whatever collateral security he may have received : 3. that the promise should not be altogether indefinite; for an indefinite promise of forbearance is void and nugatory, and is held not to be an adequate consideration to support even a promise, since the forbearance might be but an hour, which would be a forbearance indeed, but of no advantage to <em>the </em>debtor: and 4. that the surety should not have assented to the indulgence given.</p>\n<p id=\"A5v\">Trying this case upon these principles, I.think it very clear, that the surety was not absolved. For, as to the trans-r action at the time of the execution on the forthcoming bond, I think the evidence proves, that the probable motive of the appellee for joining in it as a surety, was the expectation of getting that indulgence for his friend, .which the sheriff assured him might be obtained from <em>Alcock, </em>upon the debt being secured by a forthcoming bond. To this indulgence then,'\u2014if, indeed, the promise of it, thus unauthorized, by the sheriff, and the indefinite character of it, could bind <em>Al-cock </em>at all,\u2014the surety himself assented. It was the consideration upon which he entered into the bond. Surely, he cannot complain that that has been done which was pro-raised by the sheriff on <em>Alcock\u2019s </em>behalf, and was the operative motive with himself for joining in the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">With regard to the transaction respecting the slave put into the possession of fibre; this, it is alleged, was a consideration for the indulgence, and sufficient to bind <em>Alcock. </em>Admitting the facts as they are contended for, although here was a consideration, yet there was no promise, unless we resort to the original promise at the time the bond was given. Now the fact, that the principal placed collateral security in <em>Alcock\u2019s </em>hands, which has been lost without his default (as, in this case, by the death of the pledge), is not sufficient to discharge the surety, unless accompanied by a promise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>specified forbearance. No such promise is proved, or even charged.</p>\n<p id=\"ApdY\">We must go back then to the promise at the time the bond was given, or there is no promise in the case. And if we do, we can see in the indulgence given, until <em>More </em>could make such sale of the property as would be just to all parties concerned, nothing but a fair, <em>bon\u00e1 fide, </em>and honorable compliance with the engagement made by the sheriff and ratified by <em>Alcock, </em>that he would give <em>Richard Hill </em>time to discharge the debt, provided a forthcoming bond was given with satisfactory surety; upon the faith of which promise, as I conceive, the appellee did become a surety. He cannot complain of a compliance with it, and therefore ought not to have sought this injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Decree reversed, and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
