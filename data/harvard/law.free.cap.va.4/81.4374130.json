To this judgment <em>Spitler </em>obtained an injunction, and <em>M\u2019Cluer </em>was his surety in the injunction bond. In 1838 this injunction was dissolved; and <em>Adams </em>then brought an action on the bond and recovered a judgment against <em>M\u2019Cluer\u2019s </em>adm\u2019rs, which was discharged by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-12\">At the time the original judgment was obtained by <em>Adams </em>against <em>Spitler </em>he owned several small tracts of land in the county of <em>Botetourt. </em>One of these he sold and conveyed to <em>Peter Noffsinger </em>by deed dated the 14th of August 1832. He conveyed another tract to <em>Noffsinger </em>by deed dated the 18th of October 1833, which was acknowledged before two justices of the peace on the 22d of the same month. On the 29th of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>September 1832, he executed to <em>Joseph Rodgers </em>a bond, in which he acknowledged the receipt from <em>Rodgers </em>of 120 dollars as the price of a <em>tract </em>of land he had sold , ancj bound himself to make <em>Rodgers </em>a title to the ian(j wj\u00a1thin twelve months from the date: and on the 21st of October 1833, he did execute to <em>Rodgers </em>a deed for the land. This deed was acknowledged on the 22d, the same day, and before the same justices before whom the last deed to <em>Noffsinger </em>was acknowledged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARX\">The plaintiffs asked that they might be substituted to the remedies of <em>Adams </em>the creditor, against the lands held by <em>Spitler </em>at the time the judgment was obtained against him; and that these lands in the hands of <em>Noffsinger </em>and <em>Rodgers </em>might be subjected to satisfy them for the amount they had been compelled to pay on account of the suretyship of their intestate for <em>Spitler </em>in the injunction bond. When the cause came on to be heard, the Court, holding that <em>Rodgers </em>was the last purchaser from <em>Spitler, </em>decreed that his land should be first sold to satisfy the claim of the <em>plaintiffs; </em>and if that was not sufficient to discharge their claim, then that the land conveyed to <em>Noffsinger </em>by the deed of the 18th of October 1833, should be sold. Accordingly the commissioner made sale of <em>Rodgers\u2019 </em>land, and made report thereof to the Court, which was confirmed; and then <em>Rodgers </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-7\"><em>Eskridge, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-8\"><em>J.

This Court is, however, of opinion, that there is error in said decree, in treating the said <em>Joseph Rodgers </em>as the last purchaser from the said <em>Michael Spitler; </em>and in directing his tract of land to be first sold in satisfaction of the amount due upon said judgment. For though the deed of the said <em>Noffsinger </em>is prior in date to that of the said <em>Rodgers, </em>and in the absence of any proof to the contrary, the said deeds are to be regarded as having been regularly executed and delivered at the several periods their respective dates purport, and the said <em>Peter Noffsinger </em>is, so, to be regarded as having obtained a legal title to the tract of land sold to him, before the said <em>Joseph Rodgers </em>obtained a legal title to the land purchased by him; yet it appears to the Court that long antecedent to the date of the conveyance to the said <em>Noffsinger, </em>the said <em>Rodgers </em>had contracted with the said <em>Spitler </em>for the purchase of the land which is convoyed to him by the deed of the 21st October 1833, had paid the purchase money and obtained from his vendor a bond acknowledging the receipt thereof, and covenanting to convey the title. By virtue of this purchase the said <em>Rodgers </em>acquired a good equitable title to the land sold to him, and, in the opinion of this Court, had a right to insist that the land remaining in the hands of his vendor, the said <em>Michael Spitler, </em>and subsequently aliened and conveyed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>said <em>Peter Noffsinger </em>by the deed of the 18th October 1833, should be sold, and the proceeds applied in satisfaction of the amount due upon the judgment aforesaid jje\u00a3ore resort should be had to the land so purchased by ^ sa^ <em>Joseph Rodgers. </em>This Court is therefore of opinion to reverse the decree aforesaid with costs, to set aside the sale made in pursuance thereof, and to remand the cause to the said Circuit Superior Court for further proceedings to be had in conformity with the principles of this decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
