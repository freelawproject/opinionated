A person having held actual possession of land for more than fifteen years under colour of title, and being then ousted by another who is a mere trespasser without pretence of title, may recover in ejectment against such trespasser; though it does not appear that the land has ever been granted by the <em>Commonwealth.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b149-9\">2. A genera] judgment for costs against two defendants in ejectment, is proper, though one of them did not enter himself a defendant until there had been one trial of the cause, and a large portion of the costs had been incurred.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-10\">This was an action of ejectment upon the demise of <em>Thomas J. Johns als., </em>the heirs of <em>David Scott </em>deceased, for five hundred acres of land in the county of <em>Braxton. </em>At the April term 1841 of the Circuit Court of that county, <em>Benjamin L. Boggs </em>was admitted a defendant in the action, confessed the lease, entry and ouster, and pleaded to issue. An order of survey was then made, and the venue was changed to the county of <em>Nicholas. </em>At the April term of 1842 of the Circuit Court of <em>Nicholas, </em>the report of the surveyor was recommitted to the surveyor of <em>Nicholas </em>county; and at the September term of the Court the cause was tried, and there was a verdict for the defendant, which was set aside by the Court, and a new trial granted. After the verdict was set aside <em>Henry O. Middleton </em>was admitted a defendant to the action upon the usual terms, and pleaded to issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-11\">In September 1843, the cause was again tried, when the jury rendered a special verdict, the material parts of which were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-12\">That between the years 1805 and 1810, <em>David Scott </em>the elder entered upon the land in controversy, which was then in an unimproved condition, and cleared a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>small field, which he enclosed; and erected a cabin on the land, in which he resided about a year. On the 9th of August 1812, he, by deed regularly executed, conveyed said land to his son <em>Felix Scott, </em>upon the consideration as recited in the deed of 1000 dollars. On the 6th of March 1819, <em>Felix Scott </em>and wife, by deed regularly executed, conveyed the said land to <em>David Scott </em>the younger, for the consideration, as expressed in the deed of 1155 dollars. Said <em>David </em>has since died, and the lessors of the plaintiff, who are his heirs, held the uninterrupted possession of the land in controversy by themselves and their tenants for a period of more than fifteen years next preceding the year 1837; at which time, to wit, in the year 1837, the defendants entered upon said land and ousted the lessors of the plaintiffs; and that the said defendants have held possession thereof ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-9\">Upon this special verdict the Court gave judgment for the plaintiff for the term yet to come in the land, and his costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-10\">The plaintiff having sued out a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>for the costs against the defendants, it was served upon <em>Middleton, </em>who tendered property in discharge of his body; and then executed a forthcoming bond, with surety, for the delivery of the property on the day of sale, which was forfeited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-11\">In April 1845, a motion was made by the plaintiff for an award of execution on this <em>bond; </em>and a counter motion was made by <em>Middleton </em>to quash it and the execution on which it was taken, on the ground that the execution had issued against him for the whole amount of the costs which had been incurred in the cause, whereas, as appeared by the statement of the clerk, much the larger portion of the costs for which the execution issued had been incurred before <em>Middleton </em>had been admitted a party defendant. The Court overruled the motion to quash the bond, and sustained the motion for award of execution upon it; and thereupon <em>Middleton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>excepted to the opinion of the Court; and applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to both the original judgment and the judgment on the forthcoming bond, which was granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-10\"><em>William Smith </em>and <em>Price, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD4\">after referring to the principle that nothing can be inferred on a special verdict, referred to the verdict to shew that it did not find adverse possession or entry under colour of title by <em>David Scott </em>the elder, nor possession by himself or <em>Felix Scott, </em>when the deeds were executed by them, nor a descent cast; nor did it in any way connect the possession of the lessors of the plaintiff with that of their ancestor; or find that the land had ever been granted by the <em>Commonwealth. </em>They then insisted that the land not having been granted by the <em>Commonwealth, </em>there could be no adversary possession. <em>Overton </em>v. <em>Davisson, </em>1 Gratt. 211; <em>Fouke v. Darnall, </em>5 Littell\u2019s R. 318; and therefore the whole question was, whether a party without title, having entered upon the land as a trespasser, could maintain ejectment for it against another party who had gotten possession without title. This they insisted could not be done; for although it was so held, at one time, in <em>England, Bateman </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>1 Croke\u2019s R. 437; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Rivington, </em>2 Saund. R. 111, yet these cases had been repeatedly overruled, and the contrary established; and they referred to Adams on Eject. 31; <em>Doe ex dem. Crisp </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>2 T. R. 749; <em>Martin ex dem. Tregonwell </em>v. <em>Strachan &amp; als. </em>5 T. R. 108, note 1; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Peat, </em>1 East\u2019s R. 244; 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 191; <em>Parker\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>11 East\u2019s R. 488; <em>City of Cincinnati </em>v. <em>White, lessee, </em>6 Peters\u2019 R. 441; 2 Starkie\u2019s Evid. p. 4, 514; <em>England ex dem. Syburn </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>4 T. R. 681; <em>People v. Leonard, </em>11 John. R. 504; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Lorillard, </em>10 Id. 347; <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Green\u2019s lessee, </em>1 Leigh 287.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AnC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>Reynolds, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKs\">insisted that the lessors of the plaintiff had held peaceable and uninterrupted possession of the land in controversy for upwards of fifteen years, under claim of title evidenced by deed; and the defendants without any title had entered upon and ousted them. That, therefore, whether the plaintiff\u2019s title was or was not good against all persons, it was good against the defendants, who were mere trespassers: and he referred to <em>Woods &amp; als. v. </em>Lane, 2 Serg. &amp; Rawle <em>53; Jackson ex dem. Livingston </em>v. <em>Walker, 7 </em>Cowen\u2019s R. 637; <em>Williams &amp; als. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>6 Id. 751; <em>Murry &amp; als. </em>v. <em>Denn, </em>5 Id. 200; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Lorillard, </em>10 John.

Baldwin, </em>11 East\u2019s R. 488. But he insisted that the defendants being mere intruders could not set up an outstanding title in a third person.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b152-4\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AN\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
