Browning </em>made a contract with <em>John Price </em>for the sale of the property devised to by j^jg father, and executed a title bond, in which he states the contract as follows: !! Whereas the above bound <em>John A. Browning </em>has sold to the said <em>John Price </em>all his interest in the devise made to him by his father <em>Francis Browning </em>deceased, in a certain tract of 180 acres situated on Little Cedar creek in the county of Russell, and the mills and dam and use of the water, together with the carding machine and other machinery connected therewith, and blacksmith tools, and the grass on a certain meadow, which was devised to the said <em>John A. </em>and his brother <em>William </em>for the term of ten years; which said tract of land of 180 acres, one moiety whereof with the mills, carding machine, use of dam, &amp;c. as hereby intended to be included, is bounded as follows: Beginning, &amp;c. For all which said land, mills, machinery, &amp;c. to the extent of his interest therein, as devised to him as aforesaid, the said <em>John Price </em>is to pay to the said <em>John A. Browning </em>the sum of 1000 dollars.\u201d He then binds himself to give possession of the carding machine forthwith, and of the residue of said property by the 19th of the May following; and that on the 15th of October 1839, or as soon thereafter as <em>Price </em>shall pay the purchase money, he will make to said <em>Price </em>a good and sufficient deed of conveyance for his interest in said land, mills, machinery and privileges as aforesaid, as contained and devised in the will aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-5\">In September 1844 <em>Price </em>filed his bill in the Circuit Court of <em>Russell </em>county, in which after stating his contract with <em>John A. </em>Browning, and that he had been put into possession of all the property purchased, except the meadow, which was held by the widow as a part of her dower, he alleged that he had paid the greater part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the purchase money; that for the remainder, amounting to 430 dollars, ho had been sued, and a judgment would be rendered therefor at the next term of the Court. And he prayed the Court to enjoin the collection of the same, on the ground that he was in danger of being subjected to loss by a reassignment of the widow\u2019s dower at the suit of the two youngest sons of <em>Francis Broioning, jr. </em>out of whose lands the dower had been assigned; and also from the claim of the child who was born after the will of <em>Francis Browning </em>was made, and who had been pretermitted therein. The injunction was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-14\"><em>John A. Browning </em>answered the bill, and insisted that he sold only the interest which he had in the property devised to him by his father; that such was the contract between himself and the plaintiff, who resided in the neighbourhood, and was fully informed of all the facts on which he relied in his bill at the time the contract was made; and that if the title bond which he executed stated the contract otherwise, it was not according to the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-15\">After the defendant had filed his answer the plaintiff had leave to amend his bill; and he then stated that the pretermitted child of <em>Francis Browning </em>had filed her bill asserting her right to contribution from the devisees of her deceased <em>father; </em>and that the two youngest sons of <em>Francis Browning </em>had also instituted a suit for the purpose of having the widow\u2019s dower assigned equally out of all the lands of their father; and that both these suits were then pending.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-16\"><em>John A. Browning </em>did not answer the amended bill, and it was taken for confessed. And then the cause came on to be heard, when the Court dissolved the injunction and dismissed both the original and amended bills, at the costs of the plaintiff. From this decree the plaintiff applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ae9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>The Attorney General </em>and <em>B. R. Johnston, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AWe\"><em>Price, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A-P\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AkZ\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The Court is of opinion, that the proper construction of the contract between the parties contained in the title bond executed by the said <em>John A. Browning </em>to the appellant, dated the 9th of April 1838, required the said <em>John A. Browning </em>to make a good and sufficient deed to the appellant for the specific property named in said contract, and devised and bequeathed to said <em>John A. Browning </em>by the will of <em>Francis Browning, jr.; </em>the reference to the devise being descriptive of the property sold and to be conveyed, and not being intended to make the contract one of hazard on the part of the purchaser, as to the interest in the estate purchased by him. The Court is farther of opinion, that the purchaser was entitled to indemnity against the incumbrances growing out of the renunciation of the will by the widow of <em>Francis Browning, jr. </em>and the assignment of dower to her in said <em>Francis Browning, jr.\u2019s </em>estate, and the claim of the pretermitted child to contribution from the other devisees and legatees in the <em>will; </em>and to an injunction to restrain the payment of the balance of the purchase money, until the extent of his loss from said incumbrances could be ascertained. The Court is therefore of opinion that said decree is erroneous. It is therefore reversed with costs to the appellant, and remanded, with instructions to reinstate the injunction heretofore awarded, to await the determination of the controversies growing out of said assignment of dower to said widow, and the claim to contribution by said pretermitted child; and for farther proceedings in order to a final decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
