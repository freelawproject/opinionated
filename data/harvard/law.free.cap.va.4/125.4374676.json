The trustees and <em>A B </em>deny notice that the purchase money was due at the time of the conveyance to the trustees; and there was no proof of notice ; but <em>B\u2019s </em>deed shewed he had not the legal title. Held : The land is liable for the purchase money due to <em>C.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-12\">This was a bill filed in the Circuit Court of <em>Monroe </em>county by <em>William Campbell </em>against <em>Andrew Beirne </em>and others, seeking to enforce a lien on a tract of land then in the possession of <em>Beirne, </em>for a balance of purchase money of the land due from a previous purchaser. The pleadings and proofs present the case as follows : In 1794 <em>William Estill </em>sold to <em>Samuel Campbell </em>a tract of land in the county of <em>Monroe, </em>near the Red <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Sulphur springs. He did not convey the land to <em>Campbell, </em>but put him in possession, and executed to him a bond binding himself to make him a title. <em>Samuel Campbell </em>died, having devised the land to his three sons: and it was afterwards divided, and the <em>* </em>plaintiff took possession of the part allotted to him. In 1835 the plaintiff sold the land to <em>William Burke </em>for 1325 dollars, and executed to <em>Burke </em>a bond by which he bound himself to make him a title to the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMY\">In 1836 the plaintiff1 and his brothers instituted a suit in the Circuit Court of <em>Monroe </em>against the heirs of <em>Estill, </em>for the purpose of obtaining a title to the land. And in 1839 a decree was made by which <em>James A. Dunlap </em>was appointed a commissioner to convey the land to the <em>Campbells ; </em>and all of them having sold to <em>Burke, </em>and directed <em>Dunlap </em>to convey the land to. him, <em>Dunlap </em>executed a deed bearing date the 5th of October 1840, by which he conveyed the land to <em>Burke.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-7\">Previous to the conveyance by <em>Dunlap </em>to <em>Burke, </em>viz : on the 20th January 1837, <em>Burke </em>conveyed this land with several other tracts which he owned, to <em>John H. Yawter </em>and <em>Conway Robinson, </em>in trust to secure a debt he owed to <em>Andrew Beirne. </em>This conveyance referred to the agreement between <em>himself and Campbell; but </em>was with general warranty of title. Afterwards in 1843 <em>Vawter </em>and <em>Robinson </em>sold the lands conveyed to them, and this tract was purchased by <em>Andrew Beirne. </em>Immediately after the sale this suit was brought; the plaintiff alleging that there was due to him a balance of 125 dollars and some interest of the purchase money, from <em>Burke, </em>who was then insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-8\">The trustees and <em>Beirne </em>answered, denying that they had notice that any part of the purchase money was due from <em>Burke </em>to the plaintiff when <em>Burke's </em>deed to the trustees was executed, or indeed until about the time of the sale ; and <em>Beirne </em>insisted, that the legal title having been conveyed to <em>Burke </em>by the directions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>of <em>Campbell; </em>and that legal title vesting in the trustees by virtue of the warranty in <em>Burke\u2019s </em>deed to them, he held by their conveyance to him the legal title without notice <em>of the </em>plaintiff\u2019s equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-4\">When the cause came on to be heard, the Court below held that the plaintiff had a lien on the land in the bill mentioned, for as much of the purchase money as was still due upon the contract between the plaintiff and <em>Burke; </em>and it not sufficiently appearing how much was due, a commissioner was directed to ascertain and report the same to the Court. From this decree the executors of <em>Beirne, </em>he having died pending the suit, applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-11\"><em>N. </em>Harrison, for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqa\">to shew that the conveyance by <em>Dunlap </em>to <em>Burke </em>vested the legal title in the trustees, referred to <em>Doswell </em>v. <em>Buchanan\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>3 Leigh 365, and <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>14 John. R. 193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-12\">He insisted further, that as actual notice was denied and not proved, the law would not imply notice of an intermediate vendor\u2019s lien. That though the withholding the title by <em>Bstill </em>might imply notice of his lien for the purchase money, if it had not been paid, it could afford no ground for the implication that <em>Campbell </em>had not been paid by <em>Burke. </em>And as the deed was made to <em>Burke </em>by <em>Dunlap </em>by the direction of <em>Campbell, </em>that itself was a declaration that he had no lien, or that he waived it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-13\"><em>Caperton for </em>the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A65\">referred to 2 Story\u2019s Equi. Juris, p. 470, \u00a7 1224, and p. 480, \u00a7 1228, to shew that the vendor\u2019s lien exists against a vendee and purchasers under him, having only an equitable title ; and that the <em>onus is </em>on the vendee to show that it has been intentionally waived. And he referred to Story\u2019s Equi. Plead, p. 754, and <em>Doswell </em>v. <em>Buchanan\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>3 Leigh 365, to shew that to sustain the defence of pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>chaser without notice, it is necessary to shew that the vendor was seized in fee, or pretended to be seized, and was in. possession. And he then referred to the answers of the defendants to shew that they admitted they knew that <em>Burke </em>had only an equitable title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJU\">He further insisted that the defendants having had constructive notice when the conveyance was made by <em>Burke </em>to the trustees, which was the same in its effects as actual notice, (Sugd. on Vend. 532, <em>Doswell v. Buchanan\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>3 Leigh 365,) the deed from <em>Dunlap </em>to <em>Burke </em>could not change the fact, and thereby destroy the vendor\u2019s lien. And the fact that <em>Campbell </em>directed that deed to be made to <em>Burke </em>did not deceive or injure the purchasers, as their deed had been taken before that direction was given.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b148-5\">Ex the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AfI\">Affirm the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b148-6\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ary\">dissented. He was of opinion that the trustees and <em>cestuis que trust </em>had no actual notice of <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>lien, either when <em>Burke\u2019s </em>deed was made or when <em>Dunlap </em>conveyed to <em>Burke; </em>and that the retention of the title by the first vendor was not a constructive notice of the subsequent vendor\u2019s lien; and. therefore <em>Beirne </em>having the legal title was entitled to the benefit of the defence of purchaser for value without notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
