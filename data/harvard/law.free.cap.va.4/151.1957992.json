That the defendant, when of very tender years, received a present from her grandfather, <em>Richard </em>Corbin, which was deposited in the hands of her father, who having failed to invest her with it, it being in money, declared to her that the said slave, <em>Thamar </em>and her children, were her property, and that as she had so long had possession of her, and it was so notorious that the property was hers, she considered it entirely unnecessary to require a bill of sale, or any other instrument of writing, to insure to her property which she had for such a series of years held and enjoyed as absolutely and indisputably hers. That not only the <em>right </em>of the slave was <em>not </em>in her father at the date of the mortgage, but he was not invested with the possession of them, she having lent the slave <em>Thamar </em>to her brother, with whom she then lived as a cook, and her children with her, by the defendant\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-3\">The affidavit of <em>Francis Corbin </em>states, that he well remembers that when this defendant was a little girl,, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>partiality of her grandfather, <em>Richard </em>Corbin, brought her to <em>Lar eviUe, </em>where she lived for several years. That a negro woman then attended her as a nurse, by the name \u00a9f Thamar, and that it was alw ays understood in the family that his father, <em>R. C. </em>had given the said negro woman to the defendant, <em>Ann C. Braxton. </em>That since his return from England, where Mr. <em>Braxton?s </em>affairs had been the subject of his father\u2019s unceasing reflections, he has been frequently advised by him to take care that his niece, the defendant, did not lose her maid <em>Thamar </em>and her children in the scuffle, for that he had paid Mr. <em>Braxton 1001, </em>sterling for her, and <em>given her </em>to the defendant. He adds, the particulars, as collected from him, ar\u00a9 these: Mr. Braxton, being pressed in <em>Williamsburg </em>for that sum, applied to his father for it. He advanced it for him by a bill of exchange, and <em>gave it to the defendant. </em>It was to lie in her father\u2019s hands, and interest to accumulate on it till she should marry or come of age. But by agreement a short time afterwards, and <em>long before </em>Mr. <em>Braxton </em>became embarrassed in his affairs, the said negro woman and her increase were given to the defendant <em>in lieu of the said </em>100/. <em>sterling and interest. </em>She has remained the property of the defendant ever since ; and until called on to state what he knew of the matter, he did not imagine her right had ever been contested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-4\">This affidavit was admitted to be read as evidence in like manner as if the examination of the witness had been taken by a commissioner. There is no other evidence in the cause as between these parties upon this particular point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">The Chancellor (the late Mr. Wythe) decided, that the defendant had no tide to the slaves, and that they be delivered up to commissioners to be sold, &amp;c. The defendant, <em>A. C. </em>Braxton, alone, appealed to this Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-12\">Call, for the appellant, (Miss <em>Braxton^) </em>contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbA\">that the decree of the Chancellor could not be supported <em>or\\ </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>any ground whatever. An attempt had been made to charge her as a mere volunteer, when she was a <em>purchaser </em>for valuable consideration. The property was <em>paid </em>to her by her father, long before the date of the mortgage, in lieu of a sum of money given her by her grandfather; she had been upwards of twenty years in peaceable possession, and had exercised every act of ownership over it. Though she lived in her father\u2019s family, yet no possession adverse toilers was attempted to be proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-9\">But even if her title could be disturbed, the plaintiffs must shew that her father was the proprietor of the property at the time of the transfer to his daughter, and indebted in a sum vastly beyond his ability to pay. It is not enough to shew that a donor <em>is indebted, </em>but it must be further shewn that he was <em>so much indebted at the time of the </em>gift, as not to be able to make it, without injury to his creditors.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-10\">Warden, for the appellees, observed,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjS\">that it was stated in the bill, and not denied in the answer, that the persons whom the complainants represented had paid upwards of 2,000/. as sureties of <em>Carter Braxton, </em>it was also a mat-&gt; ter of record, as well as of public notoriety.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-11\">With respect to the slaves in question, the possession was always in <em>Carter Braxton. </em>His daughter, Bliss <em>Braxton, </em>was an inmate in her father\u2019s house at the time of the mortgage, and so continued ever since. There being no public conveyance of the property to Bliss <em>Braxton, </em>the possession of her father was sufficient to induce a. purchaser to take a conveyance. Miss <em>Braxton does </em>not pretend to claim the slaves by any deed or record. She only says, that her father gave her the negro <em>Thamar, </em>in consequence of a sum of money appropriated by him, which had been given to her by her grandfather. The, testimony of <em>Francis </em>Corbin, as to this fact, is mere <em>hearsay, </em>and differs, in some respects, from the account given, by Miss <em>Braxton </em>in her answer, <em>lie </em>states that his father, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u25a0who was the grandfather of Miss Braxton, lent 100/. sterling to <em>Carter </em>Braxton, which was to lie in his hands, and the interest to accumulate, till his daughter, the appellant, came of age. There is no evidence that this sum of money was paid for the negro, but hearsay. It is, in fact, only a <em>gift </em>from <em>Carter Braxton </em>to his daughter, and subject to all the legal consequences of such. She cannot, therefore, be considered as a <em>purchaser, </em>nor can the decree of the Chancellor, on any principle, be reversed.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b170-6\"> <em>Cowp.432.

This being a matter of evidence, more than of <em>legal </em>inference, it is detuned unnecessary to insert the arguments at the bar, further than has already been done.
