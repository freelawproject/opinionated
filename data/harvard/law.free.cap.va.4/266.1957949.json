At the trial, Ae plaintiff, in support of his cause, offered toathe Jury an account stated, the items in which bore date 'in the years 1787, 1791, and 1792, \u201cand offered to prove, that the \u201c said account was justly due from the said <em>Walter Brooke, </em>\u201c deceased, and that the said Brooke, about twelve months \u201c before his death, that is to say, some time in the year \u201c 1797, (about two years before the commencement of the . \u201c suit,) <em>acknowledged that the balance note claimed was </em>just, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>and that the said <em>Walter Brooke </em>departed this life in 1798 : \u201c but the Court, upon the motion of the counsel for the de- \u201c fendants, directed the items of the said account to be \u201c stricken out, and refused to hear the evidence offered by <em>u </em>the plaintiffto which opinion of the Court the plain* tiff excepted.

Code, </em>vol. 1. p. 167. (which section was, for the first time, enacted at the session of 1792,) as imperative that the items shall be stricken out. The Legislature meant to impose upon creditors the necessity of closing their accounts within five years. Though the replication states that there was an <em>assumpsit </em>within five years, yet that will not vary the words of the account. The <em>Court </em>are only to look into the <em>account, </em>and see that the items are within five years <em>; </em>and, if not, to expunge them. It would be a nugatory thing in the Court to strike out the items of the account, and then permit the Jury to hear evidence to establish it, '</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-11\">No counsel appeared for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b284-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Monday, October </em>30.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0Y\">The Judges, Tucker and Roane, (Fleming having been prevented by indisposition from sitting in the cause,) pronounced their opinions.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b284-9\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"AtNm\">The only question upon this record, is, whether the County Court ought to have admitted the evidence offered by the plaintiff to prove that Mr. Brooke, the defendants\u2019 intestate, within twelve months before his death, assumed to pay to the plaintiff a balance of 63/. 15s. appearing to be due upon an account stated, and in which there Were credits for sundry payments to the amount of 93/. 18i. made by the intestate in his life-time, or whether that evidence was properly rejected by the Court, by whom all the items of the account which appear to have been due five years before the death of the intestate were expunged therefrom, according to the act concerning wills, &amp;c. <em>Rev. </em>Code, vol. 1. p. 167. c. 92. sect. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">The same question occurred in the case of <em>Fisher\u2019s Executory. Duncan </em>&amp; <em>Turnbull,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and Judge Fleming and myself then concurred in the opinion, that such evidence as that offered by the plaintiff ought not to have been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"Apq\">The opinion of this Court in <em>Beale v. Edmundson,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I think strongly corroborates the other. I am therefore of opinion, that the County Court erred in <em>rejecting </em>the testimony and expunging the account, without hearing it, and that there is no error in the judgment of the District Court reversing that judgment. It may, however, be advisable to add to it a direction, that the County Court shall, on the new trial, admit the evidence formerly offered to be given, if the same shall be again offered to them..</p>\n<author id=\"A32\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"ArE\">The principal\u2019item in the account bears date in 1787, and the act under which <em>all </em>the items of the account were expunged was not passed until the 13th of December, 1792.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> In the case of <em>Fisher s Executor </em>v. <em>Duncan </em>&amp; <em>Turnbull,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I expressed it as my then opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>that that act did not apply to previously existing accounts, inasmuch as it would affect the <em>rights </em>of the parties by making it the <em>imperious </em>duty of the <em>Court </em>to bar the plaintiff by a defence which before only rested in the discretion of the ... . . . <em>defendant. </em>I still rather hold this opinion: but, as this ground of objection had been <em>before </em>disregarded by the Court in the case of <em>Hoskins </em>v. <em>Wright,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and was again apparently disregarded by the two other Judges in <em>Fisher\u2019s Executor </em>v. <em>Duncan </em>fix\u2019 <em>Turnbull, </em>I can readily yield my impressions on this point, to these decisions ; and I will, therefore, consider this case as if every item in the account had arisen posterior to the passage of the act in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">As to the question upon the merits, I entirely concur with the opinions of the two Judges as reported in <em>Fisher\u2019s Executor </em>v. <em>Duncan </em>&amp; <em>Turnbull,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that the act of 1792 relates only to <em>open </em>accounts, and does not extend to exclude evidence of settlements or assumptions by testators within the time limited by the act. The reason and policy of this provision of the act does not require such a construction. In addition to these authorities, I beg leave to refer to the decision in the case of <em>Beale </em>v. Edmundson,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> in an analogous case. The grounds of that decision seem fully to apply to this case, and to narrow the application of the act to eases depending upon the account, as exhibited, only, and do not interdict proof of settlements or assumptions of the debt within the time prescribed by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">As, therefore, the appellant offered to prove in the Court below, not only that the account exhibited \u201c wasjustly due,\u201d but also that the intestate, about twelve months before his death, \u201c <em>acknowledged that the balance claimed now by the </em>\u201c <em>plaintiff ofhis administrators was </em>just,\u201d the County Court erred in refusing to admit such testimony to be adduced ; and the judgment of the District Court, reversing the judgment of the County Court on that ground, is correct.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\"><em> 1 Hen. &amp; Munf. </em>574. 577.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"ACI\">\n<em> 3 Call, 514.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b284-12\"><em> </em>1 <em>Rev.
