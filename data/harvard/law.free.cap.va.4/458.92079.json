At the May term of the county court 1794, the executrix having received due notice of an application to be then made to the court, by her sureties for counter security, and failing to appear, an order was made by the court, that she should deliver the estate of- her testator in her hands, to the sureties, <em>Waddy </em>and Dabney.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And, accordingly, she delivered to them, all the estate that remained unadministered, consisting of a few debts due or claimed to <em>be due to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the estate and yet to be collected, and about twenty slaves; and thenceforth till December 1801, <em>Waddy </em>had the possession and management of the whole property, taking steps to collect the debts claimed for the estate, and receiving the profits of the slaves. His co-surety <em>Dabney, </em>took no part in the business. At the end of the year 1801, <em>Mrs. Hawkins </em>the executrix being dead, and <em>Joseph Hawkins </em>having taken administration <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed of the testator <em>John Hawkins\u2019s </em>estate, <em>Waddy </em>delivered him all the slaves belonging to the estate, but he rendered no account of bis transactions while the estate was in his hands. Application was made to <em>Waddy </em>to render this account in 1809; when he admitted his duty to render it, but owing (it appeared) to ill health, he made no settlement; and shortly afterwards, he died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-5\">In 1813, <em>Joseph Hawkins, </em>the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed of the testator <em>John Hawkins, </em>exhibited his bill, in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Richmond, </em>against <em>Dabney </em>and <em>John Waddy </em>executor of <em>William Waddy, </em>praying an account of the administration of the estate by <em>Dabney </em>and <em>Waddy, </em>while it was in their hands under the order of the county court of May 1794, and a decree for the balance that should be found due thereon. And the defendants having put in their answers, by which it appeared that <em>Waddy </em>had had the sole management of the estate, and was alone accountable for the same, the court ordered the executor of <em>Waddy </em>to render an account of <em>Waddy\u2019s </em>administration of <em>Hawkins\u2019s </em>estate while it was in his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-7\">The commissioner reported two statements. The <em>first, </em>after allowing <em>Waddy </em>the usual commission of <em>five per cent., </em>shewed a balance due from his estate to that of <em>Hawkins, </em>of 1671 dollars, with long arrears of interest; which balance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>consisted, almost intirely, of the profits of the slaves while they were in <em>Waddy\u2019s </em>hands, from 1794 to 1801. The <em>second, </em>statement shewed a balance of only 288 dollars; the balance being reduced to this sum, by <em>crediting Waddy </em>with dollars, yearly, for the seven years of his agency, for his trouble in managing the estate. It appeared clearly, from the face of the accounts, that he had incurred no extraordinary trouble at all; and, in the first statement, all his expenses were credited to him, over and above the <em>five per cent, </em>commission therein allowed. The claim for the extraordinary compensation of 200 dollars a year, during the seven years, was founded wholly on the provision in the will of the testator <em>Hawkins, </em>that his executors \u201c should be handsomely paid out of his estate for the trouble they should be at in discharging their trust.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aib\">Much delay was produced in the progress of the cause, by the deaths of all the parties, the necessity of reviving it from time to'time, and the delays in the qualifications of other representatives of the deceased parties; and many years elapsed before the suit was revived between the proper parties, and brought to hearing. At the final hearing, the cause stood revived between <em>Liddal Bowles </em>administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of the testator <em>John Hawkins, </em>and <em>Anthony Waddy </em>the surviving executor of <em>William Waddy </em>(the surety) and <em>Edmund Goodwin </em>administrator of <em>John Waddy, </em>who alone had first qualified as the executor of <em>William.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-6\">The chancellor, being of opinion that there was no ground for the claim of the extraordinary compensation of 200 dollars <em>per annum </em>to <em>Waddy, </em>for his trouble in managing the estate, and that the usual commission of <em>five per cent, </em>was an ample compensation, decreed, that the surviving executor of <em>'Waddy </em>should pay to <em>Bowles </em>the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>fee. of <em>Hawkins, </em>the balance of 1671 dollars, with interest &amp;c. appearing to be due by the first statement of the commissioner\u2019s report. From this decree, the defendant applied by petition to this court for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>Daniel </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akmd\">insisted, 1. that <em>Waddy, </em>who had in effect administered the estate of <em>Hawkins </em>from 1794 to 1801, was entitled, by the express provision of <em>Hawkins\u2019s </em>will, to be <em>\u201c </em>handsomely paid for his troublewhich, they said, certainly meant that ho should be allowed something more than the usual compensation of <em>five per cent, </em>commission. And 2. that the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Hawkins, </em>could not maintain a suit against <em>Waddy, </em>to recover the balance due from him to <em>Hawkins\u2019s </em>estate, any more than <em>he </em>could have maintained a bill against <em>Mrs. Hawkins, </em>the executrix, to recover a like balance due from her, if the estate had remained in her hands, since <em>Waddy </em>must be considered as acting merely as her agent; and that the claim could only be prosecuted by the creditors or the legatees of <em>Iiawkins: </em>and as to this point, they relied on <em>Wernick\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>M\u2019Murdo, </em>5 Rand. 51.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-4\"><em>J. M\u2019C. Wickham </em>and <em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8c\">answered, that there was not the least pretext for the claim of extraordinary compensation for <em>Waddy\u2019s </em>services; for it was plain, from the accounts, that if there had been any extraordinary trouble in the administration of <em>Hawkins\u2019s </em>estate, that trouble had been incurred by <em>Mrs. Hawkins, the </em>executrix, before the estate was taken out of her hands; that <em>Waddy, </em>certainly, had incurred no trouble for which the commission of <em>five per cent, </em>was not a \u201c handsome\u201d compensation. As to the other point, they said, that <em>Waddy </em>was not an executor or administrator of <em>Hawkins\u2019s </em>estate, nor an agent <em>of the </em>executrix, but only a <em>receiver </em>appointed by the court; <em>per Green, </em>J. in <em>Wernick </em>v. <em>M\u2019Murdo, </em>5 Rand. 87. But supposing he was to be regarded as the agent of <em>Mrs. Hawkins, </em>the executrix; then, as the moneys he had received had never been accounted for and paid to her, she neither had, in fact, nor could have, administered them, or converted them to her own use; so that the balance due from <em>Waddy </em>was assets of <em>Hawkins\u2019s </em>estate remaining unadministered, and unconverted, which, according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>principles of the case of <em>Wernick\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>M\u2019Murdo, </em>belonged to-the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Hawkins; Id.' pp. 72, 73.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-9\"> This order was made under the provision of the revised statute of wills of 1792 (1 Old Rev. Code, ch. 92. \u00a7 25. Pleasants\u2019s edi. p. 165.), which was in these words: <em>\u201c </em>When sureties for executors or administrators conceive themselves in danger of suffering thereby, and petition the court for relief, the court shall summon the executor or administrator, and make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>such order or decree thereupon, to relieve and secure the petitioners, by counter security <em>or otherwise, </em>as to them shall seem just and equitable.\u201d There was, at that time, no other statutory provision on the subject. The order of the county court, in the present instance, was in conformity with the usual practice of the courts under the provision above quoted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ARQY\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ArZB\">The decree is to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
