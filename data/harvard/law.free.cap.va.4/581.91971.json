Stephen, </em>and recovered a judgement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\">Whereupon, <em>Alex. Stephen </em>exhibited his bill against <em>Toole </em>and <em>Tapscott </em>the executor of <em>Baker, </em>without making the bank a party, setting forth the facts above stated; and insisting, in the first place, that the balance claimed by <em>Baker </em>of his testator, and for which he gave his note, was, in truth, due from <em>Newkirk, </em>and ought to have been demanded of him; and, in the next place, and principally, that the consideration of the note was usurious; and praying, therefore, an injunction to inhibit <em>Toole, </em>the assignee, from enforcing his judgement at law. The injunction was awarded. The answers of the defendants, disclaimed all personal knowledge \u2022on the subject. But the evidence in the cause, established the facts of the case as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-7\">The chancellor, upon the hearing, perpetuated the injunction, with costs; and <em>Toole </em>appealed from the decree to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-8\"><em>Leigh </em>for the appellant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY-h\">said, 1. that the commission was undoubtedly due to <em>Baker, </em>from the bank; and if the debtors of the bank thought proper to make an arrangement with it, by which they assumed the payment of the debt it owed to him, and thereby to induce him to give up his just \u2022claim on the bank, <em>he, </em>at least, practised no usury, and they ought not to be allowed to avoid their obligation to him, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the ground that the bank had practised usury on them. He, ^ in effect, gave a full and fair consideration for the note. The plaintiff might have a right to recover the money from the bank, who had practised the extortion, but not to avoid his obligation to <em>Baker, </em>who had practised no extortion, and to whom it was perfectly immaterial, who paid him the commission acknowdedgedly due to him. And as to the bank, all it stipulated for, was the reimbursement to it by its debtors, of the exact expenses it had incurred in consequence of their neglect to make punctual payment of their just debts. But <em>2. if it </em>was proper to injoin <em>Toole </em>the assignee, from enforcing his judgement at law, the court should have given him a decree against his codefendant <em>Tapscott, </em>the executor of the assignor, this being a case between codefendants, made out upon pleadings and proofs as between the plaintiff and defendants. <em>Chamley </em>v. <em>Ld. Dunsany, </em>1 Scho. &amp; Lef. 689. 709. 718. Indeed, the court ought not to have proceeded to. a final decree, until the bank was made a party, so that a decree might have been given against it for the money due to <em>Baker.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AVj\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag_P\">said it was quite indifferent to him, what recourse <em>Toole </em>might be entitled to against <em>Baker\u2019s </em>executor, or he against the bank; but he suggested, that, as their respective remedies at law were very easy and simple, there was no manner of necessity to perplex this case with an effort to administer justice between the defendants, especially between the defendants and the bank, which was out of <em>the </em>commonwealth. <em>On </em>this point he also cited <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>1 Leigh 492. 522. As the commission due from the bank to <em>Baker, </em>which the bank stipulated that <em>Stephen </em>and <em>Newkirk </em>should pay him, as part of the consideration of its forbearance of the debt they owed, was so much over and above the principal and interest of the debt, the consideration of <em>Stephen\u2019s </em>note to <em>Baker </em>for a balance of the commission, was plainly usurious; and as <em>Baker </em>had knowledge of all the particulars of the arrangement between the bank and <em>Stephen </em>and <em>Newkirk, </em>he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>not possibly avoid the charge of usury. He cited <em>Meagoe </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>1 Mood. &amp; Malk. 121. 22 Eng. C. L. R. 266.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Acf\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Avt\">The decree is right, and is to be affirmed, <em>in omnibus.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
