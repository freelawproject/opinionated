This bill of sale was never recorded. It did not appear, that <em>Lunsford </em>had applied the 1300 dollars put into his hands by <em>Bird, to the </em>purchase of slaves for him, or had returned the money to <em>Bird; </em>no evidence was adduced by either party, as to those points. The slave <em>Phil </em>was not delivered to <em>Bird, </em>at the time the bill of sale was executed ; he was then a runaway, so that no actual delivery could have been then <em>made; </em>nor did <em>Bird </em>ever after acquire actual possession of him. But <em>Lunsford </em>got possession of him, and had him secured in the jail of <em>Lancaster; </em>whether with the knowledge or consent of <em>Bird, </em>or not, did not ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>pear. On the 10th September 1822, <em>Lunsford </em>executed another bill of sale to <em>Osmond. Johnson; </em>whereby, in consideration of 400 dollars, he conveyed to him, this slave <em>Phil </em>and sundry others; and, shortly afterwards, he gave <em>Johnson </em>an order on the jailor of <em>Lancaster, </em>for the delivery of the slaye to him; and he was delivered to him accordingly. <em>Johnson, </em>thus having the possession, sold the slave to <em>Wilkinson, </em>for a valuable consideration actually paid, and delivered possession to <em>Wilkinson </em>immediately. This was done before this suit was instituted. It was not found that <em>Johnson </em>purchased without notice of the bill of sale previously executed by <em>Lunsford </em>to <em>Bird; </em>but it was found, that <em>Wilkinson </em>was a fair purchaser from <em>Johnson, </em>without notice of <em>Lunsford's </em>bill of sale to <em>Bird. </em>And the question referred to the court, was, Whether, upon this state of the case, <em>Bird </em>was entitled to the slave ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-4\">The circuit court held that he was not, and gave judgement for <em>Wilkinson; </em>from which <em>Bird </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-5\"><em>Robinson </em>and <em>Scott, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARP\">The decisions of this court have recognized the general principle of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>2 T. R. 587. and <em>Hamilton v. Russell, </em>1 Cranch 309. that an absolute bill of sale of goods is fraudulent <em>per se, </em>as to creditors, unless possession accompanies and follows the deed. But <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben </em>is now doubted in <em>England; Steward </em>v. <em>Lombe, </em>1 Brod. &amp; Bing. 506. 5 Eng. C. L. R. 167. And there, the court established the principle, that the sale will be valid, if such possession be given as the nature of the case admits of. So, if the property is absent at sea, or for any other cause it is impossible for the vendee to take possession, this impossibility is an answer to the presumption of fraud that might otherwise arise. <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Atlantic Ins. Co. </em>1 Peters 449. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>2 Pick. 599. In the case cited from Peters, the propriety of the rule that the fact of possession not accompanying and following the deed, is fraud <em>per se, </em>is left an open question; so that <em>Hamilton v. Russell </em>is not now considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>more conclusive in the supreme court of the <em>United States </em>than <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben </em>is in <em>England. </em>In <em>Beals v. Guernsey, </em>8 Johns. Rep. 348. and <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Swartwood, </em>2 Cowen 431. sales were sustained, where the vendor\u2019s possession continued no longer than convenience required. Like principles have been recognized by the judges of this court, in <em>Land </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>5 Rand. 216. 252. 259. 271. 603. and in <em>Claytor </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>6 Rand. 304, In the case now before the court, the slave was a runaway at the time of the sale, so that it was impracticable for the vendor to give, or for the vendee to take, actual possession immediately. The fact of inability to deliver or take possession, is an excuse for non-delivery; and that inability being found here, the sale is valid. To hold otherwise, were in effect to hold, that personal property cannot pass by sale, unless it be capable of being delivered at the time of sale. The circumstance of <em>Lunsford </em>having regained the possession of the runaway slave, cannot affect <em>Bird\u2019s </em>title; for <em>Lunsford </em>took the possession without his knowledge or consent, and without any right to exercise that or any other act of ownership over him; and <em>Lunsford\u2019s </em>sale to another could pass no title as against <em>Bird.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-4\">There is, however, another objection to <em>Bird\u2019s </em>title, which will be mainly relied on\u2014that the bill of sale under which he claims, though absolute on its face, was in fact a mortgage or deed of trust, and is void as to subsequent purchasers without notice, because it was not recorded according to the statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99. \u00a7 4. p. 362. But this objection to a bill of sale, that though absolute on its face, it was intended only as a mortgage, is not matter for a court of law; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>M\u2019Donnell, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Ald. 134. Stark. Law of Ev. part IV. vol. 3. pp. 1002. 1009. n. 2.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The remedy is in a court of equity; <em>Ross v. Norvell, l </em>Wash. 14. A party ought not to be permitted to claim a benefit from the omission to record a deed, as to whom the registry of it would have been of no avail, if it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>duly made. If the bill of sale, in this case, had been re<em>co</em>rded, and it had been proved that it was in lact intended as a mortgage, this would not have afforded an excuse for the non-delivery of possession to the vendee <em>(per Green, </em>J. 5 Rand. 251.) nor would it have made the deed valid as a mortgage. The rule should work both ways. Here, the bill of sale has not been recorded as a mortgage; and it ought not to be regarded as a mortgage, merely to favor a subsequent purchaser, when he would not have been affected by it as a mortgage, <em>if it </em>had been recorded. It may be of mischievous consequence, to extend the statutes of registry so far as to require deeds to be recorded as deeds of trust or mortgages, which are not so expressed on the face of them : nor is there any necessity for it. For, if the deed be absolute on its face, the rights of creditors and subsequent purchasers are protected by the rule which requires that possession shall accompany and follow the deed, if practicable, or as far as practicable: it is only where the deed is not absolute, but is on its face a deed of trust or mortgage, so that the possession may lawfully be separated from the property, that the law does or ought to require that it shall be recorded. This subject was touched in <em>Land v. Jeffries; </em>and the judges, so far as they expressed opinions upon the point, regarded the statute as applying to such deeds only as are trusts or mortgages on their face ; 5 Rand. 221. 272. 615. The counsel for the appellant also cited and commented on <em>Dey v. Dunham, 2 </em>Johns. Ch. Rep, 182. 191. <em>James </em>v. <em>Johnson &amp; Morey, </em>6 <em>Id. </em>417. 432. <em>James </em>v. <em>Morey, 2 </em>Cowen 246. S. C. and <em>Coterell </em>v. <em>Purchase, </em>Ca. Temp. Talbot 61.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ak7\">The <em>attorney general </em>and <em>Lyons, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACd\">In any view that can be taken of the case, the bill of sale from <em>Lunsford </em>to <em>Bird </em>must be regarded as fraudulent and void as against <em>Wilkinson, </em>a subsequent fair purchaser, for value paid, without notice. The bill of sale to <em>Bird </em>must be taken for what it purports to be, an absolute sale, or for what it was really intended, a mortgage. As an absolute sale, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>was fraudulent and void, because possession did no wise accompany and follow the deed, and the parlies in truth intended that the vendor should retain the possession. The circumstance that the slave was a runaway cannot excuse the non-delivery of the possession, and so bring the case within any of the exceptions to the rule of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben : </em>because, in the first place, the vendee took no steps whatever to obtain the possession; and, in the next place, the circumstance that the instrument was in truth intended as a mortgage, affords a conclusive answer to the argument, that the actual delivery of possession was impracticable, and therefore not necessary to the validity of the transaction; since it shews, that it was designed that <em>Lunsford </em>should not deliver the possession, as a vendor, but that he might retain it, as a mortgagor. If this bill of sale be taken as a mortgage, as a conveyance with a secret trust, according to the real intent of the parties, it was void, not only because the taking a bill of sale in form, where the real transaction is a mortgage, tends to deceive and injure others, and is therefore fraudulent, but also for the conclusive reason, that it was not recorded; <em>Shields </em>v. Anderson, 3 Leigh 729. 737. If the deed had expressed the real contract between the parties, the law would have required that it should be recorded, in order to give it validity against creditors and subsequent purchasers: the mortgagee could not exempt himself from the duty of recording it, by the omission to express in the instrument the real terms of the contract.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-5\"><em> Ingraham\u2019s </em>edi. Boston 1828.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AKI\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAP\">If the transaction between <em>Lunsford </em>and <em>Bird </em>had been, what the bill of sale purports, an absolute sale of slaves, the question would fairly have arisen, whether the fact of the slave in question being at the time a runaway, excused the actual delivery, and whether the subsequent assertion of his right by <em>Bird, </em>and the other facts found, cleared him of the imputation of fraud ? It was contended, that a court of law must take this as a bill of sale; and <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>M\u2019Donnell </em>was cited in support of the po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>sition; but to my mind, it does not support it. There, <em>Bell \u00a7\u2022 Clarkson </em>executed a bill of sale for two ships to the <em>Sharps: </em>they retained possession, and acted as owners : the <em>Sharps </em>became bankrupts, and their assignee took possession of one of the ships: at a subsequent time, <em>Bell Clarkson </em>became bankrupts, and their assignees brought <em>trover </em>for the ship. At the trial, it was proved, that the real consideration of the bill of sale was, that the <em>Sharps </em>should accept <em>Bell &amp;p Clarkson\u2019s </em>bills to the amount of <em>\u00a3 </em>12,000. and that <em>the </em>ships were to be a security for their advances upon such acceptances, but were to remain with <em>Bell </em>Clarkson, until they made default in providing for the acceptances ; which they had not done, when the bankruptcy of the <em>Sharps </em>happened, and their assignees took possession of the ship. The plaintiffs were nonsuited at <em>nisi </em>prius, and a rule was moved for at bar, to enter a judgement for them; which, on argument, was refused. Chief justice <em>Abbot </em>said\u2014\u201c I think that it was not competent for <em>Bell Clark-son </em>to avail themselves of the parol agreement, <em>in contradiction to their own deed. </em>The bill of sale might be void upon the statute of <em>Elizabeth, </em>as against creditors, <em>but not as against the parties who executed it; </em>and their assignees are in this respect, in no better situation.\u201d It will be remarked, that the point of the decision was, that a party shall not avail himself of a parol agreement, <em>in contradiction of his own deed; </em>and so far from deciding that a court of law could not, <em>at the instance of any one, </em>receive such evidence, the court decided in effect, that it might; for the chief justice added, that the bill of sale, though good between the parties, might have been void as against creditors; which could only be by their shewing the facts, and disclosing the true nature of the deed. In the case before us, it is not <em>Lunsford </em>the grantor, who seeks to shew, that the bill of sale is in truth a mortgage, but a subsequent purchaser without notice from <em>Lunsford; </em>and as our statute enacts that as to <em>all such purchasers, </em>mortgages shall take effect and be valid, from the time they are proved or acknowledged, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>delivered to the clerk to be recorded, and from that time . only, it would seem to follow, that, in whatever court <em>such purchaser </em>is impleaded, he may avail himself of all proper evidence to prove, that the deed, however absolute on its face, is in truth a mortgage <em>; </em>and therefore of no validity as to him, because unrecorded : and then it would devolve on the other party, to prove notice upon him. The evidence then being admissible, the question is, do facts found in the special verdict, prove this a mortgage ? And that indeed is no question; for it is found, in so many words, that \u201c it was intended to have the effect of a mortgage or deed of trustand whether the one or the other, we know that the effect, in respect to the recording, and subsequent purchasers, is precisely the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">I do not think it necessary to notice any' other point. This is an action of detinue for a slave brought by a mortgagee on an unrecorded mortgage, against a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice\u2014and the judgement is for the defendant. 1 think it must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>As the deed from <em>Lunsford </em>to <em>Bird, </em>although absolute on its face, was intended by the parties, at the time of its execution, to operate only as a mortgage or deed of trust, I am of opinion, that, not having been recorded according to law, it is void as to subsequent purchasers without notice. On this ground, without considering any other, I think the judgement is right and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Brooke, <em>J. </em>It is the admitted principle of the common law, that the title to personal property passes by the actual delivery, or by a constructive delivery of it, as in the ease of <em>Pleasants v. Pendleton, </em>6 Rand. 473. and many like cases. Mortgages and deeds of trust of personal property, which are directed by statute to be recorded, (by which the title passes without actual delivery), do not impair this principle of the common law. A bill of sale of personal pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>perty absolute on its face, is not within the statute, and need r , , . ......... not be recorded to give any greater validity to <em>it; </em>and if recorded, it does not affect this common law principle. The possession of the property must accompany it, to make it a valid transfer of the title; unless, indeed, there are unavoidable circumstances (such as in the case of the transfer of a ship at sea) shewing that delivery was impracticable at the time, and that such circumstances made no part of the contract ; for, otherwise, if the circumstances which prevented the delivery, made a part of the contract, they ought to be stated on the face of the bill of sale, and it ought to be recorded, in order to give it validity. As regards creditors and subsequent purchasers, where that is not done, the sale or transfer is fraudulent <em>per se; </em>that is, it is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of fraud, which is conclusive until evidence to explain it is introduced ; (see my opinion in <em>Land </em>v. <em>Jeffries). </em>But, in the case before us, it appears by the special verdict, that it was not the intention of the owner, <em>Lunsford, </em>to deliver the slave in question to the appellant, though it is found that he was a runaway at the time, but to transfer to him the title of this and two other slaves, as a security for the due application of 1300 dollars, to be laid out in the purchase of other slaves for the appellant. This was one of those secret trusts, which the statute requiring mortgages and deeds of trust to be recorded, intended to inhibit, as to creditors and subsequent purchasers. Therefore, the second bill of sale to <em>Johnson, </em>under whom the appellee claims the same slave, accompanied by delivery of the possession, must prevail, notice to <em>Johnson </em>of the previous bill of sale to <em>Bird, </em>being negatived by the finding of the jury. As to the question raised at the bar, whether evidence of the secret trust was proper at law, there can be no doubt. The bill of sale is only evidence of the title; as to third persons, it does not pass the title of itself, as in the case of a deed recorded for that purpose, in which case, resort is had to a court of equity to remove the deed out of the way of proceedings at law. But its validity may be questioned, by creditors or subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>quent purchasers, at law as well as in equity. <em>Stratton </em>v. <em>Minnis, 2 </em>Munf. 329. The judgement must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax_\">Tucker, <em>P. </em>This is, I think, a very clear case against the appellant. The special verdict finds, that the deed under which the plaintiff claims, which is absolute upon its face, was intended and received as a conditional conveyance ; that was intended only to secure the payment of the sum of money specified therein. It was, therefore, in fact, nothing but a mortgage. Now, if it had been a mortgage on its face, it would have been void as to the subsequent purchaser, because it had not been recorded. So far as that purchaser is concerned, it would never have taken effect at all; because mortgages \u201c take effect as to subsequent purchasers from the delivery to the clerk to be recorded, <em>and from that time only.\u201d </em>Can it be then, that the <em>falsehood </em>of the conveyance, places the plaintiff in a better situation, than if the deed had been draughted according to the <em>truth </em>of the case? Can it be that even a <em>fair deed </em>would be considered void, because it is hidden from the eyes of purchasers, and that this deed is good, which, even when seen, hides in impenetrable secrecy from every eye, except those of the parties concerned in the transaction, its real character? I cannot think it. Every well received maxim must be overturned before it can be so: Suppression must become a merit, and falsehood a virtue; and a guilty party must be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong. So far from the absolute form of the deed making the appellant\u2019s case better, it stamps it in my judgement with stronger features of fraud, as respects purchasers and creditors. Independently of express adjudications upon the subject, it is but a corrollary from the principles established in <em>Twine\u2019s </em>case. It is a transaction calculated to work a double fraud ; to deceive a double set of creditors and purchasers; creditors and purchasers both of the grantor and grantee. To those of <em>Bird, </em>he is held out as the absolute owner of the slave; and when a .creditor seeks to charge it, or a purchaser acquires it, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>secret defeasance is brought forward to defeat them. To the creditors of <em>Lunsford, </em>on the other hand, the property is held out as the absolute property of <em>Bird, </em>while there is a secret trust between the parties, covering the equity of redemption of <em>Lunsford </em>in the mortgaged subject. What transaction can be more directly fraudulent? If I convey my estate to another, without any consideration, upon a secret trust for my benefit, the deed is indelibly stamped with fraud, in all contests with my creditors : Because my grantee covers my property from them. If they confide in the good faith of the transaction, they are led to suppose, that that property is not chargeable with their debt. And if this be so, where there is no consideration, how does it differ where there is a <em>false </em>consideration ? where there is an equity of redemption, which the creditor would have a right to subject to his demand, which, by the falsehood of the deed, is hidden from his view ?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The authorities, I think, very strongly sustain this view of the case; but it is unnecessary to examine them.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Judgement affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
