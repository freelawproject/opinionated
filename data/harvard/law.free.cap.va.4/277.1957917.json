The plaintiffjoined in demurrer, and replied generally to the plea. On argument, the demurrer was sustained, and judgment for the defendant; and that judgment was affirmed by the District Court, from which the plaintiff appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-11\">Randolph, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AS2m\">Wirt, for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A17\"><em>On the part of the appellant </em>an objection was made to a demurrer to the whole declaration and a plea to the whole : but the Court said it was settled, under our act of Assembly,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> that a plea and demurrer at the same time to the whole declaration are admissible. <em>Randolph </em>also observed the demurrer was offered too late, for an office judgment could be set aside by an issuable plea only, and a demurrer which does not go to the <em>merits</em><footnotemark><em>(1)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of the case is not an issuable plea.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> He then admitted the decisions of this Court as t0 the <em>(,UQ\u00bf </em>cum, and the want of a direct averment in the declaration, but contended that those decisions applied only to actions of <em>trespass. </em>In the Court of Common Pleas the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>quod cum </em>has long been disregarded; and in K. B. resort is had to a <em>fiction </em>to get over it.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> When, therefore, this Court adopted the evil of the <em>quod </em>cum, it would have been well to have adopted the antidote with it: but, since that fiction cannot be resorted to here, they should, for that reason, have emancipated themselves from the rule. He hoped, however, they would not, by analogy? extend it to other cases. In an action on a bond the \u201c whereas\u201d is mere inducement, and ought not to be regarded: and here the words \u201c <em>whereby the said writing obligatory becameforfeited\u201d </em>amout\u00f3ted to a positive averment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-4\"><em>On the other side, </em>it was urged, that the reason was the same, in every case, that a <em>positive averment </em>of the <em>gist </em>of the action should be made. The breach was therefore defectively assigned, being merely by way of <em>recital </em>throughout. Besides, there was no <em>time </em>laid when the breach was alleged to have been committed; neither was it so set out as to be clearly within the terms of the condition <em>;(b) </em>for, notwithstanding <em>John Webb </em>did depart and go out of the prison bounds, he might have previously \u201c <em>discharged the debt and </em>\u201c <em>costs and saved harmless the said John Lacy\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-5\">But the grand objection is, that the bond itself is void in law; the condition being different from that prescribed in the act of Assembly.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> According to that act it should have been \u201c that he the said <em>John Webb </em>should not depart \u201c or go out of the rules or bounds of the prison to which he \u201c was committed the words \u201c until he should have dis- \u201c charged the debt and costs and saved harmless the said \u201c <em>John Lacy? </em>should not have been added.

Simms,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(all of which were actions on the case, and after general verdict,) were founded. <em>Lomax </em>v. <em>Hord, </em>was also an action on the case ; and though inclined to think the second count might be supported after a verdict, I yielded my opinion, without reluctance, to the majority of the Court who thought otherwise, although that case, also, was not upon a demurrer. That a sentence introduced by the word <em>whereas </em>has been always regarded as mere recital, unless in a subsequent part of h there is some positive allegation, has been too long settled both by pedagogues and rhetoricians, as well as by Courts, to be doubted at this day. That part of the declaration in which the escape (the very <em>gist </em>of this action) is mentioned, is prefaced in that manner; nor does it appear to me to be helped by the words <em>u whereby the said writing obligatory </em>\u201c <em>became </em>forfeitedthat being only a <em>legal conclusion, </em>and not as was contended a <em>substantive averment </em>of a matter of fact. Still I should have struggled hard to support this declaration, if in the subsequent part a proper expression, such as might refer to the <em>whole </em>subject matter before recited had been used, instead of the word <em>assignment, </em>as the inducement to the action. For the assignme it of the bond <em>alone </em>could not give a <em>right </em>of action unless a precedent <em>escape </em>had given a caus\u00e9 of action : neither is this mistake (probably made <em>c\u00farrente calamo} </em>aided upon a demurrer, by the subsequent words \u201c and by force oi an ac&lt;. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>u </em>Assembly in that ease made and provided,\u201d because the act of Assembly does not give an <em>action, </em>unless there has been an escape, which in this case is not properly averred. In an action founded upon a statute, the plaintiff ought to <em>aver very fact </em>necessary to inform the Court that his case is w:Jun the statute. Whether a verdict might have supplied the want of this averment, [ shall not pretend at present Ui say ; the question before us being, whether it is good upon a general demurrer. I think it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">But an objection was taken to die bond itself, which, if sound, is fatai not only to the present action, but to any odier that may be brought upon this bond. - By the act of 1748, c. 6. incorporated in the late revisal.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> it is declared that it shall not be lawful for any sheriff or his officer or deputy, to take\" any obligation of or from any person or persons in his custody, for or concerning any matter relating to his office, otherwise payable, thlan to <em>himself </em>as <em>sheriff\", </em>and dischargeable upon the prisoner\u2019s appearance, &amp;c. And every obligation by any sheriff taken, in <em>other </em>manner <em>or form </em>by colour of his office, shall be null <em>and </em>void <em>; </em>except, in any special case, any other obligation is, or shall be by law, particularly and expressly directed. This clause was framed on the purview of <em>stat. 23 Hen. </em>VI. c. 10. concerning which great doubts were formerly en-eriained, whether the Judges must take notice of it, <em>ex </em>oficio, or whether it must be pleaded,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> but that doubt has been lately overruled in <em>England ;</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and there is the same or greater reason for overruling it in this country, where special pleading is so seldom practised, and where the law permits private acts to be given in evidence without pleading. The bond auiho! ized to be taken from.persons in <em>execution </em>by the act of 1748, is to be taken to the sheriff with good and sufficient <em>securities </em>under a reasonable penalty, upon condition that he shall not depart or go out of the rules, or bounds of the prison to which he was committed. Any further <em>substantive condition </em>under the first recited act is therefore voide.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> The sole question then is, whether those words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>of the condition, \u201c if the above bound <em>John Webb </em>shall keep \u201c within the prison bounds laid off by the Justices of the \u201c Court of <em>New </em>Kent, until he shall have <em>discharged the debt </em>\u201c <em>and </em>costs, and <em>save </em>harmless the said <em>John </em>Lacy, then \u201c the above obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in \u201c full force and virtue.\u201d do import a substantive <em>condition </em>beyond that which the law authorizes. Suppose <em>Webb </em>should have taken the oath of insolvency, and had been discharged by virtue thereof. Would he not have broken the condition not to depart the bounds <em>until he should have </em>discharged <em>the debt </em>and costs ? Certainly, I conceive: the bond is therefore void for that part of the condition which should have only required that he should not depart the bounds, until thence discharged by <em>due course of laxo. </em>Again; suppose him to have left the bounds, and that the sheriff had neglected to pursue the proper steps pointed out by the law to take him ; and for that <em>neglect </em>the plaintiff had brought suit against the sheriff and recovered. Still might not the sheriff, according to the latter part of this condition, have brought suit against <em>Webb </em>and his securities, to indemnify him for his departure from the bounds, though he might have retaken him if he would, the next day, or perhaps the next hour? Certainly he might, unless the bond itself be void. Now every bond taken in such manner as to induce or encourage neglect of duty in a public officer is void, I conceive, by the <em>common law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">The statute has, for the sake of the prisoner, superadded a further security against the abuses of office, by declaring all bonds taken in any <em>other </em>manner or form, than such as is by law particularly <em>and expressly </em>directed, void.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> I am therefore of opinion both judgments were correct, and ought to be affirmed..</p>\n<author id=\"b298-13\">Judge Fleming.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"AFS\">After a deliberate and mature consideration of this case, I perfectly concur in the opinion just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>delivered, on every point; and more especially, that the bond on which the action was founded is .illegal and void, not being authorized either by the common law, or by statute ; the condition being <em>thatli John Webb\u201d </em>the debtor, should keep within the prison bounds laid off by the Justices of the Court of <em>New </em>Kent, <em>until he should have discharged </em>\u201c <em>the debt\u201d \u00e1ndeoste, and save harmless the said John Lacy. </em>The effects that such a bond might have had on the prisoner, have been too clearly pointed out to need a repetition; and, had the declaration been ever so formal and correct, an action on this bond never could have been sustained, it being-void in itself, as having been taken, expressly, contrary to Jaw.</p>\n<p id=\"ACH\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Ai1\"> 2 <em>Wash. 187.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AdA\"> 1 Call. 83.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"ALX\">\n<em> 2 Call, 39.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AHNj\"><em>Rev.Code, </em>vol. 1. c. 80. s. 17. p. 122.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AuN\">\n<em>SeePlowd, 64, 65.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"Ajf\"> 2 <em>Term Rep. </em>574, <em>573 Samuel v.
