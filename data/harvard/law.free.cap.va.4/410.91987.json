A. Chandler </em>administrator of <em>Joseph Godwin </em>deceased, who had been administrator of <em>Edmond Godwin </em>deceased, and <em>Martha Godwin </em>widow of <em>Edmond, </em>and administratrix <em>de bonis non </em>of his estate, and others his distributees; which involved a settlement of <em>Joseph Godwin\u2019s </em>accounts of administration of the estate of <em>Edmond Godwin, </em>and a distribution of any balance found due thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-8\">. Upon the settlement of the accounts before the commissioner, it appeared, that there was a balance due from the estate of <em>Joseph Godwin </em>to that of <em>Edmond Godwin; </em>but this balance consisted intirely of the proceeds of slave property of <em>Edmond\u2019s </em>estate, which had been sold by <em>Joseph, </em>under an apprehension that the sale was necessary to raise funds to pay debts of <em>Edmond\u2019s </em>estate, though it turned out that the sale was not necessary, or that more slaves were sold than necessary, to meet the debts. And in distributing this balance, the commissioner allowed the widow one-third of it in absolute property. To this an exception was taken, on the ground, that as the widow was entitled by law only to a life estate in one-third of the slave property of her husband, so she was only entitled to the- value of a life interest in one-third of the proceeds of the slaves that had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>been sold. The chancellor, in his decree, overruled the exception, approved the report, and decreed accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajd\">Au appeal was taken by <em>Chandler, </em>from the decree generally; and there were many questions arising on the details of the accounts; but the only question of law was that presented by the above mentioned exception to the commissioner\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-6\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b435-8\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AR0\">The court is of opinion, that the widow is improperly allowed one-third of the balance found due from the administrator, in absolute property. That balance is, in effect, the proceeds of the sales of slaves, to one-third of which she had title indeed, but only for life. What her proportion of the price ought to be, can be estimated by no certain rule that the court knows of. It is a complicated question presenting a triple ratio; the probable life of the widow', the probable life of the slaves, and the difference between the hires of the slaves in her portion, and the interest of her portion of their price. For, if the slaves had not been sold, their hires would have been of more value to her than the interest of the money; and, therefore, the mere interest of the money for life would seem, at first view, not a fair compensation; yet as this is certain, and the hires uncertain, since the slaves may die, perhaps there is no better rule, in such cases, than to allow her one-third of the money for life. No other course can approximate to what is right. For it is possible the slaves, or the widow, may die, the day after allotment; and so her interest may be worth little or nothing. But it is also possible, that the slaves may live many years, and yet die before her, and then she W'ould have had the whole value. And it is also possible, she might live until they were superannuated ; so that if they survived her, they would be a charge and not a profit. The use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>purchase money for life, is, therefore, the most proper mea<em>sure} </em>aQd wherever her portion of purchase money is so paid over to a widow for life, bond with security should be required of her, for paying it over at her death, to the perent*ded in remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
