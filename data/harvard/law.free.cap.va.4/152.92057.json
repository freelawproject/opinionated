The will was proved in the county court of <em>Culpeper, </em>at April term 1822. <em>George Thornton </em>died in 1824, without having qualified as executor of the will; neither did <em>Mrs. Thornton </em>ever qualify as executrix. The testator\u2019s estate remained wholly unrepresented until the March term of the county court 1826, when the court granted administration with the will annexed to <em>Frances Thornton, </em>a daughter of the testator, with the express assent of the executrix <em>Mrs. Thornton, </em>who declared her agreement that the administration should be granted to her daughter, but said, at the same time, that she reserved her right to qualify after her daughter\u2019s death : but this assent and agreement of <em>Mrs. Thornton, </em>to the grant of administration with the will annexed to her daugh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ter, and reservation of her own right to qualify after the daughter\u2019s death, were not entered of record, and, indeed, were mere parol declarations, upon which, however, the court proceeded to grant the administration. <em>Frances Thornton, </em>the administratrix, died in 1828.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-4\">The testator, <em>John Thornton, </em>had been an officer of the army during the war of the revolution, and, as such, had a claim against the <em>\u00dc. States </em>for half pay for life from the termination of his service, or commutation of five years full pay : this claim was nowise disposed of, or even mentioned, in his will, so that, as to it, <em>he died </em>intestate. The testator, besides his son <em>George </em>and daughter <em>Frances, </em>left several descendants living at his death; namely, several grandchildren, the children of a daughter then deceased, and a grandson, <em>James Winston, </em>the only child of another daughter then also deceased, who had been the wife of <em>Isaac Winston: </em>these grandchildren, of course, were distributees of the testator, and entitled to shares of the persona] subject undisposed of by his will. The grandson <em>James Winston </em>died in 1831, leaving a will, by which he devised and bequeathed his whole estate real and personal, and especially his share of his grandfather\u2019s recently discovered claim against the <em>U. States, </em>to his father <em>Isaac Winston, </em>the appellee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">It being necessary that the testator\u2019s estate should be represented, in order to prosecute the claim against the <em>U.

The county court, at April term 1832, by one si-meuee, deoied the administration to <em>Winston, </em>and by another, grant' *! <em>h to Mrs. Thornton.

That she had, in effect, never renounced the executorship of her husband\u2019s will: that it was necessary to constitute a valid renunciation of such a right, that the executrix should have been cited to appear before the court of probat, and should thereupon have renounced the executorship, and such renunciation entered and <em>recorded; </em>that a refusal by any act <em>in pais, </em>as by a mere verbal declaration to that effect, is not sufficient, but to give it validity it must be thus solemnly entered and recorded. Toller\u2019s Law of ex\u2019ors, 41, 2. 93.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> He said the cases of <em>Geddy </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>3 Munf. 345. <em>Nelson v. Carrington, </em>4 Id. 332. and <em>Burnley </em>v. <em>Duke, </em>1 Rand. 108. in which it had been held that the renunciation of an executorship may be by act <em>in pais, </em>was distinguishable <em>from </em>the present case : in those cases, the right to the administration was not, as it was here, the point in contest. And here, as the executrix did not, by any act valid in law, renounce the executorship, so neither did she, in fact, renounce or intend to renounce <em>it; </em>for she expressly reserved her right to qualify after the death of her daughter, to whom she agreed, that administration with the will annexed should be granted. 2. He contended, that if the executrix had, in the most solemn and binding manner, renounced the ex-ecutorship, and thereupon administration with the will annexed had been granted to another,\u2014though she could not have retracted her refusal during the lifetime of the administrator, yet she had a right to do so after the grant of administration had ceased by the administrator\u2019s death, and then would have been, entitled to the executorship or to the administration <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed ; to which point he cited Toll. Law of ex\u2019ors, 45. 92. But, 3. Supposing this a general question which of the parties was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>titled to administration of the decedent\u2019s estate, the statute gave the preference to the widow over all other persons. 1 Rev.

Green </em>and <em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWj\">maintained, that a valid and binding renunciation of the right of executor-ship may be made by act <em>in pais, </em>and that the cases of <em>Geddy </em>v. <em>Butler, Nelson </em>v. <em>Carrington, </em>and <em>Burnley </em>v. <em>Duke, </em>were in point to that purpose. And they cited the case of <em>Broker </em>v. <em>Charter, </em>Cro. Eliz. 92. to shew, not only that an executor\u2019s renunciation of the executorship may as well be by matter in fact as by judicial act, but that such a renunciation once made by an executor, however qualified, in favor of a particular person, is absolute, peremptory and perpetual. The reason was, that though an executor may <em>renounce, </em>he cannot <em>assign, </em>his right of executorship. The executrix, in this case, having duly renounced the executorship, and the other executor named in the will having previously died without ever qualifying, the testator was dead <em>intestate </em>(that is, in the technical sense, without having constituted any executor) as much as if he had made a testamentary disposition of his property without naming any executor, in which case the paper (technically speaking) would have been a codicil. 3 Bac. Abr. Ex\u2019ors and Adm\u2019rs, C. p. 27. Shep. Touchs. 406. It was, indeed, only because the decedent, in such case, was thus <em>intestate </em>in law, that an administration could be granted: and when, by the refusal of a sole executor, if only one, or of all the executors, if more than one named in the will, or of the survivors after the death of the others, a decedent was become intestate in law, there could never afterwards be an executor, but only an administrator with the will annexed; and the refusing executor could neither qualify as <em>executor, </em>nor derive, from the nomination of him as executor in the will, any preferable claim to the administration : he stood, now, on the same ground as if he had not been named executor in the will. <em>Broker </em>v. <em>Charter, ubi supra. Hensloe\u2019s </em>case, 9 Co. 37. 38. 40. Shep. Touchs. 461, 2, 6, 7.

As to the passages cited by the appellant\u2019s counsel from Toller\u2019s Law of ex\u2019ors, 42, 3. 92. that, after administration granted in consequence of an executor\u2019s renunciation of the executorship, the executor cannot retract his refusal during the lifetime of the administrator, <em>hut he may do so after the grant has ceased by the administrator's death; </em>they said, it would be found, that the proposition was not sustained by any authority; on the contrary, the authorities were the other way. Then, if the appellant had no preferable claim to the administration <em>by </em>reason of the testator\u2019s nomination of her to the office of executrix, which she had renounced, she had certainly no preferable claim to administration as the widow of the testator, or rather, no claim to it at all on that ground, because she had no manner of interest in the estate undisposed of by the testator\u2019s will, and as to which he was intestate. The will made a provision for her (and apparently a most ample one) in real and personal <em>property; </em>she never renounced the provision made for her by the will; and, therefore, she could never claim any thing from the testator\u2019s personal estate besides that which his will gave her. The statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 104. ^ 26. p. 381. provides, that a widow dissatisfied with the provision made for her by her husband\u2019s will, may renounce such provision within the year after his death,\u2014but that every widow, not making such renunciation, \u201c shall have no more of her husband\u2019s slaves and personal estate than is given her by his will.\u201d The appellant, then, had no interest in the estate to be administered ; and the appellee was entitled to a distributive share of it. Therefore, she had no claim to the administration, and the appellee had a claim to it as a distributee. <em>Cutchin v.

Philadelphia 1824.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b180-6\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AbXR\">The first point made for the appellant, was, that her assent to her daughter\u2019s taking administration being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>in pais, </em>was not such a renunciation of the executorship, as bound her. But it has been expressly decided by this court, in <em>Geddy </em>v. <em>Butler, Nelson </em>v. <em>Carrington, </em>and <em>Burnley </em>v. <em>Duke, </em>that such renunciation may be effectually made by declarations <em>in pais, </em>or may be presumed from circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">It was next insisted, that this renunciation, though it might for the time authorize the grant of administration to the daughter, was no peremptory renunciation, but that on the death of her daughter, the widow still had a right to qualify as executrix. The passage cited from Toller\u2019s Law of ex\u2019ors, 42. certainly supports the proposition ; but that passage itself is not only wholly unsupported, but seems directly in opposition to the books there referred to. <em>Toller </em>says, \u201c After refusal by the executor and administration granted, the party is incapable of assuming the executorship <em>during the lifetime of such administrator, </em>but after the death of the administrator, he may retract his renunciationand Wentw. Off. Ex\u2019or, Swinburne, and 3 Bac. Abr. are cited in the margin. Now, in Wentw. Off. Ex\u2019or, 38. I find this <em>passage\u2014\u201c </em>After refusal, and administration committed, <em>the executor cannot go hack, to prove the will, and assume the </em>executorship\u201d\u2014almost the words used by <em>Toller </em>in the first part of the sentence, but unqualified by his assertion that the executor may retract after the death of the administrator. And (p. 41.) <em>Wentworth </em>gives the reason why there can be no such power of retraction : \u201c It is clear, he says, that if there be but one executor, and he refuse, or being many, if they do all refuse, <em>then is the party dead intestate, </em>and administration is to be committed with the will annexed. <em>JYor can any after meddle as executors.\u201d </em>Certainly, the party could never be said <em>to be dead intestate, </em>if there were a person living who might, under any circumstances, still claim to qualify as executor. So, in <em>Swinburne, </em>part 6. \u00a7 12. it is said\u2014\u201c But after refusal, and administration committed to another, the executor cannot recede from it, and go back to prove the will, and assume the executorship.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>And in 3 Bac. Abr. 42. it is said, still more strongly\u2014\u201c If an executor refuse before the ordinary, to take upon him the executorship, the ordinary may grant administration <em>cum testamento annexo </em>to another person, and he can <em>never </em>afterwards be permitted to prove the will.\u201d In Rolle\u2019s Abr. 907. it is said, \u201c if all the executors refuse to administer, administration shall be granted, <em>for then the testator is dead </em>intestateand he cites several of the year books. In <em>Graysbrook </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>Plowd. 281. it is said, <em>\u201c </em>where a man makes his executors, who refuse, the ordinary may commit administration to others, <em>because, 'upon the matter he died </em>intestate.\u201d And in <em>JAensloe's esse, </em>9 Co. 40. the court lay it down, that \u201c the reason why the ordinary may, upon the refusal of all the executors, or their death intestate, grant administration, is,' because <em>now the testator dies intestate, </em>and then the statute 31 Ed. 3. gives him power to grant it, which he cannot do, when one refuses, and the other proves.\u201d Upon all these authorities, as well as the clear reason of the case, I am well satisfied, that the passage in <em>Toller </em>is erroneous, and that when an executor has once renounced, and administration has been committed, he can never retract his renunciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">It was contended, in the last place, that the wife has the best right to administration under our statute; and this, though it be clear (as in the case before us it is) that she has no interest in the <em>residuum; </em>nothing to do with the personalty beyond the provision made for her by the will. But this is a question concluded, as I conceive, by our own decisions, and these decisions founded on the law and reason of the case. In <em>Cutchin </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, Hendren v. Colgin, </em>and <em>Bray </em>v. <em>Dudgeon </em>(cited at <em>the </em>bar), this court has decided, that the person entitled to the estate, is entitled to the administration, and, in the last case, this was so adjudged against a husband seeking administration on his wife\u2019s estate,\u2014a case in point. I am of opinion, on the whole, that the sentence must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Cabell, <em>J. </em>I am also of opinion, that the sentence should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiv\">Tucker, P. The attempt to sustain the claim of the appellant, in this case, to the administration of the estate of her husband, rests upon three grounds\u20141. that she was the executrix named in the will, and has never refused the executorship ; 2. that if her verbal declaration could be considered a refusal, she had a right to retract it after the death of the first <em>administratrix; </em>and 3. that if that be not so, she had as widow the preferable right to the administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">As to the first proposition, it rests upon the assumption that a verbal declaration <em>in pais </em>does not amount to a refusal, but that a valid renunciation can only be by act done before the court of probat. Whatever may have been the former doctrines of the ecclesiastical courts, it seems to have been admitted in the case of <em>Broker </em>v. <em>Charter, </em>Cro. Eliz. 92. that a letter written by the executors declaring their inability to attend to the duties of executor, was held a valid renunciation; and upon that occasion, <em>Dr. Ford </em>declared before the justices, that by the civil law, a renouncing may be by a matter in fact as well as by judicial act, and that a refusal might even be by parol. This case seems to have been not only unquestioned, but it is also set forth by the various elementary writers as containing the law of the subject. In our courts too, it has been repeatedly adjudged, that the renunciation of an executorship may be by act <em>in pais ; </em>and, in like manner, our statute makes the refusal or failure of all the executors to give security, equivalent to a refusal of the executorship. In the present case, it appears that when <em>Frances Thornton, </em>the first person who administered on the estate, was appointed, <em>Mrs. Thornton </em>declared her agreement that <em>Frances </em>should qualify, but at the same time reserved her right to qualify after her death. Now this agreement by an executor, that another shall qualify as administrator, amounts of course to a refusal of the executorship j because the executor thereby consents, that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>testator shall be considered as having died <em>technically </em>intestate, ^hat is without executor. It is a consent that the interest in the estate, which the testator had cast upon him, should be withdrawn from him and cast upon another, and of course inevitably implies a renunciation of that interest himself. Here, it is true, the widow reserved her right to qualify after <em>Frances Thornton's </em>death; and this leads to the</p>\n<p id=\"ATF\">\u2022 2nd Inquiry; whether she had a right to retract her renunciation after <em>Frances Thornton's </em>death? This rests upon a mere question of law: for the reservation of her subsequent right to qualify, can only have effect if it should appear she had such subsequent right. The passages which have been cited from <em>Toller's </em>treatise, go fully to the point, that if an executor renounces, and an administrator is appointed, though the executor cannot retract in his lifetime, \u2022he may after his death, however formally the renunciation may have been made. Upon examination, however, this particular proposition seems wholly unfounded in authority. The editor of the new edition of the Office of Executors, seems to have considered it as sustained by <em>Bacon's </em>abridgement and by <em>Swinburne, </em>part 6. \u00a7 12. but in neither of those is-there the slightest intimation of any such opinion. -The case of <em>Broker </em>v. <em>Charter </em>moreover ccmtains the declaration of <em>Dr. Ford, </em>very explicitly, that the renunciation of the executor cannot be partial, or only for a time, but is absolute and perpetual; and though the case itself is not in point here, since in that case the administrator was yet living when the act occurred retracting the renunciation, yet this declaration of a doctor of the civil law (who was, I presume, of the prerogative court) cannot be of less authority than the unsupported <em>dictum </em>of <em>Toller. </em>The proposition, indeed, seems \u25a0 at variance with fundamental principles. By the common law, he who made a will without naming an executor, was technically considered as dying intestate; and if an executor was appointed, and he refused, the testator was <em>then </em>considered intestate. By the common law, also, the appointment of an executor gave him a right to the <em>residuum </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>after the payment of debts and legacies, unless that right was expressly or impliedly excluded by the will. On the other hand, where the decedent died intestate, the ordinary, in early times, took the one-third of the estate\u2019*\u00bb <em>pios usus; </em>and then, when administrators came to be appointed, <em>they </em>were at first deemed to be entitled to the <em>residuum </em>after payment of debts; and, afterwards, were compelled to make distribution. Hence it is obvious, that the <em>residuum </em>went, in right of property, to the executor, if he qualified; but if he did not, it went to the administrator in his own right, or as fiduciary. The effect, then, of a renunciation by the executor, was to part with this right of property; to consent that his testator should be deemed to have died inteS\u2019 tate as to it, and to agree that it should pass into the hands of such person as the ordinary should make administrator, for the benefit of those by law entitled. This is of the nature of a transfer of a right or title in personal property; and hence it may be truly said, in the language of <em>Dr. Ford, </em>that, after the renunciation, the executor shall never retract, <em>quia transit in contractum. </em>The right of property has passed, and cannot be arbitrarily reclaimed: the testator has been admitted to be intestate, and the rights which thereby vested cannot be revoked and annulled by again considering him testate. The affairs of estates would be eternally unsettled, if such irregularities were permitted; and though it is true the executor is not now entitled to the <em>residuum, </em>and that the principles out of which the rule has grown, have been in part repudiated by our law, yet the practice to which they gave rise must still be adhered to. I am, therefore, of opinion, that after a refusal by an executor, and the appointment of an administrator, there is no right on the part of the executor to retract his refusal upon the death of the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Then, 3rdly, upon the death of <em>Frances Thornton, </em>when it became necessary to appoint an administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>had <em>Mrs. Thornton </em>a preferable right to the appointment? Admitting, that, in the appointment of an adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>trator <em>de lonis non, </em>the same preferences are to be observed as <em>m </em>{ke original grant of administration, and admitting that <em>Mrs. Thornton\u2019s </em>permission to <em>Frances Thornton </em>to administer, was no waiver of her preferable right, still that right would or would not exist, according as she had or had not an interest in the testator\u2019s estate. For, notwithstanding the strong language of the statute, it cannot at this day be contested, that the right of administration mainly follows the title to the personal estate. This has been repeatedly decided in <em>Virginia; </em>and it is the settled law of <em>England, </em>Toll. 116. So far, indeed, is the doctrine carried, which gives the administration to the person entitled to the property, that although the statute directs the husband or wife to be preferred, yet their claims will yield when the estate is to go to other persons; as, where by settlement upon the death of the <em>feme, </em>her property is to pass to her representatives to the exclusion of her husband, her relations shall have the administration in preference to the husband or his representatives; Toll. 85. 116. <em>Bray </em>v. <em>Dudgeon, 6 </em>Munf. 132. Now, in this case, I take it the widow is entitled to no portion of the <em>residuum. </em>She has had an ample provision made for her by her husband\u2019s will; and if not, yet she has not renounced the will: and the law emphatically declares, as to <em>the personalty, </em>that if she does not declare her refusal of the provision made for her by the will, within a limited time, she shall have no more of her husband\u2019s slaves and personal estate than is given her by his will. It is not correct to suppose, that such provision must be declared, or averred to be, in <em>lieu </em>of her distributable share: there is no such language in this statute. In the statute concerning dower, indeed, it is made necessary to bar <em>dower, </em>that the estate conveyed must be, expressly or by averment, in lieu of the dower of the wife; but that provision is confined to the real estate, and to that alone do all the cases refer, in which it has been held, that a wife may take the provision made for her by her husband\u2019s will, and her dower also.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\">Sentence affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
