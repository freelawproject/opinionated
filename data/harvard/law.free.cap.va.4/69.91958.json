And it also insisted, that by the failure of the lessee or his assigns to perform the covenant for payment of the ground rents, so as to let them be in arrear for three years, the term was <em>ipso facto </em>forfeited, and the premises revested in the lessor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-11\">The chancellor declared, that the <em>Borough of Norfolk </em>was entitled to priority over both the banks, and that the <em>Bank of Virginia </em>was entitled to priority over the <em>Farmers Bank; </em>and, therefore, decreed, that the <em>Mutual Assurance Society </em>should pay the borough, the sum of 2080 dollars (being the aggregate of the principal of the rents claimed, and interest thereon from August 1821, when the last of those rents accrued, to the date of the decree) with interest on 1575 dollars, part thereof being principal, from the date of the decree, and the costs of the borough in this suit; and then pay the residue of the money due on the policy of assurance, to the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>in part satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>faction of its claim, it being not enough to discharge the whole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGH\">From this decree the <em>Farmers Bank </em>appealed <em>to </em>this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ArR\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Nicholas </em>for the <em>Farmers Bank, heigh </em>for the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>and <em>Johnson </em>for the <em>Borough of Norfolk:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOF\">there was no counsel for <em>M\u2019Dowell\u2019s </em>administrator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-10\">I. As to the claim to the fund in question, set up by <em>M\u2019Dowell\u2019s </em>administrator in the court of chancery, it was clearly shewn,\u2014by reference to the 8th section of the original act of incorporation of the <em>Mutual Assurance Society </em>(an abstract of which may be seen in the report of <em>The M. A. Society </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; others, </em>3 Leigh 219.) and by the rules and regulations of the society, to which all the assured are parties,\u2014that when property there assured, is mortgaged, the policy of assurance is <em>ipso facto </em>assigned to the mortgagee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-11\">II. <em>Nicholas </em>argued for <em>the Farmers Bank, that it had </em>a right to have satisfaction out of the money due on the policy of assurance, in preference to the <em>Bank of Virginia; </em>because <em>M\u2019Dowell\u2019s </em>notes, by the express provisions of the deed of trust of the 20th March 1817, under which the latter claimed, were only to be renewed until the 1st March 1818, and the security provided by the deed was only a security for the contents of the note existing at the date of the deed, or of such other note as might, afterwards, from time to time <em>until the period before mentioned </em>(namely, the 1st March 1818), be given in lieu or renewal thereof. But the <em>Bank of Virginia </em>continued the accommodation to <em>M\u2019Dowell </em>upon notes renewed from time to time (with an interval of three months in 1819) until May 1822. Therefore, the note protested at the last date, was not a note whereof the contents were secured by the deed of trust under which the <em>Bank of Virginia </em>claimed; it was a wholly different note, the contents of which were not secured or intended to be secured by the deed, but on the contrary distinctly excluded from the security thereby provided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>Leigh, </em>for the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>answered, that the original note given for the debt due that bank, was not the debt, but only the evidence of the debt and personal security tor it, and the notes renewed irom time to time, were only renewed evidences of the debt and of the personal security; the debt itself, of which it was the purpose of the deed of trust to provide collateral security, remaining throughout one and the same. The original debt remained unpaid, acknowledgedly, till the 1st March 1818. The effect of the renewal of the notes for it from time to time afterwards, was to give a further credit for it, beyond what was at first intended ; but, notwithstanding the extension of credit, the same original debt, which was due the 1st March 1818, remained still unpaid. The giving such further credit nowise changed the debt, or impaired the collateral security for it: the rights of the <em>Bank of Virginia </em>were exactly the same, in this regard, as if it had allowed the further credit, without a renewal of the notes. The <em>Farmers Bank </em>was the assignee of <em>M'DowelVs </em>equity of redemption, and so entitled to redeem upon the terms on which he would have been; and, surely, <em>M\u2019Dowell </em>could not have been heard to object to the lien of the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>that it had renewed his notes for a longer time than it had stipulated to renew them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-9\">III. <em>Leigh </em>said, the chancellor erred in adjusting the question of preference between the <em>Borough of Norfolk </em>and the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>upon the bill and the pleadings in this cause; for they presented no such question between those parties. The bill, indeed, claimed a priority for the <em>Farmers Bank </em>over both; but the only question it presented, was, whether that bank was entitled to such priority ? It nowise concerned the <em>Farmers Bank, </em>which of the defendants was entitled to priority over the other; on this point, therefore, the bill presented no issue. Accordingly, the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>in its answer, only controverted the priority insisted on by the <em>Farmers Bank </em>over its own claim, and properly avoided to put in issue the question of priority between itself and the borough.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>for the borough, answered, that the obvious purpose of the bill was to have the rights of <em>all parties, </em>as to priority of satisfaction out of the insurance money, adjusted. The claim of the borough to <em>priority equally </em>affected the interests of both the banks: that claim, therefore, the <em>Farmers Bank </em>contested; it claimed priority over the borough as well as over the <em>Bank of Virginia; </em>and the adjudication of the claim asserted in the bill, necessarily involved the examination, comparison and adjustment of the rights of co-defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-9\">IV. <em>Nicholas </em>and <em>Leigh </em>then contended, 1st. That the decree was erroneous in giving preference to the borough over the banks, for satisfaction <em>out of the money due on the policy of assurance. </em>The policy was a personal subject assigned to the banks as collateral security for debt: the borough had no specific lien on the policy, or qn the money due upon it: with respect to this fund, the banks were specific incumbrances; the borough a general creditor. There could be no question in equity, between the borough as lessor of the premises and creditor for the rents in arrear, and the banks as assignees <em>of the policy of assurance: </em>the only questions between the borough and the banks grew out of the relation of the borough as lessor, and the banks as assignees, <em>of the term, </em>originally leased to <em>Booze, </em>and from him through <em>M'Dowell </em>derived to the banks; and these were questions which could properly be controverted only in an action at law brought by the borough, upon the covenants in the lease. 2ndly. Supposing the first objection unfounded, yet, they said, the decree was erroneous in allowing <em>the </em>claim of the borough, and giving priority of satisfaction, for rents in arrear for which the banks <em>as assignees of the term </em>were not bound, and which, therefore, were not properly chargeable on this fund. The only breaches of the covenants in the lease, consisted in the non-payment of the ground rents reserved. The amount of about eleven years rents in arrear were claimed by the borough, and allowed by the decree; comprising the rents of about five years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>which accrued before the term was assigned to <em>M\u2019Dowell </em>in September 1815; the rents of about two years following, which accrued before <em>M.\u2019Dowell </em>mortgaged the term to the <em>Bank of Virginia; </em>and the rents of about four years, which accrued after that mortgage was executed, but while <em>M\u2019Dowell, </em>not the bank, held the possession. Now, <em>M \u2019Dowell </em>was not bound to pay the rents in arrear, or liable for any breach of covenants, before the assignment of the term to him; nor were the banks bound to pay any rents which accrued before the term was mortgaged to them. For the assignee <em>of </em>a lease could not be held liable for any breaches of covenants before the assignment; he was only liable in respect of his possession, and for breaches during his own time. <em>Walker\u2019s </em>case, 3 Co. 23. <em>Grescot </em>v. <em>Green, </em>1 Salk. 199. <em>Tovey </em>v. <em>Pitcher, Id. </em>80. <em>Cook v. Harris, </em>1 Ld. Raym. 368. <em>St. Saviour\u2019s church wardens </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>3 Burr. 1271. Whether the banks were bound for the rents accrued during the four last years, which elapsed after the execution of the first mortgage of the term, but while <em>M\u2019Dowell </em>the mortgagor remained in possession, was a doubtful point. In <em>Pilkington </em>v. <em>Shaller, </em>2 Vern. 374. it was held, that the mortgages; of a term, though never in possession, was bound for breaches of the covenants in the lease after the execution of the mortgage; but the contrary was adjudged by lord <em>Mansfield </em>and the whole court of <em>King\u2019s Bench, </em>in <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Jaques, </em>2 Doug. 455. And then, in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bosanquet, </em>1 Brod. &amp; Bing. 238. 5 Eng. C. L. R. 72. it was decided, that by the mortgage of a lease, the whole interest passed to the mortgagee, and he became liable on the covenant for rent, though he never entered into the possession; and it was said to have been the opinion of a great majority of all the judges, that <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Jaques </em>was not to be considered as having been rightly decided. This court would decide, between these conflicting authorities, which was the better opinion. But 3rdly, they insisted, that, whatever rents in arrear the borough was entitled to, the decree was erroneous in allowing interest on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>those rents, even from the time the last of the rents in arrear accrued; for it appeared that, during the time when those rents were accruing,\u2014until, indeed, the buildings on the premises were destroyed by fire in April 1822,\u2014there was always sufficient distress on the premises. <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Wise, </em>3 Hen. &amp;. Munf. 463. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Wilson, Id. </em>470. <em>Dow v. Adams, </em>5 Munf. 21. <em>Michie </em>v. <em>Wood, 5 </em>Rand. 571.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-10\"><em>Johnson </em>answered, 1st. That as the lease from the borough to <em>Booze </em>was a building lease, and the <em>lessee </em>covenanted, for himself and <em>his assigns, </em>to improve the premises within three years, in such manner that the yearly ground rents should be <em>thereby sufficiently secured, </em>and that in case the rents should be in arrear at any time during the term for three years, the borough might lease out the premises again, <em>with all the improvements thereon, </em>for the residue of the term,\u2014it was, therefore, plain, that the lessor had a specific lien on the buildings erected on the premises in pursuance of the covenants, for the. ground rents; and, in equity, after the destruction of the buildings by fire, the money due on the policy of assurance thereof, must be regarded as standing in the place of the buildings, and subject to the same specific lien for the security of the rents to the lessor. The assignees of the lease, too, were expressly bound for the performance of all the covenants, and <em>took subject to all </em>the rights of the lessor, and subject especially to the' specific lien on the buildings to secure the rents. 2ndly. He went into an examination of the general doctrine, that an assignee of a lease is not liable for breaches of covenants before the assignment, in order to shew that it was inapplicable to this case. Here, there was an express covenant, that in case the rents should be in arrear at any time for three years, not only the lessor might lease the premises again for the residue of the term, and that the lessee and his assigns should make good any deficiency, but that <em>he and they should make good the arrears of rents. </em>Therefore, the assignees of the term were expressly bound to pay all arrears of rent, whether they accrued before or after the assignment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>And he considered it now settled, by the case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bosanquet, </em>that there is no difference, in respect of liability to the lessor for breaches of covenants in a lease, between a mortgagee and any other purchaser of the whole term ; and that the mortgagee is bound, like any other purchaser, though he never enters into the possession. But here again, he said, there was an express contract which obviated all doubt: it was expressly covenanted in the deed of trust executed by <em>M\u2019Dowell </em>to secure the debt to the <em>Bank of </em>Virginia, that the trustees and their assigns should pay the ground rents, and perform all the covenants in the original lease contained, to be performed on the part of the lessee. 3rdly. As to interest on the rents, he said, the decisions of this court on the point, amounted in effect to this,\u2014that interest on rents should be allowed or not according to circumstances. And under the circumstances of this case, he said, the decree was right as to the allowance of interest: or, at least, interest should be allowed from the time the buildings were destroyed, since, thenceforth, a distress would have been unavailing, and <em>M\u2019Dowell </em>being dead insolvent, the borough had no means of recovering the rents : or, at any rate, interest should be allowed from the 6th January 1823, when the insurance money fell due; for that money ought to have been then immediately applied to the payment of the rents; and as it had not been so applied, and had been yielding interest all the time, that interest justly belonged to those to whom the principal ought to have been paid. Lastly, he himself objected to the decree, that it had not given to the borough what it had a right to insist upon : that the chancellor ought, undoubtedly, to have made provision out of the fund at his disposal, for the payment of all rents to accrue in future during the residue of the term ; and more, he ought to have made provision to secure the future rents, in the manner in which it was intended and covenanted in the original lease that they should be secured ; that is, by putting such new buildings on the premises as would suffice to secure them. He insisted, that the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>and effect of the covenant for improving, was, not only that buildings should be erected on the premises, but that they should be erected <em>and kept up during the whole term. </em>Therefore, he contended, the whole insurance money should have been appropriated to the.erection of new buildings in lieu of those which had been destroyed by fire.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOE\"><em>Leigh </em>replied, that the covenant for improving, bound the lessee and his assigns to make improvements <em>once only; </em>for the improvements which the lessee covenanted to make, were to <em>be made </em>within <em>three </em>years from the date of <em>the </em>lease, and there was no stipulation that they should be <em>kept up. </em>The claim to have the insurance money appropriated to the erection of new buildings was wholly untenable. And unless that proposition could be established, he thought it would be impossible to give the borough a specific lien on the insurance money for any purpose. It could not be inferred from the covenant, that if the rents should remain in arrear for three years, the borough might sell the premises <em>with the improvements, </em>and the lessee and his assigns should make good the deficiency, together with the arrears of rents; the borough had not sold, or attempted to sell, the premises, and so the <em>casus foederis </em>had not occurred. As to that covenant, he also insisted, that, in just legal construction, its obligation on the assignees of the lease, was, that they should make good the arrears of rent accruing in their own time. So, too, as to the covenant in the mortgage to the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>it ought to be taken prospectively, that the bank should perform the covenants in the lease after the assignment of the term to it, as <em>JVPDowell </em>was bound to perform them before the assignment. In fine, he said, the borough, if it had any specific lien on the insurance money for any purpose, was only entitled, at the utmost, to have provision made out of it for the payment of the ground rents which should accrue during the residue of the term yet to come; and (having regard to the present state of the premises, which were now unsaleable and abandoned) he suggested, that this might <em>best be </em>accomplished, by considering <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>annual ground rents, as an annuity to the same amount, for as many years as yet remained unexpired of the term ; and decreeing to the borough, out of the insurance money, a sum equal to the present value of such an annuity.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b105-4\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Asq\">I do not concur in the opinion intimated at the bar, that the present state of the pleadings in this case, neither calls for, nor permits, a decision upon the rights of the parties before us in all their different relations. The <em>Farmers Bank </em>being the junior incumbrancer in point of time, and therefore <em>prima facie </em>inferior to the prior claimants, having filed its bill praying for the satisfaction of its demand out of the insurance fund, we cannot possibly decide upon its claim, without comparing the conflicting claims in the first place ; and if, as I apprehend, that bank must yield in point of right to the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>it then becomes all important to ascertain the validity and precise extent of the rights of the <em>Borough of Norfolk, </em>upon which will depend the amount that can be decreed to the <em>Farmers Bank </em>out of the fund in question. If the borough has rights in this matter; if those rights have priority; if they entitle it not only to back rents but to interest, and to a demand of the investment of a principal sum so as to secure an interest adequate to the payment of the rent during the residue of the term; then it would seem, indeed, very probable that the struggle of the <em>Farmers Bank </em>has been for nothing; for nothing will remain to be paid to it. Hence it becomes absolutely necessary to look at the demands and rights of the borough in every aspect, before we scatter the funds out of which the counsel have supposed that it has a title to be secured in the payment of the rents reserved on its lease. I shall therefore proceed first to examine the title of the borough to the funds in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The borough being the proprietor of lands at the <em>Town Point, </em>proceeded in 1792 to have it divided into lots, and to lease the lots for ninety-nine years, renewable forever, reserving a ground rent payable annually by the lessee and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>his assigns. The object on the part both of lessors and &gt; \u2022 \u00ab \u2022 lessees, was to build upon the property, since otherwise it would be useless to the latter, and to the former the payment of the rents would be precarious. Among other lessees was one <em>B\u00b0oze\u2019 </em>under whom <em>M\u2019Dowell, </em>the debtor of the banks, claimed to hold. By the lease to <em>Booze, </em>the borough reserved a certain rent on each of the lots leased to him : and <em>Booze, </em>for himself, his executors, administrators and assigns covenanted, 1. to pay the rent annually : 2. to pay the taxes: 3. to <em>improve </em>the land in the space of three years, in such manner as that the yearly rent should be thereby sufficiently <em>secured; </em>and 4. on failure thereof, at the expiration of three years, that he, his executors,- administrators and assigns, would tender bond with sufficient security for the further [future, probably] payment of the yearly ground rents and taxes, until improvements should be made sufficient to secure the same; or 5. if such security should not be given within three months from the expiration of the three years, the borough might lease out the premises again, for the best price to be had, and the lessee, his executors, administrators and assigns would make good the deficiency, or be entitled to the surplus if the new lease brought a higher rent: and 6. if the rent should be in arrear at any one time for more than three years, there was a like privilege to re-let, and a like obligation on the lessee, his executors, administrators and assigns, to make good the deficiency, together with the arrears of rent. Such were the terms of this lease, which <em>Booze </em>parted with, it seems, in 1796, and which <em>M\u2019Dowell </em>did not acquire until September 1815; from which time he became liable for the accruing rents. Previously, it seems, the covenant as to the erection of buildings had been complied with; but, if the account filed by the mayor of <em>JYorfoUc </em>be correct, there were, at that time, more than five years rent in arrear and unpaid; and, of course, two years before his purchase, it had been lawful for the borough to hav\u00e9 leased out the premises again to some other tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>This provision, however, had not the effect of avoiding the lease, <em>ipso facto, </em>without some act on the part of the lessor. The answer of the borough, in this regard, misinterprets the lease. A lease for years, indeed, may be avoided without entry, if it be so provided, though a lease for life cannot. But a prudent landlord will so provide, as to give him an option to avoid the lease or not; for if it be an advantageous lease, it may be better for him to waive the right to enter and be reinvested with his old estate. So, in this case ; the draftsman has secured the <em>power </em>to re-let; but it was a power which might be waived or not at the lessor\u2019s pleasure. That pleasure has never been exerted to defeat this lease, although it may at any moment be exerted. But it is obviously not their interest; for it seems the time has gone by when this property could be leased for a cent, with provisions like those of this lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><em>M. \u2019Dowell </em>having purchased the property, proceeded to insure it. He then, in 1817, executed a deed of trust of it to secure the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>and another in October 1818, to secure another debt to the <em>Farmers Bank. </em>In 1822, the houses were burned down; and about the same time ho died. The insurance company are ready to pay the insurance money; and four claimants are competitors for <em>it,\u2014M\u2019Dowell\u2019s </em>administrator (whose claim however is not urged), the <em>Borough of Norfolk, </em>the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>and the <em>Farmers Bank.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In the examination of the rights of the <em>Borough of Norfolk, </em>I shall take it for granted, for the present, that the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>though a mere mortgagee, is to be looked upon as an assignee of the term; for, however the general doctrine may be on the subject, if the bank takes the benefit of the lease, it must assume its burdens, to the same extent as if it was assignee of the term out and out. But as such, it is very manifest, that, unless there is something in the lease which varies its case from that of ordinary assignees, the bank is not chargeable with any breach which occurred anterior to its title. For an assignee is only liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>in respect of his possession ; he bears the burden while he enjoys the benefit, and no longer. In particular, the assignee cannot be liable for rent in arrear before his title accrued. Rents due and in arrear are considered as debts severed from the realty <em>sub modo. </em>Moreover, it is inconsistent with any principle of the law, that one man should bind any other than his heir or his executor; and they are only bound in respect to the assets passing to them. He cannot bind his assignee; but the assignee, by the acceptance of the estate, binds <em>himself </em>to fulfil the obligations of the contract devolving upon him during his occupation. By law he is bound for nothing more. In the present case, however, a doubt hangs over this question from the peculiarity of the covenants. The difficulty is to say, whether the breach has occurred, or may be made to occur, in the time of the bank or not. The breach in <em>non-payment </em>of the rents, certainly occurred even before <em>M\u2019Dowell\u2019s </em>time; for when he purchased in September 1815, there were five years rent in arrear. Now, I have much doubt, whether <em>M\u2019DoweU, </em>or those who come after him, could have been bound for the rents in arrear, or to. give security for deficiency in price, for rents to become due after their possession and\u2019-estate might have been passed away. <em>Booze </em>certainly and his estate are bound, that his assigns shall do what is provided; for he is bound for the performance of all his <em>express </em>covenants, during the continuance of the whole lease, notwithstanding the assignments; and this, although the lessor accepted the assignee as tenant: But after assignment and acceptance, he is not liable on covenants merely <em>implied by law. </em>2 Bac. Abr. Covenant. E. 4. p. 72. and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The next question under these covenants, is, Whether the covenant to improve is satisfied by the erection of the first buildings, or is a continuing covenant, binding the parties to renew the buildings from time to time, in case they should be destroyed by flood or fire ? The language of the covenant affords no ground for this latter construction. If an action for breach of the covenant were brought, the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>of covenants performed would be sustained, by proving that the party had once improved or built according to bis engagement. A different construction cannot be given to the lease in a court of equity. It is the misfortune of the landlord, indeed, that by the burning of the houses, the lot is reduced to its originally naked condition, and still more that the change of times has reduced its value to nothing. But the conflagration fell more heavily upon the tenant than upon the landlord, and if the holders are bound for prospective rents forever, upon three valueless lots, the change of times, which has desolated that part of the town, will prove ruinous to them. These are losses which the parties must be content to bear in proportion to their respective interests. The tenant must put up with the loss of his house, and the landlord with the loss of his rents. Neither can throw his share of the loss upon the shoulders of the other. It is said, that the houses were insured, and that the insurance money stands in the place of the buildings. And what is the <em>se~ quitur </em>? <em>Is </em>it that <em>the </em>rents are to he paid out of it, or that a court of equity may compel the rebuilding out of this fund, because of its supposed relation to or substitution for the buildings which have been destroyed ? I think not. Whatever the supposed relation may be between the houses and the insurance money, the landlord has no sort of equity in this case to demand its application to the payment of arrears, or to rebuilding the premises. The tenant was neither bound to rebuild, nor to insure. Had he been so bound, the case would have been otherwise. As it is, the insurance money is the price paid by the insurance society for the consideration of the premiums and quotas advanced by <em>M'Dowell </em>out of his own pocket. Upon what pretext could the borough claim the benefit of this covenant purchased by <em>M\u2019Dowell\u2019s </em>funds for his own benefit, if he was not <em>hound </em>to purchase it for their benefit? If they had bound him to insure, or had homo the charges of insurance in proportion to their interest, the case would have been widely different. As they did not, it would be iniquity in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>stead of equity, to take from him what has been acquired , , . \u00b6 <em>by </em>his own advances.</p>\n<p id=\"ABh\">If the case, then, stood solely upon the original lease, and there was nothing in the deed of trust to the bank, which cou^ enure to the benefit of the borough, I should be clearly of opinion that the borough had no rights whatever in relation to this fund. But that deed, I conceive, changes the whole aspect of the case, and would have rendered unnecessary an investigation of the questions I have been considering, but that the earnest discussion of them at the bar, forbad that they should be passed over in silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">What, then, were the rights and obligations of the <em>Bank of Virginia</em>? By the operation of the deed of trust, the bank became assignee of <em>M\u2019Dowell </em>of the <em>lease; </em>for it seems to be now settled, that when a party takes an assignment of lease by way of mortgage, the whole interest passes to him, and he becomes liable on the covenant for payment of rent, though he has never occupied or become possessed in fact: <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Jaques, </em>which had determined otherwise, is now considered as not rightly decided; <em>Williams v. Bosanquet, </em>1 Brod. &amp;s Bing. 238. This case is certainly in strict analogy to the doctrines of courts of law, which look upon a mortgage as the conveyance of the title, and not as a mere security for money. And as they also consider the mortgagor as tenant at will only of the mortgagee, the mortgagee must be the tenant for years, unless the estate for years is gone by the assignment, which cannot be. In this case, moreover, the <em>Bank of Virginia </em>is before the court, claiming the benefit of this lease, and demanding to be paid its debt out of funds to which it could have no title except as assignee of the lease; and if they take the benefit, they must be content to bear the burden. But this is not all. When <em>M\u2019Dowell </em>encumbered this property to the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>it was a valuable tenement. Its insurance amounted to 7000 dollars. <em>M\u2019Dowell </em>was aware, that by the terms of the lease under which he held, the <em>Borough of Norfolk </em>had a right, if the rent was three years in arrear, to re-let <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the tenement upon such terms as they could, and to hold _ . M . /*\u00edii . him responsible, moreover, lor the back rents accruing in his own time at least. He, therefore, expressly provides in the deed of trust for the rights of the borough. He assigns the <em>premises </em>to the trustees,\u2014they or their assigns <em>paying the ground rents and performing all the stipulations and covenants in the original deed of lease for the said land contained, and required to be done and performed on the part of the lessee. </em>Is this a covenant ? Then the trustees of the bank covenant, that they will perform all that the original lessee was bound to do and perform. Is it a condition ? Then they took the estate upon the <em>condition </em>that they should do and perform all that he was hound to do and perform. Is it a trust ? Then this deed enures to the <em>Borough of Norfolk, </em>as a security for the payment of the ground rents, and the performance of all the stipulations and covenants in the original lease, required to be done and performed on the part of the lessee. One of these is, that if the rent be behind for three years, the landlord may re-let ; and upon re-letting, the lessee <em>bound himself to pay up and make good the deficiency, together with the arrears of rents and taxes. </em>This obligation, then, rests upon the assignees here. The rent is now three years and more in arrear; and in the language of the books, having been due then, and there having been no tender, it lias been due and payable every day since; 6 Bac. Abr. 29. The borough may therefore now, at its pleasure enter and re-let. If it do so, it is obvious the property will bring nothing, and the assignees of the term, who have assumed to do and perform what the lessee had bound himself to do, will be bound to pay up and make good the deficiency, <em>together with the arrears of rent. </em>The arrears of rent, and the future payment of the rents stipulated, are thus secured by this deed of trust. The consciences of the trustees for the bank, are as much affected by this part of the undertaking, as by any other. Indeed, from the language of the deed, this is anterior to all others; for provision must be made for the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ment of past and future rents, before the bank can take any thing. This may be effected by decreeing the amount of the rents due, and that the <em>Bank of Virginia </em>be permitted to retain a capital sum equivalent to the production of an interest equal to the annual rents, or in some other way,\u2014 leaving this matter, however, to be arranged by the court of chancery, upon the principles I have laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">With respect to interest on the rents in arrear, thq. court is of opinion, that no interest whatever should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"AdE\">A few words are now necessary as to the rights of the <em>Bank of Virginia. </em>As assignees of the term, it would have been clearly entitled to the benefit of the policy of insurance, which is a covenant real, running with, and entered into for the purpose of upholding, the estate, even if there had been no provision on this subject in the insurance regulations. These however expressly provide for the case, and that the mortgagee shall be paid out of the insurance money. As against <em>M\u2019Dowell\u2019s </em>estate, therefore, there can be no difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">But it is contended for the <em>Farmers Bank, </em>that the lien of the deed of trust of the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>did not extend to any note renewed after the 1st March 1818. To this it might be a sufficient answer, that it indisputably extended to the note that was due and unpaid on the 1st of March 1818; and, to say the least, it is questionable, whether the new <em>credit </em>ought in equity to be considered as a discharge of the debt. Equity looks to the substance, not to the forms, of things. Equity sees that when a dealer at bank pays off a note by renewal, the debt is the same; the debt remains unpaid, and the credit only is extended. The <em>Farmers Bank, </em>conversant with such transactions, must also have known this. It had <em>full </em>notice of the deed of trust to the <em>Bank of Virginia, </em>and therefore stands, as to this question, precisely in the shoes of <em>M\u2019Dowell. </em>It knew the contents of the deed, and was bound to know the legal operation of it. If it did not know that the note was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>newed, then as the debt was not paid, it knew there was a lien for its amount. Had it inquired, it would have learned, indeed, that there were subsequent renewals; but it would have found also that the debt was not paid; and it was hound to know the legal inference from that fact. It was bound to know, that until it was paid, <em>M\u2019Dowell </em>could not be received to say that the additional indulgence granted by the bank, discharged the lien. Upon what equity could he have demanded a reconveyance of the legal title, before the payment of the debt, which it was conveyed to secure? Upon none. The property would have been bound in his hands, and it is equally bound in the hands of the subsequent incumbrancer, with full notice of the prior lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">In this opinion of the president, the other judges concurred. And the decree of the court was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-11\">\u201c The court is of opinion, that by the deed of trust executed <em>by II. M\u2019Dowell </em>deceased to the trustees of the <em>Hank of Virginia, </em>that bank became entitled to the benefit of the insurance fund, subject nevertheless to the obligation of discharging the arrears of rent on the leasehold premises, and to the further obligation of paying and discharging all future rents which may accrue during the continuance of the lease; that the rents in arrear should, therefore, not only have been decreed to be paid by the said bank, but provision should have been made for securing the payment of future rents; that this should have been effected, either by decreeing, that the said bank should retain, or should invest, so much of the said fund as would be equivalent to the production of an interest equal to the annual rents, or in such other way as might be deemed most convenient and advisable; and that the decree is, therefore, erroneous in having made no such provision: that, under the circumstances of this case, no interest whatever ought to have been allowed upon the rents in arrear; and that the decree is accordingly erroneous in allowing such interest: that the insurance fund ought to be applied, 1. to the satisfaction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the rents in arrear and unpaid on the leasehold premises; 2. to making a provision for future rents; 3. to the satisfaction of the debt secured by the deed of trust to the <em>Bank of Virginia; </em>4. to the <em>satisfaction of the debt </em>secured by the deed of trust to the <em>Farmers Bank; </em>and the residue, if any, ought to be paid over to the administrator of <em>M\u2019Dowell. </em>Therefore, it is decreed &amp;,c. that the said decree be reversed and annulled, and that the appellants pay to the appellees, as the parties substantially prevailing, their costs &amp;c. and that the cause'be remanded &amp;c.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
