A party may go in-' &lt;\u00a1to a Court of Chancery as a matter of right, and may ask an injunction, as a favour, from the Court. But after the injunction is dissolved, he has still a right to reply to the answer of the defendant, and continue his cause as an original suit, for a hearing in chief.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The whole Court (consisting of Judges Fleming, Roane and Tucker) were clearly of opinion, that the vomplainant had a right to continue his cause, as an original suit, after the dissolution of the injunction ; and directed a decree to the following effect to be entered: \u201c That there \u201c was no error in so much of the decree as dissolved the \u201c injunction ; but that the Court erred in dismissing the \u201c bill, which should have been retained for further pro- \u201c ceedings, with leave to the parties to take depositions^\u20195, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
