By reason whereof &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVB\"><em>Montgomery </em>pleaded, <em>1. the general issue, </em>and 2. the <em>statute of limitations. </em>To the second plea, <em>M\u2019Alexander </em>replied, that, at the time his cause of action accrued, <em>Montgomery </em>was out of <em>Virginia, </em>and in <em>Kentucky, </em>and so continued out of <em>Virginia </em>from the time when the action accrued, till the year 1815, within five years before the commencement of the action. <em>Montgomery </em>put in a rejoinder to this replication,\u2014that he was, at the time the cause of action accrued, and long before had been, a resident of <em>Kentucky, </em>which was then a part of <em>Virginia, </em>and had always thenceforth continued to reside in <em>Kentucky, </em>where the contract in the declaration set forth, was, by agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>between the parties, to have been executed, until the year 1815, when he came to <em>Virginia </em>on a visit; and that there were, at the time the action accrued, and thenceforth until the year 1792, courts of justice in <em>Kentucky </em>established by authority of <em>Virginia, </em>and courts of justice there since 1792, established by authority of <em>Kentucky </em>and of the <em>U. States, </em>of competent jurisdiction, at all times, to hear and determine the claim alleged in the declaration. Then, there was a sur-rejoinder,\u2014that, at the time when the action accrued, that part of the territory of <em>Virginia </em>in which <em>Montgomery </em>then resided, namely, the district of <em>Kentucky, </em>had been erected into a separate state, and was nowise subject to the jurisdiction of <em>Virginia, </em>and so <em>Montgomery </em>was, at the time the action accrued, out of the state of Virginia, namely, in the state of <em>Kentucky, </em>and thenceforth continually kept himself in <em>Kentucky, </em>out of the limits and jurisdiction of <em>Virginia, </em>so that the action could not be brought against him, until the year 1815 within five years next before the action was commenced. And a general rebutter being put in to the sur-rejoinder, an issue was thereupon made up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-4\">Upon the first trial of the issues, the jury found a verdict for <em>M\u2019Alexander </em>for 1584 dollars damages. But the court, on the motion of <em>Montgomery\u2019s </em>counsel, set aside the verdict, on the ground that it was contrary to evidence, and directed a new trial; and <em>M\u2019Alexander </em>filed a bill of exceptions to this opinion of the court, detailing at large all the evidence which had been given at the trial. The evidence set forth in this bill of exceptions, was the same with that set forth in the demurrer to the evidence, which <em>Montgomery </em>filed upon the second trial, and in which the court compelled <em>M\u2019Alexander </em>to join.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">Without detailing the evidence set forth in the demurrer to evidence filed upon the second trial, of which there was a good deal, and that very vague and very confused, it is sufficient to state, that it appeared\u20141st. That the treasury land warrant for 4612 acres of laud, was delivered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>M\u2019Alexander </em>to <em>Montgomery, </em>and the contract between . , them in relation thereto was made, in August 1782.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFm\">2ndly. That the evidence of the contract, and of its terms, consisted, 1. Of a bond executed by <em>M\u2019Alexander </em>to <em>Montgomery, </em>dated the 3rd August 1782, in the penalty of \u00a32000. with a condition in these words\u2014\u201c The condition of this obligation is such, that whereas the above bound <em>A. M\u2019Alexander </em>hath given <em>W. Montgomery, </em>treasury land warrants amounting to five thousand seven hundred and some odd acres, <em>to be located, </em>on the western <em>waters; </em>now, if the said <em>M\u2019Alexander, </em>his heirs &amp;c. make or cause to be made unto <em>W. Montgomery </em>a good and sufficient right in fee simple to the one half of all the lands he <em>locates </em>for him, and pay all costs for <em>surveying, </em>then this obligation to be void <em>he.\u201d 2. </em>A receipt for a land warrant given by <em>Montgomery </em>to <em>M\u2019Alexander, </em>in these words\u2014&lt;\u00a3 August 4th 1782, Received of <em>A. M\u2019Alexander </em>one land warrant containing 4612 acres of land, likewise two silver dollars; by me, <em>W. Montgomery.\u201d 3. </em>The evidence of a witness, proving that <em>Montgomery informed </em>the witness, that he had been employed by <em>M\u2019Alexander </em>to <em>locate </em>some land for him in <em>Kentucky, </em>and had located part thereof, but that owing to bis want of knowledge of a sufficient quantity of vacant lands, he had been induced to employ the witness\u2019s father to <em>locate </em>a part of the lands, agreeing that be should make the locations on the same terms, on which he, <em>Montgomery, </em>was to have made them; and he stated <em>the terms of the location to be one half of the land, M\u2019Alexander defraying all expenses incident to surveying and </em>patenting.\u201d\u2014And 4. proof that <em>Montgomery, </em>acting under the contract did locate, and cause to be surveyed <em>and patented </em>for <em>M\u2019Alexander, </em>about 1300 acres of land, which was afterwards equally divided between them ; and <em>Montgomery </em>charged <em>M\u2019Alexander </em>with th\u00e9 expenses of locating, <em>surveying and patenting, </em>this land, and of making the division thereof between them, and <em>M\u2019Alexander </em>paid him the amount of those expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>3rdly. There was evidence, that there were waste and unappropriated lands in <em>Kentucky, </em>in 1782, subject to location under the land warrant, on which the quantity mentioned in the warrant might have been located; and that, besides the 1300 acres which <em>Montgomery </em>located, and had surveyed and patented, as above mentioned, he made an entry for 3312 acres on <em>Green </em>river, of which however only 1728 acres could be surveyed, because there was no more vacant land there, subject to be surveyed under the entry; and of the 1728 acres, which were surveyed, the greater part was included in prior and conflicting entries and surveys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-4\">4thly. There was evidence, that though <em>M\u2019Alexander </em>paid <em>Montgomery </em>the expenses of <em>locating, surveying and patenting, </em>the 1300 acres above mentioned, after the same had been patented, yet he refused to advance money for defraying the expenses of <em>surveys; </em>saying, that though he was bound to defray such expenses <em>after </em>the surveys and patents were completed, yet he was not bound to advance money for the purpose <em>before </em>he got the title for the lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\">5thly. There was evidence, that after January 1783, there were not to be found in <em>Kentucky, </em>any large quantities of good lands lying in one body, subject to location under the warrant; and that though a <em>Kentucky </em>surveyor located 10,000 acres of land after November 1783, yet it was of such inferiour quality, that he sold parcels thereof for two dollars per hundred acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">And 6thly. There was evidence, that <em>Montgomery </em>resided in <em>Kentucky </em>at the date of the contract, in August 1782, and there continued until the year 1815, when he came to <em>Virginia </em>on a visit to his friends; and during his stay here, this action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">The jury, upon the second trial, found a verdict for the plaintiff <em>M'Alexander, </em>for 1584 dollars damages, subject to the opinion of the court upon the demurrer to evidence. But the court held, that the law upon the demurrer, was for the defendant <em>Montgomery, </em>and gave judgement for him; from which <em>M\u2019Alexander </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AX2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>Johnson </em>for the <em>appellant;</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A03B\">no counsel for the appellee.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ac\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aa7\">The declaration sets out a contract on the part of <em>Montgomery, </em>to <em>locate </em>a <em>1 </em>and warrant on waste and unappropriated lands, and have the same surveyed <em>and patented; </em>and one of the breaches assigned is, that after located, he failed to have the lands surveyed <em>and patented. </em>The jury has found a verdict for 1584 dollars upon this declaration,' and, for aught we know, for the breach of failing to <em>patent </em>what may have been <em>located and surveyed; </em>which renders the <em>paten ting </em>a most essential ingredient in the case, even if we could disregard the general principle, that in an action upon a special contract, the contract must be proved as laid.</p>\n<p id=\"A-I\">To the declaration, the general issue and the statute of limitations were pleaded ; and upon the last plea, the parties came to issue, at last, upon this question,\u2014Whether at the time the action accrued, the district-of <em>Kentucky </em>had been erected into an independent and separate state, no wise subject to the jurisdiction of any court of <em>Virginia </em>? <em>Upon </em>these issues, I am clearly of opinion, that the verdict in the first trial, and the judgement on the demurrer to evidence in the last, should have been given for the defendant, <em>Montgomery. </em>The contract proved did not bind him to have the land <em>patented, </em>as well as located and surveyed; nor is there evidence from which any such term in the contract could fairly have been inferred. The statement which he made to one of the witnessess, of the terms of the contract,\u2014 that he was to have one half of the land, and <em>M'Alexander </em>to defray all the expenses incident to surveying <em>and patenting, </em>refers to the <em>terms of his compensation, </em>which was to be one half, without any charges to him <em>for </em>surveying or patenting. For, in speaking of what he had been <em>employed to do, </em>he says nothing of <em>patenting, </em>but only that he was to <em>locate. </em>I think, therefore, on this point, the judgement was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>On the second issue, I think there can be no question, that the judgement should have been given for <em>Montgomery. </em>He received the warrant in 1782. The whole current of testimony goes to shew that if there was any negligence,\u2014 any breach of the contract, it must have occurred long before the year 1789, when the first act was passed for the erection of <em>Kentucky </em>into a state; and it was not until after November 1791, that the jurisdiction of the courts of <em>Virginia </em>was determined. It was not necessary, that the breach should have been five years anterior to the separation: one day before would have sufficed, for then the statute would have commenced running. Now, if the defendant be chargeable on the ground of negligence, I think it cannot be denied, that he was as guilty at the expiration of nine years from the date of the contract, as at this moment. That would have brought the breach down to August 1791; and from that date the statute would have been a bar. Indeed, if there was a cause of action, it probably accrued as early as 1784. One witness deposed, that good lands, in large quantities, in one place, could not have been procured after January 1783. Another, who was a <em>Kentucky </em>surveyor, after November 1783, made an entry for 10,000 acres, but of such inferiour quality, that he sold part of it for only two dollars per <em>hundred </em>acres. Afterwards, it seems probable, more could not be obtained. Now, the statute runs from the time the negligence occurred; as, in the case of an attorney, it is not the loss of the debt which gives the action, but the unskilfulness or negligence whereby it was ultimately lost, and the statute runs from the date of that negligence; <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Plummer\u2019s ex\u2019ors, 4 </em>Peters 172. <em>Short v. M\u2019Carthy, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Ald. 626. 5 Eng. C. L. R. 403. <em>Howell v. Young, </em>5 Barn, Cres. 259. 11 Eng. C. L. R. 219. The application of the statute, in the present instance, can be no subject of regret. The transaction is very <em>stale; </em>and the evidence in support of the action, very vague and inconclusive. The question how far a party is to be required, <em>relictis omnibus negotiis, </em>to proceed to the fulfilment of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>of these contracts, is not very easily answered ; and the presumption that the locator, who had an equal interest, and no expenses to incur, would not grossly neglect the concern, is very strong. Add to this, that <em>Montgomery </em>did not abscond from oul\u2019 jurisdiction, but was cut off from it by an act of sovereignty, and that <em>M\u2019Alexander </em>might, at any time within the last forty years, have asserted his claim in <em>Kentucky, </em>where the question of due diligence would have been settled by a <em>Kentucky jury, </em>surrounded by a cloud of <em>Kentucky </em>witnesses, who best knew what in those times did, and what did not, amount to due diligence in such cases. We have little reason to fear, that the rigorous principles of law will work injustice between the parties in this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The judgement is to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
