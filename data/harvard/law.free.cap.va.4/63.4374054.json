Baldwin </em>made the purchase in his own name; and took from <em>Fiar\u00edan </em>a bond with condition to make a title to the land when the purchase money was paid. On his return, it seems that he delivered this kond to <em>Hill, </em>who immediately took possession of the land, and lived upon it for a number of years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\"><em>John Hill, </em>the brother of <em>William, </em>owned a tract of land adjoining that purchased of <em>Harlan; </em>and whilst the brothers were the respective owners of these tracts of land, they agreed upon and marked a line which should divide their respective tracts; which line gave, and was intended to give to <em>John </em>about twelve acres of <em>William's </em>land. At the time this line was marked the land cut off from <em>William's </em>tract was in woods, and of little value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">Soon after this line was fixed <em>John Hill </em>sold or exchanged his land with <em>John B. Mitchell, </em>who immediately proceeded to improve it, and built upon this twelve acres. <em>Mitchell </em>afterwards sold to <em>James Stafford, </em>who made farther improvements. These improvements were made with the full knowledge of <em>William Hill </em>and the purchasers from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\"><em>William Hill, </em>not having paid all the purchase money for his land, owing as it would seem to the death of <em>Harlan, </em>and therefore not having gotten a conveyance for it, about the year 1831 sold it to <em>M' Camant </em>and <em>Cook; </em>and <em>Harlan's </em>title bond was assigned to them by <em>Baldwin. </em>They sold it in 1837 to <em>Jackson Carter. </em>At the time of the sale by <em>William Hill </em>to <em>M'Camant </em>and <em>Cook, </em>and by them to <em>Carter, Mitchell </em>or <em>Stafford </em>was in possession of the aforesaid twelve acres of <em>land; </em>and both purchases were made with reference to the line fixed by <em>William </em>and <em>John Hill; </em>and apparently without any knowledge that the twelve acres in controversy was included within <em>Harlan's </em>patent, or covered by his title bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-8\"><em>Jackson Carter, </em>having discovered that the twelve acres of land aforesaid were embraced in <em>Harlan's </em>pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tent, brought a writ of right in the name of <em>Harlan\u2019s </em>heirs against <em>Stafford </em>for the recovery thereof; and in 184.1 that cause was decided in favour of the demandants ; whereupon, <em>Stafford </em>brought this suit to enjoin that judgment. The injunction was granted ; but was afterwards dissolved. Upon an appeal from that decree it was reversed by this Court, on the ground that the cause was not ready for a hearing; the injunction was therefore reinstated, and the cause remanded for farther proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-3\">In September 1844 the cause came on again to be heard, when the Court dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill. And from this decree <em>Stafford </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-4\">The other facts in the record bearing upon the decision of this Court will be found stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-9\"><em>J.

and that <em>Seabert Cochran, </em>who had asserted a claim <em>to the </em>land in controversy under a recent purchase and conveyance thereof from the heirs of said <em>Harlan, </em>has abandoned the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">And it farther appears to the Court that while the said <em>William Hill </em>held and occupied the said tract of land, under his purchase aforesaid, made through the agency of said <em>Baldwin, </em>he the said <em>William Hill </em>and his brother <em>John Hill, </em>who owned a tract of land thereto adjoining, ran and marked a line which they then verbally agreed should be the dividing line between them, the effect of which was, and the parties so intended, to cut off a small portion, said to contain twelve acres, from the said tract of the said <em>William Hill, </em>and throw the same into the said tract of the said <em>John Hill: </em>that afterwards the said <em>John Hill </em>sold his said tract to <em>John Mitchell, </em>who subsequently sold a part thereof to the appellant: which sales, from the said <em>John Hill </em>to the said <em>John Mitchell, </em>and <em>from </em>the latter to the appellant, were according to the said division line, and embraced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>(he small portion said to contain twelve acres so acquired from the said <em>William Hill: </em>that the said <em>John Hill </em>and those claiming under him as aforesaid, have held respectively, the actual possession thereof, and claimed according to the said division line, and the said <em>John Mitchell </em>and the appellant respectively, have made valuable improvements upon the small portion aforesaid : and that by a decree of the County Court of <em>Grayson </em>obtained by the said <em>John Mitchell </em>against the heirs at law of the said <em>John </em>Hill, who had died, a conveyance by a commissioner was directed to be made, on the part of said heirs, to the appellant, for the land purchased by him as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">And it farther appears to the Court that the said <em>William Hill </em>resided on the tract of land acquired and sold by him as aforesaid, and had knowledge of the progress of the improvements made by the said <em>John Mitchell </em>and the appellant respectively, upon the aforesaid small portion, said to contain twelve acres, now in controversy, without asserting any claim on his part; and that the said <em>M' Camant </em>and <em>GooJc, </em>and the said <em>Jackson </em>Carter, at the time of their respective purchases, had notice of the existence of the division line aforesaid, and believed the same to be the true boundary of the land so purchased by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that the appellant has shewn a good right, under the circumstances of his case, to relief in a Court of Equity; and that the said Circuit Court erred in dissolving the injunction which had been granted the appellant to the judgment at law recovered against him in the names of the heirs at law of said Harlan, and in dismissing his bill; instead of quieting him in his possession and enjoyment of the land in controversy, and causing a proper conveyance to be made to him of the legal title thereto, upon his paying a due proportion of the purchase money due to the estate of said Harlan, to be ascertained by the relative' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>value which the land in controversy bore to the rest of the land acquired by the said <em>William Hill </em>from the said Harlan, at the time of his purchase thereof through the agency of said <em>Baldwin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">It is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the said decree of the said Circuit Court be reversed and annulled, with costs to the appellant against the appellees <em>M\u2019Camant, Cook </em>and <em>Carter, </em>and that the appellant\u2019s injunction be reinstated, and the cause remanded to the said Circuit Court to be there farther proceeded in according to the principles of this decree, with instructions to cause any additional parties to be made that may be deemed necessary for that purpose.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
