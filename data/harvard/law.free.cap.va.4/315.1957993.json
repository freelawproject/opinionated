T. . . . r. re, within the terms of the policy, if us experience having evinced that the losses happening in the country bore no proportion to those in towns, the legislature, on the 29th of <em>'January, </em>1805, at the instance of a majority of the members of the society either personally present or represented by members of the General Assembly, (as authorized by an act of the 23d of <em>January, </em>1800,) passed another act, <em>separating the interests and risks of the inhabitants of the </em>country, <em>from those of the </em>towns, so that the countryman was no longer liable for losses by fire occurring in towns, nor the townsman for losses occurring in the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aub\">Under the original act of incorporation, the society were authorized to adopt rules and regulations for their government, which they were at liberty, from time to time, to alter and amend.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In pursuance of those powers, a regulation was adopted, by which the business of the society was to he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>managed by a president and fourteen directors <em>; </em>but by the act of 1805, above mentioned,(\u00a7 9.) it is declared, that there \u201c shall be in future only three directors, <em>outofxvhom </em>a presi- \u201c dent shall be chosen <em>provided </em>that the society should not be prevented from \u201c appointing more than three di<em>u </em>rectorSj if any general meeting it should be adjudged M that a greater number were necessary for the well order- \u201c ing of their affairs.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Shortly after the passage of this law, and long before the requisition in question was made, <em>Alexander M'-Rae </em>was elected president of the board of directors, and three other persons, on the same day, were appointed directors. It does not appear that the president had been previously chosen one of the directors, <em>out of xvhom </em>he was to be taken ; but he was certainly appointed by the same <em>electoral </em>body by whom the directors were chosen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">After the election of the president and directors, a requisition, signed by the president, was made, calling on the <em>town </em>members for half a quota, but not on the <em>country </em>members. <em>Currie </em>resisted the payment of this quota on two grounds; 1st. Because the requisition on which it was founded, was not made under the <em>original </em>charter, but under a <em>subsequent </em>act, which attempted to increase his risk without his consent; and, 2dly, Whether that subsequent act be, or be not, obligatory on him, the president of the board of directors was not chosen <em>out of </em>the directors, according to the act under which he was appointed; and, consequently, there could be no legal call of a quota. The District Court gave judgment for the <em>Mutual Assurance </em>Society, and <em>Currie </em>appealed to this Court; but, pending the appeal, be having died, it was revived in the name of his administrators.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-7\"><em>George K.

Com. </em>44. to shew the definition of law.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-4\">A charter is not a law, but a compact between the sovereign authority of the state, and a citizen. In <em>England </em>though the parliament enacts every <em>law; </em>yet it grants no <em>charters. </em>These are granted by the king, who cannot at his mere pleasure revoke them ; but they remain unalterable as fate, unless the corporation do some act, or are guilty of some omission which, according to established rules and principles of .law, produces a forfeiture. And then it is not competent for the <em>king </em>(one of the contracting parties) to determine the question, but belongs exclusively to the tribunals selected tc decide all other controversies respecting contracts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-6\">If it be insisted that the legislature, in this case, did not alter the contract, <em>against, </em>but <em>tvith </em>the consent of the other party; it may be answered, that the proxies who voted for this change, were delegated to give effect to the charier <em>as if was ; </em>and that a power to <em>support </em>is not a power to <em>destroy.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-7\">No notice of the contemplated change was given io the <em>minority; </em>and, even if it had, the act of the majority could not bind any dissentient, in relation to a change in the constitution. The members of the society composed one corporate body for the performance of acts within the limits of the charter ; but beyond those limits there could be no corporate act. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARx\">It is a universal principle in the law of insurance, that to change the nature of the risk after the policy is effected, unless with the consent of the insurers, is to determine the contract. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-11\">The terms of the original charter, which authorized the society to <em>u </em>conclude upon such rules and regulations as they \u201c might judge necessary,\u201d and \u201c to alter and amend such u rules,\u201d did not give them authority to change the constitution itself. They only related to fixing the amount of the quotas, and to the general conduct of the societv.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Though this judgment was founded on a call for a quota, which the society might always rightfully make, yet the call: is not on the <em>whole </em>society according to the original charter, but on a <em>part </em>on!)',</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-9\">The act of 1&lt;'94 being a contract between the 3tate and the original adventurers, the obligation of such contract cannot foe impaired by the state without a violation of the constitution of the <em>United </em>States. The obligation <em>is </em>impaired, when the legislature say that repartition shall be made among a part, and not the <em>whole </em>of the members, as was prescribed by one of the fundamental rules of the original charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-10\">2. There was no legal president, or board of directors; consequently there could be r.o legal call of a quota.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-11\">By the terms of the act of January, 1805, there were to be \u201c three directors, <em>out of whom </em>the president shall be \u201c chosen.\u201d It was indispensably necessary, therefore, that the president, at the time of his election, should have been one of the directors. This not being the case with Mr. M'-Rae, his election vras void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-12\">The appointment of directors was but one step towards'' constituting a legal boardfor, until that was over, it was uncertain who would be president, or who directors. During the interval between the choice of directors, and that of president, they are incapable of action ; for they could not by their own energies mature their character; but it depended upon the agency of the society to perfect it, by the appointment of a president. The appointment of a president was a <em>sine qua non or </em>indispensable requisite to complete their character, and give them capacity to act; and, until that was done, every attempt to form a board or do any corporate act was a usurpation, and the proceeding void, it is like the case of a lease made by a person appointed bishop of a diocese,-who was never ordair.cd or consecrated. For want <em>of </em>this' ceremony, he is no \u2018bishop at all, and the lease void, though confirmed by the dean and chapter.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-13\">A corporation, during the vacancy ds its head, can do nr? act but appoint one. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The directors were not officers <em>de </em>facto, whose acts in certain cases may be valid; but were <em>usurpers.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-4\">An officer <em>defacto </em>is confined to <em>ministerial ax judicial acts, </em>Sacre matters of office, which he is compellable to perform ; or in which a stranger is concerned, and had a right to, or paid a consideration for. He cannot exercise his will, or do any <em>legislative </em>act. The acts which an officer <em>de facto </em>may do, must be such as are absolutely necessary for the preser* <em>wat ion of </em>the society; such as are expedient to prevent its final dissolution : and not such as contribute to its convenience enly.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-5\">The necessity of the call, in this case, is not proved. It was therefore an abuse of power to make it, which the Court will not enforce. Nor was it necessary for the <em>preservation </em>cf the society; for that might have existed without it, till the next annua! meeting.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-12\">Mr. <em>jWay, </em>who began the reply <em>to </em>the argument of the appellants\u2019 counsel,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2R\">remarked, that the record presented two questions, both of which he conceived might be answered 3p. the negative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-13\">The first question, said he, is this : \u201c Did the failure of the society to make Mr. IdlRae, by a formal election, a direc\u00bb \u201c tor, before they elected him president, invalidate the re- \u2018\u2018 quisition for a half quota, made on the 25th <em>February., </em>\u2022' 1805.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-14\">The second is: \u201cWasthe requisition which was made on \u201c the owners of town property only, void <em>on that account</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMW\">The solution of the first question, he said, depends on die-act of 29th January, 1805. This act declares, \u201c that in fit- \u201c ture there shall be only three directors <em>out </em>of whom <em>z. a </em>president shall be chosen.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-15\">I admit that Mr. M'Rae, was chosen president without the <em>formality </em>of being previously chosen a director. On the. part of the appellant it is conceded, that in every other respect the election was regular and legal, but it is contended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>that, as Mr. <em>M'-Rae </em>was not first chosen director, and then president, the election was substantially defective.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALj\">The difference between the course actually pursued and. # . that presented by the letter of the law, is a difference in form only. If this position is correct, the inference that the election was valid, it is presumed, will not be controverted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-8\">Before we proceed to establish this position, it is proper to explain what is meant by the terms, \u201c an election substan- \u201c tially defective,\u201d and \u201c an election defective in form only.55</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-9\">If the law had required that a director should be a citizen, or one of the insured, and the society had elected an alien, or one not insured, the election would have been substantially defective, because the act of making an alien or <em>a </em>stranger to the institution a director, would not have made the former a citizen, nor have made the latter a party insured. But where the law, as in this case prescribes, that \u201c a president \u201c shall be chosen out of three directors,\u201d the act of choosing a president makes the man <em>chosen </em>a director, and gives the qualification required.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-10\">To illustrate this idea, let ns suppose that the law had been <em>literally </em>obeyed. 1\u2019here would have been then four elections; three of directors, and a fourth of a president chosen \u201c <em>ouf\u2019 </em>of the directors. But, according to the course pursued, there were three elections only; one of a president, <em>eo </em>nomine, and then two of directors. It is obvious that the result is precisely the same. The <em>effect </em>contemplated by the law is attained. A president and two directors are appointed. This is precisely what was intended. The society did th\u00e9 act prescribed. They went to the place, indicated by the law, and erred, if they did err, only in taking a shorter road than that which appeared to have been marked outfor them. The defect, then, if there be one, is in the manner, in the form of the proceeding, and not in the result of that proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anp3\">Would it not be preposterous, Mr. <em>Hay </em>asked, to suspend orto embarrass the proceedings of an institution so important to the community, because the society, in occupying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>.\u00bfsound allotted to them by law, had advanced <em>to </em>it, by trlattg shree steps instead of four.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-3\">The law says, u there shall be three directors, out of 41 whom a president shall be chosen.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-4\">It is obvious that the president was to be a director <em>; </em>and it is equally clear, that the president was to he the principal director, and nothing more.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-5\">Now let us suppose that the law had said, \u201c three direr-41 tors, out of whom a principal director shall be chosen would not the appointment of a principal d'uector, and then 'of two other directors, have been a rational and substantial-compliance with this requisition ? If it would, the election in the present case is good; for, whether the head of the institution is called president, or principal director, must be regarded as a circumstance totally immaterial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-6\">In the performance even of covenants, the law regards substance only. If <em>A. </em>binds himself by an obligation to <em>B. </em>to execute a deed for conveying an estate in laud to him, for such uses as he should indicate, by writing under seal; /?. by such writing, declares that the conveyance shall be made to him, to the use of <em>C. </em>in fee-simple, and <em>A. </em>instead of conveying to <em>B. </em>to the use of <em>C. </em>conveys to <em>C. </em>immediately, atul in the first instance, the contract would be even at law substantially performed. The reason is obvious. The thing required to be done would have been done. If the conveyance had been made to <em>B. </em>to the use of <em>C. </em>the statute would have executed the use, and <em>C. </em>would have been seised in <em>fee. .A. </em>therefore in conveying to <em>C. </em>directly, performed the act really intended by the contract, and the only difference is, that the estate passed from <em>A. </em>to <em>C. </em>in a straight line, and did not pass circuitously through <em>B.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-7\">But even if I am wrong in my construction of the act of 39th January, 1805, the resolution adopted by the society, on the very next day, is sufficient to justify this election, even in the opinion of the most zealous advocate for form. This resolution declares, that \u201c there shall be three direc- \u201c tors and a president.\u201d The words in the law, directing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>t'16 appointment of a president, \u201c out of three directors,,,J are not inserted. If the question then depends on the reso^ut*on\u2019 ground of the objection here examined is placed entirely out of view.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2g\">But it may be objected, that though the general meeting might, under the 24th section of the act of 1805, increase the .number of directors, they were still bound to elect a president <em>out </em>of the directors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADx6\">. This objection is easily repelled. Sy the original law of incorporation, (of December, 1794-,) the society were not directed to appoint either a president or directors. They were empowered to appoint as many agents as they thought the business of the institution required, and to name them as they pleased. The power thus given they exercised. They -first appointed fifteen agents, calling one of them president, and the other fourteen directors, and after some time, authorized the president and four directors to constitute a board for conducting the business of the society.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfV\">The resolution of the 30th <em>January, </em>1805, is manifestly in conformity to the law of 1794, and the practice under it 5 and the election of <em>31\u2018Rae, </em>is in conformity to that resolution. The election therefore is good, unless the law of <em>December $ </em>1794, is <em>quoad hoc </em>repealed byr the act of the 29th January-1805.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-Nl\">' But the appellants themselves say, that the law of 179-1 was not repealed ; they contend, that it <em>could not be </em>repealed. It is not, sayr they, a law, but a contract, and therefore beyond the reach of legislative control. If, then, the law of \u00cd794 is not repealed,, and the election is made in conformity to one of its provisions, this part of the subject is disposed of. But I will not avail myself of this argument intended by the appellants\u2019 counsel for a very different topic, and I will shew that the act of 1794 <em>was not </em>repealed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-14\">By this act, the power of appointing officers, and of regulating elections, is given to the society. The 24th section of the act of 1805, shews that this power was not meant to be taken away. A president and two directors, it is true, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>mentioned, and their appointment is prescribed; hut it is expressly declared that nothing therein contained, shall be construed so as to prevent the society from lucre usurp; the 1 number of directors, whenever they might think it expedient <em>to </em>do so. /The fair inference seems to be, that the legislature wished only to make an cir.pevimei.it with three agents or managers, leaving it however in the power of the society to act as heretofore, if the experiment did not answer the design.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-10\">The argument is rendered more forcible by this fact, which, though not stated in the record, may be relied on, because iris authenticated bv the history of the <em>Mutual Assurance Society, </em>as it is exhibited in our laws. The law was p'-ssed on the 99th <em>January., </em>1805. On the next day the resolution tras adopted. Bv whora^ ? the <em>very men, </em>who had on the preceding div passed the law. This in the fact to which. I al\u00ednde. The members of the General Assembly are, <em>ex officio, </em>the representatives of the unrepresented subscribers, in their <em>n </em>speed ve Counties. - When, therefore, on the 30th January, 1805, they passed a resolution, in exact conformity to the constitution, as exhibited in the <em>bxr o\u00ed December, </em>1794, it is hardly to be supposed that they considered this, very law as repealed by the act of the preceding fury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-12\">This contemporaneous exposition has been always highly regarded in \u2018his country. A very striking instance is \u00edurniched by the construction put on the Hth section of our r\u00edate constitution ; a construction to which it is manifest the words of that section reluctantly submit, but to which they have been forced to yield, because it ivas fixed upon them bv the persons who had-framed the constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-13\">The 14th section alluded to, says, that \u201c the two hoifses of \u201c Assembly shall, by joint ballot appoint Judges of the Su\u00bb \u201c preme Court of Appeals, and General Court, Judges in *-\u00a3 Chancery, Judges of Admiralty, Secretary, and die Attor<em>'-l </em>ney-General, to be commissioned by the Governor, and \u00a3' continue in office during good behaviour. In case of *v death, incapacity, or resignation,, the. Governor, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>u advice of the Privy Council, shall appoint persons to sue ? \u201c ceed in office, to be approved or displaced by both houses.\u2019'</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0P\">The first sentence of the paragraph provides for the immediate appointment of the judges. The old government being dissolved, there was of course an end to the judiciary-establishment , which formed a part of it. The next sentence of the section provides, that in case of death, incapacity, or resignation, the Governor, with the advice of Council, shall appoint persons to succeed in office, to be approved or <em>displaced </em>by both houses. The plain meaning of this sentence unquestionably is, that although\u2019the first appointments, from the pressure of the times, were made by the Assembly, vacancies were to be filled by the Governor, with the advice of the Council, by the appointment of persons who were to be approved or displaced by the. Assembly, The power of approving or rejecting persons appointed by the executive is the only power given to the Assembly ; yet the uniform practice of the legislature, unquestioned by the executive, has, been to disregard the appointments made by the executive, and to appoint, whenever they thought proper, persons nominated by themselves alone, without giving any vote for displacing the officer appointed by the executive, or waiting for an}- farther or other appointment by that body. This, I conceive, to be an erroneous exposition of the constitution ; but it was adopted by those who made the constitution itself, and may now be regarded as completely ingrafted in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-5\">There is a principle, or rather rule laid down in the <em>British </em>adjudications, on the subject of corporation elections, which merits the attention of the Court. It is said that the acceptance of a new charter does not abolish the right of election under the first. (See 26 Vhz.344. <em>Burr. </em>1656. 1661.) If this position be law, its application to the present case is obvious,'and its effect decisive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-6\">It is also laid down to be law, that an election under a by-law is good, although the charier of incorporation may prescribe a mode of election different from that directed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the former. I confess that this doctrine does not seem to me to be perfectly compatible with some of those principles under the influence of which so many charters were once for-<em>J </em>feited, and so many corporations declared to be dissolved. But the Court, by referring to <em>1 Stra. </em>314. and <em>2 Kydon </em>Corporations, p. 200. will find the doctrine which i have stated. If this doctrine be correct, its application also must be obvious to the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-11\">I will take leave here to remark, that the principle contended for by the appellants\u2019 counsel goes farther than they have chosen to acknowledge. They object, it is ti ue, to the requisition only. They have no occasion to <em>go </em>farther, and they keep out of .sight, as far \u00e1s they can, the inference which must follow the admission of their objection. If the requisition is not available, because the election was irregular, every other requisition, every other act of the president and directors chosen on the 30th Januari/, 1805, is equally ineffectual and void. In fact the corporation is dissolved\u00bb</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"seealso\" id=\"b341-12\">See 1 <em>Black. Com. </em>485.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-13\">Thus, if the argument be correct, those who contend that a contract is sacred and cannot be touched by the legislature, are advocating a principle which destroys, at one \u201c fell Si swoop,\u201d every contract made between the society and its members.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-14\">This doctrine of dissolving corporations, in consequence of misconduct in their officers, to whatever extent it may have been carried in England, is not admissible here. The <em>position </em>countenanced in many decisions, is, that if a corporation refuse or neglect to appoint such officers, as they are directed by their charter to choose, on the day prescribed, the corporation is dissolved. This is not applicable to the case, to the institution, or to this country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-15\">In the present case there was neither refusal nor neglect. The corporation certainly intended to comply with .their charter. Their failure, if any failure occurred, was certainly unintentional. If the members composing a corporate body, peremptory refuse or wilfully neglect to appoint their officers, at the time prescribed, their conduct may perhaps, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>with seme <em>appearance </em>of propriety, be regarded as a vohuu tary nurrencler of their (.ban ter. Tut where t\u00edtere is only r mistake, the principle do'-:, r.ot apply (\u00a1ven in <em>England. </em>It. is there uniformly admitted, that a mayor <em>dc </em>facto, is competent to the performance of every official act. The person in office is presumed to Ire duly elected until he is actually ousted by a judgment in an information. 12 <em>Mod. Rep. </em>255 6 <em>Vin. </em>296. So far has tins principle been carried, that where there was a verdict and a rule for entering up judgment against a mayor <em>dc </em>facto, which rule would be absolute In four days, the Court refused to award a <em>mandamus </em>directing the corporation to proceed to the election of a mayor, the office not being considered as vacant until the judgment of ouster was actually pronounced. 3 <em>Burr. Rep. </em>1386.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-7\">A rule tending to destroy, or even to suspend for a time\u00bb so important an institution ought not to be extended farther than the obvious import of the terms in which it is expressed plainly requires. The failure spoken of in the books, is a failure as to ti me: the failure here charged, relates to manner only. It is not said that a president was not appointed until it was too late. It is objected only, that he was appointed without having been previously chosen a director. The distinction between a deviation from the law, as to time, and a deviation as to the manner of an appointment is obvious. If the chief officer of a corporation is not appointed when Iris predecessor goes out of office, the corporation may, with some plausibility, be said to be necessarily extinct. There certainly is a moment at which it cannot perform its functions ; and the <em>English </em>books say, that its capacity cannot be revived. A new charter is <em>the only </em>remedy. But where the election is made, where the officer is appointed, no such disability ensues, and therefore no such effect ought to be produced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-8\">This high prerogative doctrine, which has been abolished \" even in England, by express statute, has no sort of analogy' to the political institutions of this country7; and therefore ought not to be regarded. 'The convenience and welfare of many ought not to be suffered to depend upon the integrity oi; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Attention of a few, unless that dependence necessarily results from the nature of the institution in question. The welfare of the peonle of <em>Virginia </em>must necessarily, in a great ruca\u00bb , * \\ , 6 . . , . , <em>c , . </em>sure, depend on the patriotism ana wisaom or their representatives; but it would be absurd that the police of a populous city, should be suspended or destroyed, because an appoint-merit which ought to have been made, on <em>Monday </em>was made on Tuesday, or because an election which ought to have been finished by one o\u2019clock, was not concluded until two. The mischief would be incalculable. The debts due to and from the corporation would be extinguished, and its property acquired at a great expense, for schools, work-houses, &amp;c\u201e would revert to the original proprietors. .Such a doctrine grew up and flourished in the time of <em>Charles </em>IL but it was found to be too rank in <em>Great Britain., </em>and was therefore cut up by the roots. It would be folly to transplant it here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-8\">This doctrine, even if generally admitted, ought to be excluded from this particular case. The <em>Mutual Assurance Society </em>unquestionably constitute a corporate <em>body; </em>but it is a corporation o\u00ed a peculiar kind. The society is formed for the express and sole purpose of making contracts both, general and permanent. Hie above doctrine, therefore, even if applied to corporations, whose powers are confined' to their own local business and affairs, is not applicable to one, whose transactions are coextensive with the state, and whose existence must necessarily <em>be of the </em>same duration with their contracts. Strange, indeed, would il be, that the society should avail itself of its own neglect to extinguish its own contracts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-9\">But if <em>M'Rae </em>was not duly elected, tie was not a usurper. 'He was at <em>least </em>a president <em>de facto. </em>A usurper is a mere intruder ; one who exercises the functions of an officer without any pretence of right, without even the form of an election. An officer <em>de facto </em>is one who has been in fact appointed, but in whose election there is some irregularity or defect, which being proved in an'information in the nature of a <em>quo </em>warranto, would justify a judgment of ouster against him. 2 <em>Stra. </em>1091. 1 <em>Kyd an Corp. </em>451.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AbFV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Now the acts of an officer, of a mayor <em>de </em>facto, are good-A prosecution against him makes no difference.

In some cases it is admitted by the common law, and in some it has been expressly adopted by statute. At common law the acts of an administrator improperly appointed, of an administrator <em>defacto </em>are good. 3 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>51. And by statute, (see <em>Virg. Laws, 1 Rev. </em>Code, p. 58. \u00a7 5.) the same principle is expressly adopted as to clerks, sheriffs and magistx-ates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-8\">Mr. <em>Hay </em>then proceeded to the examination of the second question, and contended that the requisition of the half quota, though confined to the town subscribers only, was not for that reason void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-9\">The counsel for the appellants contend, said Mr. Hay, that the legislative act which incorporates the <em>Mutual Assurance </em>Society, is not a law, but a chartei', and that a chatter is a contract between the sovereign or state and the gx*antees of the charter, unchangeable but by mutual consent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AmX\">Having stated these premises, the appellants\u2019 counsel very logically pi\u2019oceed to the conclusion, that the act of 1805, which separated the town from the countxy, is repugnant to the law or charter of 1794, under which <em>all </em>the subscriber's wherever situated, in town or country, entered into a contx'act of mutual assurance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-11\">They further contend, that the act of 1805, under which the requisition was made is void, because it changes the contx-acts made under the law of 1794, and because by the constitution of the <em>United </em>States, no state can pass any law impairing the obligation of conti'acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-12\">This is the suhstance of the arguments for the appellants fairly stated. To both of these arguments one remark is applicable. The act of 1794 is called a charter; but the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>of 1805 is called a lavr. This difference in the denomination of the two legislative acts, which seems to be made without any design, is a stroke of great policy. If words are . properly called things, names, especially in legal science, may with still greater pt'opriety be called so. This truth is exemplified in this case. ' By calling the first act a charter, and the second a law, the cotinsel for the appellants thought that they secured to themselves the power of declaiming against a violation by law of chartered rights. But it is too clear to be disputed, that if the act of 1794 be a charter, and I conclude that it is, the act of 1805 isa charter also, by which the first is amended ; and what is more, amended at the prayer and application of the incorporated body. How much is the force of these arguments already diminished by thus calling the acts of the legislature by the names which really belong to them ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-18\">But we will examine separately the two arguments just stated. The first assumes a point, which cannot be conceded. A charter is not a compact between the state and the grantee of the charter. On the part of the state there is no contract express or implied. The state is not bound either to give to, or to receive, to do, or to abstain from doing, anything. On the part of the society, there is no obligation to the state. On what ground, then, can it be said that there is a contract, when neither of the parties enter into any sort of obligation. The idea is absurd. The real character of the act of 1794, is this ; it is in truth a charter of incorporation ; a grant of certain rights for the benefit of the grantees only ; a law authorizing certain persons to become insurers for each other, and to adopt measures adequate to the accomplishment of their plan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-19\">The propriety of this definition, or rather description of the act of 1794, cannot be controverted. It is collected from, the law itself. How far this charter, or any other, lies at the direction of the legislature, I will not stop to inquire. But it is manifest that the question is essentially different from that which relates to the control of a legislature over its con\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>tracts. Here there was no contract; but a grant only. Over grants the legislature <em>have </em>exercised a control. The Court will remember the case of the lower <em>Afames River Company. </em>They were regularly incorporated; but the legislature had been deceived or were mistaken in a very important point; and, according to the charter, as it stood, the company, who were to be indemnified by a toll for deepening the river, would have received toll for vessels to which <em>Rocketts </em>was accessible v. ithout the aid of the company. On proof of this fact, the legislature, without ceremony, repealed the law as far as the mischief extended, by exempting from toll many whom the charter bound to pay it. The propriety of this interference was never questioned, at least in Court, although the company had incurred considerable expense, and large quotas had been paid by the subscribers. The money paid was sunk, and in fact the scheme abandoned, by general consent. The question was decided in favour of the last law, by the deliberate judgment of impartial men. The subject was very generally, though calmly discussed ; and the company were, I believe, at length convinced, that their <em>chartered </em>rights were not quite so good, as the <em>natural </em>rights on which their charter had encroached. Nothing but this conviction could have prevented a legal investigation and' decision. The society was composed of men who had Wealth and influence, and many of them, at least, had no sort of objection to a prosecution, which afforded a reasonable hope of procuring a judicial condemnation of a legislative act. I mention this case to shew not only the opinion of the legislature, but the general opinion of the people.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">But it is not necessary for me to contend that the legislature possess the power and control which they exercised in this instance. The case covers more ground than my picsent argument requires. The proposition for which I contend is simply this; 4' that where the legislature grant a \u201c charter to an incorporated body, that charter may be altered 44 by the legislature at the prayer of the corporation itself.\u201d Admit, for a moment, that the charter was a compact,, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>proposition remains equally true. The parties, that is, the state and the corporation, had a right to alter it by mutual consent. That consent was given. The society in their memorial suggested the identical alterations established by the law of 1805.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-3\">But it is objected that the corporation did not unanimous-3y propose these alterations, and that every member of the society, like the members of a <em>Polish </em>diet, had a <em>veto </em>on the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-4\">In the first place, it may be answered, that in the memorial no notice is taken of any exception or dissent; nor does the fact of dissent on the part of any member appear ill any part of this record. The Court cannot presume such in fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-5\">Secondly; it is not probable that any objection was made. It would have been scandalous to have made it. The losses in the town were, so much heavier than the losses in the country, in proportion to the sums insured in each, that it was palpably unjust to continue the union longer. The proposition ivas as clear as arithmetic could make it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-7\">But, in the third place, admitting the fact alleged to be true, it is unimportant. A <em>majority </em>proposed the change, and a majority had a right to bind the rest. This proposition is very fully supported by 3 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>16. and <em>Kyd on Corp. </em>401.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-8\">It may be said, however, that a majority may hind the minority only in cases arising under the charter as it stands, and not in a measure which affects the charter itself. This certainly would be a very rigorous and unreasonable doctrine. A change approved by ninety-nine, is not to be adopted because it is opposed by the caprice of one !</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-9\">It is not only unreasonable in itself, but unfounded in law. The argument is obvious. <em>A </em>corporation may be dissolved by a surrender of its charter. For instance, the mayor, aldermen and corporation of a city mav surrender their charter to the government, and the people will be bound by its acceptance. Now if a corporate body can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>make a surrender for all the inhabitants of a city, surely a <em>majority </em>of the corporation may consent to an amendment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ayo\">From this doctrine, what inconvenience can result ? There is no room for declamation here. By this doctrine . chartered rights are not laid at the feet of legislative despotism. If no alteration is made, but at the instance of a majority of grantees, chartered rights are safe. It is idle and visionary to suppose that the grantees will conspire against themselves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-11\">The answer to the second argument is equally obvious and conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-12\">The objection is, that the act of 1805 is void according to the Constitution of the <em>United </em>States, because it impairs the mutuality of the contract between the various persons insured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ac1\">If it can be proved that the change which was made, I mean the separation of the town from the country, might have been effected if this law had never been made, the objection founded on the constitution, must be considered as unavailing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-14\">At common law the power of making by-laws is an essential ingredient in every incorporated association. 1 <em>Bl. Com. </em>476. 2 Kyd, 100. This corporation, therefore, if there be nothing in the original charter which prohibits it, had a right to alter the rate of insurance, if it bore unequally on the members of the society, or to adopt any other measure calculated to produce the same effect. The society, instead of altering the rate of insurance, struck at the root of the evil, and without making calculations, which however correct <em>then, </em>might not afterwards apply to a different state of things, separated the interests of the two great classes of the insured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-15\">The act of 1794 contains no such prohibition. Qn the contrary, they are clearly authorized to act according to their own discretion. By the 2d and 4th sections of the act of 1794, the subscribers are empowered to <em>examine </em>the system delineated in the lav/, to establish such rules and regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>as they might deem expedient, and to alter them at pleasure. By a fair construction of these sections, the society were authorized to do that which has been since done, and the doing of which gives rise to the present controversy : and there can be no doubt, that if the society, seeing the probability of the events which have since actually occurred, had then divided the town and country interests instead of attempting an apportionment of the rate of insurance, the legality of their act would never have been questioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-4\">I deem this observation to be conclusive. The words of this law are different from those generally used. H\u00e9re the members are authorized not only to es'ablish and alter regulations, but they are required to \u201c <em>examine the </em>system,\u201d and then to establish regulations. Why were they to examine the system, unless after that examination they were at liberty, by their regulations, so to modify it as to make it most conducive to the attainment of the great object of the institution ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-5\">But what is the contract which is impaired by the law of 1805, and which law is therefore unconstitutional and void?</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-6\">The idea of a contract between the state and the society has already been exploded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-7\">The contract is only between the individual subscribers. It has two parts ; the first, to pay the quotas required, is implied ; the second, giving a lien on the property insured for the quotas, is express. This is the whole contract. How is this contract affected by the act of 1805? The members are still liable to pay the quotas required ; the property insured is still bound for those quotas; and the money raised, is devoted to the object indicated by the law \u2014reparation of losses by fire. The only difference is, that the town quotas are applied to the indemnification for losses in town, and <em>\u00e9 converso </em>the country quotas for losses in the country. Each individual is as certain of indemnification now as he was before. The substance of the contract is untouched ; and though all the subscribers are not now hound to each, yet the most perfect reciprocity is maintained. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>because now each subscriber is not bound to all. In other words, if the country subscribers are now released from resPonsib\u00bbility for town losses, on the other hand, they are deprived of all claim for contribution upon the towns. I repeat, therefore, that the substance of the contract is untouched ; the benefit contemplated by the contractors, is as much within their reach as ever, and that it is absurd and irrational to contend that the obligation of a contract is impaired, where every man is bound as fully and effectually as he was before ; especially when it is recollected that by an express provision, every individual dissatisfied with the institution may retire whenever he thinks proper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-8\">This measure originated in a suspicion, that the country members paid more than their fair proportion of the losses. Inquiry converted this suspicion into belief. Calculation proved, that though their losses were only two-sevenths of the whole, <em>i. e. </em>20 dollars in 70, they yet paid two-fifths, <em>i. e. </em>28 dollars in 70. This disproportion operating on millions instead of tens, struck the most common observer, and justified the clamour which was raised against the institution. All agreed that the evil ought to be redressed. The only question was as to the mode. Redress might have been obtained by lowering the premiums in the country, or raising those in the towns. But precision, exact equality was not attainable. If either of these measures had been adopted, time would probably have shewn that the calculation had not been correct. It was wise, therefore, to strike at the root of the evil, and to prevent the possibility of controversy by the division which has been made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-9\">A town subscriber is the last person who should murmur at this arrangement. Every day losses in the towns become more improbable. No wooden houses are built ; and those which are built of brick are rendered daily more secure against fire.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-10\">The act of 1805, therefore, does not impair the <em>obligation </em>of the contracts made under the act of 1794 ; on the contrary, maintaining the contracts in full force, in every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>point of any consequence, it places the parties on the fiting of exact equality and justice. i</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-3\">Even if the contracts in question were in some dope . r i 1 changed by the act of 1805, the 10th section of the \u2014 <em>\u00b0 J </em>_ \u00a1 article of the Constitution of the <em>United </em>States, could jot be brought to bear upon the subject ; because in the rst place the obligation of the contract is not impaired, aiiin the next, the clause under consideration could never <em>hre </em>been intended for a case of this description. The olct was to prevent the states from passing laws, as they had de, affecting contracts between individuals ; such, for instae, as making lands a tender in payment of debts, or suspding executions; but not to prevent a legislature from edging a charter at. the request of the persons chartered. Oppose, when this section was submitted to the conventil, a proviso had been proposed, excepting from its openon eases like the present; would not this proposition haveeen. rejected, on the ground that it was unnecessary, the jdnt excepted not being within the purview of the section ?i</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AsA\">The Court will see, that on several occasions the <em>Mual Assurance Society </em>have acted under the construction ire given to the act of 1794 ; and the propriety and validit of their acts never have been yet questioned. At one me they exempted from sale all property but that which right be thereafter subscribed for, and at another release all those who chose to give up the premiums paid, and abidon the society.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-9\">Mr. <em>Ray </em>then stated several other cases calculad to shew that the society had uniformly, and without oppo\u00fcon or question, acted under the construction of the it of 1794, which he had before endeavoured to establish</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5I\">Mr. <em>Hay </em>remarked, that the objection, which stateithat the risk had been increased by the act of 1805, was ianifcstly the result of misapprehension. The law had nt effect either on the elements, on the h -bits of the people or on the situation of the buildings. On these things, md <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the only, the risk depended. The act of <em>1803, </em>therefore, lefhe risk where it was before. Nor did it even affect the indnnification. The loser is as secure of redress now as *le nid iiave been if the law had never passed,</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AT4k\">j then concluded by saying that he had hitherto argued on \u00a1supposition that there was \u00e1 contract between each fneaer of the society, and all the others. This seemed to s the idea which the legislature entertained ; but in tru it is not correct. The contract is contained in the poV, and to'every rational or substantial purpose is a contraibetween each individual, and the society in its corporatcapacity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-3\">[J.

The word \u201c mi is applicable to the appellant either as an individual, or asi part of the corporate body. His risk, as an insured indijdual, is not changed by the act in question ; as a merber of the body insuring, it may, and must vary accorong to circumstances, by the increase or diminution of the fund, the accession of new members, or dropping off of od ones, the raising or lowering the premium for new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>members, and in various other ways. The words \u201c with\u25a0 e* <em>out his </em>consentmay apply to him as an individual or a member. If in the former character, he is hound by the acts of the legislature ; if in the latter, by the regulations of the corporate body. Ko doubt, however, they me.-i t his <em>individual </em>assent, and that the fundamental laws of <em>u </em>corporate bod) cannot h&gt; changed without the assent of each member actually given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-4\">In the present instance, they are changed by the authority of the government,, and with the assent ol the corpoiate body in its corporate chwacto.r, but not that of each ir. 3vi-dual member.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-5\">It is admitted, on the part <em>of </em>the appellees, that, as a cojporate body, the}' owe their <em>ejds'enre </em>to Uicir fundamental laws and cannot change them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-6\">I will examine the power of the legislature on three grounds ; 1st. On general principles ; 2d. The Constitution of <em>Virginia; </em>and, 3d. That of the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-7\">ir.t. On general principles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-8\">The supreme power of a free government, cannot change its own organization. If, for instance, the legislature consists of two branches, one cannot vote the other useless and act without it, nor can the legislature annul tire powers of the executive body. ' By such a change the government would no longer be the same, and a revolution would be effected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-9\">But in every country, whether free or not, the government must have the power of calling forth the resources of the state, of commanding the persons and property of its citizens .as the public exigences may require, aud occasionally their regulations must embrace only a portion of the community. Laws may be either general or particular <em>; </em>may apply to all the citizens, to particular classes or to individuals. In time of war, for example, they may order out -dl the militia, or that of particular districts, and may impress the property of individuals.- Laws establishing roads, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>ferries, and mills, frequently affect the property of few,. and sometimes single persons, and acts divorcing husband and wife, (as in the case of <em>Turnbull and wifed) </em>and the . <em>r </em>sale or lands of infants, (as m that of <em>Minor and </em>Taliafer<em>roi </em>1 <em>Call,) </em>are frequently passed, and no one doubts their being within the scope of legislative authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-8\">Such laws, however well intended, are frequently unjust, or occasionally produce injustice ; but they are not the less valid. One at least of my opponents will agree that the act which enforces militia fines on the citizens of <em>Richmond </em>more than twice as great as on the citizens of the state at large, is highly unjust, yet he has never contended that it was void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-9\">So too they may create corporate bodies, such as banks, trading companies, and corporations for the government of towns, give them a perpetual existence, and confer on them rights and duties different from those of other citizens. The ostensible object of these Jaws is the public good, yet in particular instances it may be grossly mistaken, and the' law will still be obligatory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-10\">Generally speaking, the power of making laws carries with it the power of revoking them, otherwise, one legislature will possess a greater power than succeeding ones.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-11\">If by means of deception on the government^ a law is obtained vesting rights in individuals destructive of the \u2022public good, and against common right, a power must exist somewhere of annulling such laws ; and if there is no particular regulation to the contrary, this power must reside in the legislature, or that body which exercises supreme authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-12\">But it is objected that laws, such as the one in question, tire in their essence contracts', and that the government, being but one of the contracting parties, cannot cancel them without the consent of the other. Admitting them to be contracts, it does not follow that a government is always bound to carry them into effect. Treaties are national contracts, and yet there are cases ip which states are warrante4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Vn refusing to execute them. Independent nations acknowledging no superior, have no common judge, and each, taking <em>the </em>consequences of doing wrong, must judge for \u00b0 . i itself. Ey contracts with individuals, the state cannot be more firmly bound than by treaties ; and individuals who have no means of controlling their decisions, except in extreme cases must acquiesce.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-8\">This doctrine it may be objected goes to establish in government \u201c <em>the right divine to govern </em>\u25a0wrong,\u201d but what are the consequences of the opposite opinion ? If every individual can judge for himself whether a law is according to moral right, and whether the state is authorized in any particular instance to depart from its contract, or has <em>in fact </em>violated it, how is obedience to the laws to be sustained ? And if a public body is invested with the right of deciding, that body, <em>quoad </em>hoc, becomes the supreme power of the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-10\">Governments, like individuals, are under a moral obligation to do right, and every breach of faith in either, is Immoral. Free agency implies the power of doing well or ill, and cannot exist without this power. Error is incident to human nature, and in a doubtful case between a government and an individual, what unerring standard of right can be resorted to ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-11\">In ordinary cases, a change of rulers by the accustomed mode of election, is a sufficient security against unjust or unequal laws, and the proper remedy for such as have beet? enacted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-12\">No doubt laws may be so flagrantly unjust, and oppression so great, as to authorize every individual to refuse obedience, and to stand up in 'support of the outraged rights of humanity ; but when things are brought to this point, the government, no longer answering the purpose for which it was established, ceases to exist, and a revolution is effected. In such a conjuncture the decision is made, not by the ordinary tribunals, but by the people at large. So far on general principles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AS-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>2d. On the Constitution of <em>Virginia.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD9\">I do not deny that among the infinite variety of modes in which different governments may be organized, the su<em>t </em>\u00b0 preme power may be so distributed as that a public body, ... , not Having the right of originating or enacting laws m the first instance, may be so constituted as to possess the power of pronouncing on the validity of those that are enacted by the ordinary legislature ; and I have no doubt that under the constitution of Virginia, there might be laws enacted which this Court would be bound in the ordinary exercise of its jurisdiction to declare null and void. If, for instance, the legislature should take on itself to decide on a controverted judicial question between two individuals, the law would, be void as violating that part of the constitution which relates to the organization of the government, and provides that the legislative, executive, and judiciary power shall be kept separate and distinct from each other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-10\">The act in question cannot be said to be an invasion of \u2022the power of the Judiciary. In every judicial question there must be a controversy and three parlies, the actor, <em>reus, </em>and <em>judex; </em>here the controversy was not decided <em>by the </em>law, but <em>arises out of it.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-11\">The. argument drawn from the power of the king of <em>England </em>to grant charters but not to annul them, does not apply to a government constituted like ours. This power is a relic of the prerogatives anciently exercised by the <em>English </em>monarchs. The supreme or legislative power docs not reside exclusively in the king, and he can only exercise his prerogative in the manner sanctioned by the custom of the realm. Being a limited monarch, and entrusted only with the executive powers of government, he is neither warranted by usage nor general principles in revoking or altering charters. He cannot, for instance, alter the charter of <em>London, </em>but those of <em>Williamsburg </em>and <em>Norfolk </em>have been altered again and again by the legislature of <em>Virginia, </em>whose power in this respect has never been doubted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>it may be objected, that the general spirit of our constitution forbids any act of injustice, or the violation of a contract on the part of the government. No doubt every go-1 \u00b0 <em>/ , </em>vernment ought to keep in view the great principles of justice \u00b0 1 , ? , . , and moral right, but no authority is expressly given to tne judiciary by the Constitution of <em>Virginia, </em>to declare a law void as being morally wrong or in violation of a contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-9\">7,f such a power were given, a case might occur, in which the legislature would be right and the Court wrong in its opinion; who then would correct the error of the Court ? According to the system of the ancient philosophers <em>o\u00cd India, </em>we are told that the world is upheld by an elephant, and the sdephant again by a tortoise, but they still want a support.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-11\">Unless, then, the Constitution of the <em>United Slates </em>renders die act in question void, it is obligatory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-12\">That the constitution prohibits the legislature from passing such an act without the consent of the body corporate, I am not disposed to controvert, although it may well be questioned whether it was intended to apply to such a case. The provision in the constitution that <em>\u201cno state shall pass a </em>\u201c <em>law impairing the obligation of </em>contracts,\u201d cannot be understood in the most extensive sense of the words, so as to embrace, for instance, laws for suppressing usurious or gaming contracts, but must have a reasonable construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-14\">It may perhaps be questioned, especially since the amendment to the constitution which prohibits suits against states, whether this provision applies to contracts with states, and whether in this respect persons contracting with a state stand in a better situation than those contracting with the government of any independent nation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-15\"><em>By </em>the general law of nations, if a subject of one independent state contracts with the government of another, which violates the contract, he is without remedy and has no right to cali on his own government to support his right, as he trusted only to the good faith of those with whom he contracted, yet if, without reference to any contract, he has sustained an injury from die government of a foreign state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>a ^S'htto call on his own for protection, and a refusal to make reparation is a cause of war.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac8m\">But admitting this provision in the constitution to apply to \u00b0 1 contracts with states, any construction that would lead to an absurdity must be rejected. It may not be unreasonable to require the assent of the corporate body in its corporate character; but to require that of every individual member of a numerous body, some of whom must always be disabled by infancy, coverture, absence, disease or other causes that may render their assent impossible, is in effect to declare that no fundamental law of a corporate body thus constituted, shall ever be changed, however just or expedient such change might be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-8\">If, for example, the bank of Virginia, instead of the present seat of its establishment, had been fixed at <em>James Town, </em>with its branches at <em>Farina, Warwick, </em>and other towns that are now no more, would it not have been in the power of the legislature, with the assent of the bank in its corporate character, to remove it ? or must the business of the bank be transacted in the deserted fields where those towns stood, instead of the seats of commerce where it is now transacted ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-9\">The counsel for the appellants, aware of the absurdities to which this general position would lead, have endeavoured to evade them by a distinction which a moment\u2019s reflection must satisfy them creates no real difference, and leads exactly to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-10\">They admit the law to be binding on such members of the corporate body as have individually assented to it, but not the others, who were either incapable of yielding their assent, or actually refused it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-12\">One of two consequences must flow from such a state of things ; either that the old corporate body continues to exist in its original form and a new one is created out of it, consisting in part of the same members, comprehending the same property, and for the same general objects, which is as absurd as the position in physics, t&amp;at two bodies can occupy the same space ; or else that the individuals of the mino<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>fity who have withheld their assent to the change from choice, or inability to yield it, cease to become members of the corporate body, and art; no longer under any obligation <em>to </em>conform to its rules. This last conclusion, I presume, is the one the counsel for the appellants would draw from their position. But when it is recollected that the obligations and rights of the members of the corporate body are correlative, and that the individuals who are discharged from the former must lose the latter, they will see that tins admission gives up the. argument. Many cases might occur in which members of a corporate body would be much more deeply injured by being disfranchised and losing their corporate rights without their consent, than by conliu uing members and being bound by the acts of the majority ; and they are certainly deprived of their rights under the original contract without their consent as effectually in one way as the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-4\">It must therefore be admitted that the Constitution of the <em>Linked States </em>does not prohibit the legislature of a state from changing the fundamental laws of a corporation, with its assent, given in its corporate character, or that the framers of the constitution meant what was utterly inconsistent both with reason and right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-5\">2d, The call has been made by a president and directors duly qualified to make it. It is admitted that they were chosen at a regular general meeting by a majority of the members present; but it is objected that because instead o\u00ed choosing four directors in the first instance, and <em>then </em>a pres\u00e9; dent <em>out of these four, </em>the meeting <em>first </em>chose a president,, and <em>then three </em>directors, the act was not pursued, and the election void. This exposition of the act would be very correct if the electoral body did not continue the same. If, for instance, four directors were to be chosen by the members of the corporate body at large, and these directors were then <em>themselves </em>to choose a president out of their own body? it would no doubt be contrary to law, for the members at large to choose a president. But as the president is himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>one of the directors, (as appears from the various passages in the act,) it is merely a question as to <em>the order </em>of election, and there can be no real difference which choice is first made; now the act does not expressly prescribe any order in the choice, and the phrase \u201c <em>out of-whom a president shall a 'be </em>chosenmay be fairly understood as equivalent to u <em>one </em>\u201c <em>of whom shall be chosen </em>president.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-8\">for an error merely in point of form, a <em>quo warranto </em>will not be granted. 1 <em>Durnford and </em>East, 3. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Stacy. 4 </em>Burrow, 2120. <em>Rex </em>v. Dawes, and v. <em>Martin.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-9\"><em>But </em>on <em>either </em>construction of the act, the call was made by a president and directors <em>de facto.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-10\">The distinction between an officer <em>de </em>facto, but not dejure, and a usurper, as laid down by all the authorities is, that the former gets possession by a colourable election, the latter without any election whatever. The acts of the latter are void, of the former, good when necessary. This is not ta be understood as relating to a necessity in the <em>particular </em>case, but a general necessity for <em>such acts. </em>Now the objects for which the society was instituted cannot be attained without occasional calls for quotas. The distinction between legislative, executive, and judicial acts, as laid down by the counsel for the appellants is not to be met with in any of the books, and if it were a sound one, is not applicable. Acts of each of these descriptions may, or may not be necessary, and a call under the laws of the corporate body certainly is not a legislative act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-11\">That between acts which depend <em>on the zutil </em>and those that do not, is equally unfounded; the word <em>necessary </em>must be understood in its legal sense as equivalent to requisite for the good of the society, and not as relating to a physical necessity. On the whole, therefore, the call was made under an act of Assembly binding on the society at large, and each of the members, and by officers possessing competent authority for filis purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-12\">[judge Tucker declined sitting in this cause.)</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b331-28\">\n<em> See 2 Rev.

The act further provided, that as soots as three millions of dollars should be subscribed, the subscribers should meet together, <em>examine </em>the <em>system </em>submitted to the legislature, and conclude on such <em>rules and </em>regula<em>lions, </em>as to a majority of the subscribers might seem best; and that the <em>said society </em>should be at liberty, from <em>time to time, </em>to alter and amend the said rules and regulations, as they may judge necessary ; and in particular, that they should agree upon the premiums to be paid. The act also provided, that as soon as the society should have acted in the premises, and elected their agents and officers, it should be considered as incorporated by virtue of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">It is evident, that every thing touching the question before us, is left to the pleasure of the society itself by this act, or at least, every thing that does not invade the principle before mentioned, or some other principle admitted to .be fundamental; and that some of the powers <em>expressly </em>recognised by the act, as appertaining to the society itself, (that of fixing and altering the premiums for example,) are equally as important and as liable to be abused as the principle in question ; which, it is urged, has been infringed by the act of 1805, effecting a separation between the interests bf the towns and those of the country. Tne power to d\u00ab* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>right, unavoidably involves that of doing wrong; an adequate security to individuals, however, is, that the <em>general will </em>of the society finds no motive for injustice or oppres- . . , r , . ... sion. The true question, therefore, before us is, whether an3? <em>fundamental </em>principle exists in the case at bar,- inter-the separation of the interests in question\u2014and if there be, whether the subsequent legislature had power t\u00ae invade it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">These questions, and especially the last, involve great and momentous considerations. The near approach of the dose of the term, does not allow me time to digest and arrange my ideas upon it, to my satisfaction ; but as the interests of the society, and the public, demand a speedy decision, I shall not hesitate to give one.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">In order to shew that the act in question is no law, and therefore, it is further urged, is a compact, and as such is beyond the power of a succeeding legislature, <em>Blackston\u00e9\u2019s </em>definition of municipal law has been, relied on. Municipal law is defined by him to be \u201c a <em>rule </em>of civil conduct \u201c prescribed by the <em>supreme </em>power of the state, <em>command- </em>\u201c <em>ing </em>what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong j\u201d and it is argued, that the act in question is no law, under this definition, .for want of the <em>generality </em>implied by the term. \u201c rule,\u201d and because it is said to be not so much in the nature of a command by the legislature, as of a promise or contract proceeding from it. When we consider, that mere private statutes and acts of parliament, are (even by' this writer himself) universally classed among the municipal laws of <em>England; </em>nay, even that the <em>particular customs </em>of that kingdom, are admitted to form a part of the municipal code, it is evident, that this definition of municipal law, is by far too limited and narrow. I would rather adopt the definition of Justinian, that civil (or municipal) law, is, \u201c <em>quod quisque sibi populus </em>constituitbounded only in this country in relation to legislative acts, by the constitutions of the general and state governments ; and limited also by considerations of <em>justice. </em>It was argued-by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>3 </em>respectable member of the bar, that the legislature had a right to pass any law, however just, or unjust, reasonable, or unreasonable. This is a position which even the courtly judge <em>Bluckstcne </em>was scarcely hardy enough to contend for, under the doctrine of the boasted <em>omnipotence </em>of parliament. What is this, bat to lay prostrate, at the footstool of the legislature, all our rights <em>of </em>person and of property, and abandon those great objects, for the protection of which, alone, all free governments have been instituted 1</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">For my part, I will not outrage the character of any civilized people, by supposing them to have met in lature, upon any other ground, than that of morality and justice. In <em>this </em>country, in particular, I will never forget, \u201c that no free government, or the blessing of liberty, can, \u201c be preserved to any people, but by a firm adherence to <em>\u201cjustice, </em>moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue, <em>\u201c </em>and by frequent recurrence to fundamental <em>principles.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I must add, however, that when any legislative act is to be questioned, on the ground of conflicting with the superior acts of the <em>people, or </em>of invading the vested rights of individuals, the case ought to be palpable and clear: in an equivocal or equiponderant case, it ought not easily to be admitted, that the immediate representatives of the people, representing as well the justice as the wisdom of the nation, have forgotten the great injunctions under which they are called to act. In such case, it ought rather to be believed, that <em>the judging </em>power is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">With respect to acts of incorporation, they ought never to be passed, but in consideration of services to be rendered to the public. This is the principle on which such charters are granted even in <em>England; </em>(1 <em>Bl. Com. </em>467.) and it holds <em>a fortiori </em>in this country, as our bill of rights interdicts all \u201c exclusive and separate emoluments or privileges from <em>\u201c </em>the community, but in consideration of public services.\u201d (Art. 4.) It may be often <em>convenient </em>for a set of associated individuals, to have the privileges of a corporation bestowed upon them; but if their object is merely <em>private </em>or selfish: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>if it is detrimental to, or not promotive of, the public good, they have no adequate claim upon the legislature for the Prtv^eE'c* 33 **\u2022 *s possible that the legislature may be *mPoscd uPon in the first instance ; and as the public good and the interests of the associated body, may, in the progress of time, by the gradual and natural working of events, bp thrown entirely asunder, the question presents itself, whether, under such and similar circumstances, the hands of a succeeding legislature are tied up from revoking the privilege\u00bb My answer is, that they are not. In the first case, no consideration of public service ever existed, and in the last, none <em>continues </em>to justify the privilege. It is the character of a legislative act to be <em>repcalable </em>by a succeeding legislature ; nor can a preceding legislature limit the power of <em>its </em>successor, on the mere ground of volition only. That effect can only arise from a state of things involving public utility, which includes the observance of <em>justice </em>and good faith towards all men.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">These ideas are not new ; they are entirely sanctioned by'the <em>sublime </em>act of our legislature, \u201c for establishing re-<em>a </em>ligous freedom.\u201d That act, after having declared and asserted certain <em>self-evident </em>principles, touching the rights of religious freedom, concludes in this manner: \u201c And \u201c though we well know that this assembly, ejected by the \u201c people for the <em>ordinary </em>purposes of legislation only, have <em>a </em>no power to restrain the acts of succeeding assemblies, \u201c constituted with powers <em>equal to our </em>own, and that, there- \u00ab fore, to declare this act irrevocable, would be of <em>no effect a </em>in law, yet we are free to declare, that the rights hereby \u00ab asserted, are of the <em>natural rights </em>of mankind, and that \u00ab if an}' act shall be hereafter passed, to repeal the present, <em>u </em>or to narrow its operation, such act will be <em>an infringe-u nient of natural right.\u201d </em>Conforming to the principles declared in this luminous exposition, I infer, irresistibly, that the power of a succeeding legislature is bounded only, (and that in cases of no <em>equivocal </em>complexion,) by the principles and provisions of the constitution and bill of rights, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>uy those great rights and principles, for the preservation of which all just governments are founded. It is not my iniention to go into <em>detail </em>on the present subject ; but the power of the succeeding legislature is neither to be limited bv a state of things, which (an aforesaid) leaves no beneft rial residt whatsoever, to the community, nor by those petty inequalities and injuries, which arise to <em>some </em>individuals or classes of men, under every general regulation whatsoever. \u00cd will not say that the reason of the law ceasing, the law itself ought to continue ; nor that we are to expect entire and exact justice, under any system whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Under the actual case before us, I might, perhaps, have spared myself the necessity of this discussion. The principle stated in the act of 1794, which is supposed to have interdicted the separation in question, is couched in terms extremely abstract and <em>general. </em>While other principles declared by this act, have dearly and expressly confined the benefits of the institution to <em>citizens </em>of this state, and limited insurances to losses occasioned <em>accidentally by fre ; </em>while it is clearly provided that retribution is to be made by the insured., and <em>that </em>according to' the sum insured, the principle now immediately in question does not seem to prohibit a division or distribution of the members, or their interests into classes, or districts. There was no motive for a restriction upon the society in this particular, especially in an institution of the first impression ; and there is no reasonable fear of abuse by the society, of a power equally useiul to all, and liable to produce injustice m one quarter as well as another. It was deemed proper to allow to the society the benefit of experience ; and as other powers of a ch-raster as important as the one before us, were confessedly granted to the society at large, wherefore should <em>this </em>be withheld ? Referring to the contemporaneous and successive construction of the act of 1794, by the society itself, always acquiesced in by every member, it will be seen that \u25a0the society itself, <em>inter </em>alia, extended assurances to losses occasioned by <em>lightning </em>also; (whereas the original act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>seems </em>to have contemplated <em>ordinary Jires only;) </em>that they from the benefits of the institution certain combustible houses and buildings; and of-their own mere auprior to the existence of any legislative prov*s'on t0 t^ai effect, permitted individuals to withdraw from the obligations they had incurred under the original institution. While it is far from my intention to'arraign these wholesome and salutary exercises of power, on the part of the society, in general meeting, I contend that these and some other powers are of a character as important, perhaps, as that of effecting a separation. <em>\\ </em>. \u2022, thority, and</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">From these considerations, it would, perhaps, result, that the regulation in question did not require legislative aid to carry it into operation, but might have been effected by the society itself. That, however, is taking a broader ground than is necessary to be maintained on the present occasion. That aid having been afforded by the legislature, it is enough for our purpose that the act of 1805, if it has produced any injustice at all to any class of subscribers, has fallen short of that crying grade of injustice, which alone can disarm the act of its operation. The society itself, at least, considered this, on the contrary, asa measure essen-' tiai to the equalization of the risks ; and, in this respect, I see no cause to differ from them in opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">By referring to the principle of our law respecting corporations, the foregoing results will be fully justified. Those <em>artificial </em>persons are rendered necessary in the law from the inconvenience, if not impracticability of keeping alive the rights of associated bodies, by devolving them on one series of individuals after another. The effect of them is, to consolidate the will of the whole, which is collected from the sense of the <em>majority </em>of those who constitute them. This decision by a <em>majority </em>is a fundamental law of corporations in this country and in <em>England; </em>in which respect our law differs from the civil law ; it requiring the concurrence of two thirds of the whole members. It is also a fundamental principle of corporations, that this <em>majority </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>aft ay establish rules and regulations for the corporation, (which are considered as a sort of <em>municipal </em>law for the body corporate,) subject only to a superior and fundamental law which may have been prescribed by the founder thereof, or by the legislature which grants the privilege\u2014perhaps, also, these petty legislatures ought further to be limited by all those considerations, (including the due observance of justice.) which 1 have endeavoured to shew, ought to bound the proceedings of all legislatures whatsoever- If, however, there be no such paramount law, or overruling principle, the mere will of the <em>majority </em>is competent to <em>any </em>regulation. I have endeavoured <em>to </em>shew, that <em>ao </em>principle exists in the case before us to answer the foregoing character ; that the one suggested is entirely abstract and indefinite as to the point in question ; and that it does not appear that any injustice has arisen, or can be reasonably expected to arise, from carrying the measure in question into operation. But further, a corporation may be extinguished by the <em>surrender </em>of its rights and franchises; as to which the unanimous assent of <em>every </em>individual is not requisite. The will of the majority must prevail in this, as in other cases. ft is not to be expected that this kind of suicide will be committed for <em>light </em>causes ; and where causes of greater exigency require it, the corporation should not hesitate to make the surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">I will put a case, which will exemplify my meaning. By the charter establishing the <em>College of William and </em>Mary, it was a <em>fundamental </em>law of the institution that a <em>.Divinity School </em>should be kept up, for promoting a <em>Seminary of Church of England </em>Ministers, and another for the instruction of the neighbouring <em>Indians </em>in the arts and sciences. Both of these have, by common consent, which amounts,. <em>quoad hoc, </em>to a surrender, been discontinued in the seminary, although they were required by the fundamental law thereof. A state of things has arisen, which has put down the then established church, and given to <em>other </em>sects of religion their equal claims to the benefits resulting from that institution\u00bb*\u00bb-'\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>at\u00ed institution, to the endowment of-which, considerable\" portions of the <em>public </em>property were contributed 5 and as for. an <em>Indian </em>school, that has been rendered unnecessary* <em>' ' \u2022 * </em>^ , i <em>r </em>\" \u25a0 \u00ab . among other considerations, by the change o\u00ed our relations *n respect of those aborigines, and from their remoteness at the present day from the seat of that institution. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">As it is.not expected, that corporations shall exist <em>for ever, </em>when the reasons for granting them shall have passed away, and no public utility can ensue from their continuance,, this right of surrender must incontrovertibly exist, ev\u00e9n in derogation of the fundamental laws and principles. In the case before us, the resolution of the society,' on which the act of 18\u00d35 was bottomed, may be considered as such surrender, and that act as the acceptance thereof. The interests of the institution commenced thereafter, as it were, <em>d\u00e9 novo; </em>and provision Was made for \u00e1 revision, \u2022 and revaluation of the houses in the towns and in the country, as th\u00fas separated! Whether, therefore, the measure Adopted by the society in 1805, and sanctioned by the legislature, be considered as a legitimate change, by the society itself, of an <em>ordinary </em>regulation, or as a <em>surrender </em>which destroyed 3 <em>fundamental </em>one, the effect as to the question before us, is precisely the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">I have thus despatched, as well \u00e1s time will permit, the great question on which this case depends. It remains to say, that no act can be done by the society, but in general meeting, as to the time and place of which the law has provided, there shall be full and adequate notice * and this is a sufficient security against surprise. I will also Acid, that if any class or set of individuals are so peculiarly circum-' stanced, as that their interests should conflict with those of the majority of the society, while they have undoubtedly contracted to be bound by the suffrages of that majority, they are also protected from oppression, by the liberty guaranteed them, of withdrawing from the institution altogether. It is better that an inconvenient member of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>society should be lopped off, than the whole body corporate should perish.</p>\n<p id=\"AhU\">One objection of a minor character yet remains to be disposed of. It is that the requisition, under which the , , . , , quota in question was demanded, is illegal ; it having been adopted by a president not duly elected, it is said, he not having been <em>previously </em>elected a <em>director.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">By the original act of 1794, the power of choosing a president and directors, without any restriction whatever, is admitted to belong to the society at large, in general meeting. By the act of 1805, the legislature has provided that the president shall be chosen <em>out of </em>three directors, the whole to be chosen by the meeting ; whence it is inferred there must be two separate and distinct elections. The objection in question does not come well from those who contend, that the act of 1794 contains fundamental provisions, which even the legislature is not competent to alter,</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">I will not stop to inquire, whether the society at large acquired an exclusive and indefeasible right in the premises\u00bb under the original act of 1794, which will bear out the present proceeding ; I will consider the case as standing under the act of 1805 only. I will here remark, that I understand the case agreed, as only admitting that Mr. <em>HRae </em>was not <em>previously </em>appointed a director, by a separate and distinct appointment: I do not understand it to admit, that the society <em>did not </em>appoint him a director <em>eodem </em>fatu, that they appointed him president. By the terms of the act of 1805, a <em>previous </em>election as director is not necessary ; and, certainly, there can be no <em>substantial </em>reason for giving to it sucha construction. There can be no real utility in requiring an unnecessary circuity of proceeding ; and as a <em>previous </em>election as director, was not required by the act, there was no objection to the society husbanding their time by appointing a president and director (both of which characters are to <em>combine </em>in the same person) at one ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"A_v\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>In every-view of this case, therefore, .1 am of opinion, that-the judgment of the District Court is correct, and ought - to be affirmed.- '</p>\n<author id=\"AzL\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"Atz\">e ~ t - 1 he appellant, m the Court below, rested his defence on two points. 1st. That <em>Alexander M.'-Rae, </em>who acted as president of the said society, when the stud resolution was passed, was not duly and lawfully elected ; he not having been, previous to his appointment as president, appointed a director, as by law directed ; and, 2dly. That the <em>motion </em>could not be maintained under the act of 1794, for establishing the <em>society ; </em>the requisition on which it was founded not having been made in conformity therewith; nor under the act of <em>January., 180S, </em>lately adopted \u00e1t a general meeting ; the said \u00bfre\u00ed'having attempted to increase his risk, without his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"A-A\">With respect to the first objection, there seems to me to be no weight in it. By a regulation of the society made in the year 1795, its business was managed by a president and fourteen directors. That regulation having been found inconvenient, it is by the 9th section of the act of 1805, declared, that \u201c there shall be in future only three directors, <em>out of </em>\u201c <em>whom </em>a president shall be chosen.\u201d I construe this clause in the act, in the same manner as, if the words had been, \u201c there shall be in future only three, directors, <em>one </em>of whom 61 shall be president.\u201d And as to the mode of his election, it appears to me-immaterial whether he was first elected <em>presi</em>dent, and afterwards the same day chosen one of the <em>three directors, </em>or had been first chosen a director, and afterwards elected president; as he was on the same day .(and long before the resolution making the requisition in question), both president and one of the three directors ; and so it was admitted by the appellants\u2019 counsel in the argument, .which 'was perfectly consistent with the true meaning and spirit of the law. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">2. As to the second objection, <em>that, </em>at first view, seemed to have been of more consequence; but, on due consideration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>'that also seems to be unavailing. The first institution of this society, which, as was generally supposed, would be of great convenience and utility to the community at large, was a mere matter of experiment, and which must probably <em>1 </em>\u2019 1 . <em>J </em>undergo such changes and modifications as experience should point out, in order to make it more equal and extensively useful to the community. In contemplation, then, of these circumstances, the Legislature, in the act that established and incorporated the society, provided by a special clause for the purpose, that \u201c the society, or a majority of them, \u201c shall be at liberty, from time to time, to <em>alter and amend </em>\u201c the <em>rules and regulations </em>as they may judge necessary.\u201d So with respect to the Constitution of the <em>United </em>States, which was composed by the collected wisdom of the whole, union, <em>after long </em>deliberation it tvas found on experience to be defective, and to require sundry amendments, which have been already made ; and it is not yet, perhaps, quite perfect, which is the inevitable fate of all human institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Of these circumstances Doctor <em>Currie </em>was fully apprized when he subscribed, and became a member of the society ; and therefore bad no just ground of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">A few years\u2019 experience taught the society that, under the original constitution, the risk was very unequal between the town and country subscribers, in favour of the former; and therefore it became necessary, in order to do justice to both classes, to separate their interests, as there was much more danger to the town than to the country houses, and therefore, on the principle of equality and reciprocity, a majority of the society, on a representation to the legislature, procured an act of Assembly, passed the 29th January, 1805, in which it is declared, that \u201c all premiums and quotas, in fu\u00ab \u201c ture, for the assurance of houses'in towns, shall be applied to \u201c the payment of losses sustained by the burning of houses in u towns, <em>and none other. </em>And <em>vice versa </em>respecting losses, \u201c by the burning of houses in the country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">But it is objected that this regulation is not binding, because every individual member of the society was not con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>suited nor assenting to the regulation. It would be misspending time to refute this argument, as in all institutions of this kind, the acts of a majority are binding on the whole: , % by 'th\u00e9&gt;civil law that majority must consist of two-thirds of <em>1 </em>J r . . , , , the members. And the appellants\u2019 principal had the less. reason to complain, as he was, by the 13th section of the same act, at full' liberty to withdraw from the society, on giving six weeks previous notice, and paying all arrearages due at the time of withdrawing.</p>\n<p id=\"AxC\">As to the right of the assembly to alter the charter, I will just observe that it was, in effect, done by the society itself: who in order to give it more validity, did it under the sanction df a\u2018 legislative act, the same authority by which the institution was established j and I shall only subjoin a very correct note in <em>Tucker's Blackstone, on </em>the subject. That \u2018\u2018 no corporation has been created in Virginia, since \u201c the revolution, but by an act of the Legislature; their pow- \u201c ers and privileges must therefore, depend wholly on the rt act Of Assembly by which they are first established, or \u201c such as have been afterwards made, for the special pur- \u201c pose of <em>limiting </em>or <em>enlarging </em>their <em>privileges </em>respectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVL\">I, upon the whole, concur in the opinion, that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b363-11\"><em> Virginia, Bill of Right </em>art. 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
