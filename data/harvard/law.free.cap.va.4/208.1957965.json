The Court overruled the motion ; being of opinion that the securities, unc}er the different acts of assembly concerning sheriffs, and the collection of the public revenue, were bound for1 the due collection and payment of the taxes for the year , 180o OTlly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A40J\"><em>^le Attorney General, </em>for the Commonwealth, contendec]</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVMn\">that the condition of the bond being that <em>White </em>should faithfully collect, account for, and pay the taxes imposed . .* , ~ by law, in his County, <em>during his continuance in </em>ojjice, was broad enough to cover all the transactions of the sherifF while he acted in that capacity. By the 6th section of the act of 1792,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> every person commissioned and qualified as sheriff, <em>shall </em>be continued in office one year after his qualification, and <em>may, </em>with his own consent, and the approbation of the executive, be continued for two years, and no longer, unless, by. some accident or impediment, a succeeding sheriff shall be prevented from qualifying, in which case the preceding sheriff <em>shall continue to </em>act, till a successor he duly qualified. The uniform practice has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>been to consider the securities bound, during the sheriff\u2019s continuance in office.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-4\">Wickham, for the appellees, argued,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1a\">that the law evidently contemplated the <em>annual </em>appointment of a sheriff, and the duration of his office for one year only ; though, with his own consent, and the approbation of the executive, he may be continued for two years. The continuance of the sheriff for the second year must depend upon some act of the executive; they must express their approbation by granting him a new commission. Though the word <em>continue </em>be equivocal, yet its obvious meaning, connected with the other parts of the law, is, that the sheriff must be reappointed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-5\">Analogous to the appointment of a sheriff, is that of the governor; who may <em>continue </em>in office for <em>three </em>years, but he must be <em>annually </em>appointed. So, a sheriff, under the first section of the law,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> must be <em>annually </em>recommended, and, of course, ought to be <em>annually </em>appointed. By giving the law this construction, every part will be consistent. The latter part of the 6th section, which is relied on by <em>the Attorney </em>General, applies only to cases where the sheriff had been duly reappointed, and acted for two years, and, by some impediment, a successor had not been qualified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-6\">The words \u201c <em>during his continuance in office\u201d </em>inserted in the bond, if not required by law, cannot be extended to charge the securities beyond the legal term of the sheriffalty. But, if my construction be correct, the office continued for one year only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-7\">The Legislature, no doubt, contemplated the renewal of the bond every year; because, from the defalcations of the sheriff, one set of securities might be very inadequate. Besides, a man might be willing to be security for <em>one </em>year, who would not agree to be bound for two.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b224-27\"><em> l Rev. </em>Code, c. 80. p. 120.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b225-13\"> <em>1 Rev.

Consequently the main question is, for what period was Mr. <em>White </em>appointed sheriff, by that commission; since the undertaking of the securities for his due collection of the taxes, must be understood as commensurate with the duration of his commission, as a collector of the revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"Aah\">From an attentive perusal of the several acts on this subject, I feel no doubt, that, according to the true intent and meaning of the law, sheriffs must be <em>annually </em>nominated by the County Courts; must be <em>annually </em>commissioned <em>by </em>the Governor; and must <em>annually </em>give bond for the faithful collection of all taxes imposed by law in their County, and which may become due at any time during the period of one year thereafter; provided the sheriff lives until the 31st of December, next after such appointment, &amp;c. Because, if he lives till that day, his deputies may collect the taxes in the same manner as if he had lived.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The undertaking of the securities to this bond must therefore, I conceive, be understood as going no further than for the faithful collecting and paying the taxes for the year 1805 only; and consequently that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b226-12\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"A0h\">By the act of 1702, c. SO. the County Courts are to make <em>annual </em>nominations of sheriffs. This provision, as well as the positive limitation of the duration of the office contained in the 6th section, determines the duration of the office to be for one year only; and the eft<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>feet of the bond can only be commensurate therewith. In the event of the same person being <em>continued </em>sheriff a second year, which can only be, if he is again <em>nominated </em>by the County Court, it is to be considered as a <em>nerw </em>appointment. The terms \u201c approved\u201d and \u201c continue,\u201d used in the 6th section in relation to a <em>second </em>appointment, are precisely those used in the 1st and 6th sections in relation to an original appointment: Nothing, therefore, can be inferred from those expressions to shew that a second appointment, or a continuance in office for a second year, does not stand precisely on the footing of an original one. The sum provided in the act as the penalty of the bond, is supposed to be ample enough feu- a <em>single </em>year, and even for a short time longer in the event of a succeeding sheriff\u2019 being prevented by accident from qualifying ; but it may not be sufficient to cover also a second year ; and no construction of the act can be made to extend the bond to apply to a second year, which would not equally hold if the sheriff were permitted to act for twenty years, which, in that case, would surely be unreasonable, The case at bar differs from that only in degree. On the whole, I am of opinion, that there ought to be an annual nomination, appointment, and bond. The expression in the bond \u201c during the con-<em>u </em>tinuance in office,\u201d must clearly have reference to the actual duration of the office by virtue of the appointment under which the bond was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">My opinion is, that the judgment be affirmed,</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Judge Fleming concurring;\u2014by the whole Court the judgment of the General Court affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\"> Rev.
