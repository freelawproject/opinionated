The policy was a covenant under the seal of the society. Some years after the policy was effected, <em>Harrison </em>died, and <em>Samuel Christian </em>took letters of administration of his estate, and gave an administration bond, in which <em>Donald M\u2019Kenzie </em>and <em>John Osborne </em>were bound as his sureties. Afterwards, in March 1819, the house was destroyed by fire ; and the sum of 439 dollars, the net estimated loss, was paid by the society to <em>Christian </em>the administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-8\">Upon a bill exhibited in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Richmond, </em>by <em>Harrison\u2019s </em>children and distributees against <em>Christian </em>the administrator and <em>M\u2019Kenzie </em>and <em>Osborne </em>his sureties, praying a settlement of <em>Christian\u2019s </em>accounts of administration, and a decree against him and his sureties for the balance which should be found due from him to his intestate\u2019s estate,\u2014the main question was, whether the money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>due from the Mutual Assurance Society upon the policy, and received hy Christian, belonged of right to him as the administrator of <em>Harrison, </em>or to <em>Harrison\u2019s </em>heirs ? If it belonged to <em>Christian </em>as the administrator of the assured, tjjen ^\u00a1g suretjes in the administration bond were responsible to the distributees, for his due administration thereof; if it belonged to the heirs of the assured, the sureties of the administrator were nowise bound for it to the heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ako\">The chancellor was of opinion, that the money due on the policy of assurance belonged to the heirs of the assured, not to his administrator; and that, consequently, the sureties of the administrator were nowise responsible for and it appearing by the accounts of <em>Christian\u2019s </em>administrationjthat there were no other moneys due from the administrator, for which his sureties could be held responsible to the distributees, he dismissed the bill as to the sureties. The <em>Harrisons </em>applied by petition to this court, for an appeal from the decree; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-5\"><em>Spooner, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-6\">No counsel for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AcC\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A64E\">The appeal being from the dismission of the bill as to the sureties, and nothing more, <em>Christian </em>is out of the case here. As to the insurance money: the house, it is true, was insured by mistake, as leasehold property. The title of the assured was in fact a fee simple. The policy was, therefore, a covenant for the protection of real estate, though it was by mistake described as a term of years renewable forever. The covenant followed the title to the property, and on the death of <em>Harrison, </em>the assured, devolved to his heirs, for they are expressly named in the policy. The Mutual Assurance Society covenanted to <em>Harrison, </em>his heirs &amp;c. and he bound himself, his heirs Sic. to the society. This covenant being broken after <em>Harrison\u2019s </em>death, the right to the insurance money was in his heirs, The administrator <em>Christian </em>having received what belonged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>to the <em>heirs, </em>he is debtor for the amount to <em>them, </em>not to <em>his intestate's estate. </em>; Therefore, the sureties bound in his administration bond are nowise responsible for it. On this point, this court approves the chancellor\u2019s decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The decree was, however, reversed upon some trivial points of mere detail in the report of the administration account in regard to which exceptions had been taken by the appellants, and overruled by the court; and the cause was remanded with directions in relation thereto.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
