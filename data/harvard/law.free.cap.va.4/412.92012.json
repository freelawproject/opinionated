He took the question to be, whether the defects of the avowry were cured by the statute of <em>jeofails, </em>1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 103. p. 512. which after very strong provisions for curing defects after verdict (provisions which, be admitted, would cure the defects of the avowry here, if they were applicable to the case) provided, that \u201c neither shall any judgement, entered by <em>nil dicit </em>or <em>non sum informatus </em>be reversed, nor a judgement <em>after inquiry of damages </em>be stayed or reversed, for any omission or fault, which would not have been a good cause to stay or reverse the judgement if there had been a verdict.\u201d Now, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>a judgement by <em>nil dicit </em>was, where a party appears, but does not plead ; and a judgement by <em>non sum informatus </em>was, where a party appears by his attorney, but the attorney says he is not informed of any <em>answer; </em>but here the plaintiff -n <em>repiev{n} </em>after fj\u00a1\u00a1ng his declaration, and after avowry <em>by </em>the defendant, made default and was nonsuit. It had often been decided by this court, that the statute of <em>jeofails </em>did not apply to cases of judgement <em>by default; </em>and in <em>Roe v.' Baker, </em>in which the defendant appeared and obtained two continuances, without putting in a plea, and the cause was tried between the parties, both appearing, as if there had been a plea, and verdict and judgement rendered for the plaintiff, the court held, that this was a judgement <em>by default, </em>and that, therefore, the statute of <em>jeofails </em>had no application to the case, and reversed the judgement for defects in the declaration.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And as to the circumstance of the judgement in the present case being a judgement <em>after inquiry of damages, </em>he said, the directing that inquiry was itself a palpable error. The english statutes, respecting the course \u00f3f proceeding and the judgement in case the plaintiff in <em>replevin </em>be nonsuit, not being in force here, and there being no similar statutory provisions of our own in existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>when this suit was brought, the proceedings and judgement should have been according to the course of the common law; and according to the common law, the only judgement that could have been given, was a judgement awarding a return of the goods distrained to the defendant, to be irreplevisable in future. 1 Esp.

The avowry in this case, therefore, very properly, only demanded judgement for a return of the goods to the avowant. It was very obvious, that the proceedings after the nonsuit of the plaintiff, the award of the writ of inquiry, and the judgement of the court, were moulded upon the statute of February 1823; but that statute could give no warrant for such proceedings, because, 1. the statute was enacted after this suit was commenced ; and 2. the statute applies only to actions of <em>replevin </em>brought by a person other than the tenant, to recover his own goods improperly distrained for rent due from the tenant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-5\"><em>Scott, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI3\">argued, that the statute of February 1823, though it was enacted after the action was brought, was properly resorted to by the court, as a rule for its proceedings, and well warranted the writ of inquiry and the judgement, both of which were subsequent to the enactment; and if not, yet, that the statute of <em>jeofails </em>was applicable to the case, and cured all defects in the avowry.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-4\">In order to understand the disputed points of practice in this case, it is proper to mention, that none of the engiish statutes on the subject were in force in <em>Virginia </em>at the time this action was commenced. The statutes of 7 Hen. 8. ch. 4. and 31 Hen. 8. ch. 19. providing that the avowant, in replevin, for rent, if the plaintiff be barred, shall recover damages and costs, had been repealed; and neither the statute of 17 Car. 2 ch. 7. directing the proceedings and judgement in <em>replevin, </em>in case the plaintiff be nonsuit, or judgement be <em>given </em>for the avowant on demurrer, nor the statute of 11 Geo. 2. ch. 19. simplifying the form of the avowry or conusance in <em>replevin, </em>were ever in force in <em>Virginia; </em>nor had we any similar statutory provisions. The only statute, varying the proceedings and judgement in <em>replevin, </em>from the course of the common law, was the provision in the statute of rents, 1 Eev. Code, ch. 113. \u00a7 23. p. 451. requiring bond and surety of the plaintiff, before Buing out the writ, to perform and satisfy the judgement of the court, in case he shall be cast; and providing, that \u201c if upon the trial of the suit, it shall be found that the rent distrained for was justly due, the party injured or delayed by suing forth the writ, shall recover, against the party suing forth and prosecuting the same, double the value of the rent in arrear and distrained for, with full costs of suit.\u201d But after this suit was brought, namely in February 1823, a statute was enacted, whereby it was provided, that in all cases where property dis-trained or attached for rent, shall be claimed by any other person or persons than the tenant or tenants, it shall be lawful for the said person or persons to sue out his or their writ of <em>replevin, </em>directed to the sheriff; and upon the execution of a bond by the person or persons suing out the writ, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>with one or more sufficient .securities, in double the amount of the value of the said property, to be ascertained by two disinterested freeholders, to be sworn before some justice of the peace, and conditioned to perform and satisfy the judgement of the court in such suit, in case he or they shall be cast therein, such sheriff shall proceed to execute and return such writ, as heretofore; and the jury that shall try the issue in such cause, shall also inquire of' the value of the property, and of the damages sustained by the, avowant, by occasion of the suing out the said writ, which in no case shall be less than the value of <em>ten per centum </em>upon such value; and judgement shall be accordingly rendered, if the plaintiff be barred, for the value so ascertained, with interest from the date of the writ, and the damages and costs. And if the plaintiff be nonsuit before issue joined, the court, upon the suggestion of the defendant, in the nature of an avowry, shall award a writ to inquire of the value and damages as aforesaid, which shall be ascertained by the jury, and judgement shall be given accord<em>ingly.\u201d\u2014\u201c </em>And that so much of the twenty-fourth section of the aforesaid act, to which this is an amendment, as subjects the party suing out the writ of <em>replevin </em>to the penalty of double the value of the rent in arrear, and distrained for, if he shall be cast in th\u00ae suit, shall be, and the same is hereby repealed.\u201d Sess.

It was a suit brought by <em>Baker </em>against <em>Roe </em>upon an award. The declaration was, in many respects, fatally defective and faulty; this was admitted on all hands, and indeed was too apparent to be denied; and the only question was, whether the defects were cured by the statute of <em>jeofails? </em>The defendant had appeared at one term, moved for, and obtained a continuance; appeared again at the next term, and obtained another continuance; and then at the third term, both parties appeared and went to trial, exactly as if the defendant had pleaded, and an issue had been regularly made up, though, in fact, he had never put in any plea; and there was a verdict for the plaintiff, on which the court gave him judgement. This court held that this was not a judgement by <em>nil dicit, </em>or <em>non sum informatus, </em>or <em>on inquiry of damages, </em>but a judgement by <em>default, </em>to 'which the statute of <em>jeofails </em>was not applicable, and, therefore, reversed the judgement for the defects of the declaration: <em>dissentiente Green, </em>J. who (as the reporter well remembers) held, that the statute of <em>jeofails </em>was applicable in cases of judgements <em>ly default; </em>a proposition which the counsel for the defendant in error had earnestly endeavoured to maintain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b441-11\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"Aluz\">At common law, in the action of <em>replevin, </em>after issue joined, both parties are plaintiffs, and therefore the plaintiff cannot suffer a nonsuit. <em>Eggleton </em>v. <em>Smart, </em>1 W.

But, before issue joined, he is the only plaintiff; and he might therefore have suffered a nonsuit, and terminated the whole process. But when he did so, the judgement was not merely that he take nothing by his bill, as in other cases of nonsuit: for having, by his <em>replevin, </em>got what he principally wanted, that is, his goods, and then abandoned the process instituted to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>his right to them, it was right he should be compelled to re- , turn them. Hence* the judgement, in case of nonsuit in <em>replevin, </em>went on to. award that the defendant should have a return of the goods and chattels; Tidd\u2019s Pract. Forms, p. <em>^QQ' </em>'Auci ,this was equally the case whether the nonsuit was before or after avowry, as where it was for want of a declaration; Id. 586. If then the case at bar stood unaffected by any statute, the court ought to have given a mere judgement for a return of the goods, when the plaintiff suffered a nonsuit; and whether there was a good or bad avowry filed, or whether an avowry was filed or not, the judgement must have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"A4vp\">In <em>England, </em>however, the common law has been modified by several statutes. Those passed in the reign of Henry 8. gave to the avowant damages for the vexatious <em>replevin, </em>either in case of judgement against the plaintiff upon demurrer on a nonsuit, or in case the jury found for the avowant; in which last case, the same jury might assess the damages; but if they failed to do so, a writ of inquiry might be awarded ; and, in the two first cases, the avowant was always entitled to his writ of inquiry. 1 Wms. Saund. 195. c. in note. An extract from the statutes is to be found in the same note. They are, I presume, not in force at this time in <em>Virginia. </em>Next came the statute 17 Car. 2. the provisions of which may be found in the same note. But this statute never was in force with us, nor was the statute 11 Geo. 2. ch. 19. \u00a7 22. dispensing with the necessity of regularly setting out in the- avowry the title of the lessor or landlord ; 2 Id. 284. c. But though the statute of 17 Car. 2. was never in force, yet we have long had a provision in our statute book making a great innovation in the common law: it will be found in the statute of 1769, ch. 4. 8 Hen. Stat. at Large 382, 3. and in the Old Rev. Code, Pleasants\u2019s edi. ch. 89. &lt;\u00a7&gt; 15. and 1 Rev. Code, ch. 113. &lt;\u00a7&gt; 23. p. 451. and it was the law of the land at the time of the commencement of this suit. By this statute it is provided, that \u201c if upon the trial of the suit, it be found that the rent distrained for was justly due, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>party injured or delayed'by suing forth the writ of <em>replevin, </em>shall recover against the party suing forth and prosecuting the same, double the value of the rent distrained for, and full costs.\u201d Yet, though this statute devolves upon the landlord a right to double rent, it makes no particular provisions for the mode in which the party is to proceed. It leaves the courts to mould the remedy to the right, or, what is much better, to follow the established course of proceeding in analogous cases at common law, or cases under analogous english statutes. It is to be wished, I think, that this court had pursued the latter course in <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Light, </em>1 Call 117. instead of the practice established in that case, which seems to me both anomalous and inconvenient. Be this as it may, that case respected a trial where an issue had been made up between the parties: our concern is with the case of a nonsuit after avowry.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">That the right of the landlord to a judgement for double rent, was confined to the case of an issue made up and trial thereof between the parties, and did not extend to a judgement in case of nonsuit or upon demurrer, does not seem to be a reasonable construction. The double damages were given as a satisfaction for the delay and injury of suing forth the writ, and the wrong is enhanced where the proceeding has been so frivolous, that the plaintiff himself has abandoned his pretensions. Upon nonsuit, therefore, or upon demurrer, 1 think the avowant is entitled to double rent if it shall .appear that the rent distrained for was justly due. But how is that fact to be ascertained ? I answer by a writ of inquiry. And how is the inquiry to be presented to the jury, where the plaintiff has suffered a nonsuit before the pleadings are made up ? I answer, by filing a suggestion in the nature of an avowry. Now, this is precisely the course which was pursued under the statutes of Hen. 8. Those statutes gave the landlord a right to damages, but they said not a word as to the mode in which the party was to get at them. The courts therefore decided, that these damages were to be ascertained by writ of inquiry; 1 ffms. Saund, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>195. c. in note; 6 Bac. Abr. Replevin and Avowry. L. pp. 84, 6. 14 Petersd. Abr. 280. Lord <em>Rardxoiclce </em>seems, indeed, to have laid down a very broad and proper principle, that in every case where it may be necessary for the purpoge jjgjHg comp]ete justice, a writ of inquiry may be granted; with the exception of the case of a jury failing to inquire of the rent in arrear under the statute of Charles, which in strong language, seems to tie up the inquiry to the jury impanneled to try the issue. But the courts also decided, under the same statutes, although they contain not a syllable about a suggestion, that if the landlord would, in the case of nonsuit, entitle himself to damages within the statutes, he must make a cognizance or avowry, or a suggestion <em>pro retorno habendo; </em>1 Wms. Saund. 195. e.</p>\n<p id=\"A9X\">From these analogies, I am of opinion, that where the landlord chooses to avail himself of the statute, he must in case of nonsuit before issue joined, file a suggestion in the nature of an avowry, and thereupon a writ of inquiry must be awarded to inquire of the value of the rent in arrear. He may, however, waive the statute, and take the common law judgement <em>de retorno habendo, </em>since the statute only adds to his remedy. 1 Wms. Saund. 195. c; <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>3 T. R. 349.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahc\">In this case, the parties have been supposed to have proceeded under the statute of February 1823. That statute cannot apply to an action brought before its commencement. For though, at first view, it may seem to affect the remedy only, it in fact most materially acts upon the rights of the parties. When the lessee brought this suit, the landlord under the statute then existing, immediately became entitled to recover double rent, if the distress was found rightful. The statute of 1823 takes away the double rent, and gives in lieu of it, damages not less than <em>ten per cent. </em>It goes then to the right, and not merely to the remedy, ar.d is obviously not binding upon the rights of the landlord. But if <em>not </em>in force as to the landlord, it cannot be in force as to the tenant. If it is law for one, it is law for the other. I <em>consi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>der it therefore as not applying to this case. But I am not satisfied, that the proceeding is not perfectly reconcileable with the previous statute. By it, a writ of inquiry is rendered necessary for ascertaining whether the rent distrained for was justly due and in arrear. Now, that is the inquiry directed here, in effect; and the jury have found 120 dollars of rent in arrear, which is the amount avowed for. Upon this verdict, the landlord might have demanded judgement for double rent; but by his consent, judgement was entered for the rent in arrear with interest at <em>six per centum </em>only: thus waiving the heavy penalty which the law entitled him to insist on.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">It is contended, however, that the avowry is bad, according to the decision of <em>Southall </em>v. Garner, 2 Leigh 372. in which it is declared that as the statute of 11 Geo. 2. ch. 19. \u00a7 22. is not in force in <em>Virginia, </em>the old common law strictness, as to setting forth the avowant\u2019s title in the avowry, must be adhered to. Admitting this doctrine in its fullest extent, in its application to an avowry upon which an issue in fact or in law is made up, 1 do not think it can apply to a mere suggestion after a nonsuit, of which character the avowry in this case must be considered, as the plaintiff neither demurred nor pleaded to it. Where the parties go to issue upon the <em>right </em>of distress, there is more reason to demand that the title out of which the right grows, should be distinctly stated. But, in the case of a nonsuit, the plaintiff waives the contest, and acknowledges the right; and the writ of inquiry is only to ascertain the quantum of the demand. This is the general character of a writ of inquiry. See the cases collected 10 Petersd. Abr. 654. &amp; seq. The suggestion, therefore, in this case, would seem sufficient. Why insert the title in detail, when the tenant cannot contest or traverse it in this stage of the proceeding. The landlord, indeed, must prove the lease, and the rent due; and the tenant is at liberty to controvert its being in arrear, by proving payments; but I apprehend he can no more plead in this case to the suggestion, than he could plead to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the suggestion of breaches after a judgement by default in debt on bond with collateral condition. See <em>Bullythorpe </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>Willes 435. <em>Foot\u2019s </em>case, 1 Salk. 93. 14 Petersd. 268. in note. 1 Wms. Saund. 58. note 1. Upon looking jnt0 t[ie forms 0f these suggestions, I incline to think, they were much more general than avowries, even before the statute of 11 Geo. 2. ch. 19. See Tidd\u2019s Pract. Forms 586. which I take to be under the statute of Charles 2. and not of George 2. That is quite general.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Upon the whole, I am therefore for affirming the judgement, without thinking it necessary to resort to the statute of <em>jeofails </em>to sustain the avowry or suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Cabell, J. The statute of <em>jeofails </em>declares, that no judgement entered by <em>nil \u00bflicit, or non sum informatus, </em>shall be reversed, nor shall a judgement after inquiry of damages be stayed dr reversed, for any omission or fault which would not have been a good cause to stay or reverse the judgement, if there had been a verdict. I have never considered this statute as embracing any case of judgements <em>by default for want of appearance; </em>whether those judgements <em>be final, </em>as in <em>case of office </em>judgements confirmed in actions on bonds, bills or notes; or merely <em>interlocutory, </em>and afterwards completed by writ of inquiry of damages, as in actions on the case. That it does not extend to the former class of cases, is manifest from <em>Nadenbush v. Lane, </em>4 Rand. 413. If this were not so, the plaintiff might bring his action on a bond for 100 dollars, which the defendant, knowing it to be just, might fail to defend, in the full confidence that no judgement could be rendered, which the bond would not justify; and then the plaintiff might file his declaration on a bond, forged or paid, for ten times the amount, and recover a judgement which would be irreversible. I think it equally clear, that the statute does not apply to cases of judgements after writs of inquiry, where the writs of inquiry have been awarded <em>on default for want of appearance. </em>The principle is precisely the same in both cases, and it applies more <em>ford</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>hly to the latter than to the former; for in the latter, the plaintiff may, in his declaration, not only enlarge the amount claimed in his writ, but he may change the form of action altogether. He may bring his action on an uncontested account, and may then file his declaration, and go before the jury, for slander or assault and battery. But the statute expressly embraces judgements by <em>nil dicit </em>and <em>non sum informatics; </em>which judgements, we know, are never rendered except where the party has previously appeared : and the parly having once appeared, it is his own folly not to see that every thing is correct, or to abandon the case before it is ended. The statute also embraces, in terms, judgements <em>after inquiry of damages. </em>But although these words are general, I do not think they were intended to have a universal application. I think they were intended to apply only to those cases, where, as in the cases of judgements by <em>nil dicit </em>and <em>non sum in* formatus, </em>there has been a previous appearance by the party. But even this restricted application of the statute is sufficient to embrace the case before us; for here the party had appeared. Therefore, I am of opinion to affirm the judgement.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b447-8\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A9q\"><em>I </em>am of opinion that this judgement should be affirmed. I concur in the opinion of the president generally. There is one point, however, taken by him, which I have not so carefully examined, as to justify a decided opinion upon it; such examination not being necessary to a decision of the case, in my view of it. That point is, whether the statute of February 1823 embraces the case? There is another point, too, on which the president has not given an opinion, which I must think a strong one in support of the judgement; that is, the statute <em>o\u00ed jeofails. </em>This, it must be observed, is not a case where there has been no appearance, and where the defendant may be considered wholly ignorant of the proceeding; on the contrary, he was the original actor; he sued out the writ of <em>replevin, </em>and thereby got possession of the goods distrained, and put the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>landlord to his avowry. After this, he can by no means (Ithink) claim the exemption extended to one supposed to be wholly <em>uninformed of </em>the action. He <em>comes </em>within the meaning, as well as the letter of the statute. But it was unjess y0U apply the statute of February 1823 to this case, there should have been no writ of inquiry, and then the case would not have been within the statute of <em>jeofails. </em>The reasons given by the president answer this objection, and shew to my mind, that without the aid of the statute of 1823, the writ of inquiry was proper. It was said, that it was the settled law of this court, that the statute of <em>jeofails </em>does not extend to a case like this. I have considered the court as saying (in perhaps more than one case) that where there has been <em>no appearance </em>at all by the defendant, the statute does not embrace the case. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Baker </em>was cited; aijd the record does certainly shew, though there had been no regular appearance, the defendant had in fact been in court so far as to obtain one or more continuances. I have no recollection of the argument, <em>of the conferences, </em>or the particular opinions of the court; I cannot therefore think that it was a case much argued or examined, by the bar or bench; or that we meant to settle the practice by it. I have looked in vain among my papers for a note of the argument, or my own remarks. It is, therefore, a naked decision, which, however I may have then decided, I must confess seems to me <em>now </em>to have been directly within the statute of <em>jeofails. </em>I have always thought, that (however we, in our private judgement, might suppose the legislature had covered too much ground by that statute) we were bound, nevertheless, to administer it, according to the spirit in which it was passed, and extend its provisions to every case, within the view of the law makers.</p>\n<p id=\"AVlb\">Tucker, <em>P. </em>then said, he concurred with the other judges, that the case was within the provisions of the statute of <em>jeofails.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADf\">Judgement affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
