Gd. per </em>hundred) was less by more than a third than the quantity charged in <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills, and he doubted not there were other errors in the bills : that <em>Patillo </em>had since applied to <em>Lee, </em>to unite with him in appointing two persons to measure the work, and ascertain the quantity of timber used therein ; but <em>Lee </em>refused to do so ; sometimes denying his promise at the time <em>Patillo </em>gave his bond, to correct errors of this kind, and alleging that this matter had been settled by the arbitrators; and sometimes alleging, that it was impossible for any persons now to ascertain the quantity of timber used and of work done : that <em>Patillo </em>had made sundry payments in part discharge of his bond to <em>Lee; </em>and that <em>Lee </em>had brought suit on the bond, and recovered judgement for the balance due thereon. Therefore, the bill prayed an injunction to restrain <em>Lee </em>from further proceedings on his judgement at law; and that the quantity of timber used and work done by <em>Lee </em>should be ascertained, and credit allowed <em>Patillo </em>for any overcharge in <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\"><em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills for the work done, with the prices extended by the arbitrators, and the award of the arbitrators at the foot thereof, were exhibited with the bill. The award was in these words : \u201c We <em>T. Legrajfenreidt, W. Tisdale </em>and <em>W. Parrotte, </em>as arbitrators upon the bills and vouchers produced, have settled it up agreeably to our judgements this 15th August 1818,\u201d\u2014signed by the arbitrators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-6\"><em>Lee, </em>in his answer, stated, that the work done by him for <em>Patillo, </em>and the particulars thereof, appeared in his bills for the same, now exhibited by <em>Patillo: </em>that it was not true that the submission to arbitration was confined to the <em>prices,\u25a0 </em>it was made for the purpose of settling the whole matter in dispute relative to the work, and the arbitrators did actually settle the whole matter; <em>Degraffenreidt </em>and <em>Tisdale </em>went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>to the house, viewed the work, compared it with <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills, and chose <em>Parrotte </em>as their umpire; and these three made the award : that <em>Patillo </em>did not execute his bond to <em>Lee, on the terms mentioned in the hill; </em>on the contrary, <em>Patillo </em>proposed to give his bond, about which <em>Lee </em>was indifferent, as he held the bills for the work and the arbitration ; but, at <em>Patillo\u2019s </em>request, he received the bond, as a full and complete settlement, and gave up the bills and the award, which he would not have done if he had considered the matter still unsettled: that after the bond was executed, <em>Patillo </em>said, <em>jestingly, </em>that he would be glad for his own satisfaction, to have the work accurately measured, to which <em>Lee </em>answered that he might for his own satisfaction get it done if he could ; but <em>Lee </em>never promised to do it himself, nor did he intimate, before or after the execution of the bond, that he would unsettle the award or bond again : that <em>Patillo, </em>sometime afterwards applied to <em>Lee </em>to have a remeasurement of the work and timber, to which <em>Lee </em>answered he would never refuse any thing that was right; and the same request to have the work remeasured, being repeated by <em>Patillo, </em>he told him, he had often declined, and then positively refused, to do so : that he considered himself no wise bound to measure the work now: and he insisted, that the award, and the bond given by <em>Patillo </em>was a complete settlement; but, he averred, his bills for the timber and work were accurate as to the quantity, and went into the particulars to shew that they were so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-9\">The <em>affidavits </em>of several witnesses were taken and filed by the parties, to the following effect:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-10\">1. <em>Thomas Lee </em>deposed (in two affidavits) that he was present at a conversation between the parties in the summer of 1820 [after <em>Lee </em>had brought suit on <em>Patillo\u2019s </em>bond] in which <em>Lee </em>agreed, that when <em>Patillo </em>gave him the bond, he required that the calculations of the quantities of materials and work should still be made, to which <em>Lee </em>answered he was willing to any thing that was right; but though <em>Lee </em>admitted that this conversation had passed, he added, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>he did not think, then or now, that it was right to remeasure the work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-4\">2. Two carpenters, <em>Hannah </em>and <em>Perry, </em>deposed, that they had carefully examined and measured the work which was shewn them by <em>Patilio (Lee </em>not being present) and ascertained the quantity of timber in the <em>whole </em>work to be 25,922 feet. <em>(Lee's </em>bills on which the award was founded, stated the quantity to be 33,194 feet.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\">3. <em>Degraffenreidt, </em>one of the arbitrators deposed, that he and <em>Tisdale, </em>after undertaking the arbitration, separately viewed the work, in order to see the manner in which it was executed : that they afterwards met to make the arbitration and named <em>Parrotte </em>for their umpire <em>(Lee </em>being present, <em>Patilio </em>not) : that they took the bills of the work done by <em>Lee, </em>as furnished by him, and extended the <em>prices, </em>without entering into any calculations of the quantity of work or materials, <em>Degraffenreidt </em>and <em>Tisdale </em>not having seen it together, and <em>Parrotte </em>the umpire having never seen it at all: that <em>Patilio </em>had requested that a calculation should be made of the quantity of materials and work, expressing his opinion that there were considerable errors in this respect; but as <em>Degraffenreidt </em>declined this service, and understood that <em>Tisdale </em>had done so likewise, he considered that the <em>prices alone </em>were submitted to arbitration, and the arbitrators acted only on the <em>prices: </em>that <em>Degraffenreidt's </em>own price for hewing and sawing was <em>six shillings per hundred, </em>and he had done some at 5 dollars <em>per thousand. </em>(In the arbitration, <em>Lee </em>was allowed 8s. <em>dd. per hundred.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">4. The arbitrator <em>Tisdale </em>deposed, that <em>Lee's </em>work was done in a workmanlike manner : that he and the other arbitrator were called upon to settle the <em>prices; </em>but he considered, that the arbitration was to be a final settlement between the parties, and that a calculation as to the quantity of materials used in the work was part of the business of the arbitration, because <em>Lee </em>furnished them with a bill of the <em>work, </em>which bill was not disputed by <em>Patilio: </em>and he deposed that his price for hewing and sawing was <em>7s. 6d. per hundred.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Axg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>5. There were two depositions of <em>P. Endaly, </em>taken to prove an overcharge in <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills as to the quantity of wlagonage in haling the timber. His statements were very confused, and somewhat contradictory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">6. There were depositions, as to the usual mode of measuring such work in that part of the country; and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">7. Depositions, taken to prove that timbers cannot be accurately measured after they are worked up in a house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-7\">In this state of the evidence the cause was set down for hearing in the county court, February 1822; but it was not heard till June term 1824, when on <em>Patillo\u2019s </em>motion, the county court gave him leave to file</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">An amended bill, in which <em>Patillo </em>charged the arbitrators and the umpire, or a majority of them with partiality and corruption, and founded the charge upon their depositions: for that, 1st, the arbitrators took <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills as to the quantity of work and materials, without any calculation of their own or measurement: 2ndly, that, though they had set lower prices on some of the smaller items than <em>Lee </em>had charged, they had allowed on the heaviest items higher prices than he claimed ; and on the heaviest item of all (the charge for hewing and sawing 33,194 feet of timber) they had allowed <em>Lee </em>8s. <em>6d. per hundred, </em>when according to <em>Eegrajfenreidt\u2019s </em>deposition, his own highest charge for such work was only 6s. and according to <em>Tisdale\u2019s, </em>his rate of charge was but 7s. <em>6d. </em>and when even <em>Lee\u2019s </em>charge was but 7s. <em>6d. </em>in a bill rendered to <em>Patillo, </em>which he had handed to the arbitrators : 3rdly, that <em>Lee, </em>in a lumping charge for certain parts of the work, had charged 200 dollars, but the arbitrators had allowed him 380 dollars; and they had moreover made him an allowance of 30 dollars \u201c for work not mentioned in <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AzY\"><em>Lee </em>put in his answer to the amended bill at the same term, stating that the arbitrators did measure the work, and insisting that their conduct in fixing the prices, was impartial, fair and just.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>And on the same day on which he put in his answer, he , , ....... ... . moved the court to dissolve the injunction; which motion the court overruled, because the answer to the amended bill had not been filed till that day. Whereupon <em>Lee </em>presented a petition to the superiour court of chancery, praying an appeal from the order of the county court overruling the motion to dissolve the injunction ; which was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\">In the superiour court of chancery, in October 1825, the motion to dissolve the injunction was renewed ; but the chancellor overruled it, and ordered the injunction to stand till the hearing; and, at the same time, by the consent of the parties, he appointed three persons to measure the work done by <em>Lee </em>for Patillo, to fix the prices thereof, and to settle all other matters in relation thereto, and make report of the same to the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-8\">The commissioners made a long report of their proceedings in execution of the order; shewing the manner in which they had measured and ascertained the quantities of timber and of work done, and settled the prices, with all the details. It appeared by their measurement, that the quantity of timber hewed and sawed by <em>Lee, </em>was 26,497 feet, instead of 33,194 feet charged in <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills on which the arbitrators acted, and that there were several other overcharges in those bills. And the result was, that <em>Patillo </em>had, already, as early as the 7th December 1819, paid <em>Lee </em>the sum of 300 dollars, over and above the just amount to which he was entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-9\"><em>Lee </em>filed several exceptions to the report; but they were all the same, in substance; <em>viz. </em>that the commissioners had, without reason or justice, disregarded the accounts as settled by the arbitrators, both as to the quantity of work, and the prices.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-10\">The depositions of the arbitrators were taken anew, and filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-11\">1. <em>Tisdale </em>deposed, that, at the request of the parties, he went with <em>Lee </em>to <em>Patillo\u2019s, </em>to view and arbitrate the carpenter\u2019s work done for him by <em>Lee: </em>that <em>Patillo </em>told him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>Degraffenreidt </em>was to be the other arbitrator, but he was not present; that he, <em>Tisdale, </em>viewed the work : that he asked <em>Patillo, </em>whether he disputed the quantity or quality of the work; and he said he did not; that he called on them merely because he was not a judge himself; that <em>Tisdale </em>might view the work then, and <em>Degraffenreidt </em>might view it at another time, and when they met, if they should disagree, they might call in a third person. The arbitrators appointed <em>Parrotte </em>their umpire, and the three met and settled the work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\">2. <em>Degraffenreidt </em>deposed, that he examined the work in the presence of the parties, the other arbitrator <em>Tisdale </em>being absent: that it was then agreed by the parties, that <em>Tisdale </em>and he should settle the work, and, if they should disagree, call in a third person : that they did disagree, and called in <em>Parrotte, </em>and the three settled the work: that <em>Patillo </em>observed to him, <em>Degraffenreidt, </em>that he thought <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bill very high, and especially, the hewing and sawing appeared to him enormous; and he expressed a wish that the arbitrators should make some calculation to see whether the bill for hewing and sawing was correct or not; but, not doubting the correctness of <em>Lee, </em>they did not enter into a calculation <em>of </em>any part of the work done : that the deponent saw <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills for the hewing and sawing, and supposed them to be correct from the view he had of <em>the </em>work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\">Upon the final hearing, the chancellor overruled <em>Lee\u2019s </em>exceptions to the report of the commissioners, and approved the same; perpetuated the injunction awarded by the county court to Lee\u2019s judgement at law against <em>Patillo ; </em>and moreover decreed, that <em>Lee </em>should pay <em>Patillo, </em>the sum of 300 dollars with interest from the 7th December 1819 (that being the sum appearing by the report to have been then overpaid by him to <em>Lee </em>on account of the work by him done). From this decree, <em>Lee </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-6\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellant, and <em>Leigh </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHb\">The argument consisted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>chiefly, in a critical examination of the pleadings and the proofs, and of the same matters of detail, which are discussed in the opinions of the judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b467-5\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAA\">The principles which govern awards, have been so often, and so solemnly settled by this court, that it would be an idle waste of time to state them again, or to cite the authorities on which they rest. If there be any thing settled in the law, it seems to be this, that to set aside an award, you must shew either a mistake apparent upon its face, or misbehaviour in the arbitrators. The court may be fully satisfied that the award has operated injustice, yet if the mistake be not upon its face, and there be no proof of partiality or corruption, it will not touch it. Whether these rules are wise or not, whether this domestic forum is to be cherished or discouraged, will hardly (I presume) at this day, be considered open questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">That there is no mistake apparent upon the face of the award, seemed to be admitted, and must, I think, be taken as a clear point.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The first bill states, that <em>Patillo </em>employed <em>Lee </em>to do some carpenter\u2019s work; and after the work was finished, considering his bills unreasonably high, he refused to pay them ; whereupon, they agreed to submit the <em>prices </em>of the work to the decision of <em>Degraffenreidt </em>and <em>Tisdale, </em>or their umpire: that the arbitrators confined themselves to <em>price, </em>taking <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills for amount of work: that when <em>Patillo </em>received the award, he told <em>Lee </em>he believed he had charged more work than was done; that <em>Lee </em>promised to have an accurate calculation of the work and materials made, and that, in this respect, the award was not to be considered binding and conclusive; and that, upon this agreement, he executed his bond to <em>Lee </em>for 720 dollars, the balance due according to the award : that <em>Lee </em>afterwards, refused all measurement or correction, sued him on the bond, and obtained judgement. If <em>Patillo </em>could have established, either by the answer or by other proof, the agreement, on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>he states that his bond was executed, he would have taken the case off the ground of the award, so far as regarded the <em>amount </em>of work and materials, and would clearly have had a right to the remeasurernent and calculation agreed on. But in this respect, he has failed. The answer is certainly no admission: <em>Lee </em>there says that the bond was not executed upon the terms mentioned in the bill; but on the contrary <em>Patillo </em>proposed to give his bond, about which he felt indifferent, as he had his bills and the arbitration, but at the request of Patillo, he received a bond, as a full and complete settlement, and gave up all his bills and the award; which he would not have given up, if he had considered the matter as still unsettled. He adds, that after the bond was executed, <em>Patillo </em>said, jestingly, that he would be glad, for his own satisfaction, to have the work accurately measured; and <em>Lee </em>replied he might do so, if he could ; but he never promised to do it himself, nor did he intimate, before or after the .execution of the bond, that he would unsettle the award or bond again. I think this a positive denial, and being responsive, must be disproved. Is there any evidence that disproves it? Clearly not, in my mind. No witness is produced who was present at the execution of the bond, when <em>Patillo </em>says the agreement to remeasure was made; yet there is a witness to the bond,\u2014a female. If <em>Patillo </em>really disputed the correctness of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bill as to amount of work, is it not strange, that he should, in the first place, have permitted the arbitrators to take it as the basis of their award, and then when he found the award made, and the sum ascertained upon that basis, should have executed his bond for the balance, without one scrip of writing, or any witness to prove a verbal understanding, that he was still to have a right to unsettle \u2018every thing that was done ? to destroy the very foundation of the award ? The only witness who gives evidence touching this point at all, is <em>Thomas Lee: </em>he speaks of a conversation between the parties after the .suit at law was brought; and taking his two <em>affidavits </em>together (if I do not misunderstand them, for, the last espe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>cially is very ambiguously expressed) they only amount to this, that he heard a conversation between the parties, in which <em>Patillo </em>claimed, that he had required a remeasurement when he executed his bond, and that <em>Lee </em>had said he was willing to do what was right, but did not think a re-measurement right. This, if it were proved by more than one witness, would not amount to any thing like an agreement ; but being a single witness against the bond, executed unconditionally, and <em>Lee\u2019s </em>positive answer, is of no weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The ground, then, upon which the first bill was filed, was wholly unsupported ; and the injunction ought to have been dissolved, on the motion made in the county court, and the bill dismissed ; but the court being divided, the motion was overruled. This was in June 1821. The case then stood upon an order to take depositions till February 1822, when it was set for hearing by the plaintiff. So it remained till June 1824, when upon the plaintiff\u2019s motion, leave was given him to file an amended bill: a permission, which in my judgement, ought never to have been granted under the circumstances of the case, and after the great lapse of time which had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The new bill charges the arbitrators and their umpire with corruption. The grounds of this charge, as they may be collected from the bill are, 1. that the arbitrators took the bills of <em>Lee </em>as to the amount of work and materials, without examining those points <em>themselves; </em>and 2. that they allowed <em>8s. 6d. per hundred </em>for hewing and sawing, although their own prices for the same work, were only <em>6s. </em>and <em>Is. 6d. </em>These, I believe, are the material points. No evidence is gone into, to prove from the words or the temper of the arbitrators, partiality or corruption ; it is rested on their acts as stated above. We must recollect that <em>mere mistake </em>cannot be established by evidence. Do the acts complained of, amount to partiality or corruption ?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">1. As to taking <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bill <em>Degrajfenreidt </em>says, that when he met first on the business, <em>Patillo </em>expressed a wish that the bills should be examined as to quantity of materials and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>work; but as he declined doing so, and understood that <em>Tisdale </em>also had declined such examination, he considered the prices alone submitted to their arbitration, and accordingly they acted on the prices only. <em>Tisdale, </em>in his first <em>affidavit, </em>says he viewed the work at the request of both parties; that he did consider the calculation of the work and materials as a part of their business; but that <em>Lee </em>furnished a bill, which was not disputed by <em>Patiilo. </em>In his second affidavit, he says, he asked <em>Patiilo, </em>whether he disputed the quality or quantity <em>of </em>the work; he said he did not, but that he merely called on them, because he was not a judge; that he might view the work then, and <em>Degraffenreidt </em>might view it at another time; and when they met, if they disagreed, they might call on a third person. Now, when he said that he did not dispute the quantity or quality of the work, but called on them because he was not a judge, what was it he called on them for ? Let his original bill sworn to in open court, answer : <em>that </em>states, that believing <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills unreasonably high, he refused to pay them, and he and <em>Lee </em>agreed to submit <em>the prices </em>of the work, to <em>Degraffenreidt </em>and <em>Tisdale. </em>But whatever might have been his original wish, it is clear, that he knew the arbitrators were about to make their award without any measurement or calculation of quantity, and to take <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills as their basis, and that he acquiesced in this proceeding. <em>Degraffenreidt </em>expressly declined such examination ; <em>Tisdale </em>considered <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bill admitted : <em>Patiilo </em>knew these things, and then was his time, to have insisted on the measurement and calculation, if he continued to think them material; but so far from this, it is evident, that in his conversation with <em>Tisdale, </em>he counted on the award being made without them; for he tells him, he might <em>view </em>(not measure and calculate) the work then, and <em>Degraffenreidt </em>might <em>view </em>it \u25a0 at another time, and when they met, if they disagreed, they might call in an umpire. The arbitrators considered their award a <em>final </em>settlement; which could only be upon the ground, that the bill of <em>Lee </em>was admitted ; since a subsequent measurement and calculation must remove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>very basis of tlieir work, and throw every thing again up into the wind. But more than all this, when the award was made, and presented to <em>Patillo, </em>ho went into a settlement upon it, received a credit for all his payments, executed his bond unconditionally for the balance, and it is not till upwards of two years after, when pressed by a judgement on the bond, that he calls in question by his bill any part of the transaction. Under these circumstances, it surely cannot be imputed to the arbitrators as proof of partiality or corruption, that they took <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills as to quantity of work and materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><em>2. </em>The other charge of misbehaviour is, that although the price of <em>Degrajfenreidt </em>for hewing and sawing was <em>6s. per hundred, </em>and that of <em>Tisdale 7s. 6d., </em>yet these arbitrators allowed <em>Lee 8s. 6d.; </em>and if this award had been made by these two men, this would have been, to say the least of it, a strange and suspicious fact. But we are told, on all hands, that if they differed, they were to choose an umpire; they <em>did' </em>disagree, and then called on <em>Parrotte. </em>I need not say, that when arbitrators disagree and call in an umpire, the award is in law his, though they may sign it with him. Nor is he, in his decision on any point, bound to agree with either arbitrators, or to split the difference between them : he must be guided by his own judgement, free of all control; and, in the absence of all testimony, we must suppose he was so, in fixing this price for hewing and sawing. This then is no ground for fastening upon the arbitrators or the umpire, the charge of corruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">But it was said, if these arbitrators had no agency in settling the amount of work and materials, it is no part of their award, and has nothing of the sanctity belonging to awards. I consider <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills as the statement of the subject matter, on which the arbitrators were to act; as if the parties had said, here are bills of certain work done and materials found; we cannot agree as to the prices; you must judge between us in fixing them. The bills become thus the very foundation of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>But suppose there were no award here at all; suppose that when <em>Lee </em>presented his bills to Patillo, he had examined them for himself, or got some friend better acquainted with the subject, to do it; and that, after such examination, he had settled with <em>Lee, </em>got all his credits, and executed his bond for the balance; and after a judgement on the bond, had attempted to open the whole account from its foundation, and had shewn such a case as is now before us: I, for one, would have refused to open the transaction. Look at the nature of it: no previous bargain is made settling any of the terms: the carpenter goes to work, finds all and does all; the work is finished; and the bill presented, containing a hundred different items,\u2014timbers, wagonage, hewing and sawing, finding, measurement, prices, &amp;c. &amp;c. All is settled, the bills given up, and bond taken; and some six or eight years afterwards, all this is to be ripped up ! How can you settle it then ? The carpenters tell us, that there is no such thing as ascertaining with any thing like accuracy, the quantity of timbers which have been used in a building. Look at the measurement made by <em>Hannah </em>and <em>Perry, </em>at the instance of <em>Patillo, </em>and without notice to <em>Lee. </em>The persons who made that, tell us, that if they had measured side and edge, there would have been no material difference between their bill and Lee\u2019s; and many witnesses tell us, that this was the usual mode at the time the work was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\">It was relied on, that the commissioners who acted under the order of the superiour court of chancery, were appointed by consent of the parties by their counsel. I do not consider this as going, in the slightest degree, to shew the assent of <em>Lee </em>to open the transaction, or abandon the ground he occupied under the award. He moved to dissolve the injunction ; this motion was overruled; and all done after-wards, was <em>in invitum. </em>Before these commissioners, he protested against their proceeding, and claimed to hold to the award. Look at the testimony as to the wagonage on which the commissioners seem to have rested their report, as to this matter: can any one read the depositions of <em>En</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>daly, </em>and give them much credit? Will they not see, that when asked the same questions, by the different parties, he answers them differently ?</p>\n<p id=\"Atv\">Upon the whole, I must believe, that to open such a transaction as this, on such ground, will be contrary to the whole current of authority, and fraught with very mischievous consequences. Look at the monstrous result here. The party who had a judgement at law on the bond of the other for 770 dollars with interest and costs, is called into equity, to injoin his judgement; the bill seeks nothing more; yet by this process of resettlement, a balance is produced against him, and a decree entered, not merely to injoin his judgement perpetually, but, in addition, that he pay to the man for whom he built the houses, 300 dollars with interest and costs. I cannot agree to this. I think the decree should be reversed, the injunction dissolved, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>It is manifest that great injustice was done <em>Patiilo </em>by the award of the arbitrators; and I think, this injustice may be remedied without the violation of any established principle. I do not say, that these arbitrators were corrupt; but they have reposed a confidence in the unproved representations and statements of one of the parties to the submission, which, to say the least of it, amounts to misbehaviour, if not to partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The language of the bill is so defective in precision, that if we were to look to that alone, we might, perhaps, be somewhat in doubt as to the extent of the submission; whether it embraced the <em>quantity, </em>as well as the <em>prices, </em>of the work. But when we look to the conduct of the parties, and to the evidence in the cause, there can be no doubt, but that the whole subject of the work was referred ; quantity, quality and prices. <em>Lee </em>expressly swears it in his answer; for he says, that it was not true that the reference was confined to the <em>prices, </em>but it was for the purpose of settling the whole matter in dispute relative to the said work &amp;c. <em>Tisdale, </em>one of the arbitrators, says, that at the first meeting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the parties (the other arbitrator not being present) he asked Patillo, whether he disputed the quality or quantity of the work; he said he did not, but that he merely called on them because he was not a judge of it himself. SureJy this, did not mean, that he acquiesced in <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills in these respects. If that were the case, why call on them at all ? Not knowing w\u2019hether the bills were right or wrong, he could not, as an honest man, <em>dispute </em>it; but left it for them to decide. <em>Degrajfenreidt, </em>the other arbitrator, says, that when be first met the <em>parties, Patillo </em>requested, that the calculation of the quantity of materials and work should be made, and'expressed his opinion that considerable error existed in this respect. Now, let us see what was the conduct of the arbitrators. It is admitted, that they made no inquiry into, nor any estimate of, the quantity of materials or of work, but were guided intirely by <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills. <em>Tisdale </em>says, he did not make any calculation, because <em>Patillo </em>did not <em>dispute </em>the bills in these respects. I have shewn already that he did not <em>admit </em>them. It was, consequently, the duly of the arbitrators to make the necessary inquiries to satisfy themselves of their justice, <em>Degrajfenreidt </em>repeats in his second deposition, what he had said in the first, as to <em>Patillo\u2019s </em>anxiety on this subject; that he observed, that he thought <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills were <em>very high, </em>and especially the hewing and sawing appeared to him to be enormous; and that he expressed a wish that the arbitrators should majke some calculation to see whether it was correct in these respects. It is worthy of remark, that these objections, made in the presence of the arbitrators, related only to <em>quantities of work and materials; </em>for <em>Lee\u2019s </em>bills as submitted to them contained no <em>prices; </em>yet the arbitrators made no estimate of quantities whatever. I have given the reason assigned by one of them for this omission. Then let us hear the other: <em>Degrajfenreidt, </em>after relating <em>Patillo\u2019s </em>anxiety for them to make the calculation, says, that <em>not doubting the correctness of Lee, </em>they did not enter into a calculation of any part of the work done for <em>Patillo. </em>And as to the umpire, <em>he never </em>saw the work at all. I cannot sanction an award thus made.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Nor do I think the bond given by <em>Patillo </em>precludes him from seeking redress in equity. He says in his bill, that at the time the bond was given, there was an agreement that there should be a rerneasurement of the work. <em>Lee </em>professes to deny this ; but I do not believe him. His answer appears to me to be an equivocation. In another part of his answer, he has stated what is certainly false; for he says that the arbitrators went to the house, viewed the work and <em>compared it with his bill; </em>in which last particular, he is contradicted by both of them. Besides, the proposition to remeasure the work, was under the existing circumstances so reasonable, that no fair and just man could have objected to it. But even if there was no agreement at the time of entering into the bond, yet, on general principles, as the bond was founded on the award, and as the award itself was liable to be set aside for misconduct of the arbitrators, and is in many respects contrary to justice, the bond itself ought to be no more respected than the award. I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Tucker, <em>P. </em>concurring in this opinion, the decree was affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
