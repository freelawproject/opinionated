The Court sustained the demurrer, and thereupon the cause coming on for trial, the defendant demurred to the evidence, and the Court sustained this demurrer, and gave judgment against the plaintiff, who applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-5\"><em>Fultz, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-6\"><em>Baldwin, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b105-7\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ab\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">It seems to the Court, that the question of variance between the promissory note in the proceedings mentioned, and the writing obligatory of which <em>profer\u00ed </em>is made in the second count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, is not presented by the demurrer to that count of the declaration, no <em>oyer </em>having been craved of the last mentioned writing ; and that the said Circuit Court erred in sustaining, instead of overruling that demurrer. It is therefore considered by the Court that the judgment of the said Circuit Court be reversed and annulled with costs. And it is further considered that the said demurrer to the second count of the declaration be overruled, and the verdict of the jury, together with the defendant\u2019s demurrer to the evidence, set aside, and the cause remanded to the said Circuit Court for further proceedings therein, with leave to the parties, or either of them, to plead <em>de novo.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
