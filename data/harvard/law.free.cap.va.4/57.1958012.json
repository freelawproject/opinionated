On the trial of these issues, which took place <em>fu\u00f1e </em>13th, 1804, the Jury found against the plea of <em>payment; </em>and also that the defendant had goods and chattels of his testator unadministered to the amount of 263/.

If the,4Tth section of the same act<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> prevents it from extending to any <em>right </em>which had accrued prior to its commencement, we must inquire, whether prior thereto the Commonwealth had a right of exemption from <em>all time. </em>The act of <em>1TY8, </em>c. 2. s. <em>4.</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>did not retain this privilege as to judgments afterwards obtained in the name of the <em>Cor,nncn-wealth, </em>but only as to judgments then existing iq the name of the <em>King. </em>Neither reason nor the words of the law are in favour of any other interpretation. The clause in the fourth section applies only to the executions described in the preceding sections, as much as if the words \u201c in cases aforesaid\u201d had been inserted; and because it was so considered, it has not been transplanted into any succeeding revisal. The word \u201c but\u201d (with which that clause commences) is antithetical, and confirms this construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-4\">A broader error was never seen, than was committed <em>by the </em>General Court in this case. They refused the executor a credit for money paid for <em>taxes l </em>What a solecism is it that the Commonwealth\u2019s claim for <em>taxes </em>is not good against the Commonwealth\u2019s claim by <em>judgment $ </em>Taxes arc a debt of the <em>first </em>dignity. Those very taxes were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>paid for support of the plantation, the profits whereof have been charged to the executor. A negro too has been charged against him; yet the expense of apprehending that negro is disallowed. The produce of the estate is charged, yet necessary disbursements for raising that produce are disallowed! In short, no credit is given the executor but for funeral expenses !</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-9\">Another point is important. The act subjecting lands to satisfy the Commonwealth\u2019s judgments was not in force when this judgment was rendered.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> No lien was therefore given to the Commonwealth in preference to other creditors. Of course the sum of 189/. received for land sold, being equitable assets, ought to be divided among all the creditors <em>pari passu.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ATA\"><em>The </em>Attorney-General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD5\">The first point I will consider is that of the act of limitations. As to the general principle, it was settled in <em>Kemp </em>v. <em>The </em>Commonwealth.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The expression in the act of 1778 is general, that \u201c no time shall bar the Commonwealth of \u201c execution,\u201d not <em>o\u00ed such executions </em>as had been mentioned. The sixth section of the act of 1792<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> evidently shews that the fifth section was intended to apply exclusively to individuals, and not to the Commonwealth, which can neither be <em>afeme covert, non compos mentis, </em>nor come within any other exception therein mentioned. That act moreover does not apply to any judgment of a prior date. In the cases of <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Elliott </em>v. Lyell,<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> it was decided that an act of Assembly had not a retrospective effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALd\">With respect to the question of notice, there is no authority that judgments must be revived by <em>scire facias </em>before the executor is bound to take notice of them. It is true that the judgment creditor who first sues out his <em>scire facias </em>is to be preferred ;<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> but this does not contravene the general rule, that an executor is bound to take notice of judgments as against debts of inferior dignity.<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>But we need not rely on <em>constructive </em>notice; for in this case, <em>actual </em>notice appears from the facts disclosed. The executor ought to have traced the subject, and ascertained whether there was not a balance due to the Commonwealth, since he knew his testator was a delinquent Sheriff, and that part of his property had been sold by a <em>venditioni ex-ponas.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-3\">Again ; Debts due to the <em>Crown </em>are of the highest dignity ;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and it was clearly the intention of our Constitution to retain to the <em>Commonwealth </em>all such prerogatives of the King as were necessary to the public interests. The reason of such prerogatives applies to all governments, and as well to the state of things <em>after </em>as <em>before </em>the revolution. As to taxes, I admit the Commonwealth ought not to be satisfied twice : but whether the party might not recover back these taxes is another question. If they were due in the life-time of the testator, they were due by open account. Whether such was the case, or not, does not appear; nor whether the expense of apprehending the negro <em>Sancho </em>was incurred before the death of the testator or not; and, indeed, there is no evidence that any of the items were such as the executor had a right to pay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-4\">It is extremely doubtful whether the proceeds of the sale of land were <em>equitable </em>assets. They seem rather to be considered as <em>legal </em>assets. According to 2 <em>Fonb. 397.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c legal assets, though you cannot come at them without the \u201c assistance of equity, shall be applied in a course of ad- \u201c ministration.\u201d Nothing appears in this case to make the, executor a <em>trustee. </em>He seems to have considered himself as taking the property <em>qua </em>executor, and not as trustee; for he charges himself with it, as executor, and as legal: assets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-5\">The Court in this case did not give an instruction as to the weight of evidence. The Jury, I admit, are to judge of facts ; but when facts are ascertained, the Court determines the law. All the Court has done here is to instruct, the Jury as to the law in case they should find a certain state of facts to exist,-</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Randolph, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH1\">Independently of the act of limitations, the <em>scire facias </em>was improperly issued; for, after ten years, it could not issue without special leave of the Court. In the case of <em>Kemp </em>v. <em>The </em>Commonwealth, a number of points were made in the argument; but a general opinion was given by the Court without assigning any reason. The true ground of the decision was, that there was a <em>trust </em>in that case. Is there any trust in this ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-9\">The rule, that <em>general </em>expressions are to be considered relatively to the subject matter, should be applied in construing the act of 1778, so as to limit the word \u201c <em>execution\" to </em>the executions there spoken of. The argument, that the Commonwealth is not a <em>feme </em>covert, &amp;c. proves nothing ; for shewing that the Commonwealth cannot come within the <em>exceptions </em>of the act does not shew that the <em>general </em>terms of the act do not apply to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-10\">According to the doctrine now contended for, thirteen years after an executor has settled up his account, he may be again called to settle every item. The court precluded us from giving any evidence about any item, by instructing the Jury not to take notice of them at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-11\">Lord Thurlow, in <em>Brown's Ch Rep.</em><footnotemark><em>(1)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>ridicules the distinction between taking <em>qua </em>executor, and as <em>trustee. </em>According to all the modem authorities, the proceeds of lands devised to be sold for the payment of debts generally, are in every instance, <em>equitable </em>assets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-12\">Take out of the 304/. 16s. the amount of the sale of land, and the expense of reclaiming the negro who ran away, together with the taxes, and other money expended for the benefit of the estate, and the balance is very small.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-13\">Judge Tucker.

It appears from an exhibit, made part of the bill o\u00ed exceptions, that the personal estate of die testator, (except a very few articles of household furniture, and one slave who had run away with the <em>British </em>army during the revolutionary war.) including his slaves, was sold in the testator\u2019s life-time, under a <em>venditioni exponas, </em>issued from die General Court, at the instance of the Commonwealth, and a return thereof made. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">The first error, suggested in the petition for a <em>supersedeas </em>to this judgment, is, that the Commonwealth is bound by <em>the </em>statute of limitations <em>; </em>and thaiefere the <em>sdre facias </em>was for ever barred, after ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">Whether the acts of limitations extend to the Commonwealth, or not, was fully argued and considered in the case of <em>Kemp </em>v. <em>The </em>Commonwealth<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> in which the plea of the act of limitations was the sole defence relied on. And this Court, consisting at that time of three Judges, judge <em>Lyons, </em>Judge <em>Carrington </em>and myself, two of whom are not present, unanimously agreed that they did not. in civil suits, not founded upon any <em>penal </em>act.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">But a collateral question growing out of these circumstances has arisen, and been discussed at the bar, namely, whether an executor is bound at his peril to take notice of all judgments obtained against his testator in his life-time, or not ? That such is the law of <em>England </em>cannot be doubted, provided the judgment be docketed according to the statute of 4 and <em>5 W. </em>and <em>M. </em>c. 20. as we are told by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Judge <em>Blackstone. (2 Comm. </em>511.) It would seem from this, that the rule is in some respects a statutory one ; it must .however be acknowledged that it was also a rule of the common-law; to that effect is <em>Cro. Eliz. 793. </em>and <em>Godolphin., </em>in his <em>Orphan's </em>Legacy, 170. is so likewise; though in <em>2 And. </em>159. the Court thought that an executor ought not to be charged with a judgment of which he had no notice.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> But it is not every common law rule, founded upon the judicial system of that country, that can be deem-e(]^jn strictness, applicable to the circumstances and situation of this. In <em>England </em>there are only four Superior Courts of Record, all held at the same place, and their records accessible to every one who chooses to consult them.</p>\n<p id=\"AqPY\">A regular train of attorneys, and officers belonging to these courts, and well versed in every thing that relates to them, are capable in a few hours of furnishing that information respecting matters of record, which might defy a life of research in this. In this country we have now two hundred Courts of Record ; the records transferred from one place to another in various instances; and the very names of some Counties in which Courts have formerly been held sunk in oblivion. There was once a County in <em>Virginia </em>called <em>Rappahannock </em>County, and another called <em>Tohoganta: </em>there areno such Counties at this day. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Can it be supposed, that under such circumstances, (even if the rule of the common law in <em>England </em>be such as above suppos-. d,) an executor must at his peril take notice of all judgments against his testator in his life-time, in what Court, or part of the state soever, the same may have been entered ? I conceive not; for, if such a principle be established as law, no man will ever be an executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">But, while I reject the application of the rule to <em>all </em>judgments, I think it reasonably and justly applies to some. An executor may well be presumed capable of informing himself of judgments obtained against his testator in the County or District Court within whose jurisdiction he resided, and to whose process he was daily amenable. So, as to judgments in the General Court, which has ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>risdiction over the whole Common wealth in respect to public agents and defaulters. If a testator has been a public collector of taxes, this, of itself, is a sufficient warning to an executor, to inquire whether any judgment hath been obtained against him as a delinquent. And, if there be, it will be difficult to excuse his neglect in making the inquiry. But, in the present case, the judgment was nearly of five years standing before the testator\u2019s death. His whole visible personal property, except a few trifling articles of household furniture, valued at 26/. only, had been taken and sold upon an execution, issued in behalf of the Commonwealth. The executor might have concluded the debt satisfied, under such circumstances <em>; </em>especially if the agents of the Commonwealth had taken no steps to recover the balance, by an execution against the body of the testator, or had not given the executor actual notice that a balance still remained due. The great lapse of time (on which I lay great stress) between the judgment in <em>April, </em>1786, and the testator\u2019s death, in <em>January, 1791, </em>united with the circumstances just noticed, and the liability of a Sheriff\u2019s securities to make good any deficiency, prompt me to say, that unless notice of that judgment were proved to have been given to the executor, he ought not to be charged as for a <em>devastavit </em>in paying other just debts of his testator, merely on account of the notice which the law <em>implies </em>in such cases. For the reason of the law seems to be this : \u201c that the judgments of all courts, upon matters \u201c or persons within their jurisdiction, are conclusive, <em>so </em>\u201c <em>long as they are in </em>force <em>; </em>and the parties are bound to \u201c yield obedience to them; and that obligation to perform \u201c follows the assets in the hands of the executor or adminis\u201ctrator.\u201d<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Now, although a judgment may be <em>enforced, </em>either by a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum, fieri facias, </em>or eiegit, within <em>the year, </em>yet after that period the judgment creditor cannot <em>enforce </em>his judgment, even against the testator himself, if living, without <em>notice by scire facias. </em>And it seems strange that an executor should thereafter be hound at his peril, to, take notice of that of which bin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>testator must <em>receive </em>notice, before he could be charged upon the judgment formerly obtained against him. If dormant judgments will not bind a <em>purchaser </em>without noticed<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> wherefore should they bind an <em>executor </em>without notice ?</p>\n<p id=\"ATj\">Another error suggested is, that the sum of 189/. arising from the sale of the land directed by the testator\u2019s will to be sold, was only equitable assets; and as such, distributable <em>pari passu </em>among all the creditors. The rule certainly is, that in administering legal assets the Court follows the law; but as to equitable assets it proceeds by the rule of equality, <em>4 Bro. Ch. 171. Lowthian </em>v. <em>Hassel. </em>And in that case the, Court refused to compel a creditor, who had by diligence obtained payment of one bond out of five, to bring the. money received for that bond, into contribution. I am also of opinion, that the judgment having run out of date, ceased to be a lien upon the lands, until revived by <em>scire </em>facias, according to the decision of <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Randolph.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The act making Sheriff\u2019s lands liable to the Commonwealth\u2019s judgments, did not pass until eighteen months after the judgment in this case.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> With respect to this 189/. I conceive the General Court' ought totally to disregard it, as not being legal assets ; leaving it to the Commonwealth to pursue its remedy for a due proportion thereof, as the Attorney-General may be \u2022advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">We come now to that instruction of the Court to the Jury, directing that no discount, or credit, ought to be allowed the defendant for <em>any item </em>in his administration account, except for the funeral expenses. Such certainly is the rule laid down by Lord Ch. J. Holt, 1 <em>Salk. </em>296. Our law is however more liberal <em>; </em>executors are to be allowed \u201c <em>all reasonable charges and </em>disbursements, which they shall \u201c lay out and expend in the funeral of the deceased, <em>and other </em>\u201c <em>their administration ;n </em>such, for example, as m ay be incurred in consequence of the provisions contained in the 46th section of the act'concerning wills, which in certain cases give him the charge and care of the whole estate, real and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>personal, for a certain period ; and the same rule will hold, think die practice in <em>England </em>does not. On this point, therefore, I have no doubt that the instruction obtlie Court was not altogether correct. I am therefore of opinion, that th.- judgment be reversed, and the cause sent back, with directious <em>pursuant </em>to the preceding opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"AA0\">Judge Eo an\u00fc.</author>\n<p id=\"Azk\">This was a <em>scire facias </em>issued on behalf of the Commonwealth, from the office of the General Court, on the l?,lh of <em>July, </em>1799, against <em>fames </em>Nimmo, surviving executor of <em>William </em>Nimmo, deceased. Its obj cc.t was to enable the Commonwealth to have the effect of a judgment obtained against <em>William </em>Nimmo, the testator, in the <em>General </em>Court, on the S6th of April, 1785, for 208/. 10s. <em>Aid. </em>the balance of the one <em>per cen\u00ed, </em>tax, <em>collected </em>by the defendant in the County of <em>Princess </em>Anne, for the year 1784, and 31/. <em>5s. 6 \\-%d. </em>damages ; amounting in the whole to 239/. ld.v. 10 <em>\u00cd-2u. </em>with interest and costs, as in the said writ of <em>scire facias </em>is more particularly mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The appellant, (the executor,) having appeared, pleaded, 1st. Payment by the testator; and, 2d. Fully administered ; on both which pleas issue was joined. The Jury' -on the trial found <em>against </em>the defendant on the first plea j and, on the second, found that the defendant, at the time of issuing the <em>scire </em>facias, had divers goods and chattels, which were of the testator at the time of his death, in hit. hands to be administered, to the value of 253-7. Is. <em>8d. parcel </em>of the debt, damages and interest aforesaid wherewith ho might have satisfied the same <em>pro tanto ; </em>and judgment \u00abas given against him for the same, in the form usual in such cases. This finding of the Jury was under the influence of an opinion of the Court, stated in the bill o\u00ed exceptions, and to be presently more particularly noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">The first inquiry which presents itself, is respecting the nature and character of this writ of <em>scire facias ; </em>whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>it is a <em>scire facias </em>to revive the judgment <em>because of </em>the lapse of ten years, or even of a year and a day since its rendition ; or <em>because of </em>the death of the defendant, and the devolution of his interests upon his executor, who was no <em>party </em>to the original judgment. I rather think it is in this last view <em>only </em>that this <em>scire facias </em>is to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"AtOv\">I will assign my reasons for this opinion. It is laid down in 6 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>112. that one who is no party to the record or judgment, as heir, or executor, &amp;c. though it be <em>'within the </em>year, shall have no writ of execution to enable himself to the suit, and so of the tenant or de\u00edendant ; for the alteration of the person altereth the process. On this ground, then, of the death of the defendant, this writ of <em>scire facias </em>shall be taken to have issued, especially if, in truth, one was not necessary on any other ground. This brings us to that inquiry, and more particularly to the question whether the Commonwealth was barred of her execution by the lapse of time in the case before us. That inquiry again presents itself in a twofold point of view; 1st. Whether a <em>scire facias </em>be necessary, after the lapse of a year and a day, in the case of a judgment of the Commonwealth ; and, 2d. If so, whether the right to sue out a <em>scire facias </em>is barred by the lapse of <em>ten years </em>under the act of 1792.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">As to the first branch' of this inquiry, it is held in 1 <em>Salk. </em>603. that, <em>in case of the </em>King, there need not be any <em>scire facias </em>after the year and day : and it would seem that the declaration in the act of October, 1778, c. 2. \u201c that no time \u201c shall bar the Commonwealth of execution,\u201d has adopted this principle in relation to judgments of the Commonwealth. That act speaking of judgments in favour of the King, which did not require a <em>scire facias </em>after the year as aforesaid, it is reasonable to consider it as placing the Commonwealth in the same situation ; as exempting the Commonwealth as well as the King from the necessity of suing out a <em>scire facias. </em>In opposition to this principle it is said, that the maxim \u201c <em>nullum tempus occurrit regif </em>which gives this rule in England, arises front the roya <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>prerogative, and is odious and inapplicable to the nature of our government. In answer to this objection it would \u00a7eem that, while our Constitution inhibits to the \u201c Governor the exercise of any power or prerogative, by c\u2018 virtue of any law, statute, or custom of England,\u201d<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> it does not interdict such preferences and pre-eminences as may be given to the <em>Commonwealth </em>by the acts of our <em>own Legislature. </em>In this latter class, the aforesaid act of 1778 causes the present case to fall; and that circumstance supersedes the necessity of considering how far, on <em>general </em>principles, the maxim \u201c <em>nullum tempus occurrit reg\u00ed\u201d </em>applies to this country. Whenever that point must, of necessity, be decided, it will be important to consider how far the decision in <em>Kemp </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and, also, what is said by the Court in the case of <em>Birch </em>v. <em>Alexander </em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>have seemed to give a countenance to its application. I will merely say, at present, that within my observation, the Commonwealth is not in general, and from the nature of the case cannot be, on an equal footing with private suitors, in respect of diligence^ attention, &amp;c. (however vigilant and faithful its officers may be,) and that, therefore, the reason of this pre-eminence may be in some measure as applicable to the <em>present </em>government as to the <em>former.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">I leave that general question, however, for future decision. It is not necessary to be decided in this case ; for here the Legislature has spoken explicitly on the subject i\u00bb the aforesaid act of 1778. That act has never been repealed ; it is founded, perhaps on good reason; is supported by the analogy, as to this point, of the doctrine in <em>England </em>as aforesaid ; and therefore, neither the general limitation as to writs of <em>scire facias </em>provided by the act of 1792,<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> nor the common law limitation of a year and a day, does, I think, embrace the judgment in question.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> The Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>mcnweallh, therefore, hada right to sue out the <em>scire facias' </em>in this case, the lapse of time notwithstanding; a .d M'as entitled to recover, in satisfaction of its judgment, all such of the testator\u2019s assets as were not otherwise <em>legally </em>administered in favour of other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Having thus cleared the way for the consideration <em>of </em>the particular instruction <em>of </em>the Court, under which the verdict of the Jury was found, and which verdict can only stand in the event of that instruction being correct, let us examine the rectitude thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">The defendant, at the trial, having given in evidence, in support of his second plea, an account of his administration which had passed the Auditors of <em>Princess Anne </em>Court,, on the 5th of May, 1800, who reported that <em>vouchers </em>were produced to them to sustain the charges in the account, leaving a balance of 27/. Is. 1 <em>l-4d. </em>in the hands of the executor; the Attorney-General, on the part of the Commonwealth, gave in evidence to the Jury an inventory signed by the executor, (the items of which exactly correspond with those of the <em>credit side </em>of the account exhibited by the defendant,) with a memorandum thereon that \u201c the \u201c other personal estate of <em>William </em>Nimmo, including his \u201c slaves, was sold in his life-time under a <em>vendifioni expo- </em>\u201c <em>nas, </em>issued from the office of the General Court, at the \u201c instance of the Commonwealth, and a return thereof \u201c made by the Sheriff of <em>Princess Anne </em>and moved the Court to instruct the Jury that no credit should be allowed the defendant for any <em>item </em>in his aforesaid account, except <em>forfuneral expenses; </em>alleging that it appeared, from the memorandum aforesaid, that he had notice of the judgment aforesaid, before making the disbursements in the ' said account mentioned. The Court did accordingly in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>siruct the Jury to the effect desired by the Atttorney-Gcne<em>ral; to </em>which instruction the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\">I am of opinion that this instruction was eminently erroneous in ail those particulars (and for the reasons so luminously) stated in the <em>seven </em>last errors assigned in the petition for the <em>supersedeas. </em>I beg leave to refer to thos\u00e9 reasons particularly ; and to adopt them as the ground of my opinion on this part of the case. They had great weight with me at the time of awarding the supersedeas, and 1 understand are now all assented to by the <em>unanimous </em>opinion of the Court. Still, as those exceptions do not go to the <em>zvhole </em>of the items contained in the account; and, as the Commonwealth is not barred from recovering in this case on the merits, she is entitled to a judgment for the <em>residue </em>of tiic account; unless she be precluded on the ground stated by the Judge who has preceded me ; that is, on the ground that the executor was not bound to take notice of the judgment on which the <em>scire facias </em>is founded. Between the rendition of the judgment against the testator and his death, <em>less </em>than ttive years had elapsed, and that Judge seems to suppose that the executor had a right to <em>presume, </em>from such lapse of time, and because no <em>express </em>notice is shewn to have been given him of the existence of the judgment, that it was <em>paid, </em>and that consequently he was authorised to apply the assets to the payment of debts of <em>inferior </em>dignity.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">I am not prepared to say that the <em>memorandum </em>before mentioned amounts, on account of its iudefinitencss, to proof of <em>express </em>notice of this particular judgment; but this I am prepared to say, that this judgment, being rendered in the <em>General </em>Court, having at the time <em>general </em>jurisdiction throughout the Commonwealth, against a public collector ; a Court having the peculiar jurisdiction in the fiscal concerns of the Commonwealth, and five years not having elapsed since its rendition j ought to have beer\u00bb, taken notice of by the executor, <em>at his peril, </em>in the administration of the assets of the testator. X should suppose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>it would be readily admitted on all hands, that, within the year and day, the executor must have taken notice of it: but if, in respect of de!&lt;ts due to the Commonwealth, this limitation does not exist to bar the execution as aforesaid, this case cannot be differed from one in which that lapse of time had not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">It is a universal rule that judgments and debts of record are to be preferred, in the administration, to simple contract debts, and that executors ought, <em>at their </em>peril, to take notice of them. In <em>Littleton </em>v. <em>Hibbins</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which was <em>scire facias </em>v. executors, upon a <em>judgment </em>against the <em>testator </em>in <em>debet; \u201c </em>they pleaded that, <em>before \u201c they had any conusance </em>of this judgment, dn-v had fully \u201c administered all the assets in paying .debts <em>upon obliga- \u201c Lions ; </em>and thereupon it was demurred, and on argument \u201c adjudged that it was <em>not any plea: </em>for that they <em>at their </em>\u201cperilought to take conusance of debts upon record, and \u201c ought first of all (unless for debts due to the Queen \u201c wherein she hath a prerogative) to satisfy them, and al- <em>\u201c </em>though the recovery was-in <em>another County </em>than where \u201c the testator and executors inhabited, it is not material.\u201d In <em>Ordway </em>v. <em>Godfrey; </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to a <em>scire facias </em>v. an administratrix to have execution of a judgment against her intestate, the plea was (in general) that she had no goods to be administered at the time of suing the writ, or afterwards ; on demurrer, this was held to be no plea; for that \u201c a <em>\u201c </em>judgment cannot be answered <em>without another judgment, </em>\u201c and it may be she had administered all the goods in pay- <em>\u201c </em>ing <em>debts upon </em>specialties, which is not any administra- \u201c tion to bar the plaintiff;\u201d and \u201c that she should have \u201c pleaded specially how she had administered.\u201d This decision seems full up to our case <em>; </em>not only as to the point of the bar, but also as to the <em>generality </em>of the plea, which in that case was held to be insufficient. It is true that, in a <em>note </em>in 3 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>80. referring to this case, (which has now perhaps become the general doctrine,) it is said, that the executor may, to the <em>scire jcicias, </em>plead <em>generally </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>lie hath fully administered, without shewing that he did so in paving debts of as high a nature ; but yet that <em>that </em>must be \u201c <em>proved upon the </em>evidence, else the Inal will fail out \u201c <em>against the executor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">In <em>Herberts </em>case,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> it is said by &gt; the Master <em>ot </em>the Roils, <em>inter </em>alia, \u201c that executors shall be presumed to take \u201c notice of <em>all </em>judgments, even in the <em>inferior Courts </em>of \u201c Raw, and therefore are not to pay bonds before such \" judg'ui-nls, <em>at their peril.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">And, in a very late case, this doctrine is fully admitted ; with this exception, indeed, that die judgment, in order to have the preference, mast he <em>dodeted </em>according to the <em>English </em>statute of 4 and <em>5 Wm. &amp; </em>Mary, c. 20.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> That decision, which was in favour of the adreiuis\u00ed ra\u00edrix, turned solely on the necessity of complying with the requisites of the statute in relation to docketing the judgments, which, otherwise, were thereby deprived of their preference : in other respects it entirely affirmed and admitted the doctrines I have been stating ; and, therefore, (as we have no such statute in this country,) the decision is lull up to the point before us. The superadding the requisite of <em>docketing judgments </em>in England., <em>by the </em>Legislature, in order to enable executors the more easily to find them out and know of their existence, shews that the <em>hardship </em>of the case, in relation to the judgments of die com iy Courts, (to be presently more particularly noticed,) is improperly addressed, to <em>this </em>tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Testing our case by these decisions, it is ineontesh: le, that the executor should have taken notice of the judgment mentioned in the <em>scire </em>facias, \u00e1t his peril ; ana that he should have <em>shewn in his glen, </em>or at least, <em>proved on the </em>trial, that he had applied the assets to the payment of debts of as high a dignity, or else there would be no bar; neither of which has he done.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-15\">Thus stands the case as upon the <em>Englidi </em>authorities. I will now refer to an opinion delivered in this Court, laying down the law on this subject with great precision and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>propriety. It is that of Judge Fleming in the case of <em>Mayo </em>v. Bentley.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> It applies exactly to the question now before us in all its parts, and overrules all the objections which have been taken on the ground of notice. This Court was divided on the main point in that case of <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>Bentley; </em>but there was no division whatever upon any principle or topic embraced by so much of that opinion as I shall now quote. I yield to the doctrine it contains my most decisive approbation.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">In that case judge Fleming said, \u201c In the general division of debts (after funeral and testamentary charges \u201c are paid) there are three sorts ; 1st. Debts by record; <em>(i 2d. </em>Debts by <em>specialty; </em>and, 3d. Debts by simple contract. <em>u </em>Passing by the cases in the <em>E tig lis h books </em>respecting u debts due to the Crown, and those by recognisance and \u201c statutes, let us consider such debts only, as are due from \u201c citizen to citizen, and apply to the case now under con\u00bb \u201c sideration. Debts <em>by judgment, </em>then, being/zrsf <em>in order, </em>are to be <em>first paid; </em>and being debts of record, an exe<em>u </em>cutor or administrator is bound to take notice of them <em>^ at his peril, however distant the record may be </em>from^his &lt;\u00a3 residence : and in the present case there was a judgment \u201c for 370/. against <em>Wm. Ronald in the County Court of </em>Ac- \u201c com Ac <em>; </em>and, had the administrator exhausted the assets in paying debts of <em>inferior </em>dignity, he must have answer-41 ed <em>it </em>(that judgment) out of his own estate.\u201d I shall leave this opinion to speak for itself : it is so apposite and emphatical that I can add nothing to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">In the case of <em>Hopkirk </em>v. <em>Pendleton, </em>decided in the Federal Circuit Court of this State ai the <em>last </em>term, and of which a gentleman of the bar' has obligingly favoured me with a <em>note, </em>the facts were these : In the year 1772, Spears, <em>Bowman </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>(of whom <em>Hopkirk </em>is surviving partner) recovered a judgment against <em>Gunn, </em>in the County Court of <em>Henrico; </em>soon after which <em>Gunn </em>died, leaving <em>Pendleton </em>and others his executors, of whom <em>Pendleton </em>qualified and proceeded to administer the assets. In 1803, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>Mopltirk </em>brought debt on the said judgment; <em>Pendleton </em>pleaded <em>fully </em>administered, on which there was an issue. The Jury found a <em>special </em>verdict, in which they state the judgment of <em>1772 </em>; that the same had not been paid ; and that <em>Pendleton </em>had fully administered the assets by paying debts due by specialties and simple contracts, and referred the law to the Court, as to the right of the plaintiffs to priority. Chief justice Marshall decided that the deft ndant was bound <em>at his peril </em>to take notice of <em>the judgment, </em>and having paid debts of inferior dignity, they were no bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. I shall make no comment on the application and appositeness of this decision to the ease before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">I have already remarked that the judgment in question was one of the <em>General Court; </em>a Court having at the time a jurisdiction (and especially in relation to fiscal concerns) coextensive with the limits of the Commonwealth. This pase then steers clear of objections, as to this point of notice, in relation to judgments of merely local Courts. I am sensible that great hardships <em>may </em>exist in obliging an executor to notice the judgments of the numerous and <em>heal </em>Courts of our country: but these hardships did not prevail with respect to the <em>lien </em>upon lands created by a judgment, although the objection was taken with great ability in the case of <em>Eppes </em>v. Randolph.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In that case a <em>lien </em>was supposed, though not decided, to be created by the judgment <em>o\u00ed any </em>County Court in the Commonwealth; (due requisites in other respects being observed ;) and <em>that </em>in relation to <em>land, </em>which is not the proper and <em>natural </em>fund for the payment of debts. It therefore goes beyond the case at bar, which only relates to <em>personal </em>property, the natural subject of administration. Neither did that argument of hardship prevail in either of the cases of <em>Mayo v. Bentley, </em>or <em>Hopkirk </em>v. <em>Pendleton, </em>in both of which it equally existed ; and yet the general doctrine was adhered to. It is certainly not very <em>necessary </em>(as the judgment before us is a judgment of the Gf.mkral Court, and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>fore not different, as to the point of notice, from the. judgments of the Courts of <em>Westminster Hull </em>in England,) to consider the question in relation to the judgments of the <em>County </em>or other <em>local </em>Courts. But, I may be permitted to ask) (inasmuch as almost all our Courts have <em>now </em>become <em>local </em>in their jurisdiction,) if the objection now taken were to prevail, what would become of the rule of law, established time immemorial, giving <em>judgment debts </em>a preference ? Would not such a construction <em>repeal </em>that rule ? and is this a power proper for the <em>Courts oj' Justice </em>to exercise ? It is true that a new <em>tier </em>of Courts has been lately created by the Legislature, making the number of these local tribunals perhaps amount to 200 ; but the <em>principle </em>is not charged thereby, but merely the <em>degree of </em>the hardship. I shall therefore adhere to the doctrine existing, time out of mind, in this country, giving to the judgments of the <em>County Courts </em>the same effect, in relation to the rights of creditors, as to those of the <em>General </em>Court: I should therefore have no hesitation to give to the judgments of <em>all </em>ihe Courts of Record in the Commonwealth, the same effect as was ascribed by Judge Fleming to the judgment of the <em>County Court of Accomac, </em>and by Chief Justice Marshall to that of the County Court of <em>Hen</em>rico, in the opinions and judgments I have mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">The result of my opinion is, that the judgment before us ought to be reversed; the instruction of the Court being erroneous ; that, in directing the instruction proper to be given on the future trial, we should affirm the right of the executor to a credit for <em>all </em>the items comprehended in the <em>seven </em>last errors assigned for the <em>supersedeas; </em>that, with respect to the 187/. for the land sold, stated in the account, the-Commonwealth is entitled tono part thereof, except by application to a Court of Equity, and then only, (as it now appears to <em>us,)pari passu </em>with other creditors ; and that, as to all the moneys paid by the executor, as stated in his account, to satisfy debts of dignity inferior to the judgment in question, he paid them in his own wrong ; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>that <em>pro tanto </em>the Conuncnwealih ought to be permitted to talce out its execution.</p>\n<author id=\"b95-3\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"A56\">The three principal.points in this ease are, 1st. Whether the Commonwealth was barred from issuing a <em>noire facias </em>to renew the judgment in question, a ter a lapse of ten years? and if not, <em>2d. </em>Whether <em>actual </em>notice of the judgment, to the executor, was necessary, or in other words, whether he was not, at his peril, bound to take notice of it, and to govern himself accordingly ? And a third question is, whether the Generad Court erred in instructing the Jury, \u201c that the defendant was not \u201c by law entitled to any credit or discount, for any item in \u201c his administration account, except for the funeral ex* \u201c penses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">On the first point, little need be said. The <em>English </em>maxim of <em>nullum tempus occur rit </em>rcg:, seems to have been, recognised and enforced by our legislature, soon after the revolution ; as by the act of <em>October, </em>1778. c. 2. s. 4. it is declared, that \u201c- no time shall bar the Commonwealth of \u201c execution.\u201d And the rule seems to have been well settled in the case of <em>Kemp </em>v. <em>The </em>Commonwealth, in <em>October, 1806. </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">With respect to the second point, it seems to be settled that executors ought at their peril to take conusance of debts upon record; and first of all to satisfy them ; and although the recovery be in another County than where the testators and executors inhabit, it is not materiaL<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> And on <em>this </em>point, the opinion of this Court was unanimous (as well as my memory serves me) in the case of <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>Bentley, </em>administrator of <em>Wm. Ronald. </em>And if an executor or administrator is hound to take notice of a judgment on record, though in a distant country, <em>a fortiori </em>is he bound to notice a judgment of the <em>General </em>Court, having jurisdiction over the vvhole State, and where judgments against public debtors are most commonly rendered. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">As to the third point, I have no doubt but the General Court erred in the instruction given to the Jurv, at the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>trial: for in the act concerning wills, the distribution of in-testates\u2019 estates, &amp;c. section 52. it is enacted, that executors and administrators shall be allowed in their accounts, all reasonable charges and disbursements, which they shall lay out and expend in the funeral of the deceased, and <em>other </em>their administration, and may be allowed such recompense for their personal trouble, as the Court, in passing their account, shall judge reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">There are several articles of this description, in the executor\u2019s account passed by the County Court of <em>Princess Anne, </em>and particularly stated in the petition for a <em>supersedeas, </em>for which the appellant ought to have had credit, but were rejected by the Jury, in consequence of the erroneous instruction of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">I am also of opinion that the sum of 189/. stated in the executor\u2019s account to have arisen from the sale of 126 acres of land, left by the will of the testator to be sold for the payment of his debts, was not legal, but <em>equitable </em>assets only, and as such distributable <em>pari passu </em>among all the creditors ; and therefore ought not to be appropriated tet the Commonwealth alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">I am of opinion, upon the whole, that the judgment ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">By the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyons,) the judgment of the General Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">The judgment of this Court was, that the judgment of* the General Court \u201c is erroneous in this, that the said \u201c Court instructed the Jury that the defendant, now plain- \u201c tiff, was not entitled to any credit or discount for any of \u201c the items in his account of administration, stated in the \u201c bill of exceptions, except for the funeral expenses 3 \u201c therefore it is considered, that the said judgment be re- \u201c versed and annulled. And this Court is further of \u201c opinion, that the plaintiff ought to have been allowed all \u00ab reasonable charges and disbursements laid out and expended by him in the administration of the estate of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>** testator, <em>as stated in his account audited and passed hj </em>\u201c <em>the County Court of Princess </em>Anne, and set out at large \u201c in the bill of exceptions ; but that the several sums paid \u201c to <em>Haynes </em>Brent, <em>Prudence Thetaball, James </em>Simpson, \u201c <em>Mary </em>Selden, <em>hatima </em>Halstead, <em>Gresham </em>Nimmo, and \u201c <em>Elizabeth </em>Hunter, being paid in discharge of debts of dignity inferior to that of the judgment mentioned in the \u201c said writ of <em>scire </em>facias, were paid by the said executor, \u201c so far as the same were paid out of the legal assets of \u201c the testator, in his own wrong, and therefore that he \u201c ought not to have any credit therefor. This court is \u201c also of opinion, that the sum of one hundred and eighty* \u201c nine pounds, the amount of the sales of one hundred \u201c and twenty-six acres ofland, stated in the account afore<em>u </em>said, as left by the will to be sold, not being legal, but \u201c mere <em>equitable </em>assets, and as such distributable <em>pari passu </em>\u201c among all the creditors of the testator, ought not wholly &lt;s to enure to the benefit of the Commonwealth, by virtue \u201c of the judgment in question, and, being equitable assets \u201c only, as appears to this Court, is not a proper subject &lt;c for the cognisance of a Court of Law ; whereupon, It is \u201c ordered, that the Jury\u2019s verdict be set aside, and that a \u201c new trial be had in the cause ; upon which an instruction \u201c is to be given to the Jury in conformity to the princi, les \u201c declared by this opinion of the Court, which is ordered \u201c to be certified to the said General Court.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A1G\"> 1 <em>Hen. </em>&amp; Munf. 85.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AMf\"> <em>Per Lawrence, </em>J. 6 <em>T.
