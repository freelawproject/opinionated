These depositions,besides containing much hearsay evidence, tended to explain the intention of the panics at the time of entering into the agreement, and to prove covenants on the part of the defendant, which were not inserted in the said agreement; particularly, it w as proved by the person who drew the instrument of writing, and after-wards attested it as a witness, that the defendant\u2019s attorney agreed with the plaintiff, 44 <em>that if he did not prove that </em>44 <em>the spot of ground on which they then were, was the </em>44 <em>spot of ground called for by </em>his, <em>Buster's </em>entry, <em>made by </em>44 <em>a certain Benjamin </em>Blackburn, <em>he would refund to the </em>44 <em>plaintiff the purchase-money. </em>After which agreement, 44 the deponent drew an article between the parties,\u201d fkc. Whereupon the defendant, by his, counsel, moved the Court 44 to exclude such parts of the depositions, in this 44 cause, from going in evidence to the Jury, as were at va~ 44 riance with the covenant, or went to explain the same.\u201d But the motion was overruled, and the whole of the depositions suffered to go in evidence to the Jury. To this opinion of the Court, the defendant tendered a bill of exceptions, which was signed, sealed, and made a part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>record. Verdict for the plaintiff for 300 dollars damages, and judgment thereupon ; from which the defendant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AC0\">Hening, for the appellant, made the following points, and cited in support thereof the corresponding authorities.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-7\">1.

And the want of this averment will not be aided by verdict. 5 <em>Com. Dig. </em>(by <em>Rose,) </em>343. tit. Pleader, (C. 49.) <em>Vaugh. </em>118. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Bickerstaff.

This was the doctrine of the common law before the statute of frauds existed; and the rules of evidence being the same in both Courts of Law and Equity, parol evidence is no more admissible in the one Court than in the other. 1 <em>Fonb. </em>200. 1 <em>Roll.

In declaring in covenant <em>it is sufficient to set out the substance of the covenant and the breach.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the case of <em>Bristow </em>v. <em>Wright,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is expressly said by Lord Mansfield., \u201c that \u201c if an action be founded on a deed, the plaintiff need not \u201c set forth more than that part which is necessary to enti44 tie him to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>By the strict letter of the covenant, <em>Wallace </em>was to defend any suits which might be brought, and <em>Buster </em>to pay the expenses. \u2018 But the fact was, that there was <em>no land. </em>How then was <em>Wallace </em>to comply <em>literally </em>with the terms' of the contract ? It is enough that the <em>intention </em>of the parties to be collected from the instrument be stated in assigning the breach.

The Court was asked to exclude from the consideration of the Jury certain <em>parts </em>of the depositions. How was the Court to comply ? Were the Judges to erase the exceptionable parts ? Certainly not. The proper course would have been for the counsel to select such <em>parts </em>as he deemed improper evidence, and move the Court to instruct the Jury to disregard them. Not having done so, the Court could not have done otherwise than permit the whole depositions to go to the Jury; not being presumed to have seen those parts which were excepted to.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b102-12\">Wednesday, <em>May </em>28.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASrq\">The Judges gave their opinions.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"APH\">\n<em> Cowp.665.

That the breach is not well assigned ; because it is neither in the words of the covenant, nord oes it comprehend its effect, and is moreover uncertain. 2. That by the terms of the agreement, the defendant was not bound to refund the money, unless the lands Were lost by a legal eviction, which ought to have been averred and shewn by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">As to the first of these exceptions. IIow far the technical phraseology of the declaration might have been judged deficient upon a special demurrer, it is unnecessary to inquire, since the defendant, by his plea, has admitted that the plaintiff hath <em>alleged </em>a breach of his covenant. But with regard to <em>substance, </em>the case of <em>Bache </em>v. <em>Proctor,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which was upon, a special demurrer, is, in my opinion, a conclusive authority in favour of the plaintiff, if indeed authority upon so plain a case could be required. As to the second, I see nothing in the contract, to warrant Mr, <em>Honing's </em>conclusion, that the defendant was not bound to refund the money, unless the lands were <em>lost by a legal eviction. </em>The covenant does not import to be a <em>legal conveyance </em>of the lands therein mentioned ; there being no such description of the lands therein, as that the purchaser could have entered, and possessed himself thereof; but is merely such a contract, as a Court of Equity would compel the specific execution of, or a Court of Law give damages for breach of.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The vendor might have had a thousand, or ten thousand' acres of land on <em>Silver Creek </em>in the same tract, or in a da<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>zen different tracts; into none of which would it have been lawful for the covenantee to enter upon this contract. It is therefore a <em>petitio principa </em>to say, that the covenantor was not bound to refund, unless the lands were <em>lost by a legal </em>eviction, which presupposes an entry and actual possession ; neither of which could happen, if, in fact, as is alleged in the declaration, the covenantor had no lands on <em>Silver Creek </em>in the County of Madison, as by the covenant is supposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">With respect to the exception taken at the trial. It was toot to be supposed or expected, that the Court could be so well apprized of the contents of the depositions, as to be able to select, without the aid of counsel, those parts which the Jury ought to <em>disregard. </em>The depositions being regularly taken, and read without objection, could not be withheld from the Jury, <em>partially ; </em>the Court could not direct any er\u00e1sure, as has been supposed ; and it was the duty of the counsel, specially to recite those parts which he objected to the Jury\u2019s considering. Had he pointed out the pass* ages, and it had appeared improper that those passages should be considered as evidence before the Jury, the Court could no doubt have instructed the Jury to disregard them; but he not having proceeded in that manner, I cannot charge <em>his </em>omission, as an error committed by the <em>Court. </em>I think the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b104-10\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayb\">The declaration in this case, though very ill drawn, charges a covenant to sell to the appellee 500 acres of land on <em>Silver </em>Creek, and also to refund all moneys paid therefor, in case the land or any part be lost. It charges breaches in that the appellant had in fact \u201c no \u201c land at all lying on <em>Silver Creek </em>that the consideration for which a sum of 100/. was paid under the said contract \u201c had entirely failed,\u201d and that the said 100/. was not refunded.</p>\n<p id=\"AmP\">The cases of <em>Hawkins v. Berkeley,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Bache </em>v. <em>Proctor,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and others, fully justify this assignment of breaches, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>in reference to the agreement on which the action is founded : the breach is substantially laid, according to the intentionof the parties, which was to warrant to the appellee the land sold, or, if lost, to refund any moneys paid thereior.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">With respect to the motion made by the defendant to the Court, it was, 44 that the Court should exclude such \u201c parts of the depositions from going in evidence to the \u201c Jury, as were at variance with the covenant, or went to 44 explain the same.\u201d And again, in another part of the bill of exceptions, the motion is stated to have been \u201c to \u201c arrest from the consideration of the Jury so much of 44 the <em>depositions </em>as went to establish a fact out of the co-44 venant stated in the declaration ; <em>particularly those parts \u201c of the depositions which say that at the time of entering into </em>\u201c <em>the said </em>covenant, <em>the defendant was bound to refund the </em>44 money, <em>if he did not prove that the land whereon the plain-</em>44 <em>tiff lived was the very land called for by the defendant\u2019s </em>44 <em>entry?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">With respect to the first part of the instruction required from the Court as above, the motion was, perhaps, too general, and the instruction required, of too <em>abstract </em>a nature. If given, it would have left the Jury much as they were, as they would still have to judge whether this or that particular piece of testimony was admitted or rejected by the instruction. But the Court were justified on another ground in refusing to give the instruction ; and that is, that, upon inspecting the whole of the depositions, it appears that every part thereof was admissible. If they gave a correct opinion upon the <em>actual </em>case before them, they are to be excused from answering general and abstract questions. The latter part of the motion, indeed, propounds a <em>particular </em>question to the Court; but I am of opinion, that the decision of the Court thereupon was also correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Indeed, all the testimony contained in the depositions tends either to prove, that the appellant had no land at all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>on <em>Silver Creek ; </em>or that he had not that <em>particular </em>tract which it was understood and agreed between the parties was the tract embraced by the agreement. Evidence to this last point was not contradictory to the agreement; was not <em>out </em>of the same : it is consistent therewith : it is like the common case of admitting evidence to shew <em>which John </em>was meant, when there are two, and <em>one </em>is mentioned in a deed or agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">On the whole, I am for affirming the judgment-</p>\n<author id=\"b106-8\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"Abh\">The counsel for the appellant stated three points on which the judgment ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">1. That the breach is not well assigned, because it is neither in the words of the covenant, nor does it comprehend its effect, and is too uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">2. That the defendant was not bound to refund the money, unless the lands were lost by a legal eviction, which ought to have been averred and shewn by the plaintiff; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">3. That the court erred in admitting parol testimony to go to the Jury, which essentially varied a written agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">With respect to the first point, the breaches are well assigned, according to the principles laid down in the case of <em>Bache and others </em>v. Proctor, <em>Doug. </em>382. that it is not necessary, in assigning breaches, to use the express words of a covenant; and that the <em>intention oj the parties, </em>to be collected from the instrument itself, may well be stated in assigning breaches, though not particularly expressed in the covenant. But admitting that, on a special demurrer, the assignment of breaches would have been adjudged insufficient, they are certainly good after a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">As to the second point, \u201c that the defendant was not *c bound to. refund the ipo\u00faey, unless the lands were lost i\u2018 by legal eviction,\u201d there is no such article in the agreement ; and the counsel should have explained to the Court how the defendant was to have been evicted of lands of which he was never seised or possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>With respect to the admission of improper evidence to <em>go to the </em>Jury, it appears that the depositions were legally taken, and I perceive no error in the Court\u2019s permittihg them to go in evidence to the Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AMz\">By the whole Court, (absent Judge Lyons,) the judgment of the District Gourt was affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b103-11\"> Daug. <em>388</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b104-11\"> 1 <em>Wash. 204</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AjR\">Doug.368. 1st edit. 383, 3d edit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
