Pendleton </em>was indicted and tried there, for forging and counterfeiting a check in the name of <em>Bagwell, Smith &amp;/\u2022 Williams </em>on the bank of <em>Virginia, </em>payable to <em>Pendleton </em>or bearer, for 200 dollars j and for passing and uttering the check as genuine, knowing it to be a forgery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b718-12\">At the trial, the attorney for the commonwealth called a witness, <em>Dudley, </em>who testified, that he received a check from the prisoner, of which he retained a copy and delivered the original to <em>D. Miller; </em>he produced the copy which corresponded exactly with the check described in the indictment. <em>Miller </em>testified, that he delivered the original check to <em>D. Wilson. Wilson </em>testified, that he delivered it, with sundry other checks, to <em>J. Talley ; </em>that <em>Talley, </em>in his presence, burned all the checks so delivered to him except one which he kept; but whether the one so kept by <em>Talley, </em>was the same that was delivered by <em>Dudley </em>to <em>Miller </em>and by <em>Miller </em>to this witness, he did not know. <em>Talley </em>testified, that he received several checks from <em>Wilson, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>burned all but one, which he retained and put in his pocket book ; that\u2018be had since seen it among his papers; that two or three weeks before the trial, he had looked among his papers for the check, and for other purposes, and could not find it; that not having been apprised that he was to be examined as a witness till he was called, he had made no thorough search among his papers for the single purpose of finding the check; he did not know that it had been destroyed ; it was possible that it was still among his papers; but be believed it was not among them, and that it was lost. The attorney for the commonwealth then shewed a written notice, which had been served on the prisoner some time before the trial, that he would be required to produce the check (describing it) at the trial, and that if it should not be produced, other evidence of its contents, character and description, would be offered to sustain the prosecution. And, accordingly, the original not being produced, he offered secondary evidence of the contents, character and description, of the check ; namely, the copy of it produced by <em>Dudley. </em>The prisoner\u2019s counsel objected, that such secondary evidence, if competent in any case, was not competent under the circumstances proved in this case. But the court being satisfied that it was impracticable to produce the original check, and that reasonable diligence had been used to procure it without effect, overruled the objection, and admitted the secondary evidence; to which opinion the counsel for the prisoner filed exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b719-4\">The jury found the prisoner guilty, and the court sentenced him to imprisonment in the penitentiary for two years, according to the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b719-5\">And now he presented a petition to this court for a writ of error, assigning for error, the admission of the secondary evidence of the contents, character and description of the check.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b719-10\"><em>Scott, </em>for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_kD\">To permit the prosecutor to resort to evidence of the contents of a paper alleged to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>forged, without producing the original, except in cases where the paper is withheld by the accused, or has been destroyed by <em>him, </em>or by his procurement, would be to deprive him, in many cases, of the highest evidence of his innocence. It would render him unable to prove the paper genuine. If, indeed, the original be traced to the possession of the prisoner, and he will not produce it, or- if it be shewn that he has destroyed it, or procured it to be destroyed ; in any such case, it is admitted, secondary evidence of its contents would be proper. But, in a case like this, in which the paper, if destroyed or lost at all, has been destroyed or lost by another person, without the procurement, connivance or knowledge of the prisoner; as the absence of the primary evidence may deprive the prisoner of the means of making a just defence, without any fault of his own, the secondary evidence ought not to be admitted. Accordingly, it will be found on examination, that in all the cases in which secondary evidence of the contents of a paper charged to be forged, has been admitted, a foundation has been laid for the admission of the secondary evidence, by proof that the original was in the possession of the accused <em>himself, </em>or had been destroyed by <em>him,. </em>1 Cbitt. Crim. Law 566, 7. and the cases there cited. It is obvious, that a notice to the party, to produce an original paper, shewn by the prosecutor not to be in his possession, or within his reach or control, is nugatory; and the requisition of such notice, therefore, shews the necessity of tracing the paper to his possession. But, in the present case, was there any foundation laid for the admission of the secondary evidence ? The original was traced to the witness <em>Talley. </em>He testified, that he kept one check and burned others; that two or three weeks before, he had looked over his papers to find the check he did retain, and for other purposes, and could not find it; but he had not made a thorough search among his papers with the single purpose of finding this paper; nor could he have done so, being called as a witness suddenly and unexpectedly : he <em>believed </em>it was lost. Surely, for aught that ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>pears, the paper may be still in existence among <em>Talley\u2019s </em>papers; and time should (as it certainly might) have been given him, to make a thorough search for it. <em>\u00b0</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b721-8\">Summers, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AKC\">The question is, whether the circumstances proved formed a sufficient ground for the admission of the secondary evidence of the contents, character and description, of the check? The general rule, which runs alike through civil and criminal proceedings, that the best evidence which the nature of the case admits of must be produced, is intended to preclude all testimony, which from its very nature supposes that the party offering it has it in his power to produce better evidence. But wherever an original paper is shewn to have been lost or destroyed, or is in the hands of the party himself, the prosecutor may give a copy in evidence, or if not, parol evidence of its contents; because, in each of those cases, the presumption of the prosecutor having it in his power to produce better evidence is repelled. In this case, the inquiry seems to be narrowed down to the sufficiency of the search made by the witness <em>Talley, </em>for the original paper. His testimony is not so perfectly simple, direct and positive, as it might have been; but the bare possibility that the paper might have been found on a more diligent search, was no good reason for excluding the evidence. The burning of the checks handed to <em>Talley </em>by <em>Wilson, </em>made it extremely doubtful, whether the check on which the prosecution was founded, was not one of those committed to the flames, probably for the protection of the prisoner. If the retained check may have been the one in question, the failure to produce it was not owing to any fault of the prosecutor; nor can any presumption possibly arise of an unjust suppression by him of the primary evidence. The mind of the witness <em>Talley </em>himself was satisfied, that the paper was lost; and the judge, to whom this preliminary inquiry belonged, was satisfied by the examination, of the correctness of the conclusion of the witness. This court ought not to interfere, unless error is made apparent. We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>unanimously of opinion, that there is no error. If authorities be necessary to sustain this opinion, they may be found in 2 Russel on Crimes, book 6. ch. 3. \u00a7 2. p. 674. and the cases there referred to, and the case of <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>3 Mass. Rep. 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Writ of error denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
