B. Gilliam </em>against <em>Anna Moore, </em>for a parcel of land described in the declaration as being \u201c so much of a larger parcel of land lying part in <em>Hanover </em>and part in <em>Goochland </em>counties, containing by estimation 560 acres, more or less, and adjoining the lands of <em>E. L., S. M., W. W. </em>and others, as lies in the county of Goochland.\u201d Upon the trial, the jury found a special verdict, stating, in substance, the following case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-8\"><em>W. B. Gilliam </em>being seized in fee of the 560 acres of land, whereof the land in question was parcel, sold the whole 560 acres to <em>J. S. Moore, </em>for \u00a31000. and conveyed the same to him by deed of bargain and sale, dated the 10th October 1804; and <em>Moore, </em>on the same day, by deed of bargain and sale (purporting to be the deed of <em>Moore </em>and <em>Anna </em>hi\u2019s wife, but she never executed it) conveyed the land to trustees, upon trust to secure payment of the purchase money to <em>Gilliam. </em>Several years afterwards, the whole 560 acres of land was duly sold by the trustees, in pursuance of the deed of trust, to pay the purchase money due to <em>Gilliam; </em>and at that sale, <em>Gilliam </em>himself became the purchaser, and the trustees conveyed the land to him ; but before he got possession of it, <em>Moore </em>died. <em>Moore\u2019s </em>mansion house was on that part of the land which lay in <em>Goochland; </em>and his widow <em>Anna Moore </em>claimed to hold possession of this part on which the mansion house was situated, until dower of the whole tract should be assigned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>her, under the provisions of the statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 107. \u00a7 2. p. 403. And the question of law upon the verdiet, was, whether <em>Mrs. Moore </em>was entitled to dower of the 560 acres of land or not ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-3\">The circuit court gave judgement for her; to which, upon the petition of <em>Gilliam,, </em>this court awarded a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-4\"><em>Daniel </em>and <em>Lyons, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgT\">said, there could be no doubt, that the conveyance of the land by <em>Gilliam </em>to <em>Moore, </em>and the reconveyance thereof by <em>Moore </em>to the trustees to secure the purchase money to <em>Gilliam, </em>were contemporary, and, in fact and in law, parts of one and the same transaction; and that <em>Gilliam\u2019s </em>seizin was merely transitory as well as instantaneous, and, therefore, his widow was not entitled to dower. They cited Co. Litt. 31b . 1 Rop. on Prop. 370. 2 Bac. Abr. Dower, c. 2. p. 370. <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Finney, </em>4 Mass. Rep. 566. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Munroe, </em>14 Id. 351. <em>Stow </em>v. <em>Tifft, </em>15 Johns. Rep. 458. <em>Childers </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>Gilm. 200.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-7\"><em>Forbes </em>and <em>Nicholas, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALJ\">insisted, that the verdict did not find, with certainty, that the conveyance by <em>Gilliam </em>to <em>Moore, </em>and the reconveyance by <em>Moore </em>to the trustees, were contemporary, much less that they were in fact, or were intended to be, parts of the same transaction ; and the court could not supply the defects of the verdict by intendment or inference from the facts found. For aught that appeared, <em>Gilliam </em>might have made his conveyance to <em>Moore, </em>and <em>Moore </em>being unable to secure the purchase money otherwise, might have agreed to secure it by the deed of trust, after <em>Gilliam\u2019s </em>conveyance to him was executed and delivered, and might have executed the deed of trust in pursuance of such subsequent agreement. In such case, <em>Moore\u2019s </em>seizin, however short its duration, and though it might have been momentary or instantaneous, would not have been merely transitory, and his widow would have been entitled to dower. Therefore, <em>Gilliam </em>was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>entitled to judgement on this verdict. They also objected, <em>. \u2022 </em>that the description of the parcel of land claimed in the declaration was so vague and uncertain, that it could not be known whether the circuit court of <em>Goochland </em>had jurisdiction over the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-7\"><em>Lyons </em>in reply, shewed, by a critical examination of the declaration, that there was no ground for the last objection.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b54-9\"> This seems to be part of the same controversy which was before this court in <em>1817, Moore </em>v. <em>Gilliam, </em>5 Munf. 346.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b56-8\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Akk\">The first and principal question arising on this special verdict is, whether under the deed from <em>Gilliam </em>to <em>Moore, </em>a title to the land vested in <em>Moore, </em>whereof his wife was dowable ? I am clearly of opinion, that she was not dowable. It was objected, that the verdict has not found, that the deeds were executed at the same time, and as parts of the same transaction, and that, this being a special verdict, we cannot draw this inference; but to my mind the finding is abundant to justify, and indeed to compel, the conclusion, that the two instruments were parts of one and the same transaction, and that the seizin of <em>Moore </em>was that instantaneous seizin, spoken of in the books, where the land was merely <em>in transitu, </em>and never vested in the husband. The deeds bear the same date; they are between the same parties; relative to the same subject matter. The vendor conveys the land, for so much money; the vendee reconveys it to secure that money. It is impossible to doubt for a moment, the meaning, connection and (I may say) unity, of the transaction. We have no reported case in our own books directly in point j and this, no doubt, has resulted from the general impression of the bar, that no such right existed in the widow; for the case must have happened a thousand times. The english books, however, all lay down the position that a transitory seizin in the husband for an instant, does not entitle the wife to dower, and the point has been decided in the same way, in <em>Massachusetts </em>and <em>New York. </em>A different decision at this day, would be exceedingly mischievous, and open an inexhaustible source of litigation. With respect to the objection taken on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>of uncertainty, it seems to have been founded in misappretension of the meaning of the declaration. I think the judgement ought to be reversed, and judgement entered for the plaintiff on the special verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Cabell, J. I am of the same opinion. The jury having found that the deed by which <em>Moore </em>acquired title to the land, and also that by which he conveyed it in trust to secure the payment of the purchase money, were both executed on the same day, J am of opinion, that both deeds must, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be regarded as having been executed at the same time, and to have constituted parts of one and the same transaction; and consequently, that <em>Mrs. Moore </em>is not entitled to dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Tucker, P. I have no doubt that the description of the land demanded by the declaration is sufficiently certain, and that no part of what is demanded, lies beyond the county line of <em>Goochland, </em>and so out of the jurisdiction of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Nor have I any doubt as to the operation of the deed from the trustee to <em>Gilliam. </em>That deed was executed shortly before <em>Moore's </em>death. It is found, that <em>Moore </em>was in possession at his death, and that the widow was in possession at the time of the verdict; but no adverse possession is found. This will never be presumed against the true owner, but the law will rather presume, unless the contrary is proved, that the party who has possession holds it for the owner. And this is done not only to uphold his right, but because <em>the </em>law will always presume that the acts of the party are rightful rather than wrongful. If in this case (as we think) the widow has no title to dower, and if her possession is <em>adverse, </em>then she is a trespasser or disseizor. This the court cannot presume. The jury must find it, and hence the rule that adverse possession must always be expressly found, or such facts as amount to it incontestibly.</p>\n<p id=\"A5d\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The real question, in this case, is as to the right of dower. \u2022 The authorities cited by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, leave no doubt that where the vendor passes the title to the vendee, and at the same time takes a mortgage or deed of trust for the security of the purchase money, in which the wife of the vendee does not join, she will nevertheless take her dower in the estate subject to the trust or mortgage. In such case, the husband is seized but for an instant, and not beneficially for his own use; the deed of conveyance, and the mortgage or deed of trust, are to be considered, like the levy of a fine, as parts of the same transaction and of the same contract; as taking effect at the same instant, and as constituting but one act. If both contracts were contained in the same instrument, there could be no doubt; and it is the same thing though they are contained in different instruments, provided they are parts of the same contract, and make together but one transaction. That they are parts of the same transaction, must be presumed where they are executed at the same time; and, moreover, as they cannot be absolutely isochronous, as there must be some interval, however small, the court ought always to take the same day to mean the same time, unless the contrary be found,\u2014unless it be found, that the acts were separate, distinct and independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Judgement reversed, and judgement entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
