Eppes, you have <em>greatly deceived me, </em>as \u201c to the thirds of that landthe defendant replied, \u201c that <em>he had ; </em>but that he had written to his brother \u201c concerning the business, and had got his answer, and \u201c that it should be settled directly; and you (meaning \u201c the plaintiff) <em>shall be paid therefor to your satisfac- </em>\u201c <em>tionf </em>It was further proved, \u201c that <em>Hamlin </em>Eppes, ** the former husband of the plaintiff <em>Rebecca, </em>and un- \u201c d r whom the plaintiffs claim, died in the month of \u201c <em>June, </em>1774 ; that the defendant was then in posses- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u201c sion, to wit, in 1787, and had been ever since the \u201c year 1774, <em>before the death of Hamlin </em>Eppes, of the \u201c land, to one-third of which, as dower, to wit, 252 \u201c acres, <em>the plaintiffs were entitled in right of the plain- </em>\u201c <em>tiff </em>Rebecca, until the year 1794, when dower was as- \u201c signed the plaintiffs, by a decree of <em>Dinwiddle </em>County \u201c Court in Chancery.\u201d It was further proved, \u201c that \u201c the said land was worth at least fifteen pounds <em>per an- </em>\u201c <em>num ; </em>and this being all the evidence introduced by \u201c the plaintiffs,\u201d the defendant demurred.

Taylor </em>and <em>Robertson, </em>for the appellants, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANI\">1st. That, upon the facts disclosed in the demurrer, the action of assumpsit, for use and occupation, was not maintainable ; 2d. That the promise (whatever it intended) having been made in 178-7, and the plaintiff having, seven years after, to wit, in 1794, claimed and obtained an assignment of dower against the said defendant by a decree of <em>Dinzviddie </em>Court, by such subsequent proceedings relinquished the benefit they might have claimed from such assumpsit, and either obtained, or might have obtained, by that decree, full satisfaction for the time that the dower was withheld.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-12\">1st. In support of the first point, they argued, that <em>assumpsit </em>would not lie for rent, before the stat. 11 <em>Geo. </em>II. c. 19. which never was in force in this country ; and\" that <em>assumpsit </em>for use and occupation even under that statute, can only be maintained where the defendant holds by permission of, or by demise from, the plaintiff :<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> therefore such action will not lie, where the possession has been <em>adverse </em>or <em>tortious.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Here there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>proof of possession by permission of, or contract with the plaintiffs <em>; </em>but, on the contrary, the possession appears to have been <em>adverse ; </em>for the defendant is in possession before <em>Hamlin Eppes's </em>death, and remains so until 1794. Until 1794 the plaintiffs never are in possession. They then obtain it in consequence of a suit in chancery, laying claim, to dower. This long continued possession of the defendant, (against those who never were in possession until the decree of a Court bestowed it upon them,) without paying any rent in the mean time, is utterly irreconcilable with a possession by permission, or under contract. The presumption is, that he held as fee-simple proprietor by a purchase from <em>Hamlin Eppes. </em>If he did not, but was his <em>tenant </em>merely, he, after hi\u00bb death, either paid or was liable to pay rent to his heir at law, in whom was the reversion, and not to his widow, who had claim to no part of that rent till her dower was assigned. And, again, the widow (if h\u00e9 had held under a contract with her) would not have sued <em>her own tenant </em>for an <em>assignment of dower </em>but would have turned him out of possession by ejectment. These circumstances, therefore, shew an adverse possession, and not one by contract or permission.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-9\">Nor does the conversation in 1787 make any difference. For <em>Cole </em>reproaches <em>Eppes </em>for deceiving him respecting <em>those </em>thirds, not then laid off. <em>Eppes </em>admits it, and says he has written to his brother <em>respecting the business. </em>What business ? The same thirds, not yet laid off, but claimed. The conversation evidently related altogether to compensation for the <em>value of the </em>thirds, not <em>for </em>the <em>use and occupation.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-10\">But, even if this could be interpreted a promise (in consideration of her loss) for the rent, instead of the thirds of the land itself, it would not be obligatory ; be- \u2022 cause the previous use and occupation having not been by her consent or permission, such promise was on a groundless or frivolous consideration.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> A previous moral obligation to pay would have made it binding:<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>but, if the defendant were <em>Hcanlin Eppes\u2019s </em>tenant, he was under no moral obligation to pay rent to the <em>widow, </em>when the law makes him liable to pay it to the <em>heir.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-4\">If he had bought the land of <em>Hamlin Eppes, </em>he paid a \u00b0 _ \u2019 r consideration for it, under the idea of obtaining a complete <em>title; </em>and, having paid that consideration, under what moral obligation is he to pay 19 years\u2019 rent for finding himself deceived in the bargain ? But, independent of these objections, the promise was without consideration, because the demandant in a writ of dower can in no case recover damages where she has delayed herself; and, where her husband did not die seised, can never recover them at all.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> And, therefore, in sundry suits for dower, brought by Mrs. <em>Elizabeth Braxton, </em>the Chancellor gave her no rents but from the date of his interlocutory decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-7\">And such a promise, under such circumstances, even if it were not for dower, would be void for its insufficiency and uncertainty; for, suppose that <em>A. </em>breaks <em>B.\u2019s </em>nose, or kicks his breech, and afterwards promises to pay him for the outrage to his satisfaction, could <em>assumpsit </em>be maintained on such a promise ? No : the party must still resort to his action of assault and battery. So here the remedy is not by <em>assumpsit, </em>for the deforcement of dower is as much a <em>tort </em>as an assault; and in <em>4 Bac. Abr. (Gwill. </em>ed.) p. <em>44. adfnan, </em>tit. <em>Rent, </em>letter K. the doctrine is laid down, that <em>assumpsit </em>fox-use and occupation lies only <em>for a sum in gross.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0R\">2d. In support of the second point, they observed, that even <em>without </em>such promise, the damages were recoverable in the suit in Chancery, if the plaintiffs were <em>legally </em>entitled to them; <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of course, <em>with </em>such pr<em>om</em>ise. Will the Court, then, permit the same plaintiff to vex the same defendant by two actions for the same cause, when one action would have settled the whole ? It is laid down, that no action shall be maintained which it is contrary to the policy of the law to support, <footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Now, however it may be consonant with the policy of <em>lawyers </em>to support such an action, it cannot be the policy of the law, if, indeed, its purpose be justice. Therefore, if a man were to bring <em>detinue </em>for a slave, and ask no damages for his hire, he w'ould not be permitted to claim such damages in a subsequent action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-7\"><em>Hay, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_K\">The declaration charges, that the defendant held by the permission of the plaintiff Rebecca, and the circumstances disclosed by the testimony are sufficient to authorize a conclusion, that such was the fact. But, suppose he was guilty of a trespass, and illegally entered on the land, his subsequent promise was sufficient to bind him : the tort, if any, was thereby waived, and he held by the permission of the plaintiff. It does not appear under what rigiit <em>Peter Eppes </em>was in possession : it may be inferred, from his length of possession, that he was a purchaser of the land. But, although he may be regarded as a purchaser from <em>Hamlin </em>Eppes, the moment of his death his widow had a complete right to dower. Since, then, she did not bring suit, for so many years, the inference is inevitable, that <em>Peter Eppes </em>held in virtue of a contract with her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-8\">It is objected that the promise related to <em>the thirds oj the soil itself </em>and not to <em>rent. </em>But the words were, <em>u </em>I will <em>pay </em>you to your satisfaction.\u201d If what he said had related to the soil, would he not have said, \u201c I will \u201c have your wife\u2019s third of the land laid off?\u201d The plain import of the words was a promise to pay money; and this, of itself amounted to a contract, if one had not existed before. The Jury might have inferred a contract, and, on demurrer to evidence, the Court has a rigni to infer whatever the Jury might.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-9\">It is said, too, that <em>assumpsit </em>tor use and occupation lies only whore the contract is lor a <em>specific sum. </em>The authorities cited do not support the <em>position; </em>and 1 <em>Supp. </em>to <em>Viner, </em>124. 4 <em>Esp. Rep. 59. </em>and 1 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. <em>(Gwill. </em>ed.) <em>257. </em>are authorities to the contrary. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>passage last cited from <em>Bacon, </em>it is said, that before the <em>9 </em>4 statute 11 Geo. XI. c. 19. it was holden, that this action^ was maintainable <em>u </em>where there was no stipulation <em>for any express rent r </em>citing <em>Mason </em>v. Welland, Skinner, 238. 242. S. C. in 3 <em>Mod. 73. </em>by the name of <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Beldham.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-11\">But, if there was no <em>legal </em>obligation, the defendant was under a <em>moral </em>obligation to pay; and this was sufficient to support an <em>assumpsit; </em>as in the case of a promise to pay a debt barred by the act of limitations, or of a bankrupt promising payment, after having obtained his certificate. The delay of the widow to bring suit was occasioned by the promises of the defendants, and the confidence reposed in them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-12\">I admit, that in a writ of dower damages are not recoverable, except when the husband died seised. But that makes no difference in this case. The parties surely could settle their own rights as they pleased. The widow could have recovered the <em>land </em>sooner, and, after recovering it, might, it is agreed, have rented it to <em>Eppes. </em>If so, were not the parties at liberty to make a contract without the expense and trouble of a previous recovery ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-13\">As to the second point, that the rent might have been recovered in the suit in chancery ; the rule of law, that two actions shall not be brought where one would do, is <em>general, </em>but <em>not universal. </em>A person may bring ejectment and trespass, for the mesne profits. So, in <em>detinue </em>for slaves, the great object is the <em>title </em>of the slaves, and not <em>hire. </em>If slaves be recovered, and no hire given, a Court of Chancery will entertain jurisdiction for an account of the profits. In like manner\", if a Court of Chancery, in a case before it, does not ail that it might, this is no reason why a Court of Law shotfd turn the plaintiff out of doors. But could it have been done in this case ? Where the husband does not die seised, the widow cannot recover; damages at law ; and equity follows the law.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Suppose, then, the bill had demanded damages, the Court would not have given them. If this particular contract had been stated, the Court of Chancery would have said, 44 We have nothing to do with this : institute your ac- . , tion at law upon the special agreement, and you will recover damages there.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b183-7\">\n<em>Wednesday, November 8.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAqn\">The J udges pronounced their, opinions.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b178-6\"> 1 <em>Esp. </em>N. <em>P. </em>20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\"> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A-0\"> <em>1 Esp.

It is impossible not to understand it as re* cognising the plaintiff\u2019s right thereto, and the defendant\u2019s obligation to make him satisfaction for the enjoyment he had had of it, which he had failed to do, according to some <em>previous promise; </em>the acknowledgment of the defendant, <em>that he deceived </em>the plaintiff, will admit of no other construction ; for unless he had <em>promised, </em>he could not have <em>deceived </em>him. The subsequent promise, that the plaintiff should be <em>paid therefor to his </em>satisfaction, is amply sufficient to support the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>count, which is a <em>quantum </em>valebat, for the use and oecupation of a plantation for a certain number of years. -^nc* 1 think a Jury might well have inferred, from this evidence, that the defendant had agreed to pay the \", \u00b0 r <em>J </em>plaintiff for the same, so long as he should occupy and enjoy it, which would also support the first count. The nature of the right of the plaintiffs, thus <em>acknowledged </em>by the defendant, cannot, after the <em>enjoyment </em>of the land, under them, be necessary to be inquired into. If there had been no demurrer to the evidence, I think the Jury ought to have found a verdict for the plaintiff, and therefore think the District Court gave a correct judgment upon the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">The next question is in the nature of a motion in arrest of judgment; namely, whether this <em>action </em>of <em>assumpsit, </em>for the use and occupation of a plantation, lies in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-16\">We are told by Mr. <em>Espinasse, </em>(1 <em>Nisi </em>Prius, 20.) that the action of <em>assumpsit </em>for use and occupation was given by stat. 11 <em>Geo. </em>II. c. 19. which was never in force in this country. Judge Butter, in his treatise on the same subject^ p. 138. says, at common law it was holden, that <em>assumpsit </em>would lie for rent on an <em>express </em>promise; but not upon an <em>implied </em>promise ; and such express promise must have been made, <em>at the same time with the lease ; </em>and for this he cites 3 <em>Lev. 150.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJd\">Mr. <em>Espinasse </em>does not appear to be altogether correct in this passage. The action for use and occupation was not given by the statute of <em>George: </em>it had been used at least from the time of <em>James </em>the first, as the case of <em>Dartual </em>v. Morgan<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> clearly proves; and the case of <em>How </em>v. <em>Norton</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>shews it was in use in the time of his son <em>Charles </em>II. and a variety of other cases mightbe shewn to prove the same thing. We are told by Judge <em>Bathurst, </em>that the statute was made for the benefit of landlords, and to prevent tenants from putting them to <em>difficulties </em>(after enjoyment of the lands) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>In recovering their rents under <em>parol </em>demises or agreements ; for, before the statute, in actions for the use and .occupation, the landlords were continually nonsuited, by the tenants\u2019 proving, at the trial, some <em>parol </em>demise, or <em>memorandum </em>in writing-, <em>amounting to a demise; </em>for, in that <em>case, </em>the landlord ought to have brought an action of <em>debt, </em>and not case, on <em>assumpsit; </em>which was remedied by the statute. That this was the true reason for making the statute, will appear by the cases on the the subject, from the time of Hobart.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\">I shall now notice some cases where actions similar to the present have been brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The case of <em>Darinal </em>v. <em>Morgan(b) </em>was an action of <em>assumpsit: </em>\u201c Whereas the plaintiff <em>loeasset </em>to the de- \u201c fendanl a certain warehouse, the defendant assumed \u201c to pay him, for every week that he occupied it, eight, \u201c shillings ; and alleges, in fact, that he occupied it \u201c twenty-seven weeks ; for which, upon not paying \u201c upon request, the action war. brought. Upon <em>non </em>as* \u201c sumpsit, and verdict for the plaintiff, the, defendant \u201c moved, in arrest of judgment, that this is a lease, (at. \u201c least at will,) and the eight shillings weekly is in na\u00bb <em>sl </em>ture of rent, and for rent reserved in the lease, (which \u201c sounds in the realty,) <em>assumpsit </em>lies not; nor for ic debt, upon a specialty, or upon record. But here.\u00bf forasmuch as this is not a lease, but a promise* e\u2018 that as long as he permitted him to occupy the ware-e\u2018 house he would pay it, it is not any rent, but merely a promise in consideration of occupying, &amp;c. Where- \u201c fore this action well lay <em>; </em>and it was adjudged for the \u2022\u00ab plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The case of <em>Bard </em>v. <em>Bard</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was also an action of assumpsit, in which the plaintiff declared upon an insi<em>mul </em>computassent, concerning the arrearages of rent issuing out of defendant\u2019s land, and about payment of a legacy due to the plaintiff by his father\u2019s decree. The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit: </em>and found against' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>him, and, on motion, in arrest of judgment, the plaintiff had judgment j for that they accounting together, and the defendant promising to pay, was a sufficient cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">In <em>Sleeck </em>v. Bowsal,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the plaintiff declared in <em>as-, sumpsit, </em>for that whereas the defendant was indebted to him in the <em>Si. pro redditu ante tunc </em>debito, the defendant promised to pay that <em>Si. </em>whenever required <em>; </em>and alleged in fact, that, after such a day and year, he made a request, and the defendant hath not paid him. Defendant pleaded <em>payment ; </em>and found against him. And it was moved, in arrest of judgment, that the declaration was not good, because he doth not shew when the rent was due, nor for what term, nor upon what contract. Yet, because the defendant had taken notice thereof, <em>affirming he had paid it, </em>and issue thereupon* and found against him, the declaration is made <em>good.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\"><em>How </em>v. <em>Norton,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was also an action of assumpsit* in consideration the plaintiff would permit the defendant to enjoy such land, and that he permitted him to enjoy it three years, and that it was worth <em>101. per annum. </em>After verdict for the plaintiff, it was moved, in arrest of judgment, 1st. That it does not appear that the plaintiff had any title to the land ; 2d. If he had title, that <em>debt </em>lies, and not <em>this action. </em>But the Court held the contrary on both points, and gave judgment for the plaintiff. This case appears to me to be expressly in point, there being no other difference that I can perceive, than that it was after a verdict <em>; </em>whereas, in the case before us, there is a demurrer to evidence. But if the Court, when substituted for the Jury, find the evidence sufficient to maintain the issue on the part of the plaintiff, the effect appears to me to be the same as if the Jury had found a general verdict for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">Professor <em>Wooddeson, </em>speaking of the action of <em>assumpsit, </em>(vol. 3. p. 152.) says, \"We have heretofore seen 44 that it cannot be brought on a writing under seal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>therefore, for example, not on an indenture of lease <em>cc for </em>the rent thereby reserved. Neither, as it was an- \u201c cientiy said, will the law <em>imply </em>any promise to pay the 6t rent in a parol lease <em>; </em>for, in the technical phrase, the demand savours of the realty, and there are other \u201c remedies ; by action of debt, though that too is a person-<em>u </em>al action, and by <em>distress. </em>But if there be in fact a <em>col- </em>\u201c <em>lateral </em>and <em>express promise </em>to pay the rent, <em>and no </em>\u201c <em>deed executed wider </em>seal, it may be recovered in this \u201c mode ; because it appears, that the promiser intended \u201c to give the plaintiff this' additional remedy. This ac- \u201c tion is also maintainable, to obtain a recompense for \u201c the <em>occupation </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s land, by his permis- \u201c sion, where there is <em>no stipulation for any precise \u201c rent. </em>The declaration states a promise of the de~ <em>u </em>fendant to pay so much as the landlord reasonably de~ served to have for such permission <em>; </em>which promise <em>u </em>may be implied by law. For, there being no <em>certain </em>\u201c rent, the plaintiff could neither distrain, nor, proper- \u201c ly, perhaps, bring an action of debt; this seems the \u201c plaintiff\u2019s genuine remedy. If, therefore, it may be a allowed at all, the promise ,may well be implied j and \u201c though a precise rent was agreed for, (and consequent- \u201c ly there was an actual promise of payment, which, \u201c however, the plaintiff has not evidence to prove,) yet, \u201c <em>in this </em>way, he may recover satisfaction. Scarce any <em>u </em>thing ir, more usual than such an action of <em>assumpsit </em>\u201c for the use and occupation of the plaintiff\u2019s house by \u201c his permission, which also being a real estate, the \u201c same objection, if any, might in that case be alleged \u201c against <em>implying </em>a promise of making adequate com- \u201c pensation.\u201d In the present case an <em>express promise </em>to pay the plaintiffs to their <em>satisfaction </em>has been proved <em>; </em>but were it otherwise, according to the opinion of Judge <em>Buller </em>himself, in the case of <em>Birch </em>v. <em>Wright,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the action may be maintained either upon an express, or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>implied </em>contract; for which he cites the authority of Lord Mansfield., in the case of <em>Carmier </em>v. Mercer, which I have never seen.</p>\n<p id=\"AMz0\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment be af<em>r </em>, iirmedo</p>\n<author id=\"b188-6\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"A6vO\">As the declaration in this case states an <em>express </em>promise to pay for the use of the land of the appellee, of which it is further stated, a he had, before that time, <em>by the permission and </em>assent of the appel- \u201c lant, had the use and occupation,\u201d I have no doubt but that the action is sustainable. But, understanding that the point presented by the case of <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Mandeville </em>is, whether this action is maintainable without proof of an <em>express </em>promise, I have not anticipated the consideration of that question <em>; </em>though I doubt not that the doctrines mentioned by the Judge who preceded me, on that point, are correctly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\"><em>t </em>Upon the demurrer to evidence I think the District Court decided correctly, and am for affirming the judgement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b184-17\"> <em>Cro.Jac.508</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"A4AQ\"> 1 <em>Lev.179.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b185-10\"><em> Green </em>v. <em>Harrington, Hob. </em>234. 1 <em>Brownl. </em>14.
