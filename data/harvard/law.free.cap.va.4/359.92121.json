But it was executed before the commencement of the term. After the term, <em>JYiblo </em>filed his declaration at the rules; whereupon a.conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>judgement by default for want of appearance, was entered against <em>Hare </em>by the clerk, which was confirmed at the succeeding rules; so that the case stood among the office judgements at the then next term. But owing to a vacancy in the office of judge of the court, that term was lost, and all the pending causes stood over till the succeeding term; when <em>Hare\u2019s </em>counsel moved the court to quash the writ and all the proceedings had thereon in the office, on the ground that the writ bad been made returnable not <em>to the first day </em>of a term of the court, but <em>to the term, </em>generally, and was s\u00f3 irre-guiar. The court overruled the motion. <em>Hare, </em>thereupon, pleaded to the action; and there was a trial, verdict and judgement for <em>JYiblo. </em>And then <em>Hare </em>applied to a judge of this court for a <em>supersedeas; </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-4\"><em>Allison, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdN\">Formerly, writs in actions in the circuit court, were required to be made returnable <em>to the next court, </em>generally; Rev. Code of 1792, ch. 66. &lt;\u00a7&gt; 21. Pleasants\u2019s edi. p. 77. and the process might be served at any time during the term to which it was returnable; <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>Long\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>4 <em>Hen. </em>&amp; Munf. 212. In that case, <em>Roane, </em>J. dissented; and the inconvenience of having no particular return day for such process, was clearly pointed out in his opinion. To remedy this inconvenience, the legislature provided, that every writ of <em>capias ad respondendum </em>shall be returnable, at the option of the plaintiff, either to the <em>first day </em>of the next succeeding term, or in the clerk\u2019s office to some previous rule day; 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 70. p. 507. The writ in this case, therefore, was clearly naught, and furnished no foundation for any proceedings at rules upon it. The court ought to have quashed the writ and the proceedings upon it in the office; for the statute provides, that the court, in term, shall have control over all proceedings in the office during the preceding vacation, and may correct any mistakes or errors, and for good cause set aside the rules and proceedings, and make such order concerning them as may be just and right; Id. &gt;\u00a7&gt; 77. p. 508. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>And if the court shall not be held at any stated term, all pending matters and causes stand over in the same plight to the next term. Id. ch. 69. \u00a7 8. p. 230.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-6\"><em>Wyndham Robertson, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqr\">The provision of the statute of 1819, requiring that writs shall be made returnable to the first day of the succeeding term, might defeat a writ made returnable to the term generally, in case the w'rit were executed during the term but after the first day (which as the law formerly stood, was perhaps permissible, according to the judgement in <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>Long\u2019s adm\u2019r) </em>; but this new provision does not require the abatement of a writ, which, though made returnable to the term generally, has been in fact executed before the term, and returned to the first day of it, as was the case here. The statute does not require, that the writ shall, on its face, be <em>made </em>returnable, but only that it shall be returnable, to the first day of the term; and if it is in fact executed, and returned the first day, it is enough. Even under the former law, judge <em>Roane </em>thought, that a writ returnable to the term generally, should be intended to be returnable to the first day of the term. But, in truth, this motion to quash the writ for irregularity, was in substance and effect, a plea in abatement of the writ; and, as such a plea could not have been received after office judgement; so neither ought this motion to quash the writ, to have been entertained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-7\"><em>Allison, </em>in reply. If the writ was irregular, all the proceedings on it in the office were also irregular, for they had no foundation but the writ. To say that the motion to quash, is equivalent to a plea in abatement, and therefore cannot be heard after office judgement, were, in effect, to deny the control of the court over proceedings in the office, in every case in which there has been an office judgement. This would render the provision, which gives the court such control over the proceedings in the office, almost intirely nugatory.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b385-8\">\n<em>Per curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ayz\">The judgement is to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
