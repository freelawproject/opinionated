He referred to the form of a mere warranty real, and compared it with the covenant in this case. The form of a warranty, properly so called, was thus: <em>\u201c </em>And I the said <em>W. </em>and my heirs and assigns, all the said parcel of land with all its appurtenances, to the said J. and his heirs and assigns, against all mankind will warrant forever.\u201d 2 Black. Comm. Append. No. 1. But here, the bargainor and his heirs did not <em>warrant, </em>but <em>covenanted for himself and his heirs, that he would warrant; </em>he did not covenant to <em>warrant </em>only, but to warrant <em>and defend; </em>and he covenanted to warrant and defend the <em>title </em>of the land, not the <em>land </em>itself: in all which particulars, it was obvious, the covenantor departed from the terms of a mere warranty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>real: therefore, he contracted for more than such a warranty would have bound him to perform. For, he said, a <em>covenant </em>to warrant was no more a <em>warranty, </em>than a covenant to sell and convey was a sale and conveyance; and the very use of the word <em>covenant </em>imported an intent to incur a personal obligation. The warranty proper, the mere real covenant of warranty, was created by the word <em>warrantizare </em>alone, without more; a covenant to <em>defend, </em>as well as to <em>warrant, </em>was a stipulation different from, and additional to, the <em>warranty, </em>as was clearly pointed out in Co. Litt. \u00a7 773. 383.b 384.a \u201c Where a man is bound upon <em>condition to warrant and defend land </em>to <em>W.

B. pi. 6. p. 27. And lord <em>Hardwicke, </em>in <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Codrington, </em>1 Ves. sen. 516. adverted to the effect of a covenant for assurance of title <em>not being penned as real warranty, </em>and to the difference between a <em>covenant or agreement </em>to warrant, and a <em>warranty, and </em>plainly intimated the opinion, that a covenant to warrant <em>and defend </em>is larger than a covenant to <em>warrant only. </em>Upon these authorities, it was justly remarked by <em>Green, </em>J. in <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Jackson, 2 </em>Rand. 148. that, if a covenant of warranty stipulates not only to <em>warrant </em>but also to defend\u2014 \u00abthe word <em>warrant </em>would be construed technically, so as to bind the warrantor to compensate in lands of equal value, upon voucher or <em>warrantia </em>chartce; the word <em>defend </em>would be considered as making a personal covenant equivalent to a covenant for quiet enjoyment.\u201d Further, the court would find, that the real covenant of warranty always stipulated to warrant the <em>land </em>conveyed itself; but this was a covenant to warrant the <em>title </em>conveyed by the deed, that is, the fee simple in the land ; and so was tantamount to a covenant that the grantor had good title in fee. Therefore, he concluded, that either this was a personal covenant, or it contained both a real and a personal covenant. And, without doubt, in every case of an express personal covenant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>covenantor was bound to make compensation in damages for a breach, and his personal representatives were bound, without being named, unless the covenant be such as determined by his death. 2 Bae. Abr. Covenant. E. 1. p. 69. Shep. Touehs. 178. 2ndly, He admitted, that (as is said in 2 Bac. Abr. Covenant. C. p. 67.) it seemed by the better opinion, that upon the eviction of a freehold, no action would lie upon a warranty either in deed or in law; <em>for </em>the party might have had his <em>warrantia charted </em>or <em>voucher. </em>But it had been adjudged, in an action of covenant upon a warranty real of a freehold estate, of which the breach was that the warrantee had been impleaded and evicted for a term of years, that <em>\u201c </em>the action of covenant would lie ; because, though the warranty was annexed to the freehold, yet the breach and impeaching was not of a freehold but of a chattel, for which there could neither be <em>voucher, rebutter, </em>nor <em>warrantia charted, </em>so that though there had been a judgement in <em>warrantia charted </em>in such case, yet either upon entry or upon recovery in <em>ejectione firmed </em>upon the lease, there could be neither <em>voucher </em>nor <em>rebutter, </em>nor value upon <em>warrantia charter-; </em>and therefore, areal warranty is a covenant real when the freehold is brought in question, but when a lease is in question, or any other loss that doth not draw away the freehold, it may be used as a personal covenant whereupon damages may be recovered ; so it is both a real and a personal covenant to several ends and respects ;\u201d <em>Pincombe v. Rudge, </em>Hob. 3. 28. Now, in the case before the court, the <em>warrantee </em>was impleaded in an ejectment, which being, in form, an action to recover only a term of years, though in effect it involved the whole question of title, the warrantee could have had neither <em>voucher </em>nor <em>warrantia charted </em>against the warrantor; and being evicted, of course, but for a term of years, which did not draw away the freehold, he had a right to use this as a personal covenant; to bring his action of covenant for the breach, and to recover compensation in damages; for, otherwise, he would have had no remedy. 3rdly, He referred to the doubt expressed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>Coalter, </em>J. <em>arguendo, </em>in <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>2 Rand. 156. whether upon a pure warranty, <em>warrantia chartce </em>would lie in <em>Virginia, </em>at this day, when <em>voucher </em>was done away by our statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 34. p. 496. and tQ tjje 0pjn\u00a10n intimated by that judge, that,\u2014since the statute,\u2014considering the obsoleteness of the ancient remedy, its incompatibility with the situation of this country, and the probable' intent of parties in all contracts of warranty,\u2014\u25a0 5t the general sense of the country and sound principles of justice, therefore, require, that all covenants of this kind, however worded, should be considered, as to the remedy in case of eviction as personal covenants of the vendor, that is, that a personal action of covenant will lie on such a warranty.\u201d And the counsel argued that these opinions were just though extrajudicial, and ought at once to be declared the law of the land. To shew the effect of the statute taking away the <em>voucher, </em>upon the remedy by <em>warrantia chartce, </em>how intimately the two remedies were connected, and how essential the <em>voucher </em>was, in many cases, to the efficiency of the <em>warrantia chartce, </em>he cited F. N. B. 134. <em>K. </em>4tbly, He said, all difficulties were obviated by the statute of <em>jeofails, </em>1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 103. p. 512. providing, that no judgement after verdict shall be stayed or reversed\u2014\u201c for any mistake or misconception of the form of action, or for any other defect whatsoever in the declaration or pleadings, whether of form or substance, which might have been taken advantage of, and which shall not have been so taken advantage of.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-5\"><em>Johnson </em>replied, 1st, That though the covenant in question varied from the ancient technical form of a warranty real, in some particulars, yet the variances were wholly immaterial ; they were variances in words, not in sense: and it could hardly be \"maintained, that the real covenant of warranty could only be expressed in one set form of words, and no other could be devised to convey the same meaning and intent. The first variance from the ancient form, was, that the bargainor did not say that <em>he and his heirs would </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>warrant; </em>he only <em>covenanted for himself and his heirs that he would warrant. </em>Now, the definition of a warranty real, was, \u201c a <em>covenant </em>real annexed to lands aud tenements, whereby a man and his heirs are <em>bound </em>to warrant the same$\u201d Co. Litt. 365.a : so that here, the warrantor, without exactly copying the usual form of a warranty real, had expressed his contract in the terms of the definition of such a warranty. In truth, a <em>warranty real, </em>expressed in the strict ancient form, was nothing but a <em>covenant to warrant; </em>a real covenant, of peculiar character and effect, but still only a covenant: for every agreement or consent by two or more, by deed, whereby either promises to the other, that something is done already, or shall be done afterwards, is a covenant <em>; </em>Shep. Touchs. 160, 1. As to the next variance from <em>the </em>ancient form of the warranty real, which had been mentioned, namely, that the warrantor here, stipulated not only to warrant, but to warrant <em>and defend; </em>he said, that was a variance from the form of the warranty real given by <em>Blackstone ; </em>but the form given in <em>Sheppard\u2019s </em>Touchstone, 181. was thus\u2014\u201cI and my heirs will warrant <em>and forever defend </em>to <em>W. S. </em>and his heirs, the said tenements against all men forever.\u201d And he insisted, that when those two phrases are used in one covenant annexed to a conveyance of land only, they made only one covenant, and <em>that </em>a real covenant of warranty, not two distinct covenants, one real and one personal. The opinion of <em>Green, </em>J. in <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>2 Rand. 148. was, he thought, extrajudicial in this respect, and, certainly, was not supported by lord <em>Hardwicke\u2019s </em>reasoning in <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Codrington, </em>1 Ves. sen. 516. for that was the case of a covenant in a conveyance of both real and personal estate, whereby the warrantor obliged himself, his heirs, <em>executors and administrators, </em>to warrant and forever defend both the real and personal estate conveyed ; and the decision was, that this was, in respect to the personal estate, a personal covenant, not (as had been contended) a covenant of warranty real applicable only to the real estate conveyed. In the passage from <em>Bracton, </em>quoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>in Co. Litt. 383.b it was said\u2014\u201c by this phrase <em>we warrant, </em>the warrantor took upon himself an obligation <em>to defend </em>his tenant and his assigns, and their heirs, in possession of the thing granted;\u201d and 2 Tho. Co. Litt. 245. note A. was to tjj0 same effect; so that, here again, the warrantor, in the present case, had only expressed his contract to <em>warrant, </em>according to the legal efFect of the warranty real, which bound him to <em>defend </em>the land granted to the warrantee. Then, as to <em>the </em>peculiarity in this covenant, last relied on, to shew that it was not a mere warranty real,\u2014that it was a covenant to defend the <em>title, </em>not the <em>land </em>itself; he said, it was enough to remark, that the warrantor could nowise defend the <em>land </em>but by defending the <em>title; </em>and had the warrantor <em>been vouched on </em>this warranty, he would only have been called to defend the <em>title. </em>The true test, by which to determine whether the covenant in question was a warranty real or no, was, to ascertain whether <em>voucher </em>or <em>warrantia chartce </em>would have lain upon it, at common law? for if either of those remedies might have been resorted to, this was a mere warranty real. And he contended that <em>voucher </em>or <em>warrantia chartce </em>might have been maintained; to which point he cited <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Prestwidge, </em>4 Mau. &amp;; Selw. 178. 182. 2ndly, Taking this to be a mere warranty real, which bound the warrantor and his heirs to render an equivalent in land only; he said, it resulted from the very nature of the contract, and the authorities were quite clear, that no personal action lay against the warrantor himself, much less against his personal representatives. And to the argument of the counsel of the appellee, that though this might have been true in case the warrantee had been evicted of the whole fee simple warranted, yet it was not true in the actual case, in which he had been impleaded in ejectment, and evicted of only a term of years, and that this was a breach for which a personal action of covenant lay, even though this were a warranty real; he answered, 1. that it had been admitted, that the judgement in ejectment was, in effect, though not in form, an eviction of the whole estate; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>and 2. that the breach laid in the declaration was, that the warrantor had not defended <em>the </em>title\u2014namely, the title conveyed,\u2014the fee simple; and it was necessary to prove that he was evicted of that, in order to establish the breach. 3rdly, He argued, that our statute taking away the remedy by <em>voucher, </em>nowise affected the other remedy that lay at common law on a warranty real,\u2014the remedy by <em>warrantia chartce ; </em>for this lay wherever the warrantee was impleaded in an action in which he could not vouch. F. N. B. 134. D. 4thly, As to the provision in the statute of <em>jeofails, </em>he said, that, if he was right on the main points in debate; if the appellee had, by his own shewing in his declaration, stated a case in which the defendant was clearly exempted from all liability; surely, the statute could not be strained so far as to entitle him, notwithstanding, to a judgement.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b163-5\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX4V\">It was contended for the plaintiff in error, that the covenant declared upon, is a pure warranty which descended upon the heirs of the covenantor, and upon which this action of covenant did not lie against the administrator. In discussing this point, the counsel on both sides went into the ancient and obsolete doctrines of the pure common law warranty, embracing the <em>warrantia chartce, voucher, </em>and other points of learning connected with the subject. The view which I have taken of the covenant in this case, will render it unnecessary to explore this unfrequented path. Whether the writ of <em>warrantia chartce </em>be an existing remedy with us at this day, I shall not undertake to decide: but this I may say,\u2014so entirely have the personal covenants in conveyances superseded the old common law warranty, that there is not one man in ten thousand, who, when he stipulates for a deed with warranty, means to take that common law assurance, which binds the <em>lands only </em>of his vendor, and gives him no remedy hut the <em>warrantia chartce. </em>In truth, this is never the intention of the contracting parties ; and therefore, in the construction of their covenants, I would hold those only to constitute a pure technical war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ranty, which come strictly up to the definition of it by the <em>. . </em>n , 7 7 \u2022 . 7 . ancient writers. <em>Jhgo et heredes mei warrantizabimus m perpetuum: </em>these are the technical words; the alienor for himself and his heirs warrants the lands forever. It is no <em>covenant </em>or <em>agreement </em>to warrant; it is an <em>actual warranty: </em>it is no covenant to warrant the <em>title </em>to the land; it is a warranty of the <em>land itself. </em>In these particulars the covenant before us differs from the warranty real; and the counsel for the defendant in error shewed, that these are by no means mere verbal differences; but if they were, I would, in this case, hold them important. There is another difference, held by lord <em>Hardwicke </em>to be important; which is that here, the word <em>defend </em>is added to the word <em>warrant. </em>Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that this is a personal covenant; that the action well lay against the administrator; and therefore that the judgement of the circuit court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>I am clearly of opinion, that the judgement should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Brooke, <em>J. </em>I think the terms of the covenant in this case, make it a personal covenant, and not a pure warranty real at common law. In the first place, this is an executory contract, not a contract executed, as I understand the technical warranty real at common law to have been; it is a covenant to warrant; and it also differs from the terms of the pure warranty real, in being a covenant to warrant the <em>title, </em>not the <em>land </em>conveyed'. A <em>covenant </em>to warrant and defend the <em>title, </em>is a different agreement from a pure warranty, and admits of a different <em>plea; </em>for though it was argued, that a pure warranty is only a covenant, though it be a real one, and that on <em>voucher </em>by the warrantee, the warrantor must insist on his <em>title, </em>and that a covenant to warrant and defend the <em>title, </em>imports no more,\u2014yet I think there is a wide difference between the two things. In <em>warrantia chartce </em>brought on the pure warranty real, upon the suppo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>sition that the warrantee had been impleaded though in fact he had not yet been impleaded (a proceeding that might be had on the pure <em>warranty); </em>if the defendant by plea denied that the plaintiff was impleaded, he would thereby admit the warranty, and that it was broken, and judgement would be given for the warrantee; F. N. B. 34. K. Now this shews the difference between the covenant in the case before us, and the pure warranty: for I take it for granted, such a defence, on such a covenant as this, would not be an admission on the part of the defendant, that he had broken his covenant: on the contrary, such a defence would be held good; it would be equivalent to a denial, on the part of the defendant, that the title which he covenanted to warrant, had been disturbed or legally questioned; a denial, that any claim or demand against which he covenanted to warrant and defend, had been made by any person by suit. Or, suppose the plaintiff had been impleaded in a proper action, and he had vouched the defendant, the vouchee, in order to defend the premises warranted, must have shewn, that he was seized in fee at the <em>time </em>he made the warranty: he could not have shewn, that, though he had no title at that time, he then had the title,\u2014as he might in this action of covenant, if I understand the import of the <em>covenant to </em>warrant,\u2014because by shewing that the title was then in him, his covenant to warrant would not be broken. This illustration may be said to beg the question,\u2014to take for granted, that the covenant in question does not amount to a pure common law warranty. But its object is, to shew that the covenant here was not intended by the parties for a pure common law warranty and nothing more, since the obsolete remedy by a writ of <em>warrantia charlee, </em>could not have been in the contemplation of the parties. As the law makes a part of every contract, and the parties are presumed to know the law; a departure from the terms which constitute a pure warranty real, is conclusive that the pure warranty real was not in their contemplation ; especially, as it hardly can be imagined, that the grantee meant to rely on the an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>cient common law remedies upon a breach of the warranty real, one of which (the <em>voucher) </em>is taken away by statute, and the other obsolete, if not also abolished. In the case of <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Codrington, </em>where the covenantor \u00abobliged himself, his heirs, executors and administrators-to warrant and defend the plantation, negroes, cattle &amp;c.\u201d lord <em>Hardwicke, </em>after remarking on the subject of the covenant, said, \u201cthis clause is not penned as a real warranty; which is, <em>I do for myself and my heirs warrant such land: </em>here, the words are, <em>1 do oblige fyc. </em>which amount to the same as I <em>covenant fyc., </em>for many words in a deed will amount to a covenant besides the word <em>covenant, </em>as <em>1 oblige, agree. </em>This then is barely a covenant, for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, to warrant; which word must be construed in a larger sense than warranty in a strict legal sense; as large as <em>defend.'\u201d </em>Such, essentially, is the covenant before us. The grantor <em>covenanted </em>to warrant and <em>defend </em>the <em>title </em>in fee simple, as it was the fee simple <em>in the </em>land which he sold and conveyed. In substance, it was a covenant of seizin in himself; that is, that he was cloathed with the title in fee conveyed to the grantee. A covenant and agreement to warrant the title, is, I think, no more a warranty than a covenant to sell is a sale. Had the previous words in the covenant been the appropriate words to constitute a real warranty, with the words <em>and defend </em>superadded, I should doubt whether these last words would change the character of the contract, and make it a personal covenant (though lord <em>Hardwicke </em>has laid some stress on them, in the case just mentioned): for, in the case of <em>Pincombe </em>v. <em>Rudge, </em>Hob. 3. 28. the words <em>and defend </em>were added to the word <em>warrant, </em>and yet the judges treated it as a real warranty, though it was decided, that, as the warranty was broken by a claim to a term of years only, covenant well lay.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">I think the fair conclusion from the authorities, is, that whenever there is a departure from the form of the real warranty we find in the books, from which to infer a change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>of the contract, it must be considered a persona] covenant, . , , , , , , , . \u25a0whether executors are named or not, and though the heirs are named, as in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"AKDy\">Although \u00cd do not think it belonged to this case, to investigate the remedies on the real warranty at the common law; yet, as much was said by the bar on that subject, 1 have again consulted the books, and find that I was entirely correct in what I said concerning it, in <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Threlkelds </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The judgement should he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Tucker, <em>P. </em>Waiving the inference that this is a personal covenant, drawn from the expression <em>I covenant to warrant, </em>instead of the simpler form <em>1 do for myself and my heirs warrant, </em>which lord <em>Hardwicke </em>thought a proper inference,\u2014it is sufficient to rest this case upon the use of the word <em>defend. </em>This is a covenant not only to warrant but to <em>defend. </em>Now, the same great judge distinctly intimates, that the sense of the word <em>defend, </em>is larger than that of <em>ivarrant. </em>Therefore, where a party covenants to warrant <em>and defend, </em>the obligation to <em>defend, </em>cannot be identical with the obligation to <em>warrant, because </em>it means something more. Not being identical, it is therefore distinct; so that if, as I concede, the covenant to <em>warrant, </em>has here the operation of the common law warranty, yet the covenant to <em>defend, </em>has a separate and distinct operation. It is a distinct covenant, though contained in the same clause. And it is clearly not the technical <em>warranty; </em>for <em>defendemus </em>does not make a warranty, nor indeed any other word than <em>warrantizabimus. </em>Co. Litt. 384.a If then it be not the technical warranty, it is a personal covenant, as much a covenant of seizin or for good title. It is, in effect, much the same as a covenant for quiet enjoyment: for <em>\u201c </em>where a man is bound to warrant and defend, the <em>warranty </em>is\u201d [that is, applies] \u201c when he is <em>impleaded: </em>but the <em>defending, </em>is to save the party <em>that no stranger enters upon him.\u201d 22 </em>Vin. Abr. Voucher. B. pb 6. citing Br. 60. who cites 2 E. 4. 15. And judge <em>Green, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>accordingly, in <em>Stout </em>v. Jackson, remarks, that if a covenant of warranty binds the party not only to warrant, but to <em>defend, </em>the word <em>defend, </em>would be considered <em>as making a personal covenant, equivalent to a covenant for quiet enjoyment. </em>Indeed, it seemed to be admitted by the counsel in the argument, that if by one clause I covenant to <em>defend, </em>and by another clause I covenant to <em>warrant, </em>the first would make a personal, and the last a real covenant.' I cannot perceive, that the union of them in the same clause, will neutralize the operation of the covenant <em>to defend. </em>If in the same clause, I covenant to deliver a horse, and to pay a sum of money, or to pay money, and make a title to land, or that I have good title and right to convey; yet, in each of these cases, the covenants are distinct thQugh the clause is the same. In like manner, a covenant of seizin, and for quiet enjoyment, would be distinct covenants, though united in the same clause; and so, a covenant to <em>warrant </em>and <em>defend ; </em>since it is established by concurrent authorities, that they are not convertible terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Upon these reasons, and sustained by the opinion of lord <em>Hardwicke, </em>and the uncontradicted authority of a decision' more than 400 years old, as to the effect of a covenant to <em>defend, </em>I am of .opinion, that the covenant <em>to defend </em>in this case constituted a personal covenant; and so bound the personal representatives of the covenantor, whether named or not named. I am also of opinion that that covenant was broken by the entry of a stranger (having better title) under a judgement in ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">Judgement affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
