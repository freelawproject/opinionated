On the 6th of <em>March </em>following, <em>Wolfe </em>obtained an injunction from the Superior Court of Chancery to restrain the Court of Hustings from Pr0Cee(^\"inS t0 dm trial of the said issue, and, by consent of parties, such trial was directed to be had in the District Court to be holden at <em>Richmond </em>in the next month, but no citizen of <em>Richmond </em>to be of the Jury, This injunction was granted on bill, answer, and sundry affidavits, taken with n\u00b0tice, disclosing circumstances, from which it appeared highly probable, that an impartial trial could not be had without changing the venue. It appeared also, that . . some oi the most important or those circumstances did not occur until after the issue was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-26\">The District Court refused to try the issue, or even to suffer it to be placed on its docket, being of opinion that the Chancellor had no authority to make such order. After this, the Court of Hustings, on the motion of <em>Darmsdatt\u2019s </em>counsel, in spite of strenuous opposition on the part of the defendant, determined to proceed with the trial, and ordered a Jury to be impanelled ; whereupon the counsel for the defendant withdrew his appearance, as such, and a verdict was found, and judgment rendered, for the plaintiff, for one hundred dollars damages and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-29\">A second injunction was then awarded by the Court of Chancery, and a motion to dissolve it overruled; \u201c the \u201c Court being of opinion, that it hath power to direct the \u201c issue in an action for an injury which is not a felony, \u201c depending before any Court within the limits of its ju- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u25a0* risd'^t'on, (where this Court helieveth the trial will not ** be impartial,) to be tried before another Court of coma petent authority within the same jurisdiction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-4\">At a subsequent District Court, holden at Richmond, the 10th of <em>September, </em>1803, the Judges complying with the Chancellor\u2019s order, the issue was again tried, and a verdict for eighty-eight dollars damages and costs, certified to the Court of Chancery, which thereupon decreed, that the injunction to stay proceedings on the judgment of the Hustings Court be perpetual; that <em>Wolfe </em>pay the damages and costs recovered by the aforesaid certified verdict ; and that <em>Darmsdatt </em>pay the costs of both the suits in Chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">On petition of the latter to the Judges of this Court, an appeal was allowed him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-10\">Copland, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9R\">relied on a clause, relative to writs of certiorari, in the County Court Law;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> from which he inferred that the Court of Chancery had no authority, <em>after issue </em>joined., to direct the removal of a cause from a County or Corporation Court, to be tried before any other tribunal. He contended also, that, in no case, could the Chancellor grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a <em>suit </em>depending, but only on <em>judgments ; </em>and quoted the 50th, 54th, and 55th sections of the act reducing into one the several acts concerning the High Court of Chancery. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-13\"><em>Say, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQS\">said, that, notwithstanding a Court of <em>Common Law </em>could not award a <em>certiorari </em>after issue joined, a Court of <em>Equity </em>might (upon general principles) direct a <em>change of venue. </em>The existence of such a power is essentially necessary, for the purpose of preventing a failure of justice, and incident to the nature and constitution of a Court of <em>Equity. </em>The sections referred to, relative to injunctions to stay proceedings on judgments, did not abridge the general powers of the Court. They merely subjected the jurisdiction, in the cases therein mentioned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>to certain regulations, but did not take it away in other cases not enumerated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF2L\">' The power of the Court of Chancery to award injunctions has been repeatedly exercised bodi before and since the revolution, and exists independently of the statute.

The cause being thus at issue, and no mean left the appellee (to my knowledge) to remove the cause to another Court, or to change the <em>venue </em>by application to a Court of Law, he applied to the Court of Chancery for that purpose. He charged in his bill, and proved by testimony, that a torrent of prejudice existed against him in the City; that unusual pains had been taken to foster and encourage it; that strong prejudices existed against him, even on the part of some' of the Justices themselves, as manifested at the <em>November </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>term, <em>after </em>the cause had been put to issue, and in partial-^ lar, from an unusual \u201c anxiety\u201d being discovered in them to force him into a trial at that term; and that both from this temper in the Court, and from the prejudices existing among the people of the City, he could not have a fair trial, in the Court in which the cause was depending. As much of this ground of complaint (if not all of it) had only come to the knowledge of the appellee <em>after </em>the cause was put to issue, he would have been entirely without remedy, in respect of a change of venue, but for the interposition of a Court of Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Nothing is more clear than that the powers of a Court of Equity are competent to this purpose, when the powers of the law tribunals are inadequate <em>; </em>on the ground of that jurisdiction being assistant to the jurisdiction of Courts of Law;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and on the further ground that the interposition of a Court of Equity is <em>necessary </em>under such circumstances, to ensure a \u201c fair, impartial and satisfactory trial.\u201d<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> It was particularly necessary that this interposition should be exercised, in default of the powers of the Courts of Law as aforesaid, especially \u201c in small jurisdictions,\u201d where \u201c a cry has \u201c been raised, and the passions of the multitude inflamed,\u201d or <em>u </em>where one of the parties is popular and the other a stran- \u201c ger, or obnoxious.\u201d<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> The case thus put by the author of the Commentaries, is the very case at bar, as proved by the testimony, (to which I beg- leave to have very particular reference,) with this imperious circumstance to justify the interference of the Court of Equity in the present case, that the material facts, or some of them, rendering a change of the tribunal necessary to an impartial trial, only came to the knowledge of the appellee <em>after </em>the hands of the Courts of Law were tied up from granting relief in this particular, by the stage at which the proceedings in the cause had arrived. But for the interposition of the Court of Equity, the appellee would have been immolated 011 the altar of prejudice, and the trial would neither have been fair nor satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Nothing in any of our statutes, respecting the grant of in-, junctions or <em>certioraris </em>by the Courts of Chancery, has any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>relation to the case now under consideration. The power exercised by the Court of Chancery in this case is one of the main pillars of its jurisdiction, and is indispensable to the pure and fair administration of j ustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">The Chancellor was therefore justified, not only by his undoubted jurisdiction in this case, but also by the facts proved in the cause, in arresting the proceedings in the Court of Hustings, and causing a trial to be had before a more Impartial tribunal. He went too far, indeed, in extending his interference to the <em>indictment </em>also; (which being a <em>criminal </em>proceeding, is beyond the cognisance of the Courts of Equity;)<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> but that proceeding is at an end, and is not now before us. When, therefore, he changed the <em>venue </em>by directing the trial to be had in the <em>Richmond </em>District Court, providing also, by consent of parties, that no citizen of <em>Richmond </em>should be upon the jury, he was strictly within his province, as he (in default of adequate power in the Courts of Law) thereby placed the pause in a channel to ensure a fair and impartial trial. The refusal of the District Court to try the issue, agreeably to the mandate of the Court of Chancery, cannot be justified on any ground more favourable to such Court than that of its entire ignorance of the just powers of the Courts of Equity in this particular; and as the particular ground of the proceeding in the Court of Chancery was entirely unknown to the District Court, (for, I presume only the order directing the trial of the issue was before it,) this refusal went the lull length of affirming that this power could not rightfully be exercised by the Court of Chancery, <em>under any circumstances whatsoever ! </em>not even under the strong and <em>possible </em>circumstances of the .whole bench of the Court of <em>Hustings </em>having declared, <em>after </em>issue was joined, and when, consequently, no possibility was left for the appellee to remove the cause except by application to the Court of Chancery, that the appellee should not receive justice at its hands !!</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">With the highest respect for all the tribunals of our country, it is- my duty, sitting in this place, to remark upon this unexampled procedure, as equally unwarranted by the lavy\u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>of our country, and tending to sap the very foundations of justice : and, admitting that the order of the Court oi Chancery. was not justifiable so far as it related to the indictment, <em>this </em>formed no apology for the District Court for not proceeding to try the civil issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">The Court of <em>Hustings, </em>emboldened by the example of the District Court, improved upon the contumacious conduct of the latter: for, while the latter only refused to execute an order of the Court of Chancery; the former made a positive inroad upon it: it proceeded to try the issue which .was both interdicted, as to that tribunal, by the order of the Court of Chancery, and translated to the <em>forum </em>of the District Court; and all this with a full knowledge of the existence of that order! The Court of Hustings, therefore, thus not only outraged all precedents on this subject, but also verified, perhaps, the allegation of the appellee, of its unfriendly disposition towards him : and, as his counsel actually withdrew from his defence, from a proper respect for the order of the Court of Chancery, which the Court and the adverse counsel were at that moment actually violating, and thus left the appellee wholly undefended; on this ground, also, the verdict in the <em>Hustings </em>Court ought not to bind him.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">In this whole business the conduct of the appellee has been free from blame. While he submits to the damages and costs recovered against him in the District Court at the <em>subsequent </em>term, it is right that he should recover the costs' of both suits in Chancery. Those suits were imposed upon him in the first instance by the necessity of resorting to the Court of Chancery to ensure to him a fair trial, and after-wards by the errors or contumacy of the District Court and Court of Hustings\u00bf Admitting, therefore, that the <em>appellant </em>was himself <em>personally </em>free from blame also, <em>his </em>is but the. common case of being compellable to pay costs in consequence of the errors or mistakes of the inferior tribunals. The appellant has less reason to complain, in this respect,than the appellee had in the case of <em>Cocke </em>v. <em>Pollock </em>&amp; <em>Co.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>who was condemned to pay the costs of an appeal to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Court imposed upon him with the sole view of settling a general question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">On these grounds I am of opinion to affirm the Decree now before us.</p>\n<author id=\"b268-10\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"A74\">The administration of justice (says Judge Blackstone, in his Commentaries, volume 3. page 383.) should not only be chaste, but should not even be suspected <em>: </em>and though in some respects, juries coming from the neighbourhood are advantageous, they are often liable to great objections : and after noticing some instances, he adds \u201c <em>or '\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0where a cry has been </em>raised,, <em>and the passions of the mulii- </em>\u201c <em>tude have been inf </em>anted, <em>or -where one of the parties ispopu- </em>\u201c <em>lar% and the other a </em>stranger, <em>or </em>obnoxious, \u00a3s?c. the Courts \u201c of <em>Law </em>will therefore, in transitory actions, very often \u201c change the venue, or county where the case is to be tried/\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"A5pA\">The very case now before us. There is abundant proof, from the affidavits of Moody, Harris, and Quarrier, that the cry was loud, and that strong prejudices prevailed against the appellee ; who, it seems, was not apprized of those circumstances, until after there was an <em>issue </em>in the cause, which was joined in a short time after its commencement; and it was then too late to apply to a superior Court of <em>Law </em>to remove the cause by a <em>certiorari: </em>his only mode of relief was by an application to a Court of <em>Equity; </em>which in my conception had ample jurisdiction to afford him a remedy. We are, told <em>byfxxdgeBlackstone, </em>that, <em>mEngland, </em>though the Courts of Law have no <em>direct </em>power to change the <em>venue </em>in <em>local </em>actions they sometimes do it <em>indirectly </em>and by mutual consent; yet to effect it directly and absolutely, the parties are driven to a Court of Equity; where, upon making out a proper case, it is done, upon the ground of being necessary to <em>2. fair ^ impartial, </em>and <em>satisfactory trial. </em>And it is laid down, as a <em>general </em>principle, in Fonblanque, page 9. that equity stands for the <em>whole of natural justice; </em>is more excellent than any human institution; and that Courts of Equity are assistant to the jurisdiction of Courts of <em>Law, </em>by removing legal impediments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>to the fair decision of a question depending in a Court of <em>Lato. </em>If, <em>in </em>England', then, a Court of Equity has the power of changing the <em>venue </em>in cases where the Courts of Law have no such <em>direct </em>power, upon the same principle may Courts of Equity exercise the same powers here, unless restrained by an express statute : and it appear, to me that there could not have been a more proper occasion for exercising the power, than the one now under consideration. I therefore, without minutely stating the circumstances of the case, which have been amply investigated by Judge Roane, who preceded me, concur in opinion that both decrees be af<em>FJ&amp;M </em>F.B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AgL\"> <em>1 </em>Fonb. 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"Afd\"> 3 Bl. 383</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"AIK\"> Ibid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\"> 1 <em>Fonb. 5.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b267-5\"> 1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 449.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
