HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b148-16\">This is \u00e1n app'eal from a judgment for the plaintiff in 'an action at law to recover upon a fire insurance policy covering ten barges in Ne'w York Harbor; it was for a total of $45,000, \u201cas per Schedule attached,\u201d the schedule distributing the gross sum among the ten vessels. It recited that \u201cthe property insured hereunder is valued at $45,000\u201d and is the \u201chull, body, spars, sails and all tackle and apparel, boats, engines, boilers and machinery, fixtures, appurtenances, materials, equipments, fuel, stores, supplies, furniture, ordnance, munitions and artillery on board; also Electric Light and Refrigerating Plants and installation if any.\u201d All claims were to be adjusted \u201cin accordance with the terms and conditions of the New York Standard Form of Fire Policy,\u201d and the policy was \u201cotherwise subject\u201d to that form. Among the provisions of the New York form are these: \u201cIn case of any fraud or false swearing by the insured touching any matter relating to this insurance or the subject thereof, whether before or after a loss,\u201d the entire policy is to be void.. Again the insurer is not to be liable, \u201cwhile a described building whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant is vacant or unoccupied beyond a period of ten days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-18\">Eight of the barges were lying at Travis, Staten Island, tied to a dock on the night of April <em>27, </em>1933; no bargee was on board of them, or had been for ten days. A fire broke out which totally destroyed two, the Arrow and the Billy, valued at $5,000 each, and injured a third, the Glen, and her gear. These three lay alongside each other at the outer end of the dock. At the shore end lay the other five, in the cabin of one of which, the Hampton, an independent fire was discovered which damaged her and her gear. Part of the equipment of a fifth, the Horan, not herself injured, was some covers, at the 'time on board the Arrow, and these were burned with that vessel. The total loss was $15,022.35. The fire was certainly set'by an incendiary, and the defendant alleged that he was the plaintiff, but the jury found otherwise, and we are not asked to reconsider their verdict on that score. The chief argument on the appeal concerns the proofs of loss. The plaintiff was examined at length \u201cby the fire marshal and the district attorney tried unsuccessfully to indict 'him. He was therefore presumptively aware of the incendiary\u2019s preparations discovered on the barges which were not destroyed and that a strong case could be made against him. On November 1, 1933, he filed his proofs of claim in which he swore that \u201cthe cause and origin\u201d of the fire was unknown to him; and as to the' Horan\u2019s covers of the value of $840, declared as follows: \u201cOccupancy: The building described, or cont\u00e1ining the property described, was occupied at the time of the fire as follows .and for no other purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>whatever: Derrick Ltr. S. A. Horan.\u201d Later his brokers sent a letter to the underwriter in answer to a request for further information about the cost and value of the barges. This had one column entitled \u201cCost,\u201d in which a figure was given as the \u201cBill of Sale.\u201d The bill of sale for the Billy was put at $4,000, and for the Glen at $4,-000; the Billy had been valued at $5,000 and the Glen at $4,000. The bill of sale for the Billy was in fact for $2,000, but the plaintiff swore at the trial, and had told the fire marshal before, that it had cost him in all $4,000; the bill of sale for the Glen was one dollar, the plaintiff had said, and swore, that it had cost $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">At the trial the defendant moved for a directed verdict on the ground that the \u25a0plaintiff had been guilty of \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cfalse swearing\u201d in his proofs of claim and elsewhere; and because the barges were unoccupied. The judge, having denied this, charged the jury briefly that \u201cany deliberate false statement of a material fact with the intention to deceive\u201d made by the plaintiff either before or after the policy was written, was a defence, but that the defendant must prove it. Upon request he added that \u201cif the plaintiff represented that certain of the goods or articles involved in this cause of action were on board their respective vessels and such representation were false such misrepresentation avoids the policy,\u201d but added that it must be made \u201cwith the intention and object of deceiving the company.\u201d The defendant excepted to the addition as well as to the judge\u2019s refusal to charge several other requests, which, so far as material at all, were no more than variants of the theme that intentional deceit was enough and fraud was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The defendant relies especially upon Claflin v. Commonwealth Insurance Co., 110 U. S. 81, 3 S. Ct. 507, 28 L. Ed. 76, which held that in a policy containing a clause like that at bar, any deliberately false statement upon a material matter in a proof of claim was a good defence even though not intended to defraud the underwriter. This was the effect of what the judge said here; he did not tell the jury that the plaintiff must have meant to defraud the defendant; only that he must have deliberately tried to deceive it. Upon that the evidence was not so plain as to justify a directed verdict. We agree that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover for the loss of the Horan\u2019s covers which were on board the Arrow. The phrase, \u201con board,\u201d after \u201cmunitions and artillery,\u201d does not condition those words alone; it goes back at least as far as \u201cfixtures.\u201d Conceivably the catalogue was intended to be in four parts: (1) \u201chull\u201d etc., down to \u201capparel\u201d; (2) \u201cboats\u201d etc., down to \u201cmachinery\u201d; (3) \u201cfixtures\u201d etc., down to \u201con board\u201d; (4) \u201cElectric Lights\u201d etc., to the end. Such a division would have some justification from the character of the things enumerated, and because of the repeated use of the word \u201cand,\u201d as though to complete a clause. If so, it could be argued that \u201cspars, sails, tackle and apparel\u201d were insured though not on board, but not \u201cmat-terials, equipments, supplies or furniture.\u201d However, even so covers would not fall under the word \u201capparel\u201d so well as under \u201cequipments\u201d or \u201cfurniture.\u201d Taking the phrase as a whole we have no doubt that cov.ers were a part of the gear which must be on board. Indeed it is pretty clear that this must be so, else it would be impossible for the underwriter to limit his risk. He can in some measure calculate this if he has only the barge itself to consider, but if her furniture and equipment may be taken away and kept anywhere, he has no way of knowing his liabilities. But it does not follow, as the defendant supposes, that even so it was a deliberate deceit to make a claim for the Horan\u2019s covers. As has just appeared, the clause itself is not wholly free from ambiguity and it was quite possible that the plaintiff thought the phrase referred to the covers as appurtenances of the Horan rather than'to their location. His testimony at the trial, far from having a sinister meaning as the defendant asks us to believe, seems quite innocent. It is true that on his direct examination he spoke of the covers as being on the Horan, just as he had in the proofs of claim, but his immediate admission on cross-examination that they were on the Arrow, is not consistent with a purpose to deceive. It does not appear that the defendant knew where the covers had been, or that he need have told the truth if he meant to Conceal it. At least the question was one for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The broker\u2019s letter stating the cost of the barges was not \u201cfalse swearing\u201d even if it was untrue, for it was not sworn to. If it was a defence at all, it was because it was a fraud. Since the policy was \u201cvalued\u201d as to all the barges, their cost could be relevant \u2022 only to cover up fraudulent valuations. As to the Glen this could hardly be true; her cost was given as $4,000 and had been in fact $3,000, but she had had repairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>upon her of $2,000, and,she was valued at $4,000. Although the cost of the Billy had been only $2,000, as much more had been put upon her; and she was valued at $5,000. The fire marshal had already learned all these facts and had seen the bills of sale; indeed he had had them at one time in his possession. True, it does not appear that the defendant had learned of this, or if it had, that the plaintiff knew that it had. But the whole affair had been thoroughly aired, and it was permissible for a jury to find both that the letter had not been intended to suppress a fraud, and that there had not been any in fact. Nor is it necessary at length to discuss the argument that the plaintiff swore falsely when he denied knowledge of the cause and origin of the fire. He spoke with six months between him and the fire,'during which the matter had been well combed. He denied that he had had any part in it, and perhaps that was false; but it was submitted to the jury and they have agreed with him. The defence must be that though he had not been privy to it, he knew all that the firemen knew and should have disclosed it. This is a most unreal position; it presupposes that he was deliberately keeping from the defendant what was accessible knowledge to any interested person; what the defendant would almost certainly learn from the officials; what probably it already knew. The jury might find that he meant that he knew no more than what was public.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The \u2019last charge is of \u201cunoccupancy\u201d of the barges, there being no bargees on board. It has nothing to stand on except the incorporation of that clause out of the New York standard form which we quoted at the outset. The language does not fit a flotilla of barges moored to a do'ck, which are not \u201cbuildings,\u201d and whose bargees are neither \u201cowners\u201d nor \u201ctenants.\u201d The underwriter must bear such ambiguities, if they are ambiguities at all. Especially is this true of a policy made'up like this one, by the incorporation of. another policy drawn for a quite different kind of insurance. . It is idle, we know, to protest against the shiftless composition of marine policies as they issue in this port; the underwriters prefer them so and the owners and shippers are either helpless, or indifferent, or both. The amorphous result which so often confuses parties and courts and breeds litigation will no doubt persist, and we must struggle as we can to impose coherence upon conglomerate jargon irresponsibly put together at random. But we may and should insist upon the most unsparing use of the canon contra proferentem; that is, upon the underwriter\u2019s disclosing a plain path out of the jungle he has made. Certainly the defendant has not done so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The judgment will be affirmed if the plaintiff files a remittitur of $840 and interest for the covers on the Horan; otherwise judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
