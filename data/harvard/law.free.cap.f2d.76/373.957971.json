The respondent taxpayers are stockholders of the D. H. Holmes Company. The theory of the Commissioner is that in 1923 the Holmes Company became the owner by purchase of all the stock of the, Charles A. Kaufman Company, and in the' taxable year 1927'distribut\u00e9d it all to its own stockholders at cost, which 'was less than the fair market value. His contention is that the distribution <em>[ </em>of the difference between such cost and market value constituted a distribution in the nature of a dividend to stockholders of the Holmes Company. Revenue Act 1926, \u00a7 201 (a), 26 USCA \u00a7 932 (a). The respondents deny that the Holmes Company was ever the owner of the Kaufman stock, some of which they admit they bought and still claim to own. On the issue whether the Holmes Company bought the Kaufman stock and afterwards sold it to its own stockholders, the evidence is not in dispute. The Kaufman and Holmes companies were in a limited sense competitors in business. In 1923, while the Kaufman Company was in financial difficulty and had most, if not all, of its capital stock pledged to banks as security for loans, the directors of the Holmes Company decided to acquire all outstanding Kaufman stock, whether pledged or not. At first it was intended that the Holmes Company should become the purchaser; but, since it-was a Louisiana corporation and had no right under its charter or existing la-w to acquire by purchase the capital stock of another. corporation, its board of directors proceeded, to purchase all the Kaufman stock for the account of the stockholders of the Holmes Company. The directors paid for the stock they purchased with money of. the'Holmes Company, but the .title to it was t^ken in the name of a trustee for the stockholders, subject to a pledge to the Holmes Company for the purchase price. The stockholders, other than the directors who held a majority oi the shares, \u2018 were not consulted, but were given the right to purchase, Kaufman' stock in proportion to the stock'of, the Holmes Company held by them. Ther.e was never any objection, so far as \u00e1pp\u00e9ars by any stockholder, and in 1927 some or all of them took up all the Kaufman stock, paying to the trustee the original cost of $80 per share., for it, although at th,\u00e1t time it admittedly had a market value of $135 per share. The trustee repaid the Holmes Company the amount advanced by' it. During the time the trustee held the stock he collected the annual dividends thereon and paid them over to the Holmes Company. In its income tax returns the Holmes Company included these dividends and listed the Kaufman stock as an asset under the heading \u201cinvestments\u201d or \u201cother assets,\u201d instead of under the heading \u201caccounts receivable.\u201d There is no charge of fraud or of an attempt to evade the payment of income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">The Holmes Company,' in our opinion, never became the owner of the Kaufman stock. Its directors, upon being advised that the corporation itself could not legally become such owner,' set about to make the purchase for therqselves' and other stockholders of their corporation. They used corporate funds, it is true, with which to pay the purchase price. It is also doubtless true that for this irregular and unauthorized act they could have been held individually and personally liable to the corporation or to objecting stockholders. But what was done by the officers and directors of the Holmes Company was recorded in the minutes of the directors\u2019 meetings, was done openly without any idea of concealment, and was ratified by the minority stockholders. The corporation, \u2018 having accomplished indirectly what it could not direct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ly, was satisfied to get its money back. As to outsiders or strangers, the stock transactions were perfectly legitimate. The Holmes Company, as pledgee of the Kaufman stock, was entitled to the dividends from it, and, having received them, was bound to account therefor in its income tax returns. In making up those returns the pledged stock was always listed as an asset. But conceding that the listing should have been under the special heading \u201caccounts receivable,\u201d the most that was shown under the admitted facts was an error of bookkeeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The petition for review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
