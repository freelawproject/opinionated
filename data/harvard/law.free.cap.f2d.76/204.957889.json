An anonymous communication was received by the Immigration Service at Los Angeles stating that one Ku-nimori Ohara had entered the United States from Mexico \u201cfive years ago at 1928\u201d Without a passport, and giving his address. Shortly thereafter, on May 4, 1933, appellant was taken into custody and examined under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">At this examination for investigation of status the alien stated that he entered the United States- from Mexico, on foot, in 1921, at Tia Juana, and proceeded from there to Los Angeles by automobile. He was unable to recall any details or landmarks and was hazy upon distances traveled and time consumed on his journey from En-senada, Mexico, into the United States, which was the way he said he entered this country. He was unable to describe the landing at Manzanillo, or the boat trip from Manzanillo to Ensenada, which formed a link in his journey. Concerning the people whom he met at the time he arrived in Los Angeles, he said he could not remember their names -or 'that -they had returned , to Japan. On the whole, the testimony given by him seems evasive and tended to confuse rather than clarify. Following this examination a telegraphic order for arrest of the alien was .requested, which was received the day following, on which day the hearing to show cause was called. The hearing was continued, at the request of the alien\u2019s attorney, to May 9th and then to May 16th, and again continued to June 2, this time at the request of the. government. On this latter date the hearing proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">In response to a telegram, there was received from San Francisco, under date of May 23, 1933, a record and statement of facts relative to admission of an alien, in transit to Mexico, on December 17, 1927. The description of the alien set forth therein exactly fitted the arrested alien, even to a mole on the lower left lip. The name, age, height, occupation, and home village are the same. The only discrepancy noted is the name of the father; the name given by the arrested alien being different from that set forth in the certificate from the port of San Francisco. The alien named in the certificate departed from San Ysidro, Cal., by foot, for Mexico on December 30, 1927. This certificate was made part of the record, over objection of alien\u2019s attorney. Also introduced, over objection, was a letter signed by the inspector in charge at San Pedro, Cal., reciting that no record could be found of the arrival or departure there of the alien on the steamship Anyo Maru, on which he claimed to have sailed from Japan in 1921; that that vessel arrived at San Pedro on April 19, 1921, but that the alien\u2019s name did not appear on the through manifest. Under instructions from his attorney the alien declined to answer the questions put to him on the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">The Board of Review recommended that the Department of State be requested to ascertain through its consular-service in Japan the date and manner of the alien\u2019s last departure from Japan and whether he was in fact the person who arrived at the port of San Francisco, December 17,1927, on the steamship Shinyo Maru in transit to Ensen-ada, Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-17\">Upon receipt of information from the American consulate in Japan to the effect that Kunimori -Ohara was not registered in the census register of the village under the family o,f Take jiro Ohara, as he claimed, but was registered as the second son of Yo-shido Ohara-of the same village, and that his address was not\u2019known. The father's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>name and the date of birth corresponded with that of alien admitted in transit in December, 1927. It appeared also that the family name of the mother was \u201cTakada,\u201d which was the name of a person appellant said was a relative who met him when he first came to Los Angeles. The names of his brother and sister, noted by the consul, correspond with those given by appellant when first interrogated. The Board thereupon recommended that the case be reopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Appellant\u2019s attorney objected to the use of this report of the American Consul, and instructed the alien not to answer any questions put to him. No evidence was offered by the alien. As a result of this hearing the inspector recommended that Kunimori Ohara be deported and, after further consideration, the Board of Review so. ordered, upon the ground that he was not, at the time of entry, in possession of an unexpired immigration visa.and that he was in the United States in violation of-the Immigration Act of 1924, being an alien ineligible to citizenship-and not exempt under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Appellant specifies as error, in his brief, that the lower court erred in not holding that the deportation was barred by section 19 of the Immigration Act of 1917 (8 US CA \u00a7 155), but he- does not argue the point in the brief, nor is that section of that act specifically mentioned in his assignment of errors. At any event, this point is of no merit'because the alien was charged, as noted above, with being in the United States in violation of the Immigration Act of 1924, which permits deportation at any time after entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The substance of appellant\u2019s attack upon the deportation proceedings is that the hearing was unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">It will be noted that the burden of proof in deportation proceedings is upon the alien \u201cto show that he entered the United States lawfully, and the time, place, and manner of such entry, * * * \u201d [Immigration Act 1924, \u00a7 23 (8 USCA \u00a7 221); Keizo Kamiyama v. Carr, etc., 44 F.(2d) 503, 507 (C. C. A. 9); Kjar v. Doak, etc., 61 F.(2d) 566, 569 (C. C. A. 7)], and that the alien refused to testify at the hearing, upon advice, of counsel. _ Of course, if appellant did in fact enter the United States prior to July 1, 1924, deportation would be barred by the passage of the 5-year limitation period under section 19 of the Immigration Act of 1917, and this is conceded by appellee. However,, the burden .was upon the alien to show affirmatively the time, place, and manner of his entry.. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Appellant urges as unfair the taking of the alien into custody and the questioning of him by immigration inspectors on May 4, 1933, one day prior toi receipt of warrant of arrest. It is asserted that'there is no authority for taking the alien into custody without a warrant, or for questioning and confining him before issuance \u00f3f a warrant. Appellee contends that section 16 of -the Immigration Act of 1917 (8 USCA .\u00a7 152), which reads in part as* follows,, \u201c * * * Immigrant inspectors.ar,e hereby-authorized and empowered to board and- search for aliens any vessel, railway car,' or any other conveyance, or vehicle in which they .believe aliens are being brought into - the United States. Said inspectors shall have power to administer oaths-and1 to take and consider evidence touching the right- of any alien to enter, reenter, pass through, or reside in the United States, and;'where, such action may be necessary,, to make a. written record of such evidence; and any-.p.ersqn to whom such an oath has been, administered, under the provisions of this subcha.pter, who shall knowingly or willfully give false-evidence or swear to any false statement in any way affecting or in relation to the right of any alien to admission)- or rdadmissioi to, or to pass through,. or. to. resida-: in. the United States shall be deemed \u25a0 guilty of perjury and be punished as provided\u2018by section 231 of Title 18, * *: \u201d contains implied authority to detain an -alien for a reasonable time pending receipt of a warrant of-arrest.' Without discussing this section or attempting to distinguish its application as-between those lawfully admitted and those who surreptitiously entered the' United States, we point out that: \u201c*.*\u2022* Irregularities on the' part of the government official prior to, or in connection-with, the arrest would not necessarily invalidate later proceedings in all respects conformable to-law. * \u2018 * * \u201d U. S. ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, etc., 263 U. S. 149, 158, 44 S. Ct. 54, 57, 68 L. Ed. 221. The-Supreme Court, in Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, at page 235, 16 S. Ct. 977, 980, 41. L. Ed. 140, said: \u201cWe think'it clear that detention or temporary confinement, as part of the means necessary to - give effect to the provisions for the exclusion or expulsion of aliens, would be valid Proceedings to exclude or expel would be. vain if. those accused could not be held-in custody, pending the inquiry into their true .character, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>while arrangements were being made for their deportation. Detention is a usual feature in every case of arrest on a criminal charge, even when an innocent person is wrongfully accused; but it is not imprisonment in a legal sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">In the case at hand, the alien was informed that the inspector desired a statement from him as to his right to-be in the United States; that the burden was upon him to prove such right; that any statement he would make might be used against him; and he stated his willingness to make such statement under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">While no decision based upon the point has been brought to our notice, we think the voluntary statement of the alien made prior to the issuance of the warrant of arrest was admissible. Such rule seems to find support in the case of Chan Nom Gee v. U. S., 57 F.(2d) 646, 649, decided by this court. See, also, U. S. ex rel. Chu Sun v. Karnuth, etc., 60 F.(2d) 930 (C. C. A. 2); Keizo Kamiyama v. Carr, etc., 44 F.(2d) 503, 504 (C. C. A. 9); Ex parte Seisuke Fukumoto, 53 F.(2d) 618, 619 (C. C. A. 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Objection upon the ground of hearsay is also made to the reception in evidence of the communication of the American Consul in Japan. It is well settled that an administrative tribunal is not required to observe the strict rules of evidence enforced in courts, and that the admission or rejection in evidence is not ground for reversal unless there has been a denial of justice. A consular certificate was held admissible in Kjar v. Doak, supra, and, in U. S. ex rel. Andonovitch v. Carr, etc., 6 F. Supp. 1021 (D. C. N. Y.), the court said: \u201cIn the present case, the letter from the American consul is an official communication and is entitled to such weight as the Board of Inquiry sees fit to give it. Even though that letter were the only proof, there would be sufficient proof to justify the Board in making the determination at which it arrived. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">At the hearing to show cause the alien declined, upon advice of counsel, to answer the questions put to him by the examining officer who was entitled to draw an inference from his silence. \u201c * * * There is no rule of law which prohibits officers charged with the administration of the immigration law from drawing an inference from the silence of one who is called upon to speak.\u201d U. S. ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, supra, at page 154 of 263 U. S., 44 S. Ct. 54, 56. See, also, Chan Nom Gee v. U. S., supra; Saksagansky v. Weedin, etc., 53 F.(2d) 13, 16 (C. C. A. 9). In no respect do we find the hearing unfair, nor can we say that the administrative officers acted arbitrarily. ' It was incumbent upon the alien to prove his right to remain, and he chose to stand mute.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Appellant\u2019s authorities have been carefully examined, but we are unable to find anywhere in them justification for setting aside the order of the District Court. Accordingly, the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
