S. C. \u00a7 194 (12 USCA \u00a7 194).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Appellee filed an answer and, in paragraph II thereof, averred that the bill \u201cfails to allege any matter of either law or equity entitling the plaintiff to the relief prayed for, * * * and, taking all the aver-ments of the bill as true, he has violated no duty he owed to the plaintiff. * * * \u201d Upon this averment the court on motion of appellee dismissed the bill. No other part of the answer is material here. Conway et al. v. White, 292 F. 837, 840 (C. C. A. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">The basis for the decree is not disclosed, but we assume that the court concluded from the averments of the bill, taken as true, that the bank never became the owner of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">We do not concur. We are not unaware that there is a diversity of opinion among the state courts as to whether upon such a deposit the relationship of debtor and creditor arises between a bank and its customer. The case must be differentiated from Dakin, Receiver, v. Bayly, Liquidator, 290 U. S. 143, 54 S. Ct. 113, 78 L. Ed. 229, 90 A. L. R. 999, where a state statute controls, and from St. Louis &amp; San Francisco R. Co. v. Johnston, 133 U. S. 566, 10 S. Ct. 390, 33 L. Ed. 683, where the bank was known to be hopelessly insolvent at the time the deposit was received. The question presented is one of general commercial law (Brooklyn City &amp; N. R. Co. v. National Bank, 102 U. S. 14, 31, 26 L. Ed. 61; Security Nat. Bank v. Old Nat. Bank, 241 F. 1, 8 (C. C. A. 8); In re Jarmulowsky et al., 249 F. 319, 321, L. R. A. 1918E, 634 (C. C. A. 2); Dickson v. First Nat. Bank, etc., 26 F.(2d) 411 (C. C. A. 8), and it is our duty to exercise an independent judgment based upon the controlling decisions of the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">In City of Douglas v. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 271 U. S. 489, 492, 46 S. Ct. 554, 556, 70 L. Ed. 1051, the court said: \u201cFor when paper is indorsed without restriction by a depositor, and is at once passed to his credit by the bank to which he delivers it, he becomes the creditor of the bank; the bank becomes owner of the paper, and in making the collection is not the agent for the depositor. Burton v. United States, 196 U. S. 283, 25 S. Ct. 243, 49 L. Ed. 482; Union Electric Steel Co. v. Imperial Bank (C. C. A.) 286 F. 857; General Amer. Tank Car Corp. v. Goree (C. C. A.) 296 F. 32, 36; In re Ruskay (C. C. A.) 5 F.(2d) 143; Scott, Cases on Trusts, p. 64, note, par. 8, pp. 66, 67.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">In addition to the cases cited in the above quotation, see, also, Equitable Trust Co. v. Rochling, 275 U. S. 248, 252, 48 S. Ct. 58, 72 L. Ed. 264; Security Nat. Bank v. Old Nat. Bank, supra; State Y. M. C. A. v. Picher (D. C. Me.) 8 F. Supp. 412; Williams v. Cox, 97 Tenn. 555, 559, 37 S. W. 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">The printed notation on the deposit slip, to wit, \u201call items credited subject to payment,\u201d did not invalidate the bank\u2019s title. This notation was indicative only that the bank would charge the check back to the depositor, if it were not collected, and not that credit was not given at the time of the deposit. City of Douglas v. Federal Reserve Bank, supra; Burton v. United States, 196 U. S. 283, 297, 25 S. Ct. 243, 49 L. Ed. 482; Johnson v. First Nat. B. &amp; T. Co. (D. C.) 8 F. Supp. 788, 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">Appellant urges that an averment in the bill that the bank held the check \u201cfor the benefit of the said Wesley Street\u201d was an admission that it was acting as the agent of Street, but this contention at once appears untenable when the quoted phrase is read in connection with the full paragraph in which it occurs. We conclude that an \u201cinsufficiency of fact to constitute a valid cause of action in equity\u201d (Equity'Rule 29 [28 USCA \u00a7 723]) does not clearly appear upon the face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>of the billj and that the case should have proceeded to a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The decree is reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to transfer it to the law side of the docket for such further proceedings as are consistent with the rules of practice in law c\u00e1ses.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-17\"> The question whether appellant had an adequate remedy at law suggests itself, but, having failed to move to transfer the hill to the law side or otherwise object to equity jurisdiction, the appellee has waived the point.
