The prayer of the bill was that \u201cthis court may pass an order requiring the defendant to pay to the plaintiff, or to the probation officer of this court, or into the registry of this court for the use of plaintiff, the sum of $175 as past due alimony for the support of said infant child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">A motion was filed by defendant below to dismiss the bill \u201c(2) Because the plaintiff, if she had any right to sue on the said decree could only sue in an action at law to collect payments under a decree of another' State for the monthly payments for the support of a child as that has heretofore been foreclosed by this court and is not open to further discussion.\u201d This motion was sustained, whereupon the present appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">The record discloses that the present case is governed by Davis v. Davis, 29 App. D. C. 258, 9 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1071, as well as by - our decision handed down on January 28, 1935, in case No. 6211 entitled Katherine Naomi Grant v. Samuel Reynolds Grant, \u2014 App. D. C. \u2014, 75 F.(2d) 665, on appeal from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Pursuant to the foregoing decisions, we hold that the order of the court dismissing plaintiff\u2019s bill in the present case was right, and the decision is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
