Civil Code aft. 2705. The statute enters into and forms part of every contract of lease, and in many respects, not material to this case, the lien is superior to the lien of a contractual mortgage. This is not disputed, but it is contended by appellant that the landlord\u2019s claim must be ranked according to the provisions of section 64b of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA \u00a7 104 (b), under which costs of administration are to be paid in full before a distribution is made to persons who by the laws of the states or the United States are entitled to priority, which class includes a landlord having a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-28\">Section 64b is to be construed together with section 67d, 11 USCA \u00a7 107 (d), which provides that valid liens shall not be affected by other provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. The persons referred to in section 64b (7), 11 USCA \u00a7 104 (b), (7), as entitled to priority, are those persons whose rights arise under provisions of law, but who have no lien or right on specific property and are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>be paid by preference out of the general assets of the estate. We have repeatedly held that the holder of a valid lien on specific \u25a0property is entitled to be paid in full out of the procee'ds of the burdened property, subject only to superior liens on the property and a contribution to the estate equal to what it would have cost to foreclose the lien.
