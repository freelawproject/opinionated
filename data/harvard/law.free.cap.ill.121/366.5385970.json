The facts are:</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-10\" pgmap=\"367(50) 368(182)\">On January 25, 188\u00e9, James Gordon, D. P. Barker and R. H. Roseborough were joint owners of the Union Mills, at Sparta, Randolph county, and of certain other real estate in that county. Having failed in business before this time, and being desirous of effecting a settlement with. their creditors, they borrowed $37,000, for which they gave their joint and several promissory note, payable five years after its date, to the order of Borders &amp; Boyle, with interest at the rate of six per cent per annum, from date, payable annually. To secure the payment of this note, Gordon, Barker and Roseborongh executed, under their hands and seals, a mortgage in due form, on the property covered by the policy in suit, and upon other joint property then owned by them. About the 18th of February, 1884, these mortgagors partitioned this joint property between themselves, and each took possession, severally, of the part set off to him, but allowed the $37,000 mortgage to remain upon all the property. They agreed, however, between themselves, orally, and with Borders &amp; Boyle, that James Gordon, to whom the property covered by the policy was allotted, should only pay $17,000 of the mortgage debt, and this mill property should only be charged with that amount, and that Barker and Roseborough should pay the remaining $20,000. No part of this $37,000 has ever been paid.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-5\" pgmap=\"368(177) 369(183)\">On October 1, 1884, James Gordon, owner of the property insured,\u2014being the same covered by said mortgage,\u2014wrote, signed and delivered to the Mutual Mill Insurance Company, an application for $2000 insurance on mill machinery, shafting, gearing and belting while in said mill, on the receipt of which the company issued to him, from its home office in Chicago, the policy in suit, for that sum, in accordance with said-application. The company knew nothing about the property to be insured, save the information contained in said application. The face of this policy states: \u201cThis insurance is based upon an application of the insured, filed in the office of this company, of even number and date with this policy, which application is made a part of this contract and a warranty on the part of the insured. \u201d And further, upon its face, reads: \u201cIf the insured shall make any false representation of the condition, situation or occupancy of the property hereby insured, or shall conceal any fact material to the risk, or in case of over-valuation or any misrepresentation whatever by the insured, either in the written application or otherwise, * * * in each and every case this policy shall become void. \u201d The application, among other things, contains the following questions and answers, all the answers being written by Mr. Gordon himself, to-wit: \u201cAre you sole owner of the property to be insured (exclusive of land) ?\u2014Yes. Age of building?\u2014Twenty-seven years. Is it occupied by owner ?\u2014\u25a0 Yes.

Undoubtedly he has, although lawyers might differ as to whether the construction of the law on the question was the correct one. He answered as best he knew. The question he answered was one, besides, on which the company was advised. The $37,-000 mortgage was of record, and everybody is presumed to know the record as well as the law. Finding the apparent inconsistency of the answer with the record, the company was put on inquiry, and undoubtedly did inquire and was in-informed of the true condition of affairs. Insurance Co. v. McKee, 94 Ill. 400; Insurance Co. v. Chestnut, 50 id. 116; Insurance Co. v. Wright, 22 id. 474.</p> <opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b374-5\" pgmap=\"374\">Mr. Justice Scholeield</author> <p id=\"Adl\" pgmap=\"374\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b374-6\" pgmap=\"374\">The Appellate Court, by affirming the judgment, leave us only to inquire whether there was error of law in giving and ** refusing instructions, and in admitting evidence over appellant\u2019s objection. In the view we take of the case, there are but two questions of law: First, was there material error in giving the instruction, at the instance of appellee, set out in the preceding statement ? Second, was there material error in permitting the witness Gordon to state the circumstances under which he answered that the value of the property was $25,000?</p> <p id=\"b374-7\" pgmap=\"374\">First\u2014The objections urged against the validity of the agreement recited in the instruction are, first, that it was without consideration; and second, that it was not in writing.</p> <p id=\"b374-8\" pgmap=\"374(110) 375(20)\">1. The objection that it was without consideration assumes that there was simply an agreement to accept a less security for a greater, whereas the real agreement is, that parties who have hitherto been tenants in common of an entire property upon which, there is a mortgage, shall divide the property and the mortgage debt, and each enter upon, and thenceforth hold and use in severalty, the part set off to him by the division, and each pay, severally, the portion of the mortgage debt assigned to him. The agreement is an entire one, and the consideration of each part enters into and forms a part of the consideration of every part of the agreement. We think this was sufficient. 1 Chitty on Contracts, (11th Am. ed.) 28.</p> <p id=\"A9c\" pgmap=\"375\">2. The Statute of Frauds can have no application to the case. A parol release, or accord and satisfaction of the notes, as between the parties, is plainly sufficient. 2 Chitty on Contracts, (11th Am. ed.) 114-7, and authorities cited in note k. The payment or discharge of the debt evidenced by the notes operates to release the mortgage, which is but an incident to the debt. (Ryan v. Dunlap et al. 17 Ill. 40; Pollock et al. v. Maison et al. 41 id. 516; McMillan et al. v. McCormick, 117 id. 79.) And if the notes should be assigned before due, although the assignment would carry the mortgage in equity, yet Since it is only in equity that the assignment can have that effect, the same equitable defences may be interposed against the promissory notes in the hands of the assignee, that can be interposed against them in the hands of the payee. (Olds v. Cummings, 31 Ill. 188; Shippen et al. v. Whittier, 117 id. 282; Petillon v. Noble et al. 73 id. 567.) And so, the contract being valid as between the mortgagor and mortgagee, the mortgage was for but $17,000, and the instruction was right. This insurance, moreover,' is for the benefit of these mortgagees, and the insurance policy having been issued upon the faith that that was the extent of their mortgage, the mortgagees would, upon familiar principles, be equitably estopped to contend, as against the insurance company, that it was more. And so, also, upon the doctrine of Olds v. Cummings and Shippen v. Whittier, supra, any subsequent assignee of the notes would, in this respect, but stand in their shoes, and be entitled to interpose the same defence to the assertion of rights in equity, under the mortgage.</p> <p id=\"b375-5\" pgmap=\"375(52) 376(117)\">Second\u2014It was error to allow the witness to state why he valued the property at $25,000, but, in our opinion, it could do no harm. The questions put were somewhat ambiguous, and are, therefore, to be construed most favorably for the insured. We are of opinion, that in view of that ambiguity there was reasonable ground that he might have believed that he was required to give the whole value of the property, excluding the land,\u2014not merely that of the mill machinery,\u2014 which he did, correctly. And this was the purport of the answer of the witness,\u2014that he supposed the question alluded to the whole value of the property. It was the duty of the company, if they desired explicit and lucid answers in this respect, to frame their questions so that they could not mislead. The views expressed in the opinion of the Appellate Court (Mutual Mill Ins. Co. v. Gordon, 20 Bradw. 559,) upon this point, are somewhat more extended, and have our entire concurrence.</p> <p id=\"b376-5\" pgmap=\"376\">In conclusion, it is only necessary to add, that we concede the court erred in refusing to state to the jury whether the clause in the insurance policy in relation to the amount of the incumbrance wras a warranty; but since the first instruction, given at the instance of appellee, was correctly given, that error can have worked no harm to appellant. Had that instruction been correctly given as asked, the result must have been just as it is.</p> <p id=\"b376-6\" pgmap=\"376\">The judgment is affirmed</p> <p id=\"b376-7\" pgmap=\"376\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
