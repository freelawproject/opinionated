Section 107 of the Criminal Code, making it an offence to make, pass, utter or publish, with intent to defraud, any fictitious bill, note or check, purporting to be the bill, note, check, or other instrument, in writing for the payment of money or property, of some individual, when no such individual is in existence, knowing the same to be fictitious, embraces only such instruments in writing as contain an absolute or unconditional promise to pay money or property to the person therein named. It does not include contracts for the payment of money upon a sale of property upon its delivery at a certain time, or agreements to pay money upon a contingency that may never happen.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b61-9\" pgmap=\"61\">2. Construction of statutes\u2014of general words following an enumeration of particular cases. It is a well recognized rule in the construction of statutes, that if general words follow an enumeration of particular cases, such general words are held to apply only to cases of the same kind as those which are expressly mentioned.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b61-10\" pgmap=\"61\">3. Same.\u2014the rule as applied to section 107 of the Criminal Code. So, under a statute making it criminal to make or pass a fictitious bill, note or check, or other instrument in writing, for the payment of money, etc., the words, \u201cother instrument in writing, \u201d will only include such instruments as are of the same class or kind as those enumerated, such as money, bonds, due bills, and other instruments in writing containing an absolute, unconditional promise or obligation to pay a sum of money or personal property.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-13\" pgmap=\"61\">Writ of Error to the Circuit Court of Stephenson county; the Hon.

Shirk was tried and convicted of the crime of uttering and publishing an alleged fictitious instrument in writing, for the payment of money, his punishment being fixed at two years confinement in the penitentiary. By the present writ of error we are asked to review that conviction.</p> <p id=\"b63-7\" pgmap=\"63\">The indictment is founded on the 107th section of the Criminal Code, which, so far as it is supposed to have any application to this case, is as follows: \u201cWhoever shall make, pass, utter or publish, with an intention to defraud any other person, any fictitious bill, note or check, purporting to be the bill, note or check, or other instrument of writing for the payment of money or property, of some *' * * individual, when in fact there shall be no such * * * individual in existence, the said person, knowing the said bill, note, check, or instrument of writing for the payment of money or property, to be fictitious, shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than one nor more than twenty years.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b64-3\" pgmap=\"64\">The count in the indictment upon which the defendant was convicted, charges, that on the 20th of July, 1885, in Stephenson county, in the State of Illinois, Daniel F. Shirk feloniously did utter, publish and pass, as true and genuine, a certain false and fictitious instrument of writing for the payment of money, to one Harvey F. Perkins, he being then and there the H. F. Perkins in the instrument mentioned, which instrument then and there purported to have been signed by one Morton Walldecker, when in fact there was no such individual in existence, said Shirk then and there knowing said instrument to be false and fictitious, with intent thereby then and there to defraud said Harvey F. Perkins, which instrument is of the following tenor:</p> <blockquote id=\"b64-4\" pgmap=\"64\">\u201cHarvey F. Perkins\u2019</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b64-5\" pgmap=\"64\">Marble and Granite Works, Lena, III.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b64-6\" pgmap=\"64\">Adline, July 17, \u201985.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b64-7\" pgmap=\"64\">\u201cI have this day bought of H.

O. address: Adline, County of Ogle, State of Illinois. \u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b65-4\" pgmap=\"65\">The principal question presented for determination is, \"whether, assuming the instrument set out in the indictment to be fictitious, is it such a one as falls within the category of instruments contemplated by the section of the statute above cited. If it does not, of course the conviction can not be sustained, and it will therefore be unnecessary to consider other questions discussed in the briefs.</p> <p id=\"b65-5\" pgmap=\"65\">It is clear that the instrument is neither a bill, note, nor a check, according to either the popular or technical signification of those terms, and this is practically conceded by counsel for the State; but the contention is, that it is embraced within the general designation, \u201cother instrument in writing. \u201d This phrase seems to have been first introduced into our statute relating to negotiable instruments, in 1827, and it has from that time till the present, been the settled construction of this court, that in that connection it extends only to such instruments in writing as contain an absolute or unconditional promise to pay money or property to the payee therein named, or his assignee. This construction is fully recognized and approved in the late case of Canadian Bank v. McCrea et al. 106 Ill. 281.</p> <p id=\"b65-6\" pgmap=\"65(143) 66(29)\">In the section upon which the indictment is fOund'ed, the enumeration is, \u201cfictitious bills, notes, checks, or other instrument in writing. \u201d In the act relating to negotiable instruments, it is, \u201call promissory notes, bonds, due-bills, and other instruments in writing.\" Considering the expression, \u201cother instrument in writing, \u201d as it occurs in the Criminal Code, is taken from the act on negotiable instruments, and that it follows, in both acts, a specific enumeration of the same kind or class of 'instruments, there is certainly much force in the claim that its construction should be the same in both acts. This conclusion is certainly much strengthened by the fact that it is in strict conformity with the well recognized rule of construction, that \u201cif general words (as is the case here) follow an enumeration of particular cases, such general words are held to apply only to eases of the same kind as those which are expressly mentioned. \u201d Potter\u2019s Dwarris, 247, 248 ; In re Swigert, 119 Ill. 83.</p> <p id=\"b66-5\" pgmap=\"66\">Applying this principle to the present case, it is very clear the expression, \u201cor other instrument in writing, \u201d would only include such instruments as are of the same class or kind as. those mentioned, which would include, money bonds, due-bills, and all other instruments in writing containing an absolute, unconditional promise or obligation to pay a sum of money or personal property. If this is not the test, where is the line to be drawn? It certainly could not have been intended to-include all written contracts, which, if genuine, one or the-other of the contracting parties would, upon certain contingencies, be required to pay money or property under,\u2014such, for instance, as a contract for the purchase of a horse, to be paid for on delivery at a future day. The instrument or contract, in question does not, in principle, differ from the ease suggested. It is, in form, a contract in writing for the purchase-by Walldecker, from Perkins, of a marble monument, to be delivered on a future day, and paid for on delivery. \u2022 By the terms of the instrument it was wholly uncertain whether the-money would ever become payable. That depended altogether upon whether the monument was put up and tendered at the time and place specified in the instrument. If the statute was intended to extend to a fictitious contract like this, then it would apply to every executory contract where either of the parties bound himself to the other, though upon a mere contingency, for the payment of money or personal property. This can not be a proper construction of -the statute. If such was the intention of the legislature, the language used certainly fails to express it. Contracts like the one under consideration, are seldom, .if ever, the subject of sale or transfer, like bills, notes, checks, etc., hence it was not thought necessary to protect society from the sale of fictitious contracts which impose a merely contingent obligation to pay money or property.</p> <p id=\"b67-3\" pgmap=\"67\">We are clearly of opinion that the indictment under- which: the defendant was convicted is fatally defective, and that; the court therefore erred in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to&gt; quash it.</p> <p id=\"b67-4\" pgmap=\"67\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the court below is reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to quash the indictment and discharge the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b67-5\" pgmap=\"67\">Judgment reversed\u00bb</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
