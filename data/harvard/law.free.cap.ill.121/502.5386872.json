Where a schedule has been presented to the assessor, duly verified by the person listing the property, if the assessor shall be of opinion that the person listing property for himself or for another person, company or corporation, has not made a full and fair schedule of such property, he may examine such person under oath, in regard to the property he is required to schedule.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b502-14\" pgmap=\"502\">3.

Its personal property was assessed by the assessor of the town of South Chicago, for 1885, at $10,000, and it was so notified by the assessor. \" It then petitioned the town board, complaining that the assessment was too high, stating in its petition that it was a corporation, but had no paid up capital; that it did a commission business, using its customers\u2019 money to margin all deals made for their account; that it had expended $1300 in furnishing and fitting its office, and stated that it should be assessed only on the value of its office fixtures, and pray\u00e9d the review and correction of the assessment. Acting on the petition, the town board revi\u00e9wed and reduced the assessment to $5000, which, however, was raised by the State Board of Equalization to $6000, upon which a tax of $322.62 was extended.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-8\" pgmap=\"503(77) 504(23)\">Plaintiff in error reported to the State Board of Equalization, as required by law, the amount of its capital stock, number of shares, capital stock paid up, value of its stock, etc., wherein it represented that no part of its capital stock had been paid up; that its stock had no value; that its indebtedness amounted to $25,000, occasioned by losses in business since May 1, 1885, and that the value of its tangible property was $1300, and the State Board of Equalization assessed its stock and franchise at $7000, upon which a tax of $376.39 was extended.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-5\" pgmap=\"504\">After the tax warrant had come to the hands of defendant in error, as collector of taxes, plaintiff in error exhibited its bill\" in the Superior Court of Cook county against such collector, to enjoin the collection of such taxes.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-6\" pgmap=\"504(297) 505(213)\">The bill charges that the personal property of plaintiff in error was, by the town assessor, \u201carbitrarily and knowingly and fraudulently assessed\u201d at five times its value. The facts disclosed as constituting the fraud, may be thus summarized : A deputy assessor called at the place of business of plaintiff in error for the purpose of making an\" assessment of its taxable property, and was then told that the corporation had no credits; that it was doing only a commission business, and had no cash capital, and that the only personal property the corporation had was its office furniture and fixtures, that cost $1300, and that the deputy assessor listened to such statement without objection, and left; that after being notified by the assessor of his assessment at $10,000, it sent one of its officers to the assessor\u2019s office to protest against the assessment ; that the officer went to the assessor\u2019s office and protested, in the form of a written statement upon a blank furnished to him by a person in the assessor\u2019s office, supposing such blank to be a mere form, and was there assured that the assessment would be adjusted according to such statement ; that plaintiff in error relied on such assurance, and took no further care in reference to the matter, but at the time of filing the bill it learned that the blank on which the written statement was made, was, in fact, an application to the town board to review the assessment, and which the assessor himself presented to the town board, and, on his representation, the assessment, at \u00a75000, was confirmed. Further, that plaintiff in error was always ready and willing to submit its affairs to examination by the assessor, or to answer all questions touching its property, but the assessor made no inquiries of it as to its property, or notified it of his dissatisfaction with the statement that had been made to him concerning such property. The bill further charges, that when he made the assessment the assessor knew there was no other property for him to assess, except the office furniture and fixtures, the value of which he knew, from inspection; that in making his assessment, and his representations before the town board, the assessor claimed his assessment covered cash capital as well as office furniture and fixtures, and which claim was without evidence on which to rest, and was in opposition to the statement of plaintiff in error. The bill also charged that the action of the State Board of Equalization in raising the assessment on the personal property from $5000 to $6000, and also in assessing the stock and franchise of plaintiff in error at $7000, was fraudulent, in that it was made \u201carbitrarily, without a single fact or item of information as a basis, \u201d \u201cin utter disregard of every circumstance which can tend to indicate the values of capital stock and corporate franchises, \u201d knowing the same to be \u201cgrossly excessive, unjust and unequal.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-5\" pgmap=\"505(141) 506(55)\">The answer expressly denied that the assessor, on receiving the complaint of too high assessment, promised to reduce the assessment according to the statement in the complaint, but refused to do so, and averred that the assessment was not alone upon the office furniture and fixtures, but also upon the amount of necessary money employed in the business of plaintiff in error; that the business of plaintiff in error was operating what is commonly called a \u201cbucket shop,\u201d in Chicago, in buying and selling grain, produce, option deals, stock, etc., in which business it necessarily had on hand a considerable amount of money, and that it held itself out as financially solvent; that $5000 was a reasonable and lawful assessment of the value of the personal property of plaintiff in error, as deliberately judged by the town board of review. .It also denied that the assessor knew the only property of plaintiff in error was the office furniture and fixtures, and -denied all fraud charged against.the assessor, town board and State Board of Equalization. By stipulation, the cause was heard on bill, answer and affidavits, when the temporary injunction was dissolved and the bill dismissed.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-5\" pgmap=\"506\">Messrs.

The law made it the duty of the \u201cpresident, or proper agent or officer, \u201d of this corporation, to furnish to the assessor such schedule, (Revenue act, sec. 6, clause 8,) under oath. (Ibid. sec. 24.) There is no averment that the assessor said or did anything to induce plaintiff in error not to schedule, or to prevent it from scheduling, its property, and having the same verified by the oath of the proper officer of the corporation. (Revenue act, sec. 24.) The bill avers that the plaintiff in error was. ready and willing to submit its affairs to examination by the \u25a0assessor, and to answer all his questions touching its property ; but the law casts no such duty upon the assessor in \u25a0cases where the property owner neglects to make the schedule required by law. When a schedule has been presented to the assessor, duly verified by the person listing the property, if \u201cthe assessor shall be of opinion that the person listing property for himself or for any other person, company or corporation, has not made a full, fair and complete schedule of such property, he may examine such person, under oath, in regard to the amount of the property he is required to schedule.\u201d (Revenue act, sec. 26.) The law does not make it the duty of the assessor to enter upon such an inquiry in the first instance, or in any case, unless he doubts the correctness of the sworn schedule he is asked to accept. The duty cast upon the assessor to assess the property within his town at its fair \u25a0cash value, is entirely independent of anything the property owner may or may not do.</p> <p id=\"b509-4\" pgmap=\"509(188) 510(185)\">The bill further charges that the assessor knew, when he made the assessment, that, except the office furniture and fixtures, costing $1300,\u2014the value of which he knew from inspection,\u2014the plaintiff in error had no other property subject to taxation. The cause was heard on the verified bill, read as an affidavit, and two affidavits,\u2014one of Witherspoon, president, and the joint affidavit of Witherspoon and Skakel, an officer of the corporation. And this was all the proof offered by plaintiff in error. In the joint affidavit referred to, it was said, that on May 1, 1885, plaintiff in error \u201chad no cash capital whatever, of which the said assessor, his deputies and said town board had notice.\u201d And in the affidavit of Witherspoon it is said, that when the deputy assessor called at the place of business of plaintiff in error, he was told \u201cthat the corporation had no credits; that it was doing only a commission business, and had no cash capital, and that the only personal property the corporation had was its office furniture and fixtures, \u201d etc. Is this such notice as takes from the assessor the power, or relieves him from the duty, in cases where no sworn schedule is presented to him, of listing- and assessing the property of the corporation \u201caccording to-his best judgment and information?\u201d And if he, nevertheless, in good faith, makes an assessment \u201caccording to his best judgment and information,\u201d (Revenue act, see. 24,) is. Such assessment fraudulent if he makes a mistake and overvalues the property ? Both inquiries must be answered in the negative. The circumstances were not such as to show bad faith on the part of the assessor, and we regard the reasons assigned by him, and by the town board, for disregarding such verbal, unsworn representations, and for assuming that, from the nature of its business, plaintiff in error had and used a reasonable amount of capital in- its business, and that $5000, including the fair cash value of its furniture and fixtures, was a reasonable amount and valuation under the-circumstances, as within the reasonable exercise of that judicial discretion vested in the assessor and the town .board by the law.</p> <p id=\"b510-6\" pgmap=\"510\">It seems that after the assessor had acted in the premises, he sent the following notification to plaintiff in error, and. which was duly received by the latter, viz:</p> <blockquote id=\"b510-7\" pgmap=\"510\">\u201cI have valued your personal property subject to assessment, at No. 140 Monroe street, which you. are by law required to list, at the sum of $10,000. If not satisfactory, you will please call and schedule the same within one day.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b510-8\" pgmap=\"510\">Frank Drake, Assessor. \u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b510-9\" pgmap=\"510(78) 511(228)\">Plaintiff in error promptly sent its agent, Skakel, to the assessor\u2019s office. As to what was there said, the evidence is conflicting, but as to what was done, there is the greatest certainty. Although by this notice plaintiff in error was invited to call and schedule its property, as required by law, and although, by its proper officer, plaintiff in error did call, it did not schedule its property. What it did, was to execute and leave with the assessor, to be by him presented at the proper time, a petition to the town board of review, wherein it was-represented that it owned the property set opposite its name considered itself aggrieved, and complained that the property thereafter described was assessed too high, for the reason it was a corporation under the laws of this State, but had no paid up capital; that it did a commission business, using its customers\u2019 money to margin all deals made for their account; that it had rented rooms, and had expended $1300 in fixtures therefor, and should be assessed only on the value of such fixtures, and prayed a review and correction of the assessment accordingly. Notwithstanding the fact of the making- and delivery of this petition for review of assessment by the town board, the bill charges that Skakel was told by some one in the assessor\u2019s office, that the assessment would be1 adjusted to the statement just made, and that reliance was-placed on such representation, and nothing further done in the matter. McKinnor, the deputy assessor who received the petition, swears that he was applied to at the assessor\u2019s office by plaintiff in error to reduce the assessment, but refused so-to do, and referred plaintiff in error to the town board- for review,- and supplied it with blanks for that purpose.</p> <p id=\"b511-4\" pgmap=\"511\">We fail to perceive that in anything the assessor did or failed to do, he deceived or misled plaintiff in error. If plaintiff in error relied upon an assurance of the assessor that he would reduce the assessment to the value of the furniture and fixtures, why petition the town board to review and reduce the assessment ? The execution of the petition for review is not denied, though it is charged the agent of plaintiff in error did not know he was executing a petition. It was his duty to know the contents of the instrument he was executing. The charge and pretence that plaintiff in error, acting through its agent, did not know the contents of the paper it formally executed, in respect of so important a matter of business, can not be seriously considered.</p> <p id=\"b512-4\" pgmap=\"512\">Plaintiff in error has, in our opinion, utterly failed to show any fact or circumstance tending to impeach, for fraud, the assessment of its property as made by the assessor, and reviewed and confirmed by the town board. That its petition to the latter board was received and considered, is conclusively shown by the action of the board in reducing the assessment from $10,000 to $5000, and if plaintiff in error was dissatisfied with the action of the town board in the premises, it should have availed itself of its further legal remedy, viz, by complaint, as one aggrieved, to the following July meeting of the county board, whose power to correct matters of over-assessment was ample. (Revenue act, sec. 97.) This it did not do. Not having availed itself of its adequate legal remedy, plaintiff in error must bear the consequences of any overvaluation and assessment of its property. A court of equity could afford it no relief. Adsit v. Lieb, 76 Ill. 198; Humphrey et al. v. Nelson, 115 id. 45. See, also, Spencer et al. v. The People, 68 Ill. 510; Republic Life Ins. Co. v.

Jacques, 101 id. 644; Felsenthal v. Johnson, 104 id. 21.</p> <p id=\"b512-5\" pgmap=\"512\">The charge of fraud against the action of the State Board of Equalization in raising the valuation of the personal property, and in valuing for taxation the stock and franchise of plaintiff in error, is without support. The courts can not inquire into the manner in which, or the basis adopted by, the State Board of Equalization to ascertain and arrive at the value fixed on this property, or to change the valuation they may have made. Republic Life Ins. Co. v. Pollak, 75 Ill. 292.</p> <p id=\"b512-6\" pgmap=\"512(57) 513(33)\">The general doctrine of this court is, that a court of equity will not entertain a bill to restrain the collection of a tax, except in cases where the tax is unauthorized by law, or where it is assessed upon property not subject to taxation, or where the property has been fraudulently assessed at too high a rate. (Porter v. Rockford, Rock Island and St. Louis Railroad Co. supra.) The gravamen of this bill, fraud in the assessment, being unsupported by the evidence, the bill was properly dismissed.</p> <p id=\"b513-5\" pgmap=\"513\">The decree of the Superior Court of Cook county, dismiss- \u2022 ing the bill, will therefore be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b513-6\" pgmap=\"513\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
