There being no rule of law or practice authorizing the filing of any kind of' answer or plea to a petition for the condemnation of land, there is no error - in compelling the land owner to proceed with the trial without disposing of a \u2022 plea of nul tiel corporation filed.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b264-13\" pgmap=\"264\">2. Same\u2014corporate existence of petitioner\u2014and of evidence to the jury on that subject. In a proceeding under the statute, to assess the land owner\u2019s \u2022 compensation for land taken for a right of way and damages to lands not taken, it is not necessary to show that the capital stock of the railway company, plaintiff, has all been subscribed,\u2014or, in other words, to show it is a, corporation de jure. It is sufficient in this proceeding to show a corporation de facto.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b264-14\" pgmap=\"264\">3. Evidence showing the petitioner is a de facto corporation, should not go to the jury called to estimate the compensation and damages; but if it is-sufficient to satisfy the court of the petitioner\u2019s right to proceed, the error \u25a0 in suffering it to go to the jury is so small and harmless as not to require a reversal.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b264-15\" pgmap=\"264(37) 265(53)\">4. Pbactice\u2014remarks of counsel to jury. Where the language of coun- ' sel tends to excite passion and prejudice to a degree that will probably cloud the judgment, and therefore improperly affect the verdict, the court should. prompt!)' check and rebuke him; and for a failure in this respect, a verdict in favor of the party whose counsel thus abuses his position should be set aside. But it must not be assumed that every mis-statement of law or fact will have the effect of exciting improper prejudice in the jury.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b265-4\" pgmap=\"265\">Appeal from the County Court of Washington county; the Hon.

Miller v. Dunlap, 22 Mo. App. 97 Marble v. Walters, 19 id. 134; Roeder v. Studt, 12 id. 566 ; Brown v. Railroad Co. 66 id. 588; State v. Lee, id. 165; State v. Barnham, 82 id. 67.

Fobman, and Mr. Daniel Hay, for the appellee:</attorneys><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-8\" pgmap=\"266\">The trial court committed no error in its ruling on plea of nul tiel corporation. No pleadings are necessary in such cases. Smith v. Railroad Co. 105 Ill. 511.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-9\" pgmap=\"266\">The remarks made by the attorney for petitioner, assigned \u25a0as error under the above head, are not of such grave import as to justify a reversal of this case. They were supported by the evidence, and are proper to be in an argument. The only substantial reason that can be urged, in such cases, for reversal is, that the damages are not sufficient.</p> <opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"AFb\" pgmap=\"266\">Mr. Justice Soholpield</author> <p id=\"AMd\" pgmap=\"266\">delivered the opinion- of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b266-11\" pgmap=\"266(74) 267(38)\">This is an appeal from a judgment in a condemnation proceeding. The appellee filed a petition to condemn land for right of way for its railroad, and the land owner thereupon filed a cross-petition for the assessment of damages to lands \u2022not taken for right of way. A verdict was returned by the jury, assessing the compensation for land taken, and damages to land not taken, at $650. The court, after overruling = a motion for a new trial, rendered j udgment upon this verdict, and the case comes to this court by the appeal of the land \u2022owner. Several grounds are urged for a reversal of the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b267-4\" pgmap=\"267\">First\u2014It is contended that the court erred in compelling \u00a1appellant to proceed with the trial before disposing of the plea \u2022of nul tiel corporation. But since we have held there is no rule of law or practice authorizing the filing of any kind of \u2022an answer to a petition for condemnation of land under the Eminent Domain act, (Smith et al. v. Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad Co. 105 Ill. 511,) it is impossible that this objection, can be well taken.</p> <p id=\"b267-5\" pgmap=\"267(244) 268(76)\">Second\u2014It is next contended that the court erred in admit\"ting improper evidence. This refers to certified copies of articles of incorporation of the petitioner, and evidence of Riser thereunder; and the objection is, first, that the articles \u2022ought not to have been admitted at all, because there was not also proof accompanying, that the full amount of stock prowided for had been subscribed; and second, that in no event should the proof have gone to the jury. The first objection is predicated upon Allman v. Havana, Rantoul and Eastern Railroad Co. 88 Ill. 521, in which it was held, that until proof of the whole amount of stock provided for is subscribed, there can be no recovery upon a subscription for stock. That decision is upon the principle that the legal existence of the corporation is the consideration of the subscription, and, therefore, until it is proved, the contract is without consideration, and can not be enforced. There must, in such cases, not only be proof of a corporation de facto, but, likewise, of a corporation dejare. Where the direct effect of the proceeding is to divest title in favor of a party claiming to be a corporation, the same rule also applies. (See Hudson v. Green Hill Seminary Corporation, 113 Ill. 618.) But this is regarded, not as a proceeding to determine titles, but merely to assess compenisation and damages; and because of the peculiar language of our statute, we have held that1 it is sufficient, in this proceeding, to show a corporation defacto. (Ward v. Minnesota and, Northwestern Railroad Co. 119 Ill. 287.) The evidence introduced was clearly sufficient for that purpose. It is true, this, evidence should not have gone to the jury; but since it was sufficient to satisfy the court of the petitioner\u2019s corporate existence, what harm can it have done ? We can perceive none.</p> <p id=\"Aq\" pgmap=\"268\">Third\u2014The last objection is, that the counsel for the railroad company was permitted to make improper remarks to-the jury, over appellants\u2019 objections. The most objectionable-remarks are these: \u201cThis railroad will benefit the public and each of us, if built. If you fix these damages too high, the-company will not pay them, and the road will not be built. We will never get railroads if they have to pay such damages, for right of 'way. \u201d Where the language of counsel tends to-excite passion and prejudice to a degree that will probably cloud the judgment, and therefore improperly affe.et the verdict to be rendered, it should be promptly checked by the court at the time, and the counsel rebuked, and for a failure in this regard, a verdict on behalf of the party whose counsel thus abuses his position, should be set aside. But it is not to-be assumed that every mis-statement of law or of fact will have the effect of exciting improper prejudices. The instructions of the court and the good sense of a competent jury are. a .sufficient protection against ordinary errors of statement.. and false arguments of counsel. We find nothing in this-record to induce us to believe (the jury having been correctly-instructed as to the law,) that they were excited by these r\u00e9marks to act in a way they would not otherwise have acted.</p> <p id=\"b268-6\" pgmap=\"268\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b268-7\" pgmap=\"268\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
