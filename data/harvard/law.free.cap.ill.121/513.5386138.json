On their arrival at Moawequa they were driven to what is known in that locality as the \u201cTanner farm, \u201d being the same upon which Mcllvane was then living. The farm contained from four to five hundred acres in grass, and was used by Milligan &amp; Mcllvane for pasturing and handling cattle. The first or second day after the arrival of the stock at the Tanner farm, McGuire, in company with Milligan, went over to the farm of the defendant, some twelve miles distant, in a north-east direction, where they met the defendant, -took dinner with him, examined his pastures, cattle, etc. During the interview, McGuire informed him of having brought the two hundred and eighteen head of cattle to the Tanner farm, but nothing in particular seems to have been said as to their ownership, or the terms or conditions upon which they were put there.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\" pgmap=\"517\">Before the making of the contract above set forth, Milligan &amp; Mcllvane had entered into a somewhat similar one with Montgomery, in respect to the purchasing and pasturing of cattle. While that contract bears no date, yet Montgomery swears it was finally concluded on the last days of April, 1885. The contract, together with the one supplemental thereto, dated October 7, 1885, is as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\" pgmap=\"517(193) 518(358)\">\u201cMemorandum of agreement between L.

And it is further agreed, that said second parties are to receive and accept for their services in attending to said business for Montgomery, the profit that shall accrue from said deal after Montgomery shall be paid the sum of $1200 for said pasture, on or before December 1, 1885, with eight per cent interest after that date, till paid,\u2014the sum of $5000 furnished to purchase said cattle, with eight per cent interest thereon for the time the same is used by said parties in said stock, and the sum of $750.10, with eight per cent interest thereon from March 1, 1885, being a balance due said Montgomery on a previous deal, provided the said stock brings so much. It is distinctly agreed between said parties, that the stock so furnished shall be the sole and absolute property of said Montgomery, and the said stock on said pasture shall be in his possession and in his control,\u2014 said second parties having put no money in the same, all the purchase money having been furnished by said Montgomery.

Under the supplementary contract of the 7th of October, Milligan \u2022&amp; McIlvane took one hundred and twenty-five head of these \u25a0cattle out of the pasture, to be fed and fattened, as therein \u25a0contemplated. After they were thus prepared for market they were sold, and Montgomery received the proceeds, but just what he got for them he does not state. The remaining thirty-two of the one hundred and fifty-seven head were also sold for his benefit, and he admits to having received for them $1058.76, although he states himself \u201cthey were the tail of the lot. \u201d At the same rates the entire lot would have brought $5194.54. This lot of cattle was in Montgomery\u2019s pasture at the date of Milligan &amp; Mcllvane\u2019s contract with Brush and McGuire. On the 10th of October, 1885, Milligan &amp; McIlvane, assuming that under their contract with Montgomery they had the right to do so, drove one hundred and thirty-one of the plaintiffs\u2019 cattle to Montgomery\u2019s place, and turned them in upon his pasture, for the reason, as stated by them, the grazing was better there, at that time, than on the Tanner farm. At the time of the extension of the plaintiffs\u2019 contract with Milligan &amp; Mcllvane, in November, McGuire went over to look at the one hundred and thirty-one head of plaintiffs\u2019 cattle in Montgomery\u2019s pasture, though it does not seem that anything in particular passed between him and Montgomery in respect to the cattle being there, or the ownership of them.</summary><summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-5\" pgmap=\"520\">It is claimed by Montgomery, that when he consented to the taking of the one hundred and twenty-\u00f1ve head of cattle out of his own pasture, it was understood that Milligan &amp; Mcllvane were to replace them with others. It is further claimed by him, that when they placed the one.hundred and thirty-one head of plaintiffs\u2019 cattle in his pasture, as above stated, he understood them to be put there in pursuance of such understanding, and that he did not know, at the time, that they belonged to plaintiffs, nor, indeed, that plaintiffs had any claim upon them. These claims of the defendant are denied by the plaintiffs, and in this they are sustained by both Milligan and Mcllvane. In the latter part of November, some controversy having arisen about the ownership of these cattle, Montgomery Caused them to be removed a few miles distant, to Canney\u2019s place, where they were pastured and cared for a short time, when Montgomery, as he admits, took them (at least one hundred,and twenty-eight of them,) to Chicago, where he sold them, and appropriated the pro-, ceeds to his own use, as heretofore seen. Omitting interest, appellant\u2019s entire claim against Milligan &amp; Mcllvane was but $6950.10. He admits to have received on it, altogether, $6165.66, which would leave only a balance of $784.44, exclusive of interest, or thereabouts.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-6\" pgmap=\"520\">Messrs.

To our minds the case is free from difficulty. On the trial in the circuit court, there was a sharp controversy as to two questions of fact, upon the decision of which it is manifest, from the evidence, as well as the instructions of the court, the case mainly turned. It was claimed by Montgomery, that the one hundred and thirty-one head of cattle belonging to appellees were put in his pasture by Milligan &amp; Mcllvane in part performance of their contract with him, and that at the time he received them, he had no notice of the fact that they were ap23ellees\u2019 cattle, or that the latter had any claim U230n them. On this hypothesis, the court, by a number of instructions, told the jury, that if the evidence sustained this claim of appellant, they should find for him. On the other hand, appellees contended that the cattle in question were 23laced on appellant\u2019s premises by Milligan &amp; Mcllvane, to be pastured, merely, without any understanding, 23urpose or intention, on their 23art, of delivering them to a23pellant, under his contract with them. The jury, upon this 2ilain and single issue, found for the appellees. In doing so, it is manifest that they must have found, as a matter of fact, either that the cattle were not delivered to appellant under his contract with Milligan &amp; Mcllvane, or that he, at the time they were placed in his field, had actual or constructive notice of appellees\u2019 ownership of them, for otherwise, under the instructions of the court, there would clearly be nothing to sustain the finding of the jury. So far as the result is concerned, it is a matter of no consequence which of these facts was found in favor of appellees, for one is just as fatal to appellant\u2019s theory of the ease as the other. \"With these questions of fact, of course we have nothing to do, nor with the evidence tending to prove or disprove them, \u25a0except in its relation to the instructions.</p> <p id=\"b523-5\" pgmap=\"523\">Appellant makes the point, that to maintain trover it must \u25a0\u2022appear that both the right of property and of possession were in plaintiffs, as against the defendant, at the time of the \u00a1alleged conversion, and cites a number of authorities in -its support. The rule contended for is, without doubt, the law. Indeed, it is so elementary in its character that the citation \u25a0of authorities in its support was not at all necessary. Conceding the rule, as we do, we nevertheless fail to perceive that it presents any obstacle to the plaintiffs\u2019 right of recovery,\u2014 \u2022assuming, as we must, that the jury found the facts to be as claimed by them.</p> <p id=\"b523-6\" pgmap=\"523(189) 524(79)\">Appellant was examined as a witness, on the trial, in his \u25a0own behalf. While so being examined, he was interrogated with respect to what he may have heard Mellvane or Milligan \u00a1say about how they came to put plaintiffs\u2019 cattle in his field. \u25a0On plaintiffs\u2019 objection, the court excluded the answer to the \u2022question, and this is assigned for error. We have no doubt \u25a0of the correctness of the ruling of the court upon this point. 'The exact question propounded to appellant was this: \u201cHave ;you heard either of them say how they came to put the one hundred and thirty-one head in there,\u2014what they put them in under ? If you heard either of them say, state. \u201d It will be observed that the declarations sought to be elicited by this \u25a0question are not limited to any particular time or place. Had the inquiry been confined to what they may have said on that subject at the time the cattle were put into the pasture, it would doubtless have been a proper question. Declarations made by any of the parties at that time, expressive of the object of putting the cattle into the pasture, would clearly have been a part of the res gestee, and would have been admissible as such.. But no such a case as that is here presented. By the question propounded it was sought to put in evidence the general statements of persons neither parties to the record nor in, privity with those against whom they were sought to be used. This the rules of law governing the production of testimony forbid.</p> <p id=\"b524-5\" pgmap=\"524\">With respect to the instructions, we have no fault to find' with the rulings of the trial court. If any error was committed, it was in the interest of the appellant, and consequently affords no ground for complaint on his part. Appellant\u2019s-refused instructions, we think, were either not the law, or calculated to mislead the jury, and were, therefore, properly-refused.</p> <p id=\"b524-6\" pgmap=\"524\">The judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b524-7\" pgmap=\"524\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
