In an action by a colored woman, against the proprietor of a theater, for denying her equal privileges, etc., the only case her evidence tended to prove was, that after having paid, through another, for a ticket to the first balcony, she was first denied admission thereto, and afterward denied admission to any part of the theatei', on account of her color. On the trial, the defendant offered to prove that he had adopted a rule requiring colored people to sit in the same row, separate from white people, and that it was the rule of his theater that colored persons were given the same advantages, for the same price, in all parts thereof, that whites had, except that the former were assigned a particular row of seats,\u2014which the court refused to allow: Held, that the court ruled properly, as the .proposed evidence was irrelevant to the issue.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b287-11\" pgmap=\"287\">4.

The circuit court overruled a motion for a new trial, and gave judgment upon the verdict of the jury, and this judgment, on appeal to the Appellate Court for the First District, was affirmed.

He also offered to prove that it was the rule of his theater that colored persons were given the same advantages for the same price, in all parts of this theater, that white persons had, with the exception, only, that the colored persons were assigned to a particular row of seats; but the court refused to allow the evidence to he given. Appellant also asked the court to give to the jury, among others, the following instructions, but the court declined to do so, namely:</p> <blockquote id=\"b291-5\" pgmap=\"291\">\u201c3. The jury are instructed that the defendants were legally justified in assigning colored persons to seats in the theater of defendant, Baylies, separate and apart from the seats of white persons, provided the seats to which such colored persons were assigned were equally comfortable and well situated.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-6\" pgmap=\"291\">\u201c5. You are instructed, as a matter of law, that the proprietor or manager of a theater has the right to make such reasonable rules as he may see fit, regarding the seating of the occupants of his theater, or the disposition, arrangement or classification of tickets sold to different persons or classes of persons, provided such rules are reasonable, and do not discriminate against any certain class or race of people as regards the prices and location of such seats.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b291-7\" pgmap=\"291\">Exceptions to these rulings present the only question that we are now required to consider.</p> <p id=\"b291-8\" pgmap=\"291(70) 292(73)\">It would seem too plain to admit of serious controversy, that the circuit court ruled properly, because the evidence offered and the instructions asked were irrelevant to the issue being tried by the jury. Appellee offered no evidence tending to-show that appellant or his servants seated or offered to seat her in the same row with other colored people, against her objection, nor did appellant introduce or offer to introduce such evidence. The only case her evidence tended to prove was, that after having paid, through another, for the requisite ticket to the \u201cfirst balcony,\u201d she was first denied admission thereto, and afterwards denied admission to every part of the theater, because of her color. The rule requiring colored people to sit in the same row, separate and apart from white people, manifestly had no tendency to justify either of these exclusions.</p> <p id=\"b292-5\" pgmap=\"292\">Beyond all question, sections 1 and 2 of the \u201cAct to protect all citizens in their civil and legal rights, and fixing a penalty for violation of the same,\u201d approved June 10, 1885, (Laws of 1885, p. 64,) prohibit the denial of access to the theater and to the several circles or grades of seats therein because of race or color, for such is, in effect, the language.employed. The first section says: \u201cAll persons within the jurisdiction of said State shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of * * * theaters, * * * subject only to the conditions and limitations established hy law, and applicable alike to all citizens.\u201d The second section says: \u201cAny person who shall violate any of the provisions of the foregoing section, by denying to any citizen, except for reasons applicable alike to all citizens of every race and color, and regardless of color or race, .the full enjoyment of any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges in said section enumerated, * * * shall for every such offense forfeit and pay a sum not less than twenty-five (25) dollars, nor more than five hundred (500) dollars, to the person aggrieved thereby.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b292-6\" pgmap=\"292(74) 293(24)\">It would be difficult to employ more comprehensive and sweeping language to abolish all distinctions in accommodations, facilities, privileges or advantages in theaters on account of race or color, than that thus employed. But it is enough for the present that it includes denial of access to the theater, and denial to the first balcony of the theater, and that it is not contended, nor, in our opinion, can it reasonably be contended, that these sections are inoperative by reason of repugnance to provisions of the constitution of this State or of the United States.</p> <p id=\"b293-5\" pgmap=\"293\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b293-6\" pgmap=\"293\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
