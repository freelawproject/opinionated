Meottaniq\u2019s dien\u2014of the estate or interest to which the lien may attach. The statute gives a mechanic's lien for labor or materials upon any estate or interest the owner may have in the premises at the time of making the contract. The statute gives the lien against a party in possession claiming to own the title, and it is not necessary to show the title any further, in order to create the lien.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b115-12\" pgmap=\"115\">2.

The original payee took an assignment of the judgment, and offered to cancel the same in such manner as the court might direct: Held, that the latter had a right to a decree for a mechanic\u2019s lien on the original note, although the time when the renewal note fell due was more than one year after the time fixed for the completion of the work.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b116-5\" pgmap=\"116\">5.

Chisholm, partners, composing the firm of Chisholm Bros., against F. F. Randolph, the First National Bank of Charleston, the First National Bank of Norwalk, Ohio, Theo.

The work was not completed, however, until the 15th day of September, 1882, but upon the completion of the work the mill was accepted by Randolph, and the four notes for the $8000 remaining due were then all executed, due in three, six, nine and twelve months, as provided in the contract. These notes were all paid except the one for $2105, due in nine months, which was assigned before maturity to Nordyke &amp; Harmon Co., a corporation of the State of Indiana. Three days after the maturity of this note, and on June 18, 1883, Randolph executed to Nordyke &amp; Harmon Co. a new note for $2105, due in four months, with interest at eight per cent, which was guaranteed by Chisholm Bros., and the old note was surrendered. Neither the old note nor the new one has ever been paid. A judgment, however, was rendered in favor of Nordyke &amp; Harmon Co. on the new note, November 27, 1883, for $2179.29, the amount of principal and interest. This judgment, at the time of the filing of the petition, was owned and held by Chisholm Bros., the petitioners, and they offered, in their bill, to cancel and satisfy the judgment in such manner as the court might direct.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\" pgmap=\"118\">\u2022 As heretofore said, the petition was brought to collect the amount of the note which became due in nine months after it was executed, to-wit, June 15, 1883, which was executed for $2105. As to the execution and delivery of the new note on the 18th of June, 1883, by Randolph to Nordyke &amp; Harmon Co., for said sum of $2105, in the place of the original note, it is alleged in the petition, that said last note was not a payment of said original note, and that there was no agreement or understanding between said Randolph and orators that such note should he in satisfaction or payment of the original indebtedness, but upon the contrary, orators aver that said indebtedness of $2105, so originally evidenced by said third promissory note, remained due and wholly unpaid to your orators; that they have frequently requested said Randolph to pay the same, etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\" pgmap=\"118\">In the circuit court, the First National Bank of Charleston filed a disclaimer, and was dismissed out of the case. Randolph, after the cause was remanded from the Appellate Court, failed to answer, and a default was taken as to him. The other three defendants, the First National Bank of Norwalk, Ohio, Theo. Williams and Frank Goodnow, answered the bill. A replication was filed, and on a hearing before the court, a decree was rendered in favor of complainants, which was affirmed in the Appellate Court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-4\" pgmap=\"119\">Messrs.

Section 3, chapter 82, of our statute, entitled \u201cLiens, \u201d provides: \u201c When the contract is expressed, no lien shall be created if the time stipulated for the completion of the work or furnishing materials is beyond three years from the commencement thereof, or the time of payment beyond one year from the time stipulated for the completion thereof.\u201d Here, the work was completed on the 15th day of September, 1883, and the note in question was made payable in nine months from that time,\u2019 which would be less than one year, and clearly within the terms of the statute.</p> <p id=\"b120-11\" pgmap=\"120(59) 121(69)\">But it is argued that the extension of the time of payment for four months after the note became due, made the money payable more than a year from the time of the completion of the contract, and thus the lien was lost. The same question arose in Paddock v. Stout, 121 Ill. 572, and we there held that the extension of the time of payment after the execution of the contract would not defeat the lien,\u2014that the lien depends upon the provisions which the contract makes as to the time of payment. Here, under the contract made by the parties, the time of payment was not extended beyond one year from the completion of the work, and complainants have not lost the lien conferred by the statute.</p> <p id=\"b121-5\" pgmap=\"121\">It is also claimed that Randolph had no interest in the premises in controversy on the 1st day of May, 1882, when he made the contract with the complainants, and upon this ground the decree is erroneous. Our statute does not require that a person should own the fee to enable a mechanic to obtain a lien. It declares: \u201cThe lien provided for * * * shall extend to an estate in fee, for life, for years, or any other estate, or any right of redemption or other interest which such owner may have in the lot or land at the time of making the contract.\u201d The language here employed is very broad, and is sufficient to carry the lien to any title whatever that Randolph might possess when he entered into the contract. What title Randolph held when he entered into the agreement with the complainants we are not called upon to determine in this proceeding. The evidence shows that he was in possession of the premises, claiming to be the owner of the mill, when the contract was made. It also appears, that in 1881 the First National Bank of Charleston leased the premises to Neal Bros, for five years, with the privilege of buying. This contract was transferred by the Neal Bros, to Randolph as early as February, 1882, and he was placed in possession of the property. It will not be necessary to trace the title back from the First National Bank of Charleston, and show that the bank derived a title in fee or for years. It is enough that the evidence shows Randolph in possession of the premises, claiming title therein.</p> <p id=\"b121-7\" pgmap=\"121(34) 122(132)\">It is also claimed, in the argument, that the surrender of the note due June 15,1883, and the acceptance of the note of June 18, 1883, payable to Nordyke &amp; Harmon Co., and the rendition of judgment thereon, was a payment of the original note, and a discharge of the lien given by the statute. If the last note, under an agreement of the parties, had been accepted as payment of the first note, there would be much force in the position of counsel; but such was not the case. It is shown by the evidence, beyond question, that there was no understanding or agreement that the last note should be accepted as payment of the first. We think it may be stated to be a general rule, that a new note given in renewal of another note will.not be regarded as a satisfaction of the original note, unless there is an express or implied agreement that such was the intention of the parties.</p> <p id=\"b122-5\" pgmap=\"122\">If we are correct in this position, then it is clear that the debt due on the 15th day of June, 1883, ($2105,) has never been paid or discharged, and as complainants have an assignment of the judgment rendered upon, the note given in renewal, and were prepared to cancel it when, the bill was filed, no reason is perceived why they could not maintain their bill, as held in the circuit and Appellate courts. But upon an examination of the decree rendered in the circuit court, it appears that the decree requires Bandolph to pay $2709.28 within a specified time, with interest from December 16, 1887. This was a larger sum than -was actually due. The basis of the decree should have been the amount due June 15, 1883,\u2014 $2105,\u2014for which the original note was executed. Computing interest on this amount from June 15, 1883, until December 16, 1887, at six per cent,\u2014four years, six months and one day,\u2014the amount due will be $2673.70,\u2014 $35.59 less than the amount decreed to be paid.</p> <p id=\"b122-6\" pgmap=\"122\">As to the excess of $35.59, the decree of the circuit eoprt and the judgment of the Appellate Court will be modified. In all other respects they will be affirmed, each party to pay one-half of the costs in this court.</p> <p id=\"b122-7\" pgmap=\"122\">Decree reversed in part and in part affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
