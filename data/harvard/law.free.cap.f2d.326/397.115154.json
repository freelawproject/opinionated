L. R. B. v. Interurban Gas Corporation, 317 F.2d 724, 725:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">\u201cOur review here is limited to the question whether there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s findings and order. Title 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e); Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456. Likewise,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-14\">\u2018 \u201cIt is well settled that the credibility of witnesses and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence are matters for determination by the Trial Examiner and the Board.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Bendix Corp., 299 F.2d 308, 310, C.A. 6, cert, denied [371 U.S. 827] 83 S.Ct. 47 [9 L.Ed.2d 65]. Where credibility accorded witnesses by the trial examiner is such as would justify conflicting inferences with reference to a discharge, \u201cwe are not permitted to weigh the evidence, resolve its conflicting inferences, nor draw our own inferences therefrom. The Board\u2019s choice between two conflicting views may not be set aside even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\u201d 299 F.2d at page 310.\u2019 N. L. R. B. v. Plaskolite, Inc., 309 F.2d 788, 789, 790 (C.A. 6, 1962).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-15\">\u201cSee also, N. L. R. B. v. Walton Mfg. Co., 369 U.S. 404, 82 S.Ct. 853, 7 L.Ed.2d 829; N. L. R. B. v. Power Equipment Co., 313 F.2d 438 (C.A. 6, 1963).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-17\">The Board found that respondent had threatened and interrogated employees and engaged in other coercive conduct. There is evidence in the record that the employees were interrogated; that five employees were told that they were going to be laid off for supporting the Union, and all employees were told that the five would be laid off unless it was agreed to \u201chold off with the national union.\u201d The employees were told that all production would close down if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>brought in a national union, and it was suggested in the alternative that they form a shop committee to represent them. The employees were polled on their willingness to defer joining the Union until the President, Jack Nelson, had a chance to talk to them. There is, therefore, substantial evidence to support the Boards\u2019 finding that respondent violated Section 8(a) (1) of the Act. United Fireworks Mfg. Co. v. N. L. R. B. (C.A. 6), 252 F.2d 428, 480; N. L. R. B. V. Ford (C.A. 6), 170 F.2d 735, 738; N. L. R. B. v. Plaskolite, Inc. (C.A. 6), 309 F.2d 788, 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Upon review of the evidence pertaining to the charge that respondent acted diseriminatively when it discharged James Gerding, suspended Gerald Meyer, laid off a number of employees and temporarily shut down its plant, we conclude that, considering the testimony as a whole and the logical inferences drawn therefrom by the Board, its finding that respondent violated Section 8 (a) (3) of the Act is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The Union wrote respondent on September 11 asking to negotiate a contract as bargaining representative of respondent\u2019s employees in an admittedly appropriate unit. Respondent thereupon ran its own election among its employees on September 13 and learned that a majority favored that organization. Respondent, nevertheless, contends that it was under no duty to recognize and bargain with the Union until certified by the Board. This same argument was made and rejected by this Court in N. L. R. B. v. Piqua Munising Wood Products Co., 109 F.2d 552, at p. 556:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">\u201cThis position is untenable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">\u201c * * * The employer acts at his peril in refusing to recognize a duly selected bargaining agency of an appropriate unit of his employees unless the facts show that in the exercise of reasonable judgment he lacked knowledge of the appropriateness of the unit or the selection of the majority representative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Also see N. L. R. B. v. Decker (C.A. 8), 296 F.2d 338, p. 341, where the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">\u201cIt is too late, in light of the declared wisdom found in the National Labor Relations Act, for an employer to drift into an eddy * * * and now make the contention that he has no duty to bargain with a particular Union until it has been certified by the Board, after an election. Under the N. L. R. B., \u2018An employer is under a duty to bargain as soon as the union representative presents convincing evidence of majority support.\u2019 N. L. R. B. v. Dahlstrom Metallic Door Co., 2 Cir., 1940, 112 F.2d 756, 757. \u2018The Act is clear in intent, and it has been too well established to require extended discussion, that election and certification proceedings are not the only method of determining majority representation * * *.\u2019 Matter of L. B. Hartz Stores, 1946, 71 N.L. R.B. 848, 871. See also I. O. B. et al. v. Los Angeles Brewing Co., Inc., et al., 9 Cir., 1950, 183 F.2d 398, 405, and cases there cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">There was also substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s finding that respondent was not motivated by \u201ca good faith doubt of this majority status but rather that Respondent acted in rejection of the collective bargaining principle and in order to gain time within which to undermine the Union\u2019s support.\u201d Under Section 9(c) (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 159(c) (1), it has been held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">\u201cThere is no absolute right vested in an employer to demand an election, Iob v. Los Angeles Brewing Co., 9 Cir., 1950, 183 F.2d 398. If an employer in good faith doubts the union\u2019s majority, he may, without violating the Act, refuse to recognize the union until its claim is established by a Board election. A doubt pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>fessed by an employer as to the union\u2019s majority claim must be genuine. Otherwise the employer has a duty to bargain and may not insist upon an election.\u201d National Labor Relations Bd. v. Trimfit of California (C.A. 9, 1954), 211 F.2d 206, 209.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">We therefore conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that respondent violated Section 8(a) (5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (5), in refusing to bargain collectively with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
