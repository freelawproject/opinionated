United States of America, appellee, dismissing the appeal in that case pursuant to the letter-request of the appellant acting <em>pro se. </em>At the time the case was submitted the appeal of Kittrell was still pending in the Fifth Circuit. In view of the fact that the decision of the court below was based, at least in part, upon this operative fact, which no longer exists, it seems desirable to vacate the judgment and remand in order that the court below may consider the case further. Accordingly an order will be entered to that effect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
