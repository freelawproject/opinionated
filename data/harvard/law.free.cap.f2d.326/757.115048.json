His contention was that the appellee failed to use diligence in developing the tract and in protecting it from drainage by procuring an order from the Commissioner of Conservation of the State of Louisiana creating a single reservoir-wide unit for the Broussard Oil Sand in the Erath Field, of which the 20.28 acres was a part. The suit was necessarily a collateral attack on the order of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The trial court granted the appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment for the reasons set out in his well considered opinion in Savoy v. Tidewater Oil Co., D. C., W.D., La., 218 F.Supp. 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">We are of the opinion that the judgment of the trial court is correct, and it is therefore Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
