Pursuant to the conspiracy, three Amalgamated organizers are alleged to have been hired by one LaVictor, manager of the Muncie store, to assist in the organization. Without having the benefit of testimony of Ungar or LaVictor, the Board held that it was unnecessary to determine whether or not such a conspiracy did in fact exist because there was no proof that La-Victor hired the organizers in furtherance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-18\">The proof does show, however, that the acts alleged to have been agreed upon in the conspiracy did occur. The three organizers of Amalgamated did appear, they were hired by LaVictor, they did organize the Miracle Mart, and a contract was signed by Miracle Mart and Amalgamated.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-19\">We think that if the conspiracy between management and Amalgamated to organize the Muncie store existed, further proof of its effectiveness is not required to establish violations of Sections 8(a) (1), (2), and (3), and 8(b) (1) (A). Such a conspiracy would inevitably, in some degree at least, \u201cinterfere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7,\u201d and \u201cinterfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (2). See also 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">We remand the case to the Board for the taking of the testimony of Ungar and LaVictor, together with any other testimony which may assist the Board in determining whether or not a conspiracy to violate the sections of the Act in suit did in fact exist. If the Board finds that such a conspiracy did exist, it will provide appropriate remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-10\">.
