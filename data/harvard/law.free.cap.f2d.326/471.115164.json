In addition the company had certain implementing rules regarding work stoppages, Rules 5 and 13, hereinafter referred to. On September 13, 1961 Raytheon indefinitely suspended, and on September 19 discharged, allegedly for violation of these provisions, the charging parties, Jane Reikard and Mary Fish, two employees assigned to the grid department at its Quincy, Massachusetts plant. Reikard until a year before had been chief steward for the union and both she and Fish had had lengthy employment. For \u201ca long time\u201d the grid department, which contained furnaces, had been displeasingly hot to the employees, who had several times asked that something be done. The matter had not, however, reached the stage of a formal grievance. On September 6 the department employees had unanimously signed an informal petition asking that the situation be remedied. Reikard had drafted the petition, had been the first to sign, and had delivered it to the secretary of Wills, the plant manager. Her testimony that she had been requested by another employee to do the drafting,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that she had obtained \u201cfour or five\u201d signatures, but had not been responsible for its circulation, was not contradicted. On September 12 the grid department was particularly hot. No reply had been made to the petition. Employee activity, hereinafter considered, took place on that-morning which led to the two suspensions and discharges. Its nature, and whether it was not the cause is the primary issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Reikard and Fish after suspension invoked the grievance procedures, and also filed unfair labor charges. The initial grievance procedures were unproductive and they requested arbitration. On October 12 they were notified by the union business manager by telephone that the hearing would take place on October 16. Reikard did not state whether or not she would attend. Fish said that she would call back shortly as to her intentions, but when she did not, both grievants were notified by telegram, apparently on the morning of the 16th, that the hearing was postponed to October 18. Later, on the 16th, Reikard wired the business manager that she was \u201cunable to attend [on October 18] because of poor health. Mary [Fish] still in Maine * * * will advise you when I am able to go to arbitration.\u201d The manager wired in reply on the 17th that the hearing was postponed to October 19, and that the parties were expected to appear. The grievants did not attend, request further postponement, or offer any additional explanation for their absence. Experienced union counsel represented their interests and introduced evidence, including their own statements denying improper involvement. The arbitrator\u2019s subsequent report concluded, \u201c[T]he evidence here is clear and convincing that the grievants instigated and led a walkout happily thwarted by the Chief Steward. For this gross breach of the Agreement, management may discipline and disciplinary penalty of discharge for the leaders was not improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The first question presented to the \u2022 trial examiner, and thereafter to the Board was the effect to be given to the arbitrator\u2019s award. The examiner stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that \u201cthe issue of violation of a Federal statute\u201d was not before the arbitrator, and that his other findings were not \"\u201cdispositive\u201d because the Board\u2019s jurisdiction was exclusive. By \u201cdispositive\u201d he meant, as will hereafter appear, entitled to any weight. On this issue the Board (by 3-2 majority) affirmed. As its primary reason it agreed that the arbitration proceeding did not go into the question of the company\u2019s motive, viz., whether the assigned cause was a \u201cpretext to mask the true reason.\u201d In the light of certain statements made by counsel at the hearing it is debatable whether the arbitrator did go into the company\u2019s motive, and we could not call the Board plainly wrong. It does not follow that the Board should not have accepted the arbitrator\u2019s findings on the issue con-cededly litigated. The Board did not reach this question because it found the Rearing unfair in that on a request for a general continuance the arbitrator had \u25a0granted only one day.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Passing the fact that there had been not one, but two, continuances, we note at the outset that it was not the company, but the grievants\u2019 own representative, the union, that insisted there be no \u25a0further continuance. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the union was processing the arbitration halfheartedly. The only reasonable conclusion as to Fish was that she absented her\u2022self voluntarily. Reikard\u2019s showing is little better. Seemingly her indefinitely \u2022disabling \u201cpoor health\u201d developed very \u25a0suddenly. We might doubt, like the minority Board members, if the indisposition was physical. In any event, we \u2022cannot think the Board would have expected us to rule it unfair if a trial examiner, rather than an arbitrator, had refused to grant a further continuance on this record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See, e. g., N. L. R. B. v. Somerville Buick, Inc., 1 Cir., 1952,194 F.2d 56; N. L. R. B. v. Algoma Plywood &amp; Veneer Co., 7 Cir., 1941, 121 F.2d 602. The Board\u2019s only cited case of Gateway Transp. Co., 1962, 137 N.L.R.B. 1763, is so different as not to warrant discussion. In view of the importance the Supreme Court lays upon the value of arbitration proceedings in effectuating the national labor policy we have strong doubts whether the Board should have rejected the arbitrator\u2019s finding that Reikard and Fish violated Article XXIII and company rules 5 and 13. However, we do not need to reach this question because the Board\u2019s decision on the merits must fall for lack of evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">There are no findings of the Board, as such, to review, as the Board affirmed the intermediate report without modification. The trial examiner\u2019s principal summary findings were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">1. \u201c[Bjeyond doubt * * * there was no actual \u2018walkout\u2019 by any employees * * * nor * * * any work stoppage except that which, it is uncontradicted, was implicitly permitted, by Foreman Carbury when he told Chief Steward Shea that he could talk to the employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-13\">2. There is no \u201ccredible evidence in the record\u201d that Reikard and/or Fish \u201c \u2018incited\u2019 employees to engage in what as a fact did not occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-14\">3. Raytheon did not \u201coffer any credible evidence tending to show that * * * [Hare] the management official invoking [suspension] * * * had * * * any reasonable ground to believe that Reikard and Fish had incited conduct which did not occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">(1) Whether there was a \u201cwalk-out\u201d or not may depend upon how the term is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>to be interpreted. However, merely on the Board\u2019s evidence unaugmented by the company\u2019s, there was on the morning of September 12 an extended disturbance in the grid department. Although it is disputed who were the moving parties, admittedly a substantial number of the employees gathered in the ladies room, and around each other\u2019s benches, openly discussing a walkout to which a number were fully agreeable; there was one fracas, and five attempts were made by employees to persuade the union\u2019s chief steward, Shea, to come to the area, not all of which were for pacific purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shea testified that when finally he did come he obtained the foreman\u2019s assent to speak to <em>\u201ca, few </em>of his people outside the department.\u201d (Ital. supplied, see infra, fn. 11) \u201cBy the time we arrived * * * [there] a fairly Ihrge group of people had gathered, by guess, maybe 12 or 15, although people were leaving and coming * * As Reikard herself put it, \u201cThere were about, like I said, 16 or 17 at the time, although before- he [Shea] was done talking, at sometime or another it seemed that the whole department [some 40 women and 15 men] had been there, just about the whole department.\u201d Although it is true that when Shea told the employees that management had plans under way to alleviate the heat they returned to work, the initial, uninvited,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> outpouring of nearly all to see him illuminates the other Board testimony of the nature of the insurgent unrest. Though there was no \u201cwalkout\u201d in the sense of packing up and going home, only a highly indulgent finder of fact could conclude that there had been no \u201cInterfering with, obstructing or otherwise hindering production or work performance,\u201d (Rule 5) or \u201c * * * wasting time * * * during working hours,\u201d (Rule 13) prior to Shea\u2019s arrival. The examiner\u2019s prefacing his finding with the words \u201cbeyond doubt,\u201d suggests that he-did not recognize that he was even generous.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">(2) The second finding, that there was no \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that Reikard and Fish incited conduct which \u201cas a fact did not occur\u201d calls for two observations. In the first place, the issue was whether they had attempted to-incite conduct in breach of company rules,, not whether it occurred. But more important, while we are inclined to believe that the examiner\u2019s phrase \u201cno credible-evidence in the record\u201d meant no evidence of a credible nature and not that he did not choose to credit it, in whatever sense he used the word it was incumbent upon him to examine the evidence before so characterizing it. N. L. R. B. v. Croscill Curtain Co., 4 Cir., 1961, 297 F.2d 294. This he failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">The record contains the testimony of three witnesses called by respondent who testified either that Reikard and Fish asked them to join in a walkout that morning, or that they heard them invite others, and one who testified that Fish told her about the walkout and that she thought Fish had asked her to go along. None modified their testimony on cross-examination, although the first, Coleman, who had sought to do battle with Reikard that morning,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was rather excitable. The examiner disposed of Coleman on the ground of \u201cbias and unreliability,\u201d and said that it was \u201cunnecessary here to appraise in detail\u201d (by which it is apparent he meant \u201cappraise at all\u201d) the testimony of the others because their testimony on the stand was contrary to what they had told management prior to the dismissal of Reikard and Fish and \u201cobviously could not have mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>tivated the action.\u201d While admittedly what the company learned after the discharge had no bearing upon its belief at the significant moment of the discharge, the examiner made a specific finding, quite apparently for the purpose of suggesting that the company had no reason to believe Reikard and Fish had incited a walkout, that they had not in fact done so. Then, when faced with appraising the testimony of the witnesses who contradicted that finding, he said he had no duty to do so because they did not tell the company until too late. If the examiner had chosen to say that it was not necessary to decide whether Reikard and Fish were in fact guilty of urging the violation of company rules, that would have been one thing, but, instead, he played it both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">(3) In stating that there was no \u25a0credible evidence tending to show that the company reasonably believed that Reikard and Fish had been guilty the examiner, again, misstated the issue. The question, of course, was what the employer believed and not whether that belief was reasonable. As we said in N. L. R. B. v. Standard Coil Products Co., 1 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 465, 470, 51 A.L.R.2d 1268, cert. den. 350 U.S. 902, 76 S.Ct. 180, 100 L.Ed. 792, \u201cIt is well accepted law that an employer may discharge an employee for any reason, reasonable or unreasonable, so long as it is not a reason prohibited by the Act.\u201d See also N. L. R. B. v. Whitin Machine Works, 1 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 883.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The company did offer evidence that it believed Reikard and Fish to have been instigators of a walkout. This came from Hare, the official who determined their suspension. He testified that his belief was based on information coming from employees Coleman and Millet. As already mentioned, the examiner thought Coleman an \u201cunreliable\u201d witness. He felt that because the company failed to call Millet to testify at the unfair labor practice hearing,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this indicated that he was unreliable, too. The question, of course, was not whether the examiner felt Coleman and Millet were unworthy witnesses, but whether Hare was telling the truth when he said he believed them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Then, to add weight to his finding that the company had offered no credible evidence of reasonable grounds to believe Reikard and Fish incited misconduct, the examiner referred to his finding, improperly, as we have said, arrived at, that it had not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">We find this an unsatisfactory way to meet the Board\u2019s burden of proof. But even if we could say it was sufficient to dispose of the company\u2019s asserted reason for the discharge, the Board must not only do this, it must affirmatively find an improper reason. This finding was made in the following paragraph.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-12\">\u201cIn conclusion, the Trial Examiner is convinced and finds that the minor incident of September 12, permitted by Foreman Carbury and not interfered with by General Foreman Cram, was seized upon by management as a pretext for ridding itself of the two leaders of the move which resulted in the unanimous petition of grid department employees; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>and particularly of Jane Reikard, whom Hare admitted he might have characterized to a Board agent as \u2018a thorn in the side of the company,\u2019 while acting as chief steward for the Union. The preparation and circulation of the petition was [sic] plainly protected activities, and Reikard\u2019s long service as chief stew- \u2022 ard constituted union activities. The termination of their employment for engaging in concerted and union activities was discriminatory, and violative of Section 8(a) (1) and (3) of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">We find no adequate support for this paragraph. We have already dealt with the extent that the September 12 disturbance was \u201cminor\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and \u201cpermitted\u201d by foreman Carbury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The statement that it was \u201cnot interfered with\u201d by Cram involved a clear misunderstanding of the testimony. Even on Shea\u2019s testimony Cram interfered promptly. The most fundamental error, however, was the finding that the company discharged Reikard and Fish as the \u201ctwo leaders * * * in the unanimous petition\u201d of September 6. Even assuming that the company official, Hare, who made the discharge knew of the petition at that time,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> there was no affirmative evidence that anyone in the company knew Reikard\u2019s connection with it beyond the fact that she had been the first to sign and the one who had made the physical delivery. But if the Board\u2019s burden of' pi-oof could be satisfied by inference,, there was not even this with respect to-Fish. The record contains no indication that Fish was a \u201cleader\u201d in this in any respect, or that the company thought she-was, or could have thought so. If the-company did not discharge Fish for the-reason it said it did, then on the record, before the examiner it had no reason. The finding that the company discharged' Fish as a \u201cleader\u201d on September 6, as distinguished from September 12, was. like the familiar example of the thirteenth stroke of a clock, not only unwarranted in itself, but infecting what went before.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Finally, the examiner totally misused' Hare\u2019s possible characterization of Reikard, which he admitted he might have-made, describing her (again, not including Fish) as a \u201cthorn in the side of the-company.\u201d The examiner stated that, this was while she was \u201cacting as chief steward for the Union.\u201d However, the-evidence warranted only a finding that the characterization was made long after,., and in one specific connection only, namely, with reference to the events of September 12. If Hare had made the remark, but as of some other date, the-Board should have offered its witness to prove it. The incongruity of the finding that Reikard did nothing on September 12, and that the company found her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>a thorn in its side on September 12, was lost to view by this complete misstatement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">A decree will be entered setting aside the order of the Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\">. Apparently in order to show this was protected activity the trial examiner found that Reikard drafted the petition at the request of the room steward, which was not the evidence. We are, however, for the purpose of this decision, assuming the petition to be protected activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\">. The Board, unlike the examiner, did not hold that because the Board\u2019s jurisdiction was exclusive the arbitrator\u2019s findings were to be disregarded, but was apparently content, as we are, with its decision in Spielberg Manufacturing Co., 1955, 112 N.L.R.B. 1080, that normally such findings should be accepted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-17\">. We might also observe that the trial examiner dicl not reject the arbitrator\u2019s decision by finding unfairness, or, for all that appears, take any testimony on the subject. Accordingly, the Board has ruled the arbitration proceeding unfair without ascertaining whether in fact the grievants had been unable to attend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b556-5\">. Some employees expressed a -willingness to walk out, but only if the chief steward were to be present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b556-6\">. On the Board\u2019s evidence it was uninvited. On the company\u2019s the employees were gestured out by Reikard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\">. On both the Board\u2019s and the company\u2019s evidence, Coleman had told her supervisor, Loud, that the employees were planning a walkout. Reikard testified to having charged Coleman with lying, which, on this record, was obviously unjustified. The causes of Coleman\u2019s resentment were more complicated, and need not be gone into.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\">. We need not consider to what extent the general principle of good faith mistake may not exonerate the employer if the employee is in fact engaged in a protected activity, cf. Gusano v. N.L.R.B., 3 Cir., 1951, 190 F.2d 898; N.L.R.B. v. Industrial Cotton Mills, 4 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 87, 45 A.L.It.2d 880, cert. den. 347 U.S. 935, 74 S.Ct. 630, 98 L.Ed. 1086; N.L.R..B. v Burnup &amp; Sims, Inc., 5 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 57, because whatever the events on September 12, they did not fall into this exception; nor has that been suggested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b557-13\">. Millet did testify before tbe arbitrator and a transcript o'f those proceedings was in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b557-14\">. If the examiner wanted to find that Coleman and Blillet did not in fact tell Hare what Hare said they did, this was another matter. It seems clear, however, that wliat he did was to decide the issue he put, namely, that Hare lacked \u201creasonable\u201d ground to believe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\">. To put the shoe on the other foot, there \u2022 is no suggestion in the record that the company considered the September 6 petition as other than minor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b558-8\">. Shea not only testified that he had asked, and received, permission to talk to \u201ca few\u201d of the emiDloyees, but expressly denied that he had asked to speak to the \u201centire department.\u201d Although the examiner noted the difference at one point, later, when he came to draw certain inferences against the company he substituted \u201cthe employees\u201d for \u201ca few employees,\u201d as the basis thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\">. Singularly enough, although Hare was called as a Board witness for cross-examination, he was asked only whether, and not when, the petition came to- his-attention, a sizable gap.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b558-13\">. We deduce that the company\u2019s real offense against Fish in the examiner\u2019s mind.was suspending her without an opportunity to be heard, which the examiner-considered \u201crepugnant both to the fundamentals of law and to ethical practices^ of a reasonable employer.\u201d Under the-grievance procedures Fish could (and did) have ample opportunity to be heard, as-the company told her at the time. It was not for the examiner to pass moral judgments, and most certainly not this one. We need hardly say that his view of the-law was equally mistaken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b559-15\">. Elsewhere in Ms findings the examiner commented upon Hare\u2019s further \u201cadmission\u201d that he had on other occasions found Reikard (again, not Fish) \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cunreasonable.\u201d We will assume this to have been \u201cwhile acting as chief steward.\u201d But although we should be reluctant to charge the Board with naivet\u00e9 in its own special field, we do not consider \u201caggressive\u201d a dirty word, or, more important, that unreasonableness is of uncommon occurrence or unexpected (from both sides) in labor relations. Indeed, we gather that the real dirty word is \u201csweetheart.\u201d Nor did the examiner find that this \u201cadmission\u201d was the reason for the discharge. Since Reikard was no longer chief steward her behavior a year before would have been a peculiarly unlikely reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
