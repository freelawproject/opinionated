This appeal presents only the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction. It is contended that there is no substantial evidence to establish that the property found in the possession of the defendants was that which was stolen from an interstate shipment or that defendants committed the larceny. We have examined the record, and conclude that as to these contentions, the circumstances are such as to present a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-27\">The commission of a crime may be established by circumstantial evidence.

United States, 10 Cir., 183 F.2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-28\">The case was submitted to the jury on the evidence of the prosecution. This evidence disclosed that on the 15th day of October, 1962, a truck owned by Consolidated Freightways, a common carrier, containing interstate shipments of property, was stolen after it had been parked on a street in Denver, Colorado. It was found later on a country road some distance northeast of Denver, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>all of its cargo missing. On the truck, with other interstate shipments, was one by Harker China Company, from West Virginia, consigned to Riverton, Wyoming.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2This shipment consisted of 16 master cartons of china, each containing 12 smaller cartons. The trade-name on this product prior to August 25, 1962, was \u201cStone China.\u201d After that date the manufacturer made dishes upon which the trade-name \u201cStone Ware\u201d was used. At the time the shipment was made to Riverton, Wyoming, orders were filled from dishes some of which had the trade-name \u201cStone China\u201d and some \u201cStone Ware.\u201d On October 16, 1962, the defendant Vigil offered to sell a set of Harker dishes to a cook at the El Palomar Bar in Denver, Colorado. The next day, with the defendant Real, Vigil sold one set of Harker china to the cook, and another set to a friend, Martinez. Later another set of such china was delivered to the owner of the El Palomar Bar. All of this china was a Harker Company product, some of which bore the trade name \u201cStone China\u201d and some \u201cStone Ware.\u201d It was identified by the President of the Harker Company as the identical kind of china shipped from Chester, West Virginia to Riverton, Wyoming.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Riverton shipment was not delivered, and it was necessary for the Harker Company to fill the order with another shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">On the 17th of October, two men rented a double garage in northeast Denver. On the 18th of October, Vigil and Real requested Martinez to drive his pickup truck to Vigil\u2019s home, where it was loaded with cartons from a garage there. Martinez testified that Vigil told him that \u201chis mom was mad at him\u201d and he wanted to get that stuff out of the garage. Some of the cartons taken from the garage bore the insignia or trademark of General Electric products. These cartons were described as being three feet wide and four feet high, and possibly four feet long.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 4567After the truck was loaded, the cartons were covered with a black plastic material which concealed them from view. During the process of moving this property, Real remarked to Martinez that \u201cthey\u2019d made a haul and hoped they didn\u2019t get busted.\u201d Later, at the El Palomar Bar, Martinez was given a set of Harker dishes taken from the-trunk of an automobile used by Vigil and Real, for the use of his truck. On the 19th day of October, agents of the-F.B.I. located a quantity of material of the same kind as that which was in the truck when it was stolen, in a ravine-several miles from where the empty Consolidated Freightways truck was found. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Most of this material was in a burned condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The foregoing circumstances, together with the surreptitious manner in which Vigil and Real, who were not merchandisers, handled and disposed of the goods, lead to only one rational conclusion, that is, the property was that which had been stolen from the Consolidated Freightways truck. Their unexplained possession was sufficient to sustain a finding that the defendants participated in the theft. There is nothing in Sapir v. United States, 10 Cir., 216 F.2d 722, aff\u2019d as modified 348 U.S. 373, 75 S.Ct. 422, 99 L.Ed. 426; or Karn v. United States, 11 Alaska 225, 158 F.2d 568, to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-4\">.
