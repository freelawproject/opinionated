Gen., of counsel, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b485-4\">Before HASTINGS, Chief Judge, and KILEY and SWYGERT, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Petitioner\u2019s appeal from an adverse ruling in a habeas corpus proceeding raises the question: whether the district court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing on the allegation that his constitutional rights were violated in that a coerced confession was used in his conviction; his \u201cilliterate\u201d and unsound mind resulted in inability to understand the nature of the charge against him; and he was represented by incompetent counsel. We think the answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Petitioner pled guilty to murder in October, 1948, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In a post-conviction proceeding before the sentencing judge in 1955, issues of fact upon the same questions now raised were decided adversely to petitioner. Writ of error was denied him by the Illinois Supreme Court. Certiorari was denied him by the1 United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">We have read the entire record which includes the Illinois Supreme Court opinion, and the transcript of proceedings at the post-conviction hearing which includes the judgment of conviction and excerpts from testimony. Ten witnesses, including the attorneys at the original trial, testified at the post-conviction hearing. Petitioner was represented by counsel. The court was careful to direct counsel to examine petitioner with respect to his various claims. It heard a play-back of the record of petitioner\u2019s confession on a \u201cSound scriber.\u201d The record of petitioner\u2019s arraignment was introduced showing that he was advised of the consequences of his plea and the trial court\u2019s finding that he \u201cunderstands and comprehends\u201d the nature of the charge against him; and there was introduced the transcript of his testimony subsequently in a separate mitigation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">We see no merit in the contention that petitioner did not receive a \u201cfull and fair\u201d hearing upon the points made in this petition for habeas corpus, or that these issues were not \u201cactually reached and decided,\u201d as required by Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 313-314, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">We find no basis for petitioner\u2019s claim that the record shows that he received inadequate representation at his trial, thus requiring the district court\u2019s hearing evidence .on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">We appointed Attorney Ronald M. Glink, a member of the bar of Illinois, to represent petitioner. Mr. Glink\u2019s service was in the highest tradition of the American bar. We commend him on his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-23\">. Clayborn v.
