For many years, Marvin Pixton was an officer and director of the Ingalls Iron Works Company of Alabama. After his death, May 14, 1957, Ingalls paid Mrs. Pixton $22,-500 under a resolution of the board of directors authorizing the payment \u201cin recognition of the long, devoted and faithful service of Mr. Pixton\u201d.- The widow was never connected with the company as an employee, director, or shareholder. The payment carried no understanding that Mrs. Pixton perform any service for the company. The widow did not solicit the payment. <em>Ingalls has no past history of such payments upon the death of an employee, officer, or director. </em>In its treatment of the expenditure, In-galls did not retain the withholding tax, but deducted the amount paid as a salary expense. Its right to the deduction is now in litigation. Perhaps for this reason, Robert Ingalls, president of the company, wrote the taxpayer, \u201cDear Mabel: I regret I am not in a position to say that the six month\u2019s salary * * * was a gift\u201d. Contrary to the stipulation that Ingalls had \u201cno past history\u201d of salary continuation payments, Ingalls wrote the District Director of the Internal Revenue Service, \u201cIt has been the policy of the company to pay to the wife or estate of a deceased top executive approximately one-half year\u2019s salary upon such executive\u2019s death\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">On these agreed facts, the district court found that the payment to Mabel Pixton \u201cwas a benevolent act and was intended to be and was made as an expression of sympathy, generosity and kindness to the widow of a deceased officer, director and employee\u201d. The court held that the payment \u201cproceeded from a detached disinterested generosity growing out of affection, respect, kindness, sym<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>pathy or like impulses\u201d. This is the language of Duberstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Commissioner v. Duberstein, 1960, 363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed. 1218, is the latest and leading Supreme Court decision on both the definition of a gift in a \u201cgift v. income\u201d case and the scope of appellate review of a trial court\u2019s application of that definition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Duberstein the Supreme Court restated the principles established in Bogardus v. Commissioner, 1937, 302 U.S. 34, 58 S.Ct. 61, 82 L.Ed. 32, and emphasized that in order for a transfer to qualify as a gift, the transfer must not be motivated by a legal or moral obligation. It must not be a payment for services, past or future, and there must be no expectancy of future gain. Rather, \u201cthe dominant reason that explains [the transferor\u2019s] action in making the transfer\u201d a gift must be a \u201c \u2018detached and disinterested generosity,\u2019 * * * \u2018out of affection, respect, admiration, charity or like impulses\u2019 \u201d. 363 U.S. at 285, 80 S.Ct. at 1197, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Both Bogardus and Duberstein require the clearly erroneous rule as the standard of review. Bogardus, however, focused on the transferor\u2019s intention as the controlling criterion. Duberstein focused on the reasons for the transfer, as the trier of fact weighs the reasons\u2014 somewhat metaphysically. According to Duberstein, the decision \u201cmust be based ultimately on the application of the fact-finding tribunal\u2019s experience with the mainsprings of human conduct to the totality of the facts of each case.\u201d 363 U.S. 289, 80 S.Ct. 1198, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218. We read this gestalt criterion as establishing a more limited standard of review that the Court laid down in Bogardus. In the gift v. income arena, therefore, we are steeled to untidy results. See Smith v. Commissioner, 3 Cir. 1962, 305 F.2d 778, cert, den\u2019d, 1962, 371 U.S. 904, 83 S.Ct. 208, 9 L.Ed.2d 165; Martin v. Commissioner, 3 Cir. 1962, 305 F.2d 290, cert, den\u2019d, 1962, 371 U.S. 904, 83 S.Ct. 209, 9 L.Ed.2d 165; Gaugler v. United States, 2 Cir. 1963, 312 F.2d 681; Poyner v.

Frankel, 8 Cir. 1962, 302 F.2d 666, cert, den\u2019d, 1962, 371 U.S. 903, 83 S.Ct. 208, 9 L.Ed. 2d 165; Olsen\u2019s Estate v.

Commissioner, 6 Cir. 1962, 300 F.2d 849, cert, den\u2019d, 1962, 371 U.S. 903, 83 S.Ct. 208, 9 L.Ed. 2d 165; Estate of Cronheim v. Commissioner, 8 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 706. Even with the special dispensation Galena Oaks grants when the basic facts are undisputed, the reviewing court is still bound by the clearly erroneous rule. Galena Oaks Corporation v. Scofield, 5 Cir. 1954, 218 F.2d 217, 219.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">The trial judge, drawing on his \u201cexperience with the mainsprings of human conduct\u201d, found that the payment to Mrs. Pixton was an act of benevolence. Had this Court been the trial court, we might have reached the opposite result. But, drawing on our \u201cexperience with the mainsprings of human conduct\u201d, we cannot say that the trial judge was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-13\">.
