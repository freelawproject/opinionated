Such an obligation, however, is normally implied as part of an employer\u2019s general duties under the act, cf. Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 58, and an employer cannot refuse unless there has been a \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d waiver by the union. Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. N. L. R. B., 6 Cir., 1963, 325 F.2d 746; N. L. R. B. v. Item Co., 5 Cir., 220 F.2d 956, 958-59, cert. den. 350 U.S. 836, 76 S.Ct. 73, 100 L.Ed. 746; Tide Water Associated Oil Co., 1949, 85 N.L.R.B. 1096, 1098. In finding that the omission of the previous affirmative clause from the present agreement following negotiations during which respondent said it would not grant such rights was not such a waiver, the Board erroneously referred to statements (in our opinion ambiguous, at best) made by the union after the agreement had been entered into, and hence entirely immaterial. Nevertheless, we cannot say the Board\u2019s decision was without substantial support. Where a provision would normally be implied in an agreement by operation of the act itself (but cf. Speidel Corp., 1958, 120 N.L.R.B. 733, when it is not), we think a waiver should be express, and that a mere inference, no matter how strong, should be insufficient. Cf. Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. N. L. R. B., supra. It is not necessary, to support the Board, for us to follow the case it now cites of N. L. R. B. v. Gulf Atlantic Warehouse Co., 5 Cir., 1961, 291 F.2d 475. We could not agree with the seeming suggestion in that opinion that the parol evidence rule required the waiver to be contained within the four corners of the written agreement. Cf. Rodriguez v. Secretary of the Treasury of Puerto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Rico, 1 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 344, 349. Nor has this been the Board\u2019s position. Speidel Corp., supra; Berkshire Corp., 1959, 123 N.L.R.B. 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
