Neumann &amp; Co. appeals from a decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board which dismissed appellant\u2019s; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>opposition<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to application<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by Bon-Ton Auto Upholstery, Inc., appellee, for registration of the term \u201cVYNAHYDE\u201d as a trademark for plastic film and plastic film made into furniture slip covers. Use since August 30, 1955 was alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Appellant alleged in its notice of opposition that \u201chide\u201d is the common descriptive name for the whole pelt from a large animal, such as a cow or horse; that the term \u201chyde\u201d is the phonetic equivalent of \u201chide\u201d and that said term as applied to appellee\u2019s goods is deceptive and deceptively misdescriptive under Section 2(a) and Section 2(e) (1) of the Trademark Act of 1946. Appellant produces leather by tanning the hides of various animals. It is the successor to a family business which commenced the production of leather and luggage prior to 1870. The leather produced is sold in substantial quantities to manufacturers of various kinds of- leather products throughout the United States and in various foreign countries. For the past five years, appellant has produced annually between six and seven million square feet of leather.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Appellee\u2019s business consists primarily of making to order automobile seat covers, tops for convertible automobiles, and furniture slip covers. Its products usually are made of plastic film, but leather is sometimes used; and its slip covers are used to cover a variety of upholstery, including leather.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Appellee admits in its answer that \u201cHYDE\u201d is the phonetic equivalent of \u201cHIDE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Appellant\u2019s record consists of the discovery deposition of appellee\u2019s president duly filed and a stipulation of facts. Appellee took no testimony, but filed a stipulation identifying certain exhibits annexed thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">The issues here presented are similar to those with which we have dealt in R. Neumann &amp; Co. v. Overseas Shipments, Inc. (Patent Appeal No. 7171, Cust. &amp; Pat.App., 326 F.2d 786.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">In dismissing the opposition, the board held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-13\">\u201cThe question to be resolved herein is whether the mark sought to be registered is either deceptive or deceptively misdescriptive as applied to applicant\u2019s non-leather goods and, if so, whether its registration with all the presumptions flowing therefrom would be inconsistent with an equal right of op-poser and its customers to continue to use the descriptive term \u2018hide\u2019 in connection with the sale of leather and leather goods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-14\">\u201cWhile the term \u2018HYDE\u2019 is admittedly the equivalent of \u2018hide,\u2019 there is no evidence of record that purchasers of applicant\u2019s vinyl plastic film and vinyl plastic furniture slip covers would regard the term as meaning only the hide of an animal. The term \u2018hide\u2019 also means \u2018to cover,\u2019 and it is believed that, as applied to applicant\u2019s goods, it would more than likely suggest a cover. But aside from this consideration, and assuming arguendo that \u2018HYDE\u2019 is misdescriptive of applicant\u2019s goods, the registration of \u2018VYNAHYDE\u2019 could not involve injury to opposer in that it could not possibly be employed to preclude op-poser or anyone else from using the term \u2018hide\u2019 in its primary sense to describe leather products.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">We have here a factual situation where appellee seeks to adopt the term \u201chyde,\u201d admittedly the phonetic equivalent of the leather term \u201chide,\u201d as a distinct component of a trademark for a nonleather film<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which can be made to simulate leather.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">With an almost limitless source, as broad as language itself, from which to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>choose an appropriate mark, one verges on the suspect in selecting a trademark that is misleading, either in meaning or by implication or that places him in a position to impinge upon the rights of others. As this court said in Planters Nut &amp; Chocolate Co. v. Crown Nut Co., Inc., 305 F.2d 916, 50 CCPA 1120:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-5\">\u201c * * * Where he does so he is open to the suspicion that his purpose is to appropriate to himself some of the good will of his competitor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">We find it difficult to escape the conclusion that denominating a product as something which it is not is deceptive and deceptively misdeseriptive. It requires no exercise in semantics to conclude that in the broad area of leather goods manufacture and marketing, the public mind has always accepted and understood leather to be \u201chide\u201d and \u201chide\u201d to be leather. The adoption of the phonetic equivalent \u201chyde\u201d does not mitigate this situation. It is most difficult to divine any purpose other than to trade on the good will of leather where the manufacturer or dispenser of non-leather products appropriates this phonetic equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">In Patent Appeal No. 7171, herein-above referred to, we had occasion to observe that the Federal Trade Commission, in dealing with \u201cdeceptive acts or practices in commerce,\u201d has repeatedly condemned trademarks which include the term \u201chide\u201d or \u201chyde\u201d for nonleather products. The substance of the observations which we there made is relevant in large measure here.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">We find here, as in appeal No. 7171, that appellee refers to its product as \u201cgenuine virgin Vynahyde\u201d and \u201cgenuine Vynahyde.\u201d We think that what we said in No. 7171 bears equal relevancy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">We are unable to reconcile our view with that expressed by the board to the effect that inasmuch as there is no evidence of record that purchasers of appellee\u2019s products would regard the phonetic equivalent of \u201chide\u201d as meaning only the hide of an animal and that since the term \u201chide\u201d also means \u201cto cover\u201d so that when applied to appellee\u2019s goods \u201cit would more than likely suggest a cover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">It may well be that one might studiously ferret out other definitions for \u201chide.\u201d The dominant fact remains, however, that the term in common acceptation of the public and trade means the skin of an animal. If there be no evidence of record that purchasers would regard the term \u201chyde\u201d as meaning the hide of an animal, we fail to find evidence of record to support the conclusion, or even an inference, \u201cthat it would more than likely suggest a cover.\u201d The inference that a transparent plastic would \u201ccover\u201d or \u201chide\u201d anything would seem rather finely drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">The remainder of the issues here posed was, we believe, adequately treated in our discussion of the issues in appeal No. 7171.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">For the applicable reasons there assigned and those stated herein, we hold that the registration of \u201cVYNAHYDE\u201d as a trademark for plastic film and plastic film made into furniture slip covers is prohibited by Sections 2(a) and 2(e) (1) of the Trademark Act of 1946 and that such registration would damage appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is accordingly reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-16\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-9\">.

Accordingly, I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
