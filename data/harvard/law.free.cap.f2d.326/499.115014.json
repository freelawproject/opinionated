Atty., Omaha, Neb., were with him on the brief.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b582-4\">Before VAN OOSTERHOUT, MATTHES and MEHAFFY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b582-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b582-6\"> Plaintiff (appellant) filed this .suit in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-2680, to recover damages for personal injuries received when he was bitten by a bear while a visitor in Yellowstone National Park in the State \u25a0of Wyoming. From an adverse judgment plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The facts are relatively simple and mainly undisputed. They are exhaustively and accurately detailed in the trial \u25a0court\u2019s (Judge Van Pelt) memorandum \u2022opinion which embodies his findings of fact and conclusions of law. Ashley v. United States, D.C., 215 F.Supp. 39 \u25a0(1963). Here, it will suffice to say that .\u25a0appellant was sleeping on the front seat \u25a0of his automobile to the right of his wife (driver), and had his right arm resting \u25a0on the sill of the open window when <em>&amp; </em>bear bit the elbow of his right arm, causing him to sustain serious and permanent injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Numerous issues were presented to .and resolved by the trial court. In summary, the trial court found: (1) Under the facts involved, the doctrine which Folds one who owns, keeps, or harbors inFerently dangerous animals absolutely liable for such damage and injury as they may cause is inapplicable; (2) The applicable standard in determining the degree of care which the Government owed .appellant is that which is owed to an invitee under Wyoming law; (3) Under .such law, the Government owed appellant the duty to use ordinary and reasonable \u25a0care to keep the park reasonably safe for Fis visit and to warn him of any hidden \u25a0danger; (4) Appellant\u2019s injury was not proximately attributable to a failure of .the Government to exercise ordinary care, i.e. \u2014 failure to warn appellant to keep his automobile windows closed alone, or combined with failure to remove or kill the bear thought to be the one that bit appellant was not the proximate cause of appellant\u2019s injury; (5) Handling of a troublesome bear, which had not shown an inclination to harm people without first having been provoked, involves the exercise of discretion on the part of Government employees, and such discretion \u2014 even if abused\u2014 \u201cand the court does not believe that it was in the instant case,\u201d cannot be made the basis of a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2680 (a). Since the court found no actionable negligence on the part of the Government, the issues of contributory negligence of appellant and his assumption of risk were not reached and resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">Appellant here basically contends that the Government was guilty of actionable negligence (1) in failing to provide an <em>adequate </em>warning of the dangerous nature and propensities of bears which inhabited Yellowstone National Park, and (2) in failing to remove or destroy the bear in question prior to appellant\u2019s injuries. Appellant recognizes that these issues presented fact questions and that we cannot set aside the findings of fact made by the trial court unless they are clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a), Fed.R. Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">In Geer-Melkus Construction Company v. United States, 8 Cir., 302 F.2d 181, 183 (1962), we recognized the well-established rule that the trial court\u2019s fact findings \u201ccan be set aside only upon clear demonstration that they were without substantial evidentiary support or induced by an erroneous view of the law. Fact findings supported by substantial evidence cannot be upset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948), teaches that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-14\">\u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">After a painstaking .analysis of the record, the contentions of the parties, their supporting briefs, and upon consideration of pertinent authorities, we are fully convinced that no firm ground exists for upsetting the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Judge Van Pelt accorded due and deliberate consideration to every phase of this litigation, as is manifest from his soundly reasoned opinion. Because of our inability to materially add to or improve upon the substance of the opinion, we affirm on the basis thereof as to all issues urged by appellant before us \u2014 \u25a0 except the contention that the court erred in applying the discretionary function exception of the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2680(a). We need not determine the validity of this contention, since we have concluded that appellant has failed to demonstrate that the court\u2019s finding of no actionable negligence is clearly erroneous</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
