In early 1958 Country Tweeds, which does not itself manufacture the cashmere fabric used in its coats, began purchasing its requirements of cashmere from a new supplier, Cashmere Products, Ltd. Country Tweeds had formerly purchased its cashmere from Einiger Mills, Inc., but changed suppliers because it believed that the cashmere produced by Einiger was no longer the best on the market. Petitioners called the new fabric \u201cCountry Tweeds El Elegant Cashmere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-18\">Petitioners submitted two samples of cashmere fabric to the United States Testing Company. One sample, the fabric formerly purchased from Einiger, it labeled \u201cBest Quality Cashmere produced to date\u201d; the other sample, the new fabric it was then using, it labeled \u201cCountry Tweeds El Elegant Cashmere.\u201d The testing company subjected the samples to three comparative tests requested by petitioner: (1) an abrasion test; (2) a breaking load test; (3) a dry cleaning test. A two page report was then submitted to petitioners setting forth the results of the tests and in this report the testing company designated the samples by the designations given them by petitioners. The report was on the official letterhead of the testing company, and it was signed by two of its officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-19\">After receiving the report petitioners altered it and in so doing reduced its size to one page. It was then sent, in its altered form, to petitioners\u2019 dealers throughout the United States. At the same time petitioners also furnished to the dealers a brochure, which included the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-20\">\u201cQ. How do I know El Elegant cashmere is my best buy? A. Recent tests by U. S. Testing, the world\u2019s largest independent laboratory, proclaimed El Elegant the best money could buy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-21\">The report as thus altered and distributed contained a reproduction of the testing company\u2019s official letterhead and the two signatures which were on the original report, but the body of the original report was changed. The petitioners changed that portion of the testing company\u2019s report dealing with the dry cleaning test by merely printing the testing company\u2019s stated results without the introductory material which had appeared in the original report explaining in detail the manner in which the test was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The portion of the altered report that dealt with the other two tests eliminated even more.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\">In the original report the testing company had set forth the results it had reached for the abrasion test in terms of the number of abrading cycles necessary to produce a given degree of wear for each sample. The report set forth that \u201cCountry Tweeds El Elegant Cashmere\u201d had withstood 715 cycles, while \u201cBest Quality Cashmere produced to date\u201d had withstood only 673. The testing company inserted in its report, immediately after the statement of this result in its tests, the following \u201cComment\u201d: \u201cTest results indicate no significant difference in abrasive resistance between the two submitted samples. It is noted that there is no significant difference in \u2018roughing up\u2019 in the intermediate stages of wear.\u201d In the altered report petitioners omitted this qualifying statement and expressed the test results in the following language: \u201cCountry Tweeds\u2019 El Elegant 100% Cashmere lasts 6.3% longer than Best Quality Cashmere produced to date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The results of the breaking load test were expressed by the testing company in its original report in terms of a given number of test pounds. Numerals indicating the measure of the results for each sample were set forth for both \u201cwarp\u201d and \u201cfilling.\u201d The numerals for \u201cBest Quality Cashmere produced to date\u201d were 29.6 for \u201cwarp\u201d and 14.5 for \u201cfilling.\u201d The numerals for \u201cCountry Tweeds El Elegant Cashmere\u201d were 28.5 and 22.7 for these two categories. The report as altered by petitioners described the test results in the following terms: \u201cCountry Tweeds\u2019 El Elegant 100% Cashmere proves 56.5%' stronger than Best Quality Cashmere produced to date.\u201d This 56.5% figure accurately represents only the percentage of difference between the original test results that dealt with \u201cfilling.\u201d The percentaje figure does not take into account the difference in original test results for \u201cwarp,\u201d a difference which showed that \u201cBest Quality Cashmere produced to date\u201d performed better in this regard than \u201cCountry Tweeds El Elegant Cashmere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">On the basis of these facts, undisputed by petitioners, the Commission concluded that petitioners had violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by falsely representing: (1) That the United States Testing Company, prior to the comparative tests conducted on both samples, had already found one of the fabrics to be the best quality cashmere produced up to that time; (2) That \u201cCountry Tweeds El Elegant Cashmere\u201d was in fact 56.5% stronger than another fabric subjected to a breaking load test; and (3) That the altered test report which was circulated was an authentic reproduction of the report originally submitted to petitioners by the United States Testing Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The record amply supports the conclusions of the Commission that petitioners made representations which were false, misleading, and deceptive. Petitioners, admitting that the altered report was not an authentic facsimile of the original report, contend that it was a fair summary of the original, framed in less technical terms. We find it impossible to accept this contention. Even if we were convinced (which we are not) that framing the test results in percentage terms did not cause the test results to appear more favorably to the fabric petitioners were interested in promoting, we would still be compelled to refuse to hold the altered report a fair summary. In the original report the testing company, immediately below the formal statement of the abrasion test results, had explained that the results were to be interpreted as evidencing no significant difference between the two fabrics tested. Petitioners chose to delete this important qualifying statement from the altered report which they distributed, simply stating that the fabric they were then using would last 6.3% longer than the other fabric. Thus, though the testing company had stated in the original report that the fabrics tested showed no signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>cant difference when subjected to the abrasion test, petitioners chose to attribute to the company the opinion that one of the fabrics tested would last longer than the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">What petitioners did in \u201csummarizing\u201d the results of the breaking load test was even more misleading. The test which was conducted involved two aspects, one dealing with \u201cwarp\u201d and one dealing with \u201cfilling.\u201d The figures in the original report favored the fabric petitioners were interested in with respect to \u201cfilling,\u201d but showed that the other fabric had performed slightly better in the \u201cwarp\u201d test. The percentage figure published in the altered report was one which presented the difference between the performance of the two fabrics with respect to \u201cfilling\u201d only.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We agree with the Commission that this publication went beyond the mere misrepresentation of a testimonial or an endorsement; it amounted to a direct misrepresentation of the quality of petitioners\u2019 cashmere. A national testing company had given petitioners a report setting forth the comparative performance of two fabrics as a result of tests conducted at the behest of petitioners. Petitioners, in advertising one of those fabrics, made representations about it which were not supported by the test results they had received.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The Commission also found that petitioners had falsely represented that the testing company had previously tested one of the fabrics and had found it to be the best quality produced up to that time. Petitioners, when they submitted the competing fabric to the testing company, labeled it \u201cBest Quality Cashmere produced to date.\u201d In their original report the testing company, as petitioners could well anticipate, designated the samples by the names petitioners had given them when the samples were submitted for testing, and petitioners carried over these names into the altered test report.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The Commission was correct in concluding that the report distributed by petitioners, which labeled the competing product tested as \u201cBest Quality Cashmere produced to date,\u201d falsely represented that the testing company had previously tested the fabric and had found it to be of the best quality up to that time. Publication of the results of the comparative performance of these two fabrics in three tests carried with it the implication that the one labeled \u201cBest Quality Cashmere produced to date\u201d had previously been subjected by the testing company to a battery of tests that had established that quality, tests that were at least similar to those being then reported. Admittedly no prior tests had been conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">That the public was not misled in this particular by any alteration of the original test report, but as a consequence of petitioners\u2019 original labeling of the fabrics which it failed to change when passing the test results on to the public, did not soften the fact that petitioners published representations which were misleading and deceptive. Moreover, it would be immaterial if petitioners honestly believed the competing fabric was the best produced up to the time they shifted to the other fabric, or even if this was in fact so; for petitioners were found to have misrepresented the findings of the testing company by their publication, irrespective of the quality of the competing fabric.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Petitioners also argue that they are saved by certain additional information which appeared in the altered report. They point to the statement at the top of the published report, which also appeared in the original report, which identified the two fabrics tested: \u201cTwo samples of fabric sampled and identified by Client as below. Order No. 4424 dated 2/4/58.\u201d Petitioners also note that the capitalization used in the label \u201cBest Quality Cashmere produced to date\u201d should have prevented the public from being misled. But, as the Commission correctly stated, it is immaterial that a given phrase considered technically may be construed so as not to constitute a misrepresentation. Kalwajtys v. F. T, C., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>237 F.2d 654 (7 Cir. 1956), cert, denied. 352 U.S. 1025, 77 S.Ct. 591, 1 L.Ed.2d 597 (1957). What is important in determining whether a statement is misleading is the over-all impression it tends to create on the public. Murray Space Shoe Corp. v. F. T. C., 304 F.2d 270 (2 Cir. 1962). Statements susceptible of both a misleading and a truthful interpretation will be construed against the advertiser. Id. 304 F.2d at 272; United States v. Ninety-Five Barrels of Vinegar, etc., 265 U.S. 438, 443, 44 S.Ct. 529, 68 L.Ed. 1094 (1924). We are of the opinion that the Commission could legitimately conclude that the over-all impression created by the published report was deceptive and misleading. Moreover, whatever doubts one might have had about the Commission\u2019s conclusion on this issue are dispelled when note is taken of the statements made in the brochure which petitioners circulated at the same time as they circulated their report. In that brochure petitioners stated that \u201crecent tests by U. S. Testing Company, the world\u2019s largest independent testing laboratory, proclaimed El Elegant cashmere the finest money could buy.\u201d This could only be interpreted as meaning that the testing company, before conducting the comparative tests which allegedly proved that petitioners\u2019 fabric was better than the other sample tested, had been satisfied that the other sample was the best quality cashmere up to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Petitioners also contend that the complaint filed by the Commission was inadequate to apprise them of the Commission\u2019s disapproval of the particular trade practices that the proof and findings ultimately developed. We find no merit to this contention. There was no fatal variance between the complaint and the proof and findings. Petitioners were given adequate notice of the deceptive practices which the Commission ultimately found they had committed. See Standard Distributors, Inc. v. F. T. C., 211 F.2d 7 (2 Cir. 1954). Petitioners claim that these proceedings were not in the public interest. What we have said heretofore would seem effectively to dispose of this make-weight. They also suggest that inasmuch as they had ceased their illegal conduct prior to the issuance of the complaint the Commission was thereby deprived of the power to issue a cease and desist order. Although persuasive of a less harsh order than otherwise, this change in their policies does not wholly absolve petitioners. See Giant Food, Inc. v. F. T. C., 322 F.2d 977 (D.C. Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">We come now to a consideration of the order the Commission formulated. Petitioners object to the order as it now stands, more particularly to paragraph 4 thereof, on the ground that it is framed in terms which are too broad and which are not justified in the light of the Commission\u2019s findings. The paragraph claimed to be offensive orders petitioners to refrain from \u201cmisrepresenting in any manner the quality of cashmere or other fabric in their merchandise.\u201d We agree with petitioners that the order should be modified by striking paragraph 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\"> It is true that the Commission has wide discretion in its choice of remedies, and courts traditionally have ac-. corded deference to orders promulgated by the Commission. See, for example, Hoving Corp. v. F. T. C., 290 F.2d 803 (2 Cir. 1961). But though the scope of review of a Commission order is limited and the courts must recognize the necessity for Commission orders adequate to cope with the violators which it discovers, a court must still demand that there be some relation between the violations found and the breadth of the order. F. T. C. v. Mandel Bros., Inc., 359 U.S. 385, 79 S.Ct. 818, 3 L.Ed.2d 893 (1959); F. T. C. v. National Lead Co., 352 U.S. 419, 77 S.Ct. 502, 1 L.Ed.2d 438 (1957) ; N. L. R. B. v. Crompton-Highland Mills, Inc., 337 U.S. 217, 69 S.Ct. 960, 93 L.Ed. 1320 (1949); N. L. R. B. v. Express Publishing Co., 312 U.S. 426, 61 S.Ct. 693, 85 L.Ed. 930 (1941). An order is not entitled to enforcement if the court reviewing it finds that \u201cthe remedy selected has no reasonable relation to the unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>practices found to exist.\u201d Jacob Siegel Co. v. F. T. C., 327 U.S. 608, 613, 66 S.Ct. 758, 760, 90 L.Ed. 888 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The Supreme Court, moreover, has indicated in a recent statement the importance of carefully scrutinizing orders of the Commission, and has suggested the need for the Commission\u2019s formulating \"them with sufficient specificity. F. T. C. V. Henry Broch &amp; Co., 368 U.S. 360, 82 S.Ct. 431, 7 L.Ed.2d 353 (1962). The \u2022Court\u2019s pronouncement was the result of certain amendments to Section 11 of the Clayton Act, 73 Stat. 243 (1959), 15 U.S. C. \u00a7 21 (Supp. IV 1959-62), amending 38 Stat. 734 (1914), which were designed to accord to orders dealing with Clayton Act violations the same finality which has traditionally characterized orders issued under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45. H.R. Rep.No. 580, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 1959, p. 1804. Though refusing to sanction the modification of a broad Commission order which had been entered before the 1959 amendments, the Court was careful to note that this was not to be taken as a sign that it would approve the order under the new law. The Court then went on to say:. \u201cThe severity of possible penalties prescribed by the amendments for violations of orders which have become final underlines the necessity for fashioning orders which are, at the outset, sufficiently clear and precise to avoid raising serious questions as to their meaning and application.\u201d 368 U.S. at 367-368, 82 S.Ct. at 436, 7 L.Ed.2d 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">It is difficult to imagine an order couched in more sweeping language than the one now before us. Petitioners, found guilty of misrepresenting the quality of their cashmere through the misuse of test results, have been ordered to refrain from misrepresenting \u201cin any manner\u201d the quality of their fabrics. This Court, subsequent to Hoving v. F. T. C., supra, in a series of recent cases dealing with illegal payments to buyers under Section 2(d) of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18(d), and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45, has not hesitated to modify broad Commission orders which went beyond the particular illegal practices found to exist. American News Co. v. F. T. C., 300 F.2d 104 (2 Cir.), cert, denied, 371 U.S. 824, 83 S.Ct. 44, 9 L. Ed.2d 64 (1962); Grand Union Co. v. F. T. C., 300 F.2d 92 (2 Cir. 1962); Swanee Paper Corp. v. F. T. C., 291 F.2d 833 (2 Cir. 1961), cert, denied, 368 U.S. 987, 82 S.Ct. 603, 7 L.Ed.2d 525 (1962). See also Vanity Fair Paper Mills, Inc. v. F. T. C., 311 F.2d 480, 487 (2 Cir. 1963), where the court, though refusing to accept some modifications proposed by petitioner, nevertheless did narrow the order to make it \u201csomewhat better related to * * * [petitioner\u2019s] offending while still sufficiently prohibiting \u2018variations on the basic theme.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The principles which prompted this court in the above cases to narrow Commission orders apply with equal force here, though the violation to which the instant order is directed is deceptive advertising. The First Circuit, on two occasions, has been critical of Commission orders directed to deceptive advertising and labeling which were, in some respects, less broad than the order now before us. Korber Hats, Inc. v. F. T. C., 311 F.2d 358 (1 Cir. 1962); Colgate-Palmolive Co. v. F. T. C., 310 F.2d 89 (1 Cir. 1962). We think it advisable again to note that petitioners in this case have ceased to engage in the advertising practice which prompted the order, and voluntarily did so well before the Commission filed its complaint. Cessation of the offending activity, with the likelihood that the petitioner will not again resume it or a related activity, has been one factor which courts have considered in limiting broad Commission orders. Grand Union Co. v. F. T. C., supra, 300 F.2d at 100; Swanee Paper Corp. v. F. T. C., supra, 291 F.2d at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">The order will be enforced with paragraph 4 thereof deleted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
