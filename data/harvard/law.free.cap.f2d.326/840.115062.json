The operation was such that there was no support left for an artificial limb. Except for this amputation he is in good health. He worked as a self employed truck driver for a period, but stopped after he had a bad accident. Unable to find other work, he applied for Social Security benefits. His claim was denied after consideration at all administrative levels. He then sought review in the District Court. The trial judge found that the Administration\u2019s determination was based upon substantial evidence, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\"> It is undisputed in this record that the appellant\u2019s sole defect is the loss of one arm. After a careful examination of the record we find that the appellant is not permanently and totally disabled from engaging in \u201cany\u201d substantial gainful occupation. This Court has held the equivalent of this in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Foster, 5 Cir., 1933, 67 F.2d 264, 266. The test there was \u201ctotal and permanent disability\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-6\">\u201cThe evidence shows, <em>and it is common knowledge, </em>that a man with only one arm or leg, if not otherwise incapacitated, may do much valuable work and engage in many gainful occupations, and there are many cases so holding. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Wann (Tex.Civ. App.) 28 S.W.(2d) 196; Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Barela (Tex.Civ. App.) 44 S.W.(2d) 494; Buckner v. Jefferson Standard Life Ins. Co., 172 N.C. 762, 90 S.E. 897; Hurley v. Bankers\u2019 Life Co., 198 Iowa, 1129, 199 N.W. 343, 37 A.L.R. 146; Jefferson Standard Life Ins. Co. v. Parten, 30 Ga.App. 245, 117 S.E. 772; Ind. Life Endowment Co. v. Reed, 54 Ind.App. 450, 103 N.E. 77.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">The question in Social Security cases relates to whether a man can work, and not whether he can find a job in the area. See e. g., Celebrezze v. O\u2019Brient, 5 Cir., 1963, 323 F.2d 989; Hicks v. Flemming, 302 F.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">[DeVANE, J., participated in the hearing of this case, but died before this opinion was written.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
