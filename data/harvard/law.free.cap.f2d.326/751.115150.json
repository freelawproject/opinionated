The contractor was low bidder. He knew that the Authority\u2019s obtaining of necessary financing was a condition precedent to the making of a binding contract. The Authority prepared and sent to the contractor formal contracting documents for execution and return to the Authority. The contractor signed the formal contract and returned it. However, not obtaining some of the needed financing, the Authority refused to execute the contract. In these circumstances, we think the trial court properly ruled that there was no binding contract. Cf. Wayne Crouse, Inc. v. Braddock Borough School District, 1941, 341 Pa. 497, 19 A.2d 843.</p>\n<p id=\"Asd\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
