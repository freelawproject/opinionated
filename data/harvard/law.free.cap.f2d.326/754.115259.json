Bartie v. United States, D.C.La., 216 F.Supp. 10. His findings that the defendant was not negligent, and that the deaths of the plaintiff\u2019s wife and children were not proximately caused by the conduct of defendant\u2019s employees, are not clearly erroneous. On the other hand, they are fully justified by the evidence, and are sufficient basis, in themselves, for upholding the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-22\">It is unnecessary to pass on the other grounds given by the trial court in support of his judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
