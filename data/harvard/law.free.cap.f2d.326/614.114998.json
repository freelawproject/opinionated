He was fined $1000 on Count One and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 90 days on Count Two. He was released on bail pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-17\">We are urged to reverse: (1) because the trial judge refused to compel the Government to reveal the identity of the Special Employee who introduced the agent who placed the bets; (2) for failure of the trial judge to compel the production of certain expense vouchers; and (3) for insufficiency of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-18\">We have carefully examined the transcript and find there was ample proof to sustain the finding of guilt. While appellant was a construction worker employed on a site on the North side of 42nd Street, between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues, New York City, the statute applied to all who are \u201cengaged in the business of accepting wagers,\u201d and construction workers are not excluded. Indeed, there is proof of the placing with appellant of at least ten bets on horse races over a period of several weeks, and the payment by appellant of the winnings in those instances where the horse won the race. While appellant denied that he ever paid any winnings, and testified that the bets placed through him were only \u201cabout four,\u201d or \u201cabout five all together,\u201d there was much in his testimony to give plausibility to the proofs adduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>by the Government. Moreover, the trial judge had ample justification in rejecting appellant\u2019s explanation that he accepted the bets as a favor, to be placed only if he found that \u201csomebody was going to the track.\u201d On the issue of wilfulness there was testimony of admissions by appellant that he had knowledge of the federal Wagering Tax laws, as well as proof of comments by him to the effect that \u201cthere were cops in the neighborhood\u201d and with reference to one of the Government agents standing nearby: \u201cSee that guy, he\u2019s not right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"> It is clear that disclosure of the identity of a Special Employee is to be required only when necessary for a fair disposition of the case. Roviaro v. United States, 1957, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639; Scher v. United States, 1938, 305 U.S. 251, 59 S.Ct. 174, 83 L.Ed. 151. Here, as Judge Cooper observed, \u201cthere is no evidence of entrapment,\u201d and the testimony of the Special Employee would have been at best cumulative. Certainly we cannot say the ruling, under the circumstances of this case, was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">As to the expense vouchers, counsel for appellant after moving \u201cthat the paper be turned over,\u201d made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201cMr. Stone: I ask your Honor to reserve a ruling subject to connection, where I will show that this document may be extremely important to the defense and in that case I will expect a ruling after all the evidence is in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Thereafter the subject was dropped and not referred to again. As there was no jury and Judge Cooper was to decide questions of guilt or innocence, it is easy to understand why counsel did not pursue the subject and insist at the trial, as he does now before us, that \u201cthe paper\u201d showing the vouchers for the money used in placing the bets with appellant be produced for inspection by Judge Cooper \u201cin camera.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
