The taxpayer and his wife<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed joint income tax returns for the taxable years 1950 through 1953 with the District Director of Internal Revenue for the District of Washington, at Tacoma, Washington. Since all questions hereinafter considered involve only the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended, all references in this opinion to the Internal Revenue Code, or I.R.C., are to be understood as referring to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 as amended. On November 10, 1958 the Commissioner of Internal Revenue mailed a Notice of Deficiency for the four taxable years in certain specified amounts, totaling, with alleged additions under I.R.C. Sec. 294 (d), $139,969.94. On January 26, 1959, the taxpayer filed a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency under the provisions of Section 272, I.R.C. In an Amended Answer the Commissioner asserted additional deficiencies and additions and adjustments to the tax, for the four years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-18\">Many facts were stipulated to and in addition both sides adduced testimony and other evidence in support of their respective positions, the petitioners\u2019 main witness being taxpayer himself. For the government, besides facts brought out on cross-examination of taxpayer, there was adduced testimony of an Internal Revenue Agent who did the final investigation for the government, together with that of seven other witnesses, some of them being former employees of taxpayer and others being persons who were involved in some of the transactions out of which the alleged liability of taxpayer arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The Tax Court entered a decision, entitled \u201cMemorandum, Findings of Fact and Opinion,\u201d of 114 printed pages in the transcript of record, going into the issues and evidence in rather full detail, and rendered a final decision based upon this Memorandum, Findings of Fact and Opinion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqP\">\u201cOrdered and Decided: That there are deficiencies in income taxes and additions to the tax due from the petitioners as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">Deficiency</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">Additions to the Tax (1939 Code)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">Year Income Tax Sec. 293(b). Sec. 294(d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">1950 $18,902.06 None \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqT\">1951 32,562.22 None \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADP\">1952 45,887.27 None $9,318.96</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af\">1953 34,882.63 None 4,558.07.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">In so doing the Tax Court reduced very substantially the amount of additional taxes claimed by the government, including rulings adverse to the government on the issue of fraud, and other rulings denying claims of additional unreported income.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-17\">We adopt the statement of the issues set forth on pages 3 to 4 of the Respondent\u2019s Answering Brief, and quoted in footnote,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>as being more simple and less repetitive of overlapping contentions than the specification of errors contained in Petitioner\u2019s Opening Brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>ISSUE NO. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"> The first issue is whether there was substantial evidence to support the 'Tax Court\u2019s finding that the taxpayer was regularly engaged in the business of selling timber in the years 1950 through 1953 and that timber sold in the disputed transactions in those years was held primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business, so that the gain from those .sales constituted ordinary income under Section 22(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, rather than a capital gain within the meaning of Section 117(a) (1) of that Code. The taxpayer claimed that the sales in question were sales of \u25a0capital assets and hence that the profits therefrom were capital gains. The sections in question are quoted in the Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The Tax Court held that during the \u2022taxable years in question the taxpayer was engaged in the trade or business of selling timber. We agree with the Tax \u25a0Court that what constitutes a trade or business is a question of fact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">A careful reading of the record of facts stipulated to and the transcript of testimony, including the cross-examination of the taxpayer himself, discloses that there is very substantial evidence to support the Court\u2019s ruling set forth in the note 4, supra. Taxpayer claims that none of the specific tracts of timber sold during the taxable years in question were held by taxpayer and his wife primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. In support of this contention taxpayer points to an average length of holding of each tract of about eight years, lack of \u201cbusy-ness\u201d or affirmative activity on the part of petitioners in seeking to bring about such sale, and the fact that despite the tremendous increment in timber stumpage values, brought on by the wartime inflation, petitioners disposed of only a small percentage \u2014 between 3 and 8 percent\u2014 of their timber holdings during the taxable years in question, and still retained most of their timber, despite numerous offers. Taxpayer also points to the fact that petitioners had even more numerous transactions in the stock market during this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">As stated in petitioners\u2019 opening brief, all other issues are relatively minor compared to the principal issue, which is whether petitioners realized capital gains or ordinary income from the sale of timber on certain tracts of timberland during the years 1950 through 1953. There appears to be no real dispute as to the facts. The Tax Court in dealing with the problem as to various transactions, which for the purposes of this particular question need not be specifically enumerated, pointed out, among other things, the following circumstances in support of its ruling that taxpayer was engaged in the business of acquiring and selling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>timberlands or timber rights during the ten years from 1948 to 1957, which included the four years here in question, namely 1950 to 1953 inclusive:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">1. Taxpayer began to purchase and sell real estate for his own account about 1926 and continued to acquire and sell real estate since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">2. In the late 1920\u2019s he commenced acquiring timberland and has continued to acquire such timberlands from that time throughout the taxable years involved, most of them being through tax delinquent and other tax sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">3. About 1940 he began to sell some of his timber and has continued to sell some of his timber throughout the taxable years involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">4. From the early 1940\u2019s throughout the years involved it has been his policy to purchase the timberland, sell the timber thereon, and retain the land, although there have been a very few occasional outright sales of land itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">5. In 1950 taxpayer owned between 50,000 and 100,000 acres of timberland located in the states of Oregon, California and Washington, and in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">6. In 1952 taxpayer owned approximately 35,000 acres, containing approximately 250 million feet of lumber in Lincoln County, Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">7. During the years 1948 through 1957 taxpayer made at least 107 separate sales of timber, and some sales of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">8. The timber and timberlands sold by taxpayer during this 10-year period were located in 20 different counties, in three different states, and the total sales ran from a low of 74,000 odd dollars in one year, to as high as 452,000 odd dollars a year, to a grand total for the 10-year period of almost two and a half million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">9. Petitioner was listed in the alphabetical and classified sections of the Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, telephone directories during the years 1931 to 1947 as being engaged in the real estate business.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">10. During the taxable years involved taxpayer maintained an office in his home in Vancouver, Washington, and from time to time persons interested in purchasing timberland from him would come to this office to negotiate such purchases with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">11. About 1950 taxpayer opened an office in Newport, Oregon, under the assumed name of Wineberg Timber Company, a sole proprietorship of taxpayer. At first the office of this company was located in the office of taxpayer\u2019s accountant, and later was moved to a separate location.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-16\">12. During the period April 1, 1952, to July, 1955, taxpayer employed a Mr. Moses as manager of his Newport, Oregon, office, operating under the name of Wineberg Timber Company, and on April 6, 1953, an assumed business name certificate under the name of Wineberg Timber Company was filed in Lincoln County, Oregon, showing the true names of the persons conducting this business to be taxpayer and Ellis W. Moses, and stating the business of the Wineberg Timber Company to be \u201cto purchase, exchange, sell and otherwise deal in timber, timberlands, logs, lumber and other forest products, and to log and manufacture lumber and lumber products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">13. In addition to Moses, taxpayer employed in the Newport Office of Wineberg Timber Company, on a full-time basis, a secretary, an engineer cruiser named Dennison, a helper for Dennison, and an office manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-18\">14. Taxpayer also employed a timber-finder, Pauley, who did not work in the Newport office; and on occasions taxpayer also employed a Mr. Hendrickson; but ordinarily his dealings with Hendrickson consisted of the latter coming to him to arrange for the purchase of timber from taxpayer for other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-19\">15. Moses\u2019 duties, while employed as manager of the Wineberg Timber Company, were to supervise petitioner\u2019s timber operations; be responsible for the management of the Wineberg Timber Company office; see that timber sold un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>der contract was paid for, cut and removed pursuant to the contract; handle inquiries from prospective purchasers concerning the availability of timber for sale, and transmit offers to purchase timber to taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">16. Sales of timber negotiated by Moses were subject to approval by taxpayer. Dennison\u2019s primary duties were to cruise and check petitioner\u2019s timber holdings and to check and run timber lines. Pauley\u2019s main duties were to locate and check timber tracts, acquire properties for rights of way, and acquire properties adjoining tracts of timberlands owned by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">17. Petitioner\u2019s office in Newport, Oregon, had a sign on the door reading \u201cWineberg Timber Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">18. Wineberg Timber Company was also listed in the classified section of the Corvallis, Washington-and-vicinity telephone directory of October 1953, under the heading \u201ctimber and timberland companies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">19. The stationery of that company carried its title, location and telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">20. While Moses was employed by petitioner his name was carried on the stationery as the general manager of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">21. Moses distributed business cards of the Wineberg Timber Company carrying his name as general manager thereof, with his business and home telephone numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">22. While Moses was employed by the Wineberg Timber Company petitioner advertised in the name of the company over the radio for the purchase of logged-over lands or timberlands but these radio advertisements did not advertise timber or timberlands for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">23. Persons engaged in the timber business in Lincoln County, Oregon, knew that petitioner bought and sold timber and timberlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">24. Petitioner did not have a set price which he had placed on specific timber, but throughout the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s petitioner made sales of timber when he believed he had a prospective purchaser at a price he considered \u201cthe right price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">25. The returns filed by petitioners for each of the taxable years in question contained a schedule of income and expense, and some of the items listed under expense in each return were amounts spent by petitioner in maintaining the Wineberg Timber Company office at Newport, Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">Petitioner, in some instances, would plant and i*eseed timberlands owned by him. As part of the reseeding program he practiced pest control, having poisoned pellets dropped by plane on the reseeded timberlands. Petitioner also attempted to acquire parcels of land adjoining land that he already owned in instances where such acquisition would be advantageous to natural reseeding of his timberlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">27. The Tax Court\u2019s opinion lists five timber sales for 1950, six for 1951, four for 1952, and three for 1953, ranging in sales price from a low $500 to a high of $26,000 which that Court considered as sales, the income from which was denied capital gains treatment by the Court. The opinion also lists 39 other timber sales made during the same period as to which the petitioners retained an economic interest in the timber and the respondent allowed capital gains treatment under Section 117(k) (2), I.R.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-17\">28. Both the agreements involving the former group and those involving the latter group of sales mentioned in the preceding paragraph generally provided for the sale of standing timber and not of land, contained a time limit within which the buyer was permitted to cut and remove timber from the land on which it stood, and a limitation in the diameter of timber sold and to be removed, sometimes referred to as selective cutting. On occasions because of the selective cutting provision and petitioner\u2019s retention of title to the land, petitioner was able to sell timber from the same tract to several different purchasers, so that on occasions over a pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>riod of a year or two petitioner would make as many as six separate sales of different types of lumber from the same tract. During the years involved petitioner\u2019s sales of timber frequently excluded peeler logs.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">29. In addition the Tax Court opinion lists six transactions during the period in question for which petitioners accepted as payments from sales various amounts for unauthorized or trespass removals of timber from their land. These trespasses were either reported by the trespasser or discovered by petitioners\u2019 employees, and most of them were inadvertent, resulting from mistakes in dividing property lines. In each instance the land upon which the trespass had occurred was examined by persons employed by petitioner to determine the extent of the unauthorized cutting, and petitioner and the trespassing party, after negotiations, agreed upon the amount to be paid for the trespass. There were probably other similar trespasses not discovered by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">30. Under Oregon laws effective during the periods concerned, a trespasser is liable for treble damages for intentional cutting and removal of timber, and for double damages for unintentional trespass cutting and removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">31. During the years involved petitioner owned stock in the Yaquina Bay Mills, Inc., a corporation engaged in the business of a planing mill, and petitioner also acquired other lumber mills from the owners thereof who had purchased timber from him and failed to meet their payments for the timber. During said years petitioner had a contract for sale of logs to Yaquina and certain mills to which he had sold or was selling timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">32. The foregoing facts in the aggregate, together with other considerations noted by the Tax Court, clearly support the ruling of the Tax Court on Issue No. 1., that during the years in question petitioner was engaged in the trade or business of selling timber, and clearly distinguish the Starke <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and other cases relied upon by petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">In this connection, we agree with the reasoning of the Tax Court, under the facts of this case, (a) that the failure to advertise the timber and timberlands for <em>sale </em>during the years concerned is not controlling where it is clear that petitioner had available, and used, means for selling his timber without advertising in newspapers or putting up For Sale signs, or otherwise expressly advertising that he was holding timber for sale; (b) that the lack of affirmative evidence in behalf of petitioners, to show that any one of particular timber holdings sold during these taxable years was held by petitioner for some specific reason as an investment, is of substantial significance in the framework of the total picture presented by the facts,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (c) that the length of time of holding \u2014 an average of some eight years here \u2014 is not conclusive, although in other contexts it has been held a significant factor in determining that the property sold had been held for investment.6</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">As to amounts received from the trespass cuttings of timber, we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>that since, as the Tax Court properly-held, the taxpayer was engaged in holding these properties primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business, the gains from such amounts received in lieu of payment for the' timber itself were receipts by petitioner from the sale of properties held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business and the gain therefrom constitutes ordinary income. There is no evidence that, as to the property on which the trespass cuttings were committed, the taxpayer intended to hold them for any purpose different from that of the timber holdings which he sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">ISSUE NO. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In the alternative, petitioner raises issue No. 2., in which he appears to argue, in effect, that the Tax Court should have allowed the taxpayer capital gains treatment of the proceeds from all timber sales, regardless of whether the timber was held for investment or for sale in the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">The argument, which is difficult to follow, seems to be that (a) the amendment made by the Revenue Act of 1943, which added subsection (k) to the Internal Revenue Code and amended Section 17 (j) (1) to make specific reference to subsections (k) (1) and (k) (2), (b) as construed by petitioner in the light of that portion of Senate Report No. 627, 78th Congress, on H.R. 3687, dealing with \u201cTimber Relief,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> does away with the exclusionary provisions of subsections 117(a) and 117(j) which exclude from eligibility for capital gains treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale in the ordinary course of his trade or business.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Petitioner contends that, if Congress had intended to allow capital gains <em>only to that portion of the class </em>of taxpayers who either cut their own timber or disposed of the timber by contract under which they retained an economic interest, <em>who were not dealers, </em>this purpose could have been fully accomplished by the addition of Section 117 (k) <em>without any amendment </em>to Section 117 (j); and that by adding to Section 117(j) the sentence,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq6\">\u201cSuch term [meaning property used in the trade or business] also includes timber * * * with respect to which subsection (k) (1) or (2) is applicable. * * * \u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\"><em>without adding </em>also a <em>specific exclusion </em>at this point of <em>property held primarily for sale, </em>etc., as was done in Section 117 (a) (1) (B), and in the portion of Section 117(j) preceding the last quoted amendment, Congress indicated an intention to go further and to extend capital gains treatment to all proceeds of timber sales, whether the timber was held for investment or primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">This contention of the petitioner is made in this Court for the first time, as pointed out by respondent. However, even assuming that it was properly raised below, we have carefully considered the point and find it to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Senate Report No. 627 as quoted in Note Number 7, supra, indicates no intent to prefer timber dealers over dealers in other real property interests or in other commodities. The first paragraph of the quoted excerpt indicates concern solely with the inequality of treatment between a taxpayer who <em>cut </em>his own timber and then sold or used it, and one who merely sold the timber outright.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The obvious intent in adding subsection (k), as indicated by a reading of the entire excerpt from Senate Report No. 627 quoted in Note Number 7, supra, was <em>not </em>to eliminate existing exclusions as to <em>dealers </em>in timber, but to <em>equalize </em>the <em>treatment between </em>(1) <em>non-dealers </em>who <em>sold their timber outright, </em>and (2) <em>non-dealers who cut their own timber </em>and then sold or used it. Section 117 (k) (2) was added to give the same treatment to <em>non-dealers </em>who sold timber to others under a lease or similar arrangement whereby they reserved an economic interest in the timber, as was given by Section 117(k) (1) to <em>non-dealers </em>who sold their timber outright.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">It seems equally obvious from a reading of said excerpt from Senate Report No. 627, that by adding to Section 117 (j) (1) the penultimate sentence incorporating by reference, into the definition of \u201cproperty used in the trade or business,\u201d \u201ctimber or coal with respect to which subsection (k) (1) or (2) is applicable * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>without </em>specifically again excepting \u201cproperty held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business,\u201d Congress did not intend to render inapplicable to timber sales and disposals specifically covered by subsection (k) those portions of Sections 117 (a) (1) (A) or (B) and 117(j) (1) (B) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>which excepted from capital gains treatment property held primarily for sale.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">\u201cSince this section [subsection 117] is an exception from the normal tax requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, the definition of a capital asset must be narrowly applied and its exclusions interpreted broadly. This is necessary to effectuate the basic congressional purpose. This Court has always construed narrowly the term \u2018capital assets\u2019 in \u00a7 117. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-3\">Com Products Refining Co. v. Commissioner (1955) 350 U.S. 46, 52,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 76 S.Ct. 20, 24, 100 L.Ed. 29.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARZ\">The construction here adopted conforms to the general rule of construction just quoted. We find no error in the Tax Court\u2019s failure to adopt the construction of Sections 117(j) and 117(k) advanced in this petitioner\u2019s alternate contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The questions as to whether the gains under certain transactions were entitled to capital gains treatment under subsection 117(k) (2) because of the timber allegedly having been disposed of under types of contract by virtue of which the owner allegedly retained an economic interest in such timber, are disposed of infra, in our discussions of issues Nos. 4. and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">ISSUE NO. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Sec. 112(b) (1)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the Code permits non-recognition of gain or loss if property \u201cheld for productive use in trade or business or for investment (not including stock in trade or other property held primarily for sale * * *) is exchanged solely for property of a like kind to be held either for productive use in trade or business or for investment.\u201d Petitioners contend that in this category of alleged exchanges of property the Tax Court should have included the Maclnnis (Wren Planing Mill), Monroe Lumber Company, Springfield Plywood Corp., and Pritzlaff and Wilson, transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">It was contended by the respondent that these transactions did not constitute exchanges of property, but rather constituted outright sales of timber, a portion of the purchase price in each instance being discharged by the purchaser, at petitioner\u2019s direction, paying directly to a third party, from whom petitioner had agreed to purchase other property, the agreed price of such property.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Respondent further contended that even if the transactions were in fact partial exchanges of properties, the properties exchanged were not like properties, within the meaning of Section 112(b) (1). The Tax Court avoided deciding either of these contentions, yet sustained the respondent\u2019s determination by holding: (1) that there was nothing in the record to support a contention (although neither of the parties appears to have argued the point) that the properties transferred by petitioner in these transactions were held for productive use in its trade or business; that the property transferred in each instance was standing timber; and that while it might be argued that some of petitioner\u2019s timberlands were held for productive use under a reforestation program, such an argument is not applicable to mature timber; and (2) that petitioner\u2019s timber in each of the transactions was held by him primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business, and not for investment, and therefore came within the express exclusion of the language of Section 112(b) (1) reading: \u201c(not including stock in trade or other property held primarily for sale * * *).\u201d Hence the Court held that the transactions resulted in recognizable gains.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">Our affirmance of the Tax Court\u2019s ruling on Issue No. 1., sustains the Tax Court\u2019s ground No. 2., next above mentioned, for ruling against taxpayer on this Issue No. 3., namely, that the petitioner\u2019s timber in each of the transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>tions in question was held by him primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business. However, from a reading of the entire record, we have no doubt that the denial of tax-free exchange treatment to the transactions here in issue was justified also both upon the Tax Court\u2019s ground No. 1 above mentioned, and upon the further ground that, as contended by respondent, there were no bona fide exchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">ISSUES NO. 4. and NO. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">There were some 39 other sales during the years 1950 through 1953 of timber in which taxpayer retained an economic interest and the Commissioner allowed capital gains treatment under Section 117 (k) (2). These are unaffected by the Tax Court\u2019s rulings and not in issue on this appeal. However, the Tax Court found that none of the disputed sales, the gain from which it held to be ordinary income, qualified under Section 117(k) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Petitioner claims error in this respect, contending that certain of these sales were disposals of timber under contracts, by virtue of which the owner retained an economic interest in such timber. These sales are (1) the November 10, 1952, sale to J. L. Ledgett, (2) the Monroe Lumber Company transaction covering the Kendall timber and (3) the Yaquina Bay Mills, Inc., and Cascadia Lumber Company transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">(1) As to the Ledgett sale, we agree with the Tax Court that the timber sold to Ledgett was at a fixed price; that there was no contingency which would vary that price or Ledgett\u2019s obligation to pay it, and that the petitioner was not to be credited with any part of the timber removed or share in any income or profit Ledgett might derive from the removal and sale of the timber. The contract as drawn provided for $20,000 deferred payment with interest to petitioner as the timber was developed and removed from the tract, without reference to its sale. Petitioner later, to accommodate Ledgett, agreed to accept payment as the timber was sold. We agree with the Tax Court that this later agreement did not alter the fact that petitioner was not looking to the sale of the timber for his payments, and that the fact that petitioner could upon default elect to cancel the contract, was a provision for security of the deferred payments, and not the equivalent of the retention of an economic interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">(2) The Monroe Lumber Company-Kendall tract transactions involved the following facts. An agreement of February 10, 1950, provided for the sale of timber from petitioners to Monroe Lumber Co. of (1) timber (hereinafter and in the Tax Court decision called the Lincoln County property) on land owned by petitioners in Lincoln County, Oregon, and (2) timber (hereinafter and in the Tax Court\u2019s decision called the Kendall timber) on a piece of land then owned by Kendall, if as and when purchased by petitioner; and further provided that \u201cThis contract will not apply to the Kendall property until such time as the Kendall timber is acquired by the seller,\u201d and that if the said \u201cKendall property is not acquired by the seller within three (3) years from the date of this contract, then at the option of the buyer the Kendall property shall be eliminated from this contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">Some time between February 10, 1950, and September 30, 1951, the exact date of which is not disclosed by the record, taxpayer being unsuccessful in negotiations to purchase _ the Kendall timber which he had thought his brother-in-law Kendall had previously agreed to sell to taxpayer, Monroe Lumber Co. purchased the Kendall timber at taxpayer\u2019s suggestion for a total purchase price of $31,721. On September 30, 1951, Monroe Lumber Co. deeded the Kendall property to Wine-berg pursuant to a Supplemental Agreement between petitioners and Monroe Lumber Co., dated September 13, 1951. This supplemental agreement recited the execution of the February 10, 1950, contract, recited that at the time the 1950 contract was entered into the parties had contemplated that the seller (taxpayer herein) would acquire the Kendall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>timber for the benefit of both parties thereto, that Monroe Lumber Co. had acquired the timber in trust for the use and benefit of petitioner and further recited that all the timber on the Kendall property should be included in and considered a part of the timber sold by the contract of February 10, 1950. Respondent contended that with respect to the timber cut by Monroe Lumber Company on the Kendall tract petitioner had not held the timber for more than six months prior to the disposal thereof to the Monroe Lumber Company. As the Tax Court points out under Section 117(k) (2) I. R.C.1939, where timber is disposed of under a type of contract by virtue of which the owner retains an economic interest in such timber, it is required that the timber must have been held for more than six months prior to the disposal, and the Tax Court notes, and we agree, that this means that the date of disposal of the timber is the date the contract granting the cutting rights is entered into.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The Supplemental Agreement also recited that Monroe Lumber Co. had advanced for petitioner\u2019s benefit and paid to Kendall and others for said timber the said sum of $31,721; that the parties had now agreed that petitioner should reimburse Monroe in said amount and that Monroe should execute to petitioner a deed or deeds of all the timber on the Kendall property, with certain minor exceptions; that in consideration of the stated premises the Monroe Co. agreed to execute a deed or deeds to petitioner of all his interest in and to the down and standing merchantable timber located upon the Kendall property; that all timber on said property should be included and considered a part of the timber sold by seller to buyer under the timber contract of 1950, and that petitioner should agree that Monroe should charge petitioner\u2019s account with the said sum of $31,721 from monies due and to come due petitioner under the 1950 contract. This deduction was made and amounts in excess thereof for the cutting of timber on the Lincoln County property were paid by Monroe to petitioner in 1951, 1952, and 1953 and reported by petitioners as long-term capital gain for the respective years.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The respondent allowed capital gain treatment with respect to the amount in excess of $31,721, but held that the petitioners realized an additional unreported capital gain of $31,721 from the Lincoln County timber cutting in the taxable year of 1951, representing the purchase price of the Kendall timber paid by Monroe and deducted from the stumpage amounts then due and owing to petitioner by Monroe for the Lincoln County timber. The Tax Court held that if the contract of February 10, 1950, is considered a disposal by petitioner of the Kendall timber, it is obvious that petitioner had not held the timber for six months. On the other hand the Tax Court held that if we accept petitioner\u2019s contention that he acquired the Kendall timber when Monroe acquired it for his use and benefit, and consider the disposal of the timber to be on September 13, 1951, the date of the Supplemental Agreement, there is no showing that the timber had been held by petitioner for over six months at the date of its disposal, since the record fails to disclose on what date between February 10, 1950, and September 13, 1951, Monroe acquired the timber for petitioner\u2019s use and benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Thus, under the Tax Court\u2019s ruling, proof by taxpayer of one of the essentials for receiving the benefit of Section 117 (k) (2) \u2014 namely that the timber was \u201cheld for more than six months prior to such disposal\u201d is lacking, even if the contract was one under which the seller retained an economic intei-est in the timber. On the other hand, to the petitioner\u2019s contention that, since he received the Kendall Timber in exchange for like property held for investment, the holding period of the Kendall tract timber became that of the property for which it was exchanged, the Tax Court ruled that petitioner likewise could not establish the benefits of Section 112(b) (1) because the Tax Court\u2019s holding that the property was held primarily for sale excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>it from the benefits of Section 112(b) d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Accordingly the Tax Court sustained the respondent\u2019s determination that the gain from the sale of the Kendall timber was ordinary income for petitioner. We sustain the Tax Court both in its ruling that $31,721 was an unreported capital gain as to the Lincoln County property for the year 1951, and that all of the gain from the sale of the Kendall timber was ordinary income to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">With respect to the so-called production royalties from Yaquina Bay Mills, Inc., and Cascadia Lumber Co., the Tax Court sustained the respondent\u2019s contentions that petitioner had failed to prove that these production royalties were paid to petitioner by Cascadia Lumber Co. or Yaquina Bay Mills under the agreement between petitioner and those companies providing for payments with respect to lumber processed in their mills, and that petitioner had failed to establish that he had owned the timber, from which the lumber was processed, for a period of over six months. We affirm the ruling of the Tax Court reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">\u201cThere is attached to the agreement between petitioner and Yaquina Bay Mills, Inc., a list of properties covered by the agreement. However, the record is devoid of any evidence showing how long petitioner had held each of these properties or that the logs from which the lumber that was manufactured in the plants of Yaquina Bay Mills, Inc., and Cascadia Lumber Company came from any of these properties, or if any, from which. There is also no evidence to show petitioner\u2019s relationship with the contract or captive mills that produced many of the logs. For all the record shows the logs may have been the property of someone other than petitioner when they were delivered to the mills. Petitioner has failed to establish that the so-called production royalties are entitled to capital gains treatment under the provisions of section 117(k) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">ISSUE NO. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">Whether the Tax Court erred in holding that the taxpayer\u2019s sale of 675 shares of Yaquina Bay Mills stock in 1951 resulted in a short-term capital gain of $37,809 rather than a short-term capital loss of $10,000. &lt;</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">Without reciting the complicated details of the transactions involved in this issue, we sustain the result reached by the Tax Court, summarized by it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-16\">\u201cThe sale of the stock [meaning the May 1951 sale, there having been an earlier sale of other shares not in dispute] to George E. Miller Lumber Company was made in May 1951. A contract subsequently entered into solely for its effect on petitioner\u2019s tax liability is totally devoid of any business purpose. Such a contract is so lacking in substance that to recognize it for determining the price paid for the various shares of stock would be to \u2018exalt artifice above reality.\u2019 Gregory v. Helvering, 293 U.S. 465 [55 S.Ct. 266, 79 L.Ed. 596] (1935). Petitioner in May 1951 sold 975 shares of stock of Yaquina Bay Mills, Inc., for $172,500 or an average price per share of $176.92. Three hundred of these shares had been held by petitioner for more than six months and the gain thereon was properly reported as long term capital gain. Six hundred seventy-five of these shares with a cost basis of $81,000 had been held by petitioner for less than 6 months and the gain thereon in the amount of $37,809 was short-term capital gain.\u201d (Transcript p. 190.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-18\">ISSUE NO. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-19\">We also sustain the Tax Court\u2019s ruling in holding that an amount the taxpayer received in 1950 for the use of a road was rent for the granting of a 10-year lease, rather than proceeds from the sale of an interest in land, and was taxable when received. Hyde Park Real<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ty v. Commissioner, 211 F.2d 462 (C.A. 2, 1954) and Commissioner v. Lyon, 97 F.2d 70 (C.A. 9, 1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">ISSUE NO. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">As to the issue of whether a payment of $5,000 made by petitioner dated January 8, 1953, in favor of the Sacred Heart Church was a charitable contribution to 'that church, we agree that the evidence is ample to sustain the conclusion of the Tax Court to the effect that taxpayer agreed to pay $5,000 to the church if he should be given preferential treatment in buying certain timber and timberlands; that he was given such preferential treatment in being selected purchaser of the property, so that the price which would otherwise have been charged for the timber and timberland was reduced by approximately $5,000 because of the payment denominated as a contribution, and that therefore the payment was not a charitable contribution under Section 23 (o) (2) of the Code. While the Tax Court cited, as authority for its ruling on this point, Estate of O. J. Wardwell, 35 T.C. 433 (1960) then on appeal and since reversed in Wardwell\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner (8 Cir. 1962) 301 F.2d 632, the facts of the present case nevertheless distinguish it even from the Wardwell case and support the result reached by the Tax Court. We find the conclusion also supported by such eases as DeJong v. Commissioner (C.A. 9, 1962) 309 F.2d 373 and Commissioner v. Duberstein (1960) 363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Finding no error in the Tax Court\u2019s decision, we affirm the same in toto.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1939:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">\u00a7 22.

Is there substantial evidence to support the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the taxpayer was regularly engaged in the business of selling timber in the years 1950 through 1953, and that timber sold in the disputed transactions in those years was held primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business, so that the gain from those sales constituted ordinary income under Section 22(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, rather than capital gain within the meaning of Section 117 (a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">2.

In this connection the Tax Court stated among other things, Transcript p. 169:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlB\">\u201cWhat constitutes a trade or business is a question of fact. Many factors have been considered by the courts in the determination of this question, among them, the nature of the acquisition of the property, the frequency and continuity of transactions over a period of time as distinguished from isolated transactions, substantiality of transactions, and the activity of the seller with respect to the property. William E. Starke, 35 T.C. 18, 26 (1960) and cases there cited, on appeal (C.A.9, Jan. 19, 1961). Considering all the evidence herein and particularly the numerous sales made by petitioner, the high percentage of his total income derived from such sales, his own participation in the sales activity, and the lack of any other occupation which consumed a substantial portion of his working time, all as set forth in some detail in our findings, we hold that petitioner was engaged in the trade or business of selling timber during the taxable years here involved. Since none of the adjustments made by respondent involves sales of timberlands, it is unnecessary to pass on the question whether sales of timberlands were also a part of petitioner\u2019s trade or business in the years here involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\">. The cases of Starke v. Commissioner, (9 Cir. 1963) 312 F.2d 608, and Austin v. Commissioner, (9 Cir. 1959) 263 F.2d 460, are heavily relied upon by petitioners. In each it was undisputed that the taxpayer had a prime full-time profession which he was actively pursuing as an attorney, and there was definitely less activity or \u201cbusy-ness\u201d on the taxpayer\u2019s part in connection with the sale of real estate than in this case, where it could well be said that activities connected with the purchase of timberlands and the sale of timber accounted for the prime \u201cbusy-ness\u201d of the taxpayer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b245-13\">. Transcript, p. 171: \u201cThere is no affirmative evidence with respect to any property which petitioner sold during the taxable years here involved to show that petitioner held it for some specific reason as an investment. The fact that petitioner followed a practice of selling the timber and retaining the timberland is some indication that some of his timberlands might have been held for investment, but the evidence does not show such to be the case as to any of the timber sales in the years here involved. There is no evidence of any particular instances in which petitioner refused to sell a property or treated one property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>as being in a class or category different from his other properties. The only evidence in this connection offered by petitioner was the testimony of petitioner, himself, that he acquired all the various properties held by him for investment purposes and that he owned some properties that he would be unwilling to sell at any price. Petitioner\u2019s actions in selling numerous tracts of timber in the years here involved indicate that his idea of holding his properties for investment is holding them for resale when he can find a customer willing to pay a price that he is willing to accept for the properties. This is not holding of property for investment. Curtis Co., 23 T.C. 740, 755 (1955), reversed on another issue, 232 F.2d 167 (C.A.3, 1956).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\"><em>. </em>From Senate Report No. 627, 78th Congress on H.R. 3687 (as quoted on Cum. Bull. 1944, 973 at p. 993): \u201cTour committee is of the opinion that various timber owners are seriously handicapped under the Federal income and excess profits tax laws. The law discriminates against taxpayers who dispose of timber by cutting it as compared with those who sell timber outright. The income realized from the cutting of timber is now taxed as ordinary income at full income and excess profits tax rates and not at capital gain rates. In short, if the taxpayer cuts his own timber he loses the benefit of the capital gain rate which applies when he sells the same timber outright to another. Similarly, owners who sell their timber on a so-called cutting contract under which the owner retains an economic interest in the property are held to have leased their property and are therefore not accorded under present law capital gains treatment of any increase in value realized over the depletion basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">\u201cIn order to remedy this situation, it is proposed to amend the existing law as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">\u201cIf the taxpayer so elects upon his return, the cutting of timber during the year by the taxpayer who owns or has a contract right to cut such timber is treated as a sale or exchange of the timber cut during the year and such cut timber is considered property used in a trade or business of the taxpayer for the purpose of section 117 (j) of the Internal Revenue Code provided the taxpayer has owned such timber or held such contract right for a period of more than six months prior to the beginning of such year. Where such an election is made, gain or loss to the taxpayer is recognized in an amount equal to the difference between the adjusted basis for depletion of such timber in the hands of the taxpayer and the fair market value of such timber. The fair market value is determined as of the first day of the taxable year in which the timber is cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">\u201cThe election which is made is binding on the taxpayer with respect to all timber which he owns or which he has a contract right to cut and is also made binding for all subsequent years unless the Commissioner, upon the showing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>undue hardship, permits the taxpayer to revoke his election.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">\u201cIf an owner of timber disposes of it under a contract by virtue of which he retains an economic interest in such timber, the amount received by such owner is to be treated in a similar manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">\u201cThis latter provision will afford relief to those who have leased their property under a contract whereby they retain an economic interest in the timber and are not entitled under the present law to capital gains treatment because of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">\u201cThe amendments made by your committee are effective as to taxable years beginning after December \"31, 1943, except with respect to the amendment dealing with the owner who has leased his property and who retains an economic interest in the timber. The latter amendment is effective as if it were a part of the Internal Revenue Code and of each prior revenue law on the date of its enactment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b247-17\">.
