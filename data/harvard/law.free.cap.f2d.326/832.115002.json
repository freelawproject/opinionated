The National Labor Relations Board has filed this petition to enforce its order of January 15, 1962<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2against Respondent, an Ohio corporation operating a plant in Odessa, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-23\">Respondent began operating this newly built plant in Odessa, Texas in October, 1957, and the facts touching the alleged failure to bargain will be taken up first. The Company\u2019s operating procedures, wages and other conditions of employment for hourly personnel were contained in a pamphlet published by the Company known as the Redbook. The Company employed in September, 1957 an industrial relations manager to study and recommend changes in the Redbook. After some study of the Redbook, the manager proposed several changes. However, during this time the Union began organizational activities and the Company felt it would be unwise to make unilateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>changes in the Redbook practices as long as the prospect of bargaining with the Union existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">January 28, 1960, the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 826-AFL-CIO, won a Board-conducted election, and it was, on February 5, 1960, certified by the Board as the bargaining representative of the production and maintenance employees and laboratory technicians at the Odessa plant. The parties bargained from March 17 to September 14, 1960, meeting eighteen times without reaching a final agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The Union presented its only written proposal at the opening conference on March 17th, wherein it wanted to change many of Respondent\u2019s Redbook practices and also to institute new practices. During the first four meetings the parties discussed the Union\u2019s demands, its justification for the demands, and the Company\u2019s initial position with respect to the various demands. Beginning April 20th at the fifth meeting, the Company made a series of counter offers to the Union. The Company supported its proposals and arguments with facts which were not in general denied by the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The Company\u2019s first proposal sought to maintain its Redbook practices or to reach a compromise between the Red-book and the Union demands. The series of proposals offered by the Company were thereafter discussed in detail by both sides. Following the initial counter-proposals, the Company made numerous written and oral changes in its counter-proposals, adjusting its demands in an effort to reach a form acceptable to the Union. There were thirty-eight instances where Respondent adjusted its proposals in striving to induce the Union to agree. Gradually, the Company lowered its initial proposals, reducing the Red-book benefits until there was only a slight difference between the Redbook and what the Union had originally proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">During this negotiation, the Company made numerous <em>concessions</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to the Union beyond what its Redbook had originally provided. As the result of these discussions, concessions and reasonable arguments, the parties made substantial progress towards reaching an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Based upon the facts above outlined, the Examiner found that the Company had been guilty of \u00a7 8(a) (5) violations, based chiefly upon the Company\u2019s refusal to agree to a dues check-off clause in the contract. We do not think the conclusion of the Examiner was justified by substantial evidence. There is no disagreement between the parties as to the applicable law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">On the other hand, the evidence clearly shows, in our opinion, that the employer here did enter and carry on discussions with respect to collective bargaining \u201cwith an open and fair mind, and a sincere purpose to find a basis of agreement touching wages and hours and conditions of employment.\u201d The Company was no novice in conducting negotiations such as those involved in this record, and neither was the Union. The Company repeatedly stated that it would not agree to a dues check-off clause, contending that the collection of dues was a Union obligation. The Company started out with a written memorandum of its employee relationships as it desired them to be. It retreated from a large number of the provisions of the Redbook. It made counter-proposals both in writing and orally, and discussed fully each and every contention of the Union, throughout making known its attitude with respect to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>The reduction by the Union of its \u201cmust\u201d items from seventy-nine to four shows that it was making use of these items as aids to bargaining, and it is apparent that the Union did not, in most instances, expect to induce the employer to give up its convictions and practices as to them. The same is true of the dues check-off clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">We think that the conclusion of the Examiner that the Company was not open and sincere in its effort to come to terms with the Union is without basis in the evidence. The fact is that the Union is the party which abandoned negotiations and resorted to the coercive device of a strike. The Company, on the other hand, suffered an actual strike, thus emphasizing its honest adherence to the basic principles relied on by it through the bargaining sessions. The Company\u2019s willingness to go into actual strike conditions and the contrasting prompt abandonment of the strike tended to demonstrate sincerity on the part of the Company and that the Union was resorting to bluffing tactics throughout the negotiations. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the finding by the Examiner that the Company had refused to bargain collectively in good faith with the Union was not justified by any substantial evidence in the record and was based upon speculation and suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">We think, moreover, that the action of the majority of the Board in affirming the findings and conclusions of the Examiner on this aspect of the complaint was not based upon substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">We are impressed with the analysis of the evidence and the conclusions of the dissenting member of the three-man panel, and we reproduce in the margin excerpts from the dissenting opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Likewise, we think that the action of the majority of the Board in reversing the findings and conclusions of the Examiner as to the alleged \u00a7 8(a) (3) violations were not based upon substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">Respondent, earlier in the year and in keeping with its established practice, contracted with the H. B. Stone Construction Company to furnish supplemental labor for construction work in vacation relief. The Union discussed this agreement during the bargaining period, and did not object to it. During the strike the Company contracted with the Dresser Engineers Company for supplemental labor; and when Dresser began furnishing certain temporary manpower, the Respondent and Stone canceled their contract. As a result of the cancellation, five men employed under the Stone contract were not permitted in the plant. About a month after the strike, Respondent informed Dresser that these five men were available for work and, as a result, Dresser employed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">The General Counsel failed to support the allegations in its complaint, as amended, that Alfredo Do La Cruz Julian Campos, Jose Garcia, Thomas Mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>reno, and Jesus Alvarez were discriminated against in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) when they were denied entrance to Respondent\u2019s plant because Respondent had canceled its contract with Stone.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">We feel that a majority of the Board was in error when it held that these men were participating in an unfair labor practice strike and were entitled to reinstatement upon their conditional application to return to work. Some of these alleged discriminatees were included within the bargaining unit. It should also be noted that the status of these individuals was established by agreement which the Respondent had with Stone. This agreement provided that Stone, for a stated compensation including wages and overriding percentage, was to furnish Respondent with laborers. Pursuant to this agreement, Stone hired these five men, placed them on his payroll and set them to work at Respondent\u2019s plant. While at work they were under the Respondent\u2019s control to the extent that they could be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The Trial Examiner and the Board found these men to be employees of the Respondent. We do not think it necessary to decide this precise issue. The mere act of refusing re-employment is not enough to sustain the \u00a7 8(a) (3) charge. Anti-union discrimination is the essential ingredient. There is no evidence that the contract with Stone was used either before or during the strike as an anti-union weapon or a sham. The Stone contract was canceled on September 21, the day before the strike ended. Stone, the immediate \u201cemployer\u201d of these five men no longer had any responsibility for supplying labor. If the contract was fully effective to make the laborers employees of Stone, rather than Respondent, the refusal to allow them in the plant was unquestioned. But if, as argued, under the total circumstances the men were for purposes of the Labor Relations Act employees of Respondent, there is \u25a0nothing to show that failure of Respondent to recognize such \u201crights\u201d to employment was anything more than a mistaken judgment on what is, at best, a difficult, troublesome legal question for even the most skilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">There was no evidence in the record that the Respondent\u2019s actions resulted from discriminatory motives. It should be noted that the Respondent, after the strike, referred these men to Dresser for similar employment. The petition for enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-24\">. 135 NLRB No. 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-7\">, The Company agreed to such items (among others) as (1) a complete grievance procedure to be concluded by arbitration; (2) a more liberal funeral leave provision; (3) a more liberal qualification period for jury service pay; and (4) to maintain earnings for a week when temporarily transferred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b915-13\">.

The record shows that representatives of the Respondent and the Union first met on March 17, 1960, and that 17 negotiating sessions were held thereafter. Throughout these sessions the Respondent submitted proposals and counter-proposals in an effort to arrive at a contract. Evidence of the Respondent\u2019s good faith bargaining efforts is found in the progress made during these negotiating sessions. For example, at the eighth meeting held on May <em>24, </em>I960, the Union presented a list of 79 \u2018must\u2019 items, which it maintained had to be included in the contract. Through the give and take of bargaining, the Union\u2019s second \u2018must\u2019 list, which was presented at the twelfth session on June 23, 1960, was reduced to 46 items. Through further negotiations, the \u2018must\u2019 list was reduced to 26 items as of the sixteenth session held on September 7, 1960, and the Respondent, at the next meeting held on September 13, 1960, offered to compromise on nine of these items.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">\u201cI would find, therefore, that while the bargaining negotiations between Respondent and the Union were hard and long, the Respondent bargained in good faith.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
