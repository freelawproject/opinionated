Owen in May, 1961; that Owen represented himself as being a representative of the Tensaw Company; that during the course of his stay, he moved his family onto the premises, refusing to pay rent; that his conduct became intolerable; that appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Frank and John Boykin refused to permit appellants to move Owen; and that Owen was in fact a representative of the Ten-saw Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Further, it is averred that, in December, 1959, appellants expended fifty thousand dollars for repair and maintenance of the leased property; that, at the same time, appellants entered into an agreement with Arthur and Mary Andresen under which they would operate a pleasure boat, the \u201cFROLIC\u201d; that, on August 28, 1961, John Boykin, Ocelo Boy-kin and the Tensaw Company filed suits in Baldwin County, Alabama against appellants; that John Boykin\u2019s suit was for a five hundred dollar note he claimed he paid for appellants, when, in fact, he did not pay the note; that Ocelo Boykin sued for six hundred dollars on a land deal he claimed appellants owed him, when, in fact, there was no such indebtedness; and that the Tensaw Company filed suit for one hundred twenty-five dollars claiming rent due by appellants. As a result of these suits, it is charged that all of appellant\u2019s personal property was attached by the county sheriff, Taylor Wilkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">It is further averred that, in consequence of the attachments, appellant and her children, in August, 1961, were forced off the property; that on September 15, 1961, appellant returned to see if the sheriff was keeping the property in a safe manner; that at this time, she was arrested for disturbing the peace and placed in jail until the following day; that appellee Judge R. Stewart, acting under color of his office as County Judge of Baldwin County, Alabama, held a trial; and that he was then under the control of the other appellees. Judge Stewart ordered appellant exiled from the county or face a jail sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">The District Court found that the appellant did not state a cause of action under the Civil Rights Statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. After a careful examination of the record we find that the holding of the lower court is correct. Cf. Simmons v. Whitaker, 5 Cir., 1958, 252 F.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
