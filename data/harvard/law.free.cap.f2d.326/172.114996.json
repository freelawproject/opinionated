L. R. B. v. Miranda Fuel Co., 284 F.2d 861. We granted enforcement but not on the theory advanced by the Board, as will be more fully explained below. After the Union applied to the Supreme Court for certiorari that Court decided Local 357, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America v. N. L. R. B., 1961, 365 U.S. 667, 81 S.Ct. 835, 6 L.Ed. 2d 11. The Board thereupon requested that the proceedings theretofore had in Miranda be vacated and the case remanded to the Board. This was done, Local 553, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America v. N. L. R. B., 1961, 366 U.S. 763, 81 S.Ct. 1670, 6 L.Ed.2d 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-23\">We repeat the statement of facts from our former opinion, with certain addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>tions. Lopuch\u2019s loss of seniority arose in the following manner. In April 1957, Lopuch had been employed as a truck driver by the Company, a seller of fuel oil, for approximately eight or nine years. He then enjoyed the eleventh position on a seniority list of approximately twenty-one. About the beginning of April 1957, Lopuch spoke to Jerry and Fred Miranda, chief officers of the Company, and told them he wished to spend the summer in Ohio and do some work for his sister-in-law, whose husband had just died. The period from April 15 to October 15 was a slack season in the fuel oil business, and was so designated in Section 8 of the collective bargaining agreement between the Union and the Company, quoted below. Lopuch obtained permission to leave at the close of business on Friday, April 12, 1957. He told his employers he would return by October 12. In mid-October, however, Lopuch became ill, and he did not return to work until October 30. The illness was evidenced by a doctor\u2019s certificate, and the late return was excused by the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Shortly after his return, the Union, at the urging of various of its members, demanded that the Company reduce Lopuch to the foot of the seniority list, on the ground that his late return violated Section 8 of the collective bargaining agreement. The relevant portion of that Section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">\u201cDuring the slack season, April 15 to October 15, any employee who according to seniority would not have steady employment shall be entitled to a leave of absence and maintain his full seniority rights during that period. Any man so described must report to the Shop Steward not later than 8 A.M. on October 15 and sign the seniority roster in order to protect his seniority, and the Employer agrees to accept the certification of said Shop Steward as to availability of such men when called by the Employer. If October 15 falls on Saturday or Sunday, the reporting day shall be the next work day. Any man failing to report as above specified shall forfeit all seniority rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">When the Union discovered that Lopuch\u2019s failure to return to work on time was because of an excused illness, it abandoned the claim that he be dropped from seniority because of a late return to work. Instead, it insisted that he be reduced in seniority because he had left work before April 15. Jerry Miranda, who did not think that Lopuch\u2019s early departure would cause any loss of seniority when he gave permission to leave on April 12, was reluctant to agree to this request. However, he acquiesced in the Union\u2019s demand that Lopuch be dropped to the botton of the seniority list.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Lopuch was a member of the Union, and there is nothing in the record that has been called to our attention to indicate that Lopuch had been disloyal to the Union, or had been guilty of any acts detrimental to the Union, or in any way transgressed the rules or policies of the Union. Nor is there anything to indicate he was regarded by the Union officials as a troublemaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">While the strict legal construction of Section 8 of the collective bargaining agreement, as held by us on the prior appeal, 284 F.2d at page 863, required a forfeiture of seniority only for failure to return on time, the purpose of Section 8 was to eliminate fluctuations of seasonal employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">Merely because the Union first relied upon Lopuch\u2019s late return, and then, after it was established that the late return was due to illness, placed its request for demotion upon Lopuch\u2019s early leaving, with the employer\u2019s consent, we are told by the Board that the demotion was due to \u201cwhim or caprice,\u201d that it constituted action by the Union, acquiesced in by the Company, that was \u201chostile\u201d and for \u201cirrelevant, unfair or invidious reasons,\u201d and that it consequently was a breach of the duty of the Union to act fairly and impartially in its representative capacity under Section 9 of the Act. From this so-called \u201cunlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>discrimination\u201d it is supposed to follow that Lopuch\u2019s rights under Section 7 were infringed. On the basis of this reasoning the Board concluded that the Union and the Company were respectively guilty of violations of Section 8(b) (1) (A) and (2) and Section 8(a) (1) and (3). The remedy applied was to restore Lopuch to his former position on the drivers\u2019 seniority roster, with back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Thus the law question, lying at the heart of the case, is whether any sort of discrimination against an employee, affecting the terms and conditions of his employment, can constitute an unfair labor practice under Section 8, even if wholly unrelated to any union considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We are assisted in our deliberations upon this ease by very helpful and well-documented briefs by the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America (AFL-CIO), as <em>amici curiae.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">On the subject of fair and impartial representation the Board insists upon the <em>per se </em>approach. Like all clich\u00e9s and short cuts in the law, designed to make life easy for the judicial officer who has to make the decisions, this merely eliminates the thinking process necessary to get at the root of the matter. Did both the Union and the Company believe in good faith that Section 8 of the collective bargaining agreement, fairly interpreted, meant that an employee, who was entitled to a leave of absence between April 15 and October 15 to \u201cmaintain his full seniority rights during that period,\u201d forfeited such rights by taking a longer leave of absence? If so, it is difficult to perceive any \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against Lopuch, as this interpretation, which seems to us far from unreasonable, particularly if made by laymen and not by lawyers, taking into consideration the purpose of said Section 8, applies equally to all employees, union and non-union alike. And yet there are no findings whatever on this subject in the record, either with respect to the Union or the Company, by the Trial Examiner or by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Thus, even if we were disposed to agree with the Board on the principal law question in the case, we would disagree with its conclusion that the Union, on the meager facts in the record, had taken against Lopuch \u201chostile action, for irrelevant, unfair or invidious reasons,\u201d and we would feel constrained to remand the case to the Board for the taking of further evidence and the making of additional findings of fact. In other words, having requested the Supreme Court to vacate the proceedings already had, and then having adopted an entirely new approach to the case on the basis of issues not previously litigated, the Board insisted upon pursuing its <em>per se </em>theory and took no further proofs but made a new decision on the basis of the old record. We cannot approve of this.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Further proceedings, however, will be wholly unnecessary if we adopt, as we shall, the view of the dissenting members of,the Board to the effect that discrimination for reasons wholly unrelated to \u201cunion membership, loyalty, the acknowledgment of union authority, or the performance of union obligations,\u201d is not sufficient to support findings of violations of Sections 8(a) (3), 8(a) (1), 8(b) (2) and 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq., as amended. Accordingly, we turn to the discussion of the considerations affecting our decision of that controlling question of interpretation of the Act, and especially of Sections 7, 8 and 9, including the various subsections and subdivisions thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">The issue is indeed a narrow one. Section 7 describes the rights of employees \u201cto form, join, or assist labor organizations,\u201d to bargain collectively, and to refrain from such activities, except when required to join a union by the terms of a lawful agreement. It is an unfair labor practice for an employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>under Section 8(a) (1), and for a union under Section 8(b) (1), to interfere with the exercise by an employee of his Section 7 rights. It is also an unfair labor practice for an employer under Section 8(a) (3), and for a union under Section 8(b) (2), to discriminate \u201cin regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization\u201d or to cause such discrimination. Furthermore, subject to the provisions of Section 9(a), it is an unfair labor practice for an employer under Section 8(a) (5) and for a union under Section 8(b) (3) to refuse to bargain collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">As the various ways to discriminate against a person, or to be unfair or unjust to him, are legion, it would seem at first blush that the bearing of Sections 7 and 8 above described is intended to affect only union considerations. Another way of stating the same thing is to say that, to constitute an unfair labor practice under Section 8, the union or the employer must have committed some act the natural and foreseeable consequence of which is to be beneficial or detrimental to the union. The classic way of describing such effect in the typical case is to say that the act in question \u201cencouraged union membership as such.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">But here the placing of Lopuch at the bottom of the seniority list, even if done through sheer whim or caprice, and even if arbitrary, unjust and \u201cinvidious,\u201d whatever that may mean in the context of the facts of this case, could not conceivably have been thought to encourage union membership, because his demotion affected union and nonunion men alike. Indeed, the foreseeable effect, in the context of this case and the terms of Section 8 of the collective bargaining agreement, could only be \u201cto encourage timely return and continuous work until the annual layoff, the identical objective which prompted the contract provision,\u201d as pointed out by the dissenting members of the Board. Thus the Board on reconsideration of the case pursuant to the mandate of the Supreme Court conceived the ingenious, but as we think wholly erroneous theory that any sort of discrimination, unfairness or injustice to an employee, by the Union and acquiesced in by the employer, constituted a breach by the Union of the fiduciary duty implicit in Section 9 to represent the employee fairly, and an unfair labor practice by both the Union and the employer under Sections 8(a) (3), 8(a) (1), 8(b) (2), and 8(b) (1) (A). Accordingly, the single narrow question of law in the case boils down to whether it was the intent of the Congress to read into Section 7 and Section 8 the duty of fair representation implicit in Section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">We pause to observe that, against the background of the present nationwide interest in discrimination for reasons of race, nationality, color or religion, and the natural tendency of human beings to attribute their lack of success to discrimination of one kind or another against them, it seems inevitable that the Board would be inundated with charges of this character, were we to sustain the ruling of the Board in this ease. The briefs of the NAACP and the Civil Liberties Union, as <em>amici curiae, </em>appear to assume that it is in the public interest to have such controversies channeled into the Board, where the remedy of reinstatement with back pay may be afforded, rather than leave them for decision by the courts. We are not so sure of this. See Cunningham v. Erie Railroad Company, 2 Cir., 1959, 266 F.2d 411. In any event, such matters of policy must be settled and determined by the Congress. In this case our task is not to fix policy but to interpret the statute and say what we think the Congress intended it to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The decision of the Board in this case is the first and only one holding that discrimination, by way of unfair representation arising out of Section 9, constitutes a series of unfair labor practices under Section 8. We think a word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>or two on the subject of how the Board came to make such a ruling is appropriate by way of introduction to a discussion of the miscellaneous teachings of textwriters and the excerpts from numerous opinions of the courts that are relied upon by the parties and the <em>amici curiae </em>in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">When the case was last before us the Board took the view that Section 8 of the collective bargaining agreement vested in the Union exclusive control over the seniority status of the Company\u2019s drivers, and that this was a <em>perse v</em>iolation. We did not agree with this contention, N. L. R. B. v. Miranda Fuel Co., supra, 2 Cir., 1960, 284 F.2d 861, but held instead that the Union and the Company had violated the statute by reducing Lopuch\u2019s seniority without warrant for such action in the terms of Section 8 of the collective bargaining agreement, and that such reduction in seniority \u201cconstituted a delegation of power over seniority rights which improperly encouraged union membership and discriminated against the employee Lopuch,\u201d 284 F.2d at page 863. After the Union filed a petition for certiorari, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Local 357, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America v. N. L. R. B., 1961, 365 U.S. 667, 81 S.Ct. 835, 6 L.Ed.2d 11, discussed below. It is clear to us that this decision eliminated any probability that the Board\u2019s original <em>per se </em>theory would find favor with the Supreme Court. And so the Board requested the Supreme Court to vacate the proceedings already had and to remand the case to the Board. The Board, however, as we have said, was not interested in getting at the real reasons and motives of the parties in connection with Lopuch\u2019s demotion and the interpretation given by the parties to Section 8 of the collective bargaining contract. It <em>was </em>interested in establishing some soft of <em>per se </em>violations in this type of case. That is how the Board came up with the novel, if not quite revolutionary, theory that any \u201chostile\u201d action by a union against one of its members \u201cfor irrelevant, unfair or invidious reasons,\u201d in which action <em>the </em>employer acquiesces, and which \u201cad<em>versely </em>affects (the) terms and conditions of employment,\u201d constitutes a breach of the statutory duty of the union to be a fair and impartial representative, also \u201crestrains and coerces the affected employees in the exercise of their guaranteed Section 7 right to bargain collectively through their chosen agent\u201d and thus violates Section 8(b) (1) (A) and Section 8(a) (1). Further ramifications of the theory need not be described. This is the gist of it. Were we to support the doctrine thus propounded the power and jurisdiction of the Board would be vastly extended and increased; and it would seem that such jurisdiction would be primary and the courts would be entirely excluded from the adjudication of such cases. That is what makes the case so interesting and important.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Petitioner, in support of its order, relies upon numerous decisions stating in general terms the proposition that a union, as representative of a certain class or craft of workers owes those whom it represents a duty of fair representation. Most of these cases arose under the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq., as amended, and, consequently, could not and did not hold that a mere failure on the part of a union fairly to represent the workers constituted an unfair labor practice within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act, in the absence of discrimination that encourages or discourages membership in a labor organization. Moreover, in the cases thus relied upon by the Board, the violation of the duty of fair representation was held to give rise to a <em>remedy </em>enforceable by the courts, specifically stated to be by way of injunctive relief or an award of damages. See, e. g., Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad, 1944, 323 U.S. 192, 65 S.Ct. 226, 89 L.Ed. 173; Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, 1944, 323 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>U.S. 210, 65 S.Ct. 235, 89 L.Ed. 187; Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Howard, 1952, 343 U.S. 768, 72 S.Ct. 1022, 96 L.Ed. 1283; Ferro v. Railway-Express Agency, 2 Cir., 1961, 296 F.2d 847; Thompson v. Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, 4 Cir., 1963, 316 F.2d 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\">Turning to the NLRB cases relied upon by petitioner we find each of them distinguishable. For example, in Wallace Corporation v. N. L. R. B., 1944, 323 U.S. 248, 65 S.Ct. 238, 89 L.Ed. 216, decided before the 1947 Amendments to the NLRA and, therefore, raising different issues, the discrimination was plainly an unfair labor practice because based on prior affiliation with a particular union.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In International Union of Electrical Radio and Mach. Workers, AFL-CIO, Frigidaire, Local 801 v. N. L. R. B., 1962, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 342, 307 F.2d 679, cert, denied, 371 U.S. 936, 83 S.Ct. 307, 9 L.Ed.2d 270, an employee was discharged for failure to join a union as required by the collective bargaining agreement. The Act declares such discrimination to be an unfair labor practice, except in specified circumstances. The issue before the court was whether the exceptional circumstances were present, and resolution of this issue depended upon the narrow question of whether the union had fulfilled the obligations of fair dealing owed to an employee who had made a reasonable effort \u201cto tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership\u201d as provided in Sections 8(a) (3) and 8(b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Two textwriters give some support to petitioner\u2019s view. Professor Archibald Cox, now Solicitor General, expressed views in 1957, The Duty of Fair Representation, 2 Villanova L.Rev. 151, that seem to do little more than bring the pros and cons of the question to the attention of those interested in the subject, so the issue might not \u201cgo by default unless pressed more vigorously upon an early occasion.\u201d Professor Michael I. Sovern, in The National Labor Relations Act and Racial Discrimination, 1962, 62 Colum.L.Rev. 563, reasons to the effect that where the union causes the discharge of a non-union employee because he is a Negro \u201cthe Negro workers are likely to assume that if they could only join the union, they would be allowed to work,\u201d at page 570. See also pp. 587-9, 590-4, 608-13. Moreover, even if the principles supported in these Law Review articles were articulated in the same form as those expressed by petitioner in its decision in this case, they are contrary to the holdings of the adjudicated cases discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The Legislative History of the NLRA is not particularly illuminating on the issue before us. If anything the various expressions of Congressional intent would seem to indicate that the duty of the union to bargain as set forth in Section 8(b) (3) is merely the counterpart of the employer\u2019s duty to bargain, expressed in Section 8(a) (5), and does not in this context impose an additional duty of fair representation. Cf. 93 Cong.Rec. 4021 (1947), 2 NLRB, Leg. Hist.L.M.R.A., 1947 at 1025. Moreover, we think the remark of Congressman Hartley, 93 Cong.Rec. 3425 (1947), 1 NLRB, Leg.Hist.L.M.R.A., 1947 at 616, to the effect that Section 8(b) (3) requires the union to represent the workingman \u201cwithout discriminating against him for any reason, even if he is not a member of the union,\u201d refers rather plainly to discrimination between members and non-members of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">We conclude that the authorities relied on by petitioner give little support for the novel principle sought to be established. The case against petitioner, however, is, we think, impressive and all but compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\"> To begin with, this case seems to be controlled by our recent decision in N. L. R. B. v. Local 294, International <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Brotherhood of Teamsters, 2 Cir., 1968, 817 F.2d 746, in which after examining the authorities, we concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201cThe union does not commit an unfair labor practice merely because it causes or attempts to cause an employer to promote or demote an employee or to discriminate for or against him. In Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, 345 U.S. 330, 73 S.Ct. 681, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953), discrimination in seniority which was adopted at the behest of the union was found unexceptionable. In Aeronautical Industrial District Lodge 727 v. Campbell, 337 U.S. 521, 69 S.Ct. 1287, 93 L.Ed. 1513 (1949), the Court gave its approval to super-seniority for union officials which was, of course, a practice proposed by the union. Local 357, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, etc. v. N. L. R. B., 365 U.S. 667, 81 S.Ct. 835, 6 L.Ed.2d 11 (1961), held that it was not an unfair labor practice for a union to cause the discharge of an employee because he was hired ahead of other men to whom the union had assigned preference. See also Alvado v. General Motors Corp., 303 F.2d 718(2d Cir.), cert, denied, 371 U.S. 925, 83 S.Ct. 293, 9 L.Ed.2d 233 (1962).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201cThese authorities establish the principle that a union does not violate Section 8(b) (2) unless the discrimination which the union seeks would constitute a violation of Section 8(a) (3) if the employer acted without union suggestion or compulsion. Section 8(b) (2) is violated only by causing or attempting to cause \u2018an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of [Section 8(a) (3)]\u2019. An employer who discriminates among employees does not violate Section 8(a) (3) unless the discrimination is based upon union membership or other union-connected activities. It is obvious, for example, that the employer\u2019s promotion or the demotion of an employee who is a union official is not a violation of the Act unless the discrimination for or against him is based on his union activity. It seems to us to be equally obvious that the union\u2019s seeking such a promotion or demotion would not constitute an unfair labor practice if the union\u2019s action was based upon the employee\u2019s merit or demerit and was unconnected with his union membership or activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">\u201cThe conclusion of the Board that an employer commits an unfair labor practice if he changes an employee\u2019s conditions of employment at the instance of the union, is not only contrary to the letter and spirit of the Act and to the precedents, but is based on a view of labor-management policy which is certain to have untoward consequences. There are countless situations in which the very concept of collective action demands that unions have the power to influence the employer to make changes in the job status of individual employees. To hold that unions cannot properly press upon an employer their demands for an employee\u2019s advancement or demotion would be to weaken greatly the union\u2019s effectiveness in representing all the employees in a unit. The policy of the Board is all the more mistaken if it is based upon disapproval of the union\u2019s motives in the instant case. Not only is the Board without authority to pass upon the wisdom or the desirability of a union\u2019s actions as long as those actions are not forbidden by the Act, but the principle applied by the Board would be equally applicable to actions which are clearly beneficial to the majority of employees. See Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, and Aeronautical Industrial District Lodge 727 v. Campbell, supra.\u201d [At 748, 749 and 751, of 317 F.2d, footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>We agree with the reasoning of the opinion just quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Indeed, we do not see how any other view is compatible with the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Local 357, International. Brotherhood of Teamsters Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America v. N. L. R. B., supra, 1961, 365 U.S. 667, 81 S.Ct. 835, 6 L.Ed.2d 11, the ease that led to the remand of Miranda to the Board for further proceedings. In effect the court there held that practically everything a union does encourages union membership, and that it is necessary in a particular case to show that the acts complained of were done with the unlawful intent and purpose of encouraging employees to join the union. It is not enough merely to show that the employer discriminated among employees at the behest of the union. An unfair labor practice has been committed only if the discrimination was deliberately designed to encourage membership in the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The result we thus reach is, we think, the only one consistent with the fundamental scheme of the Unfair Labor Practices portion of the National Labor Relations Act. This basic purpose, as we see it, relates to the interrelationship between employers and labor organizations on the one hand, and the interrelationship between labor organizations and union and non-union employees, on the other, all in a perfectly plain context of the effect of such interrelationships, and activities of one kind and another arising out of such interrelationships, on unions and on union membership. The machinery of the Board and the remedies applied in the enforcement of findings of unfair labor practices, as defined in the Act, are not suited to the task of deciding general questions of private wrongs, unrelated to union activities, suffered by employees as a result of tortious conduct by either employers or labor unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Enforcement denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b262-7\">LUMBARD, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">I concur in denying enforcement of the Board\u2019s order against the Miranda Fuel Company and Local 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Our decision in N. L. R. B. v. Local 294, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 317 F.2d 746 (1963), sufficiently negates the Board\u2019s contention that union and employer activities of the type here involved \u2014 wholly unrelated to the affected employee\u2019s relationship with the union\u2014 constitute violations of sections 8(a) (3) and 8(b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">However, I see no cause for the court even to consider the important and far-reaching question raised by the Board whether action which violates a union\u2019s duty of fair representation may constitute an unfair labor practice in violation of section 8(b) (1). The evidence upon which the Board relies is insufficient to support its conclusion that the union took \u201chostile action, for irrelevant, unfair or invidious reasons\u201d against Lopuch. The Board adduced no evidence to suggest that the union acted, albeit in response to the demands of the other employees, otherwise than in a belief, honestly held, that Lopuch had lost his seniority under the collective bargaining agreement. Such conduct does not constitute a violation of the duty of fair representation implicit in section 9 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">There is no reason to remand the case to the Board for further findings of fact. The Board having had the opportunity to make a record which would substantiate its charges, the proper disposition of the case is simply to deny enforcement of the Board\u2019s order. Accordingly, I see no need to consider whether or not invidious discrimination by a union against one of its members would constitute an unfair labor practice.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b262-12\">FRIENDLY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AtM\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Although there are several ways to approach this case, all of them, in my view, require us to sustain the Labor Board\u2019s finding against the union under \u00a7 8(b) (2) and against the employer un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>-der \u00a7 8(a) (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since we-had unanimously granted enforcement of this very \u25a0order, 284 F.2d 861 (1960), and the precise issue here presented has not reached the Supreme Court, it would be reasonable to demand a pinpointing of what in that Court\u2019s decisions is now thought to demand a different result. Under a second approach we might ask whether, if a member aggrieved by arbitrary union action must first exhaust administrative remedies because trial of an action <em>might </em>turn up evidence that the discrimination against him was for infraction of a union \u201crule\u201d and thus would be \u201carguably subject\u201d to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction even on my brothers\u2019 reading of the statute, Local 100 of United Ass\u2019n of Journeymen and Apprentices v. Borden, 373 U.S. 690, 695, 83 S.Ct. 1423, 10 L.Ed.2d 638 (1963); Local No. 207, International Ass\u2019n of Bridge, Structural, and Ornamental Iron Workers Union v.

But I think it best in the first instance to heed the advice that \u201c[t]o ascertain what Congress meant * * * we would do well to begin by carefuly attending to what Congress said.\u201d Shapiro v. United States, 335 U.S. 1, 39, 68 S.Ct. 1375, 1395, 92 L.Ed. 1787 (1948) (Mr. Justice Frankfurter dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">What the National Labor Relations Act makes an unfair labor practice is for an employer \u201cby discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment * * * to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization,\u201d \u00a7 8(a) (3), and for a union \u201cto cause or attempt to cause an employer\u201d to do so, \u00a7 8(b) (2). Congress did <em>not </em>say \u201cto discriminate in regard to hire or tenure of employment <em>because </em>of membership in any labor organization,\u201d \u2014 language which, indeed, would not support the result here reached by the Board. Neither did it define the unfair labor practice as being discrimination <em>\u201cin order to </em>encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\u201d What Congress forbade was \u201cto encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization\u201d by \u201cdiscrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our task is to determine whether the Board\u2019s findings that the union\u2019s and Miranda\u2019s actions had done that were within the Board\u2019s power to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Although \u201cIn common parlance, the word [to discriminate] means to distinguish or differentiate,\u201d 365 U.S. at 689, 81 S.Ct. at 847, 6 L.Ed.2d 11 (dissenting opinion), it more often means, both in common and particularly in legal parlance, to distinguish or differentiate without sufficient reason. Compare United States v. Illinois Central R., 263 U.S. 515, 521, 44 S.Ct. 189, 68 L.Ed. 417 (1924). A teacher thus does not \u201cdiscriminate\u201d simply by failing a student in an examination, although he would by doing so against his own judgment at outside dictation. This is a sufficient reason why, as said by Mr. Justice Harlan concurring in Local 357, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America v. N. L. R. B., 365 U.S. 667, 679, 81 S.Ct. 835, 842, 6 L.Ed.2d 11 (1961), \u201can employer may discharge an employee because he is not performing his work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>adequately, whether or not the employee happens to be a union organizer\u201d; the statement also rests soundly on the basis, evidently favored by Mr. Justice Harlan, that Congress did not mean \u201cdiscourage\u201d to include the kind of discouragement there mentioned \u2014 it had no interest in making labor organizations havens for the inefficient. See S.Rep. No.573, 74th Cong. 1st Sess. 11. For similar reasons, once the hiring hall agreement in the Local 357 case was pronounced valid, Slater\u2019s discharge for violating it was neither a \u201cdiscrimination\u201d nor a forbidden \u201cencouragement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Al2\">Our case is different. The union caused Miranda to \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against Lopuch in regard to hire or tenure of employment, not simply in the broad sense of \u201cdistinguishing\u201d between Lopuch and his fellows but in the invidious sense of doing this without a proper basis. What the union did cannot be defended as enforcing a valid contract, as in the Local 357 case; its action, as we said three years ago, was \u201cagainst and not under the agreement.\u201d 284 F.2d at 863. The Board was further warranted in finding that the union\u2019s act in compelling an unwilling employer to drop a valued employee of eight or nine years\u2019 standing to the lowest position on the seniority list because, with the employer\u2019s advance permission, he had gone off for the summer after finishing his work on a Friday night instead of waiting over for the following Monday, was not in good faith but rather was an arbitrary exercise of power.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We thus reach the issue whether the Board could law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>fully conclude that demotion thus unjustifiably procured would \u201cencourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Let us vary the instant case to the extent only of assuming that the contract had no union security clause and the victim was not a union member. If English words are to receive their ordinary meaning, I cannot see how it could fairly be denied in such a case that the employer\u2019s yielding to unwarranted demands by a union delegate or shop steward at the instance of union members would \u201cencourage * * * membership in any labor organization\u201d; the nonmembers would think they had better get at least that much closer to the source of power. \u201c * * * [I] t is common experience that the desire of employees to unionize is raised or lowered by the advantages thought to be attained by such action.\u201d Radio Officers\u2019 Union of Commercial Telegraphers Union, AFL v. N. L. R. B., 347 U.S. 17, 51, 74 S.Ct. 323, 341, 98 L.Ed. 455 (1954). If this be so, the argument against the Board\u2019s position must be that arbitrary union action causing an employer to discriminate against an employee is an unfair labor practice onfy when the victim is a nonmember rather than a member or a \u201cbad\u201d member rather than a \u201cgood\u201d member. \u25a0Congress, it is said, imposed no liability on unions for applying power on employers to discriminate against members for no reason, although making unions liable when they did this, as in the Radio \u2022Officers case, 347 U.S. at 29-30, 74 S.Ct. at 329-330, 98 L.Ed. 455, for what they considered a good reason but proved to be a mistaken one.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Although that would seem curious legislation, we would have to apply it if it was what Congress enacted. But it is not \u2014 my brothers\u2019 view is too myopic. The Board is entitled to look beyond the particular case, cf. Brooks v. N. L. R. B., 348 U.S. 96, 75 S.Ct. 176, 99 L.Ed. 125 (1954); it may consider the effect which union power plays against members will have not only in union shops but in nonunion shops. It could properly conclude that any such demonstration of union power to cause an employer to discriminate will lead non-members to become members in non-union shops, in the belief that by so doing they will eliminate at least one basis for a union delegate or shop steward causing the employer to take arbitrary action against them. As was said in the Radio Officers case, 347 U.S. at 51, 74 S.Ct. at 341, 98 L.Ed. 455, \u201cthe Act does not require that the employees discriminated against be the ones encouraged for purposes of violations of \u00a7 8(a) (3). Nor does the Act require that this change in employees\u2019 \u2018quantum of desire\u2019 to join a union have immediate manifestations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Even if the Board had been required to limit its consideration to \u201cencouragement\u201d within the Miranda Fuel Company, it could fairly conclude that action like that of the union here might tend to cause union members to be \u201cgood\u201d members rather than \u201cbad, or indifferent members.\u201d 347 U.S. at 40, 74 S.Ct. at 335, 98 L.Ed. 455. There is said to be no reason for members to decide they had better be \u201cgood\u201d members when they don\u2019t know that the reason why the victim was victimized was his being a bad one. But they also don\u2019t know that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>it wasn\u2019t. History teaches that it is precisely this kind of fear and uncertainty that encourages people to be servile to those who can wield arbitrary power. See Mr. Justice Douglas dissenting in United States v. Wunderlich, 342 U.S. 98, 101, 72 S.Ct. 154, 96 L.Ed. 113 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">It must also be emphasized that the question is not whether <em>we </em>would think that to countenance the exercise of unrestrained union power to cause discrimination against a member would \u201cencourage\u201d union membership but whether <em>the Board </em>might reasonably think so. As the Supreme Court said in the Radio <em>Officers </em>case, 347 U.S. <em>at 51, </em>74 S.Ct. at 341, 98 L.Ed. 455, \u201cEncouragement and discouragement are \u2018subtle things\u2019 requiring \u2018a high degree of introspective perception.\u2019 Cf. N. L. R. B. v. Donnelly Garment Co., 330 U.S. 219, 231 [67 S.Ct. 756, 91 L.Ed. 854].\u201d One of the main purposes for creating an <em>agency </em>like the Board \u201cis to have decisions based upon evidential facts under the particular statute made by experienced officials with an adequate appreciation of the complexities of the subject which is entrusted to their administration.\u201d Republic Aviation Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 324 U.S. 793, 800, 65 S.Ct. 982, 986, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945). See also Phelps Dodge Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 313 U.S. 177, 194, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941). The Board knows the facts of life in the labor world better than we ever can; we ought not upset its conclusion as to \u201cencouragement\u201d unless we can say this is without rational basis. Compare United States v. Detroit and Cleveland Navigation Co., 326 U.S. 236, 241, 66 S.Ct. 75, 90 L.Ed. 38 (1945). If the Board had determined that the \u201cencouragement\u201d to union membership afforded by arbitrary union action unrelated to infraction of union rules did not rise to the level required by the statute, we could not properly interfere. Neither may we do so when it has made the opposite determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">No decision of the Supreme Court requires a contrary conclusion. It is true that in the cases of Boston and Fowler, dealt with in the Radio Officers opinion, \u201cThe purposes of the unions in causing * * * discrimination clearly were to encourage members to perform obligations or supposed obligations of membership,\u201d 347 U.S. at 52, 74 S.Ct. at 342, 98 L.Ed. 455 \u2014 the payment of dues in the absence of a valid union security agreement in Boston\u2019s case, adherence to what the union erroneously thought to be a hiring hall agreement in Fowler\u2019s. But there is no warrant for a view that by sustaining the Board\u2019s conclusion that enforcement of the union \u201crules\u201d there at issue would encourage union membership, the Court meant to preclude the Board from finding that arbitrary action by a union against a member might also do this. In addition to the passages of the opinion already quoted, there are the emphatic statements \u201cthat specific evidence of intent to encourage or discourage is not an indispensable element of proof of violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3)\u201d; that \u201can employer\u2019s protestation that he did not intend to encourage or discourage must be unavailing where a natural consequence of his action was such encouragement or discouragement\u201d \u2014 as in the case of enforcement of an invalid no-solicitation rule by an employer having no anti-union animus, Republic Aviation Corp. v. N. L. R. B\u201e 324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945); that \u201csubjective evidence of employee response * * * is not required where encouragement or discouragement can be reasonably inferred from the nature of the discrimination\u201d; that the Board can draw reasonable inferences; and, most .significantly, that \u201cencouragement of union membership is obviously a natural and foreseeable consequence of any employer discrimination at the request of a union * * * \u201d 347 U.S. at 44, 45, 48-51, 52, 74 S.Ct. at 338, 341, 342, 98 L.Ed. 455 \u2014 remembering also that \u201cthe Act does not require that the employees discriminated against be the ones encouraged * * * \u201d 347 U.S. at 51, 74 S.Ct. at 341, 98 L.Ed. 455. These were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>principles which led us to grant enforcement of this very order three years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The claim that all this was shattered by Local 357, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America v. N. L. R. B., 365 U.S. 667, 81 S.Ct. 835, 6 L.Ed.2d 11 (1961), rests upon what I consider a misreading of that case. The Board had there applied its ruling, laid down with retroactive effect in Mountain Pacific Chapter, 119 N.L.R.B. 883 (1958), that all union hiring hall agreements were <em>per se </em>discriminatory unless they contained certain prescribed provisions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The sole issue was whether the very making of a hiring hall agreement that had not contained these provisions was a violation of the Act \u2014 despite the inclusion of a nondiscriminatory clause, the absence of evidence of actual discrimination against non-members, and the impossibility of having foreseen the requirements which the Board was to lay down. See Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion, 365 U.S. at 677-678, 81 S.Ct. at 840-841, 6 L.Ed.2d 11. The plurality opinion, by Mr. Justice Douglas, concluded that since the legislative history demonstrated that Congress did not intend to outlaw the union hiring hall,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cdiscrimination cannot be inferred from the face of ^the instrument when the instrument specifically provides that there will be no discrimination * * 365 U.S. at 675, 81 S.Ct. at 839, 6 L.Ed.2d 11. The concurring opinion, by Mr. Justice Harlan, went on the ground \u201cthat the Act was not intended to interfere significantly with those activities of employer and union which are justified by nondiseriminatory business purposes, or by nondiscriminatory attempts to benefit <em>all </em>the represented employees,\u201d and that the Board had not found that the hiring hall \u201cclause was without substantial justification in terms of legitimate employer or union purposes.\u201d 365 U.S. at 682, 684, 81 S.Ct. at 843, 6 L.Ed.2d 11. I see nothing in either opinion to support the view that the only \u201cdiscrimination\u201d forbidden is between members and non-members, or between good members and bad members. Although discrimination of that sort would almost certainly encourage or discourage union membership, the opinions do not say these are the only kinds of discrimination which the Board may find will have that effect. The Local 357 decision did indeed validate our previous refusal in this case, 284 F.2d at 863, following Local 553, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America v. N. L. R. B., 266 F.2d 552 (2 Cir. 1959), to uphold the Board\u2019s ruling that union participation in the administration of seniority was <em>per se </em>unfair. But nothing in Local 357 indicates that the result there would have been the same if the union had caused Slater\u2019s discharge arbitrarily and without the protection of a valid hiring hall agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">My brothers rely heavily on N. L. R, B. V. Local 294, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 317 F.2d 746 (2 Cir. 1963). The facts in that case were quite different. Monty, the employee there disfavored by the union\u2019s action, had no contractual right to priority over the two other extra drivers, and neither the intermediate report of the examiner nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the decision of the Board, 137 N.L.R.B. 1023 (1962), shows any reason save employer preference why he had been given first call. It may well be that union insistence on equitable work rotation when the contract is silent neither works a discrimination nor can be rationally found to encourage union membership; in any event that is a quite different issue from the one here. Compare N. L. R. B. v. Local 542, International Union of Operating Engineers, 255 F.2d 703, 705 (3 Cir. 1958). Moreover, the trial examiner in the Local 294 case had not considered the union\u2019s belief that Monty was \u201cno good\u201d and \u201ca troublemaker\u201d to be unreasonable, or its desire \u201cto keep this job open where a man out of work can pick up a few days\u2019 work now and then\u201d to be specious, and this court found there was no evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the reason assigned by the union was a \u201cpretext.\u201d 317 F.2d at 749 fn. 5. Thus the actual holding was simply that when a union induces an employer to make a non-discriminatory decision against an employee, it has not engaged in an unfair labor practice, 317 F.2d at 750. If the opinion was intended to go beyond that and to read the Local 357 decision as holding that arbitrary union action to force an employer to deal with a member as he could not properly do under the governing contract was necessarily outside the Act, I would be constrained rather to follow our previous decision in this case, which, as I see it, properly applied the statute as construed in Radio Officers and remains untouched by Local 357.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">.

I am unable to follow the criticisms of the Board\u2019s failure to take further evidence and make additional findings and of its allegedly not being interested in the real reasons and motives of the parties but rather in establishing a theory of <em>pet' se </em>violation. We held some years ago that the Board was warranted in finding this union\u2019s action to be \u201cin conflict with the agreement\u201d and \u201cagainst and not under the agreement,\u201d 284 F.2d at 863, and we referred to Lopuch as a \u201cvictim.\u201d Memorandum of Judges Swan and Olark, denying rehearing, dated December 27, 1960. The Board could scarcely have been expected to guess that factual findings which had previously proved so satisfactory to us would now cease to be; the remand requested from the Supreme Court was to enable the Board to consider whether the Local 357 case had established principles requiring a different result as a matter of law. If additional findings were needed, I am at a loss to understand why the Supplemental Decision\u2019s references to the Union as \u201cacceding to the unjustified pressures of some employees within the unit\u201d and as having exercised \u201can arbitrary power\u201d do not fill the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Neither do I understand how we can now say, contrary to our prior unanimous ruling, that these findings were not warranted by the evidence. As the Board held, 125 NLRB 454, 455-57 (1959), without disapproval by us, 284 F.2d at 862-863, \u00a7 8 of the collective bargaining agreement did not apply to Lopuch at all. It concerned only an \u201cemployee who according to seniority would not have steady employment\u201d in the slack season; the undisputed testimony was that Lopuch would have had this. What the clause said in readily understandable English was that a driver whose position would give him only occasional work during the slack season did not have to hang around all summer in order to preserve his seniority, provided only that he got back in time; its purpose was to help junior workers, not to harm senior ones. Nothing gave the slightest warrant for supposing that it prevented the employer from treating an older employee like Lopuch as decent human relations dictated. Moreover, as we pointed out before, 284 F.2d at 863, the Draconian penalty of total forfeiture of seniority accrued over many years (as distinguished from possibly dropping a place or two in the list as a result of summer work by others) was hinged only to failure to report back promptly on October 15, a failure which the union admit-ed was excused by Lopuch\u2019s illness. With this background the testimony amply supported the inference that the action of the union delegate and shop steward represented, not an honest though mistaken conviction as to the meaning of the contract, hut rather a yielding to the demands of the other drivers that the union should use any pretext to advance them at Lopuch\u2019s expense. Such inference drawing is the Board\u2019s business \u2014 not ours. Radio Officers\u2019 Union of Commercial Telegraphers Union, AFL v. N.

As I read the dissenting opinion of Chairman McCulloch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>anti Member Fanning, 140 NLRB No. 7 (1962), they did not challenge the majority\u2019s finding of arbitrariness but disagreed on the ground that there was no \u201clegally tenable distinction,\u201d fn. 28, between a case where a union demands a loss of seniority pursuant to a contract provision and another where arbitrary union action produces the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">On the other hand, if the union was not acting arbitrarily against Lopuch but was creating a general rule that no member could leave before April 15 without forfeiting seniority, this would seem, as the majority of the Board suggested, to be a union \u201crule\u201d \u2014 quite as much as the practice evidently considered to be one in Local No. 207, International Ass\u2019n of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers Union v. Perko, supra, 373 U.S. at 707, 83 S.Ct. at 1432, 10 L.Ed.2d 646. See also Brunswick Corp., 135 NLRB 574 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\">.

I cannot share my brother Medina\u2019s qualms that sustaining the Board\u2019s ruling as to \u00a7 8(a) (8) and (b) (2) will steer grievances of union members as to arbitrary union action away from the courts and toward the expert agency which Congress created to deal with labor matters. That would seem a rather good place for them to be. This is particularly so since the aggrieved employee\u2019s ability to proceed in court against the employer is seriously limited by the usual arbitration provisions which only the union can enforce, see Black-Clawson Co., Paper Mach. Division v. International Ass\u2019n of Machinists, 313 F.2d 179 (2 Cir. 1962), and Belk v. Allied Aviation Service Co., 315 F.2d 513 (2 Cir. 1963), and particularly Judge Clark\u2019s concurring opinion, 315 F.2d at 517-518, and an action by him against either the employer or the union is likely to encounter the primary jurisdiction and \u201cargupJJy subject\u201d doctrines so that he must make an excursion to the Board in any event.
