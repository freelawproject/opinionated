His defense was that the act was not forcibly done but by consent. His habeas corpus petition stated that thus \u201cthe issue of force was the only question involved in this case\u201d. His papers here admit that the jury was properly instructed that, unless it found \u201cthe issue of force\u201d against him, it was required to acquit. (On the appeal taken by petitioner from his conviction, the Missouri Supreme Court pointed out that the trial court \u201chad defined what constitutes rape\u201d and that there was no attempt to show any error in this instruction. State v. Tompkins, Mo.Sup., 277 S.W.2d 587, 592). The form of the verdict returned was \u201cWe the jury, * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>find the defendant guilty of rape * * \u201d. Petitioner\u2019s contention was that this may have been a finding that he was guilty of some other kind of rape and not of the crime of forcible rape with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The contention is frivolous. Petitioner admits that the charge against him was one under \u00a7 559.260, Mo.R.S.1959, \u00a7 559.260, V.A.M.S. That section authorizes conviction of rape \u201cby carnally and unlawfully knowing any female child under the age of sixteen years, or by forcibly ravishing any woman of the age of sixteen years or upward\u201d. With the charge being one of forcibly raping a woman over the age of 16 years, with the evidence showing that she was 68 years old, with petitioner conceding the focal question on the trial was whether the act was one of consent or force, and with the jury admittedly being instructed that unless it found \u201cthe issue of force\u201d against petitioner, it was required to acquit, there cannot rationally be room to doubt what the jury meant by its verdict of \u201cguilty of rape\u201d or for anyone not to be able to so understand. Hence, for the Missouri courts to attribute to the verdict the legal significance of constituting \u00e1 finding that petitioner was guilty of the offense of forcible rape\u2014with which he was charged, upon which the evidence was focused, and in relation to which the jury had been instructed\u2014cannot be claimed to be a violation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">In addition to its denial of relief to petitioner in the present situation, the Missouri Supreme Court has held in two other cases that such a verdict, when related to the charge, the evidence and the instructions in the case, is sufficiently clear in its meaning on the basis of fair intendment and common understanding to be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">Thus, in State v. Birkner, Mo.Sup., 229 S.W.2d 674, it was held that a verdict of \u201cguilty of rape\u201d, under a charge of carnally and unlawfully knowing a female child under the age of 16 years, was \u201cresponsive to the issues presented, and perfectly clear in its meaning.\u201d Similarly, in State v. Miner, 263 Mo. 270, 172 S.W. 366, 367, a verdict of \u201cguilty of attempted rape\u201d, under a charge of carnally and unlawfully knowing a female child under the age of 16 years, was held to be clear in its meaning and to have \u201cresponded to the evidence and to the charge included in the information, as defined by the instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">To assert that it would be a matter of fundamental unfairness to regard no doubt as existing that the jury found petitioner guilty of the offense of forcible rape, as charged, tried and submitted to it\u2014and that it was not finding him guilty of the other offense of rape under \u00a7 559.260, by carnally and unlawfully knowing a female child under the age of 16 years\u2014-is on its face a straining of both common and legal intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The application to have a certificate of probable cause issued by a judge of this Court is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
