On appeal he contends the court erred in finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>he knowingly waived his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights, instructing the jury and sentencing him to the upper term.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">After Castorena and several of his coworkers consumed four to five pitchers of beer over a period of several hours, Castorena drove to Edgar Hernandez\u2019s house, where he drank four glasses of brandy with his friend Sergio. Deciding to go home, he tried to exit the house through a window, apparently mistaking it for the front door. Hernandez, concerned about Castorena\u2019s level of intoxication, asked for his car keys. Sergio told Castorena he should not drive and offered to give him a ride. Castorena agreed initially and, giving his keys to Hernandez, walked to Sergio\u2019s car. However, he returned to the house, explaining he needed to drive his sister-in-law to work early the next morning. After Hernandez returned his keys, Castorena left the house, only to return within a few minutes. He again changed his mind, took his keys and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Traveling 70 to 100 miles per hour, often on the wrong side of the road, Castorena ran several red lights. Ultimately he rear-ended a car, injuring the driver and killing a passenger. Castorena was rendered unconscious and sustained serious facial injuries. The police took him to the hospital where two days later Police Officer Steven Ramsey interviewed him. Although Castorena was in a surgical ward, a nurse assured Ramsey he was \u201cawake, alert and spoke perfect English.\" After being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Castorena admitted drinking beer with his coworkers, but denied being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>intoxicated. He explained he did not become drunk until he consumed brandy at Hernandez\u2019s house. He could not remember leaving the house or anything about the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">After denying probation, the court stated, \u201cThe circumstances in aggravation, California Rules of Court, [rule 421] (a)(1) and (8),[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] malice for the conscious disregard of the rights and safety of others which is not an element of this crime exists in this instance. [^D The evidence clearly demonstrated the defendant was malicious in his conduct and that such conduct involved planning.. . . After having been told he was too drunk to drive, after having his keys taken away and after being offered another means of transportation, defendant drove anyway, apparently because he would have been inconvenienced [because he needed to have his keys to drive to work the next day]. In addition, ... the evidence demonstrated that the defendant in his driving was attempting to avoid detection. Also, while an element of this crime is gross negligence, defendant\u2019s conduct exceeded even the word gross. While at almost three times the legal limit of blood alcohol[,] it was .20, as I recall, he drove at speeds up to 100 miles an hour on the wrong side of the road running several red lights and narrowly missing injury to several other persons after having consumed 10 to 12 glasses of beer and 4 glasses of brandy. ... [H ... [^D Because of the gravity and weight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>aggravating factors, defendant is sentenced to the upper term of 10 years in state prison.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Castorena maintains the court improperly relied on the same facts the jury used to convict him of gross negligence. He argues because gross negligence is established from all \u201crelevant aspects of [a] defendant\u2019s conduct resulting in the fatal accident\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bennett </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1032, 1039 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 8, 819 P.2d 849]) there were no remaining facts for the court to use to aggravate his sentence. For reasons we now explain, he is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Rule 420(d) provides, \u201cA fact that is an element of the crime shall not be used to impose the upper term.\u201d However, where the facts surrounding the charged offense exceed the minimum necessary to establish the elements of the crime, the trial court can use such evidence to aggravate the sentence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1756, 1775-1776 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 73], and cases cited therein.) Stated another way, rule 420(d) does not preclude a court from using facts to aggravate a sentence when those facts <em>establish elements not required </em>for the underlying crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Here, the trial court, recognizing the dual use proscription, relied on facts exceeding those necessary to establish gross negligence. It determined \u201cwhile an element of this crime is gross negligence, defendant\u2019s conduct exceeded even the word gross.\u201d The court found such evidence demonstrated <em>implied malice which is an element of second degree murder\u2014not gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> (People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 290, 296 [179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279] [implied malice, a necessary element of second degree murder, \u201ccontemplates a subjective awareness of a higher degree of risk\u201d not required for gross negligence].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>To accept Castorena\u2019s contention would impermissibly limit trial courts from imposing an aggravated term in gross vehicular manslaughter cases. Such a result was never intended by the Legislature: \u201cThe determinate sentencing law authorizes the court to select the [lower, middle or upper] prison term . ... FID ... if circumstances justify that choice appear upon an evaluation of the record as a whole.\u201d (See Advisory Com. com. to rule 420(d) 23 West\u2019s Ann. Court Rules, pt. 2 (1996 ed.) p. 17; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Broussard </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1067, 1071 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 278, 856 P.2d 1134] [statutes should be interpreted to avoid results not intended by the Legislature].) Accordingly, we find no error in sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Crosby, Acting P.
