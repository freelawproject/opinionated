Trial was had for two days.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">While plaintiff was married to defendant, the property was acquired as community property. In 1931 petitioner was granted a divorce from defendant in the State of Texas. Texas, of course, could not adjudicate title to California real property. Defendant as minister of a church uses the property, which is improved with a church building, without paying anything to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">Petitioner contends that the court should have partitioned the property, either in kind, or by sale and division of the proceeds. The court made a minute order, finding that at the time the property was acquired petitioner\u2019s equity in it was $500. Apparently no judgment has yet been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">While petitioner presents a convincing argument, we think her remedy is by appeal. The rules respecting high prerogative writs have been recently reviewed and restated in <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>35 Cal.2d 363 [217 P.2d 951]. There it is said: \u201cWhere . . . there is a right to an immediate review by appeal, that remedy is almost as speedy as a writ proceeding, under present practice, and should be considered adequate unless petitioner can show some special reason why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>it is rendered inadequate by the particular circumstances of his ease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The most petitioner shows in this regard is that an appeal will take time and cost money. This is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">For the reasons given in <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>and in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>35 Cal.2d 379 [218 P.2d 10], the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 31,1950.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
