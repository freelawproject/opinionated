SNYDER, Respondent, v. SAMUEL J. COTTON et al., Appellants.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Altagen, Rubin &amp; Umann for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-6\">Wood, Crump, Rogers, Arndt &amp; Evans for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b510-7\">DRAPEAU, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">In this case judgment was entered November 18, 1949; notice of appeal was filed December 21, 1949; notice to clerk for preparation of clerk\u2019s and reporter\u2019s transcripts was filed January 12, 1950. Payment for clerk\u2019s transcript was received April 7, 1950; clerk\u2019s transcript on appeal was filed March 31, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">June 7, 1950, motion to dismiss appeal was filed. On that date no reporter\u2019s transcript had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Appellant Beekenfeld himself filed an affidavit, dated June 14, 1950, averring that during March and April he was negotiating directly with counsel for respondent to settle the case; that he was reasonably sure it could be settled, and therefore, did not pay all of the reporter\u2019s fees; that all of the reporter\u2019s fees had been paid on the date of the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">Counsel for appellant filed no affidavit. And no denial was made of respondent\u2019s showing that repeated requests had \"been made to counsel to perfect the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">While an appellate court has the power to relieve parties from default under the rules on appeal <em>(Jarkieh </em>v. <em>Badagliacco, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 426 [156 P.2d 969]), an affirmative showing must be made under rule 53(b) to be relieved from default. <em>(Caldwell </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>85 Cal.App.2d 104 [192 P.2d 62].)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">The right to a dismissal of an appeal for delay in filing the transcript of record is determined by the facts as they exist when the notice of motion is given. <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Krumm, </em>21 Cal.2d 846 [136 P.2d 8].)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">The time which elapsed in this case is too long. <em>(Myers </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>89 Cal.App.2d 800 [201 P.2d 884].)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">White, P. J., and Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
