He left the restaurant sometime around 5 p. m., and, after a short conversation with a Los Angeles Transit Lines traffic man, about 25 feet south of the southeast corner of Olympic and Soto, walked to the southeast corner. While standing there, on the sidewalk, he bent his head to light a cigarette. At that moment, the defendant Turner Homer Tims was making a right turn with the truck and trailer off of Soto Street onto Olympic Boulevard (he having been proceeding north on Soto Street). Tims\u2019 truck and trailer was the type commonly used for delivery of sand and gravel. The overall length of truck and trailer (including connecting bar) was approximately forty-four feet. The trailer does not \u2018track\u2019 with the truck when making a turn. That is, the trailer \u2018cuts in\u2019 and does not follow in the path of the truck itself. If the truck and trailer is making a right hand turn, the trailer will \u2018cut in\u2019 more to the right than the truck itself. In order to prevent the trailer from striking the curb or going up over the sidewalk, while making a right hand turn, the driver must head the truck in a more or less straight course to the center line of the street he is going to turn into, and then turn the wheels to the right, thus making allowance for the \u2018cutting in\u2019 to the right (towards the sidewalk) of the trailer. At the time of the accident herein, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>defendant Turner Homer Tims was executing the right hand turn as above described. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">\u201cWhen Donald Ferguson straightened up after lighting the cigarette, the front wheel (of the set on the rear axles of the trailer) were just a fraction to his left and brushing the curbing. He put out his hands in a pushing motion as though to fend off the wheel. As his hands touched the trailer wheel, it rolled him over the top of it and then threw him under it, carrying him out into the street. At the time he was struck he was standing With both feet on the sidewalk. He died in the street from the injuries thus received. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The body of the trailer did not extend beyond the wheels; the outside of the wheels was about 2 feet beyond the side of the body. The evidence shows that the outside wheel \u201cbrushed\u201d the curb but did not go over the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Obviously the question of negligence was for the jury to determine and a careful reading of the evidence reveals it to be sufficient to support the verdict. It could well be, in the light of the record, that the jury reached the conclusion as contended by respondent that, \u201cthe most that could be said for the defendants activities, in justice and charity to one who had passed on, would be to conclude that neither the defendants or plaintiff was negligent. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The court\u2019s failure to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur in the circumstances and to instruct the jury accordingly, appears to be well supported by the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">It is argued by appellant that, \u201cThe court erred in instructing the jury that the trucking equipment was entitled to use all the roadway up to and to the edge of the sidewalk, because it is negligence for the operator of a motor vehicle to drive so close to a sidewalk or safety zone as to strike a pedestrian standing there, and it was error for the court to refuse to give plaintiff\u2019s instruction embodying the correct rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">It is also argued that the court erred by giving an instruction on the unavoidable accident rule. Other instructions given and refused are also claimed as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Without going into \u25a0 detail it is sufficient to note that the instructions sufficiently and fairly covered all of the valid controversial issues; there was no prejudicial error in the failure to give requested instructions nor does any error appear from an examination of the instructions given.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
