The record discloses the execution of a written memorandum in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-12\">\u201cLos Angeles, California</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1a\">2/28/47</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-13\">\u201cI hereby purchase Howard NC-67495 aircraft from Lu</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-14\">Cook.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-15\">Purchase price ..........................$5647.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-16\">Deposit, 2/8/1947 ....................... 650.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-17\">' 1 $4997.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-18\">Add. 2/28/1947 ........................ 1500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-19\">Balance to be paid 2/15/47...............$3497.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-20\">Ralph B. Seeley.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>According to the appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cAfter the plane was inspected by respondent Seeley, there were eight things only to be done on the seller\u2019s part, i.e., furnish new tires, have it painted, put a new propeller on it, a cover for the motor, a clock, provide for an additional passenger, put on a good radio.\u201d Respondent testified that \u201che (Cook) said he could have the plane completed by April 8th ... so I gave him a check (post-dated) dated April 8, 1947 for $2,498.00,\u201d which was the balance then due on the purchase price. After the giving of such check and about March 30, 1947 \u201che (Cook) crashed the plane out near Saugus and wrecked it.\u201d Seeley thereafter stopped payment on the cheek, and instituted the present action. The trial court gave judgment for the plaintiff, respondent herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The appellant\u2019s contention is that title to the airplane had passed to the buyer although formal delivery had not taken place; that therefore, the risk of accident was in the buyer rather than in the seller. It is also argued that appellant was \u201can intermediate party, not a principal,\u201d a Mr. Jorgensen being the actual owner, and that \u201crespondent sued the wrong party. \u2019 \u2019 In reference to the title, it may be noted that during the negotiations appellant secured a bill of sale from Jorgensen, in order, according to appellant\u2019s explanation, \u201cthat appellant could borrow on said ostensible title the balance . . . owed to Mr. Jorgensen by the respondent . . . who was in the hospital and could not manage his own affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Appellant also complains that the trial court found that \u201ceach of the allegations contained in the answer of Ralph B. Seeley, the crossdefendant herein, ... is true,\u201d although no such answer had been filed. To this contention respondent replies that \u201cThis case was tried without objection upon the theory that the allegations of Cook\u2019s crosscomplaint had been denied by Seeley\u2019s answer,\u201d and that \u201cIn these circumstances appellant cannot now complain.\u201d Respondent also notes that appellant failed to raise this objection to the proposed findings, or by way of motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">A survey of the record herein fails to show any merit in the appellant\u2019s contentions. In regard to the transactions between buyer and seller and the passing of title to the airplane, respondent\u2019s brief correctly sums up the matter as follows; \u201cThe contract of sale as shown by the pleadings and the evidences was conditioned upon the doing of certain things by the seller. These things were not done prior to the destruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>tion of the plane. Consequently, the title never passed to the buyer and he is entitled to recover the portion of the purchase price paid by him.\u201d Had the seller reconditioned the plane in accordance with the agreement, a different situation might have been presented, but such is not the case. The contention that Jorgensen rather than Cook, was the seller, is untenable;\u2014 the contract of sale was between Seeley and Cook.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The findings are supported by the evidence and no reversible error appears in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
