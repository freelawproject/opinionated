J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AI\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">This appeal is concerned with an accommodating bailiff who, without the knowledge of the trial judge or trial counsel, supplied a dictionary to the jury, thus contaminating it. The judge declined to order a new trial as a result of the bailiffs pollution of the jury. The trial court did, however, reduce the verdict from $1,630, 284 to slightly less than half, $762,784. Obviously unsatisfied, the appellants, General Motors Corporation (GMC), Gladding Chevrolet, Inc., (Gladding), and Howard L. Seidel (Seidel) have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\n<em>\u2014THE FACTS\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">On April 13, 1979, Violet Seidel, accompanied by her husband, the appellant, Howard Seidel, drove their 1978 Chevrolet Monte Carlo to the Montgomery Ward Store in the Glen Burnie shopping center on Ritchie Highway. According to the testimony, Mrs. Seidel stopped the car parallel to the sidewalk in front of the store. She alit from the vehicle and walked toward the store. At the same time, Mrs. Lynda Wernsing, the principal appellee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was standing in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>lane of traffic, approximately two car lengths ahead of the Seidel vehicle. Mrs. Wernsing was in the process of loading packages in the rear compartment of her Chevrolet Suburban. Howard Seidel slid across the seat when his wife left the car, and he assumed the driver\u2019s position behind the steering wheel. Seidel moved the gear shift lever from \"Park\u201d to \"Drive.\u201d Several witnesses testified to a loud noise coming from the Seidel automobile. The Monte Carlo moved forward and pinned Mrs. Wernsing against the rear of her vehicle. Seidel reversed the Monte Carlo, and backed away from Mrs. Wernsing, who fell to the street. Seidel\u2019s vehicle then again moved forward where it rolled over Mrs. Wernsing. Seidel once more reversed and proceeded backward until he struck another car. The Monte Carlo, with Mr. Seidel still at the wheel, then proceeded forward past Mrs. Wernsing and halted several yards away. Although there was an odor of alcohol on Seidel\u2019s breath, and he admitted to having had several drinks at a club, he was not charged with operating under the influence or driving while impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">It was alleged that the Monte Carlo had a defective cruise control. Expert testimony differed as to whether the cruise control was in fact defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In any event, Mrs. Wernsing and the other appellees sued Seidel, GMC, and Gladding.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\n<em>\u2014THE ISSUE\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The appellants-cross-appellees have raised several issues for our review, while the appellees-cross-appellants assail the remittitur and seek to have the total amount of the jury\u2019s verdict reinstated. As we see it, however, the only matter we need address is that of whether the trial judge, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, abused his discretion in not granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\"><em>\u2014The Dictionary as a Forbidden </em>Book\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Maryland Rule 558 is concerned with the documents, pleadings, prayers, and instructions that may be taken to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the jury room for the jury\u2019s consideration during its deliberative phase. The rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">\"a. <em>In Court\u2019s Discretion.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">Upon retiring for deliberation, the jury may take with them into the jury room such of the pleadings, granted prayers or written instructions, and exhibits which have been received in evidence, as the court may deem necessary for a proper consideration of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">b. <em>As of Right </em>\u2014 <em>Notes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">The jury may also take with them notes of the testimony or other proceedings taken by themselves but none taken by any other person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">c. <em>Return to Clerk.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">All such papers or exhibits, except the notes mentioned in section b hereof, shall be returned to the clerk before the jury is discharged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">d. <em>Exception.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">A deposition may not be taken into the jury room, except by agreement of all parties and with consent of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">The jury also takes with it the verbal instructions given to them by the trial judge. Hopefully, those instructions are free of ambiguity and are understandable. In the instant case, the judge told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-13\">\"There may be more than one cause of an injury, that is, several negligent acts may work together. Each person whose negligent act is a cause of an injury is responsible. You are instructed that there may be more than one <em>proximate cause </em>of an accident and while negligence of a defendant must be a <em>proximate cause </em>in order to warrant recovery, it need not necessarily be the sole <em>proximate cause </em>of an accident. The mere happening of the accident raises no presumption of negligence on the part of anyone and the burden of proof is upon the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>tiffs to prove, by a fair preponderance of affirmative evidence satisfactory to you, that a defendant was guilty of negligence and that such negligence was a direct and <em>proximate cause </em>of the accident.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The case was submitted to the jury on several issues, among which was number 2. It read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\"Was the Seidel car in a defective condition and unreasonably dangerous at the time of the accident thereby proximately causing the accident?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">A jury that does not comprehend an instruction or portion thereof is free to request the trial judge to clarify that point. Indeed, the trial judge is the only proper source from which a jury may obtain instructions as to the law or the definition of legal terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the jury sent a note to the judge which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">\"We are hung on #2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">Can we have a clarification on question #2?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">I.E. <em>proximately\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">Directly under what we were informed is the handwritten message from the jury\u2019s foreman, the trial judge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">\"rec\u2019d 2:00 PM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASW\">10/23/81</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-14\">Proximate cause is legal cause</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-15\">E Lerner</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-16\">Judge\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-17\">That terse definition was technically correct but not very informative to lay persons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Apparently not satisfied with the definition it received from the trial judge, the jury undertook to educate itself as to what \"legal cause\u201d meant. It requested the bailiff, whose job it was to safeguard the jury from contamination by outside influences, to obtain a dictionary for the jury\u2019s use. The obliging bailiff<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> located a dictionary <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and presented it to the venireman.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">On the reverse side of the note containing the judge\u2019s definition of \"proximate cause\u201d as \"legal cause\u201d appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\"page 482</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">Webster\u2019s Seventh new Collegiate Dictionary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AId\">\n<em>Legal cause</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">having a formal status derived from law often without basis in actual fact</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">#1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">Will Casto\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">Our reading of that dictionary discloses that the definition apparently copied by Mr. Casto is point \"b\u201d of the second definition of the adjective \"legal.\u201d No attempt seems to have made to define \"legal cause\u201d as distinguished from \"legal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">Maryland does not heretofore appear to have had a case of a jury\u2019s receiving and using a dictionary without the knowledge and consent of the judge and counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Other states, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>however, have not been as fortunate. The most recent case of which we are aware is <em>Alvarez v. </em>People, 653 P.2d 1127 (Colo. 1982). There, a juror consulted a dictionary in order to ascertain the meaning of the \"legal terminology in the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d The use of the dictionary was not made known until after the trial. One juror acknowledged that she was persuaded that \"her doubts were not reasonable\u201d because of \"the dictionary definitions.\u201d The Colorado Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">\"There can be no question but that a juror\u2019s consultation of a dictionary to assist in understanding legal terminology in the court\u2019s instruction is improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">. .. [T]he record amply establishes that the defendant was prejudiced in fact by juror misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">The central fact is that the juror who looked up the words was aided by the dictionary definitions in deciding that her doubt was not reasonable. This decision was essential to the defendant\u2019s conviction. We hold that this adequately established prejudice resulting from juror misconduct and requires reversal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The Colorado court went on to observe in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">\"It is futile to speculate how the juror might have voted without the benefit of dictionary definitions and equally futile to inquire whether the use made of the definitions resulted in a meaning of reasonable doubt consistent with the law. The defendant cannot reasonably be required to resolve these problematic matters as a part of his required showing of prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>A case strikingly similar to that now before us was decided by the Court of Appeals of Illinois. There, in <em>Gertz, Administrator v. Bass, </em>59 Ill. App. 2d 180, 208 N.E.2d 113 (1965), a bailiff had, without the knowledge of the judge or counsel, supplied a Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary to a jury. The Illinois intermediate court held that the trial court erred in not granting a motion for a new trial in light of the jury\u2019s use of the dictionary. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">\"We believe that it was prejudicial error for an officer of the court to give to the jury a dictionary which was not admitted into evidence, because the dictionary contained definitions of terms which were essential to a decision in the case, and which were substantially different from the technical legal definitions of those terms which the jury was properly instructed to apply in arriving at their verdict.\u201d 59 Ill. App. 2d at 115.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">A number of other courts have reached homologous results when confronted with situations involving defiling of a jury. <em>See e.g., Nichols v. Seaboard Coastline Railway Co., </em>341 So.2d 671 (Ala. 1976) (use by a jury of an encyclopedia to define negligence, contributory negligence, subsequent negligence, etc.); <em>Application of Phelan, </em>126 N.J.L. 410, 19 A.2d 792 (1941) (use of a dictionary to define \"undue influence\u201d); <em>In re Collins\u2019 Will, </em>18 N.J. Misc. 492, 15 A.2d 98 (1940) (the constable in attendance to the jury obtained and furnished to the jury panel a dictionary in order that they could ascertain the meaning of \"undue influence\u201d); <em>Figula v. Fort Worth &amp; Denver City Railroad Co., </em>131 S.W.2d 998 (Tex. Civ. App. 1939) (foreman of jury consulted a dictionary in order \"to ascertain the meaning of 'proximate cause\u2019 \u201d); <em>Palestroni v. Jacobs, </em>10 N.J. Super. 266, 77 A.2d 183 (1950) (trial judge \"supplied jurors with a dictionary at their request while they were deliberating.\u201d The judge, however, did not advise counsel of the communication with the jury.); <em>Norris Brothers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mattinson, </em>118 S.W.2d 460 (Tex. Civ. App. 1938) (juror used dictionary to determine meaning of the words \"immediately prior to the collision\u201d); <em>Smith v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>State, </em>95 So.2d 525 (Fla. 1957) (trial judge furnished dictionary to the jury \"out of the presence of the defendant and without knowledge of her counsel\u201d); <em>Gulf States Equipment Co. v. Toombs, </em>288 S.W.2d 203 (Tex. Civ. App. 1956) (jury foreman used dictionary to find meaning of \"estoppel\u201d and communicated his findings to other jurors).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">There is not, however, an unanimity of opinion on the subject of jurors\u2019 unauthorized resorting to the dictionary in order to determine the meaning of words or phrases. The Supreme Court of Wyoming, in <em>Zanetti Bus Lines, Inc. v. Logan, </em>400 P.2d 482 (Wyo. 1965) rejected the contention that a bailiffs impermissive supplying of a dictionary to a jury in order that the veniremen might define \"natural\u201d was reversible. The court reasoned that there were eight definitions of the word \"natural\u201d in that particular dictionary, but that only one of them \"could be reasonably applied\u201d to the facts of the case. Moreover, the court said there was \"sufficient substantial evidence both of negligence and of proximate cause upon which the jury could have based its verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The Court of Appeals of Oregon, in <em>State v. Cummings, </em>33 Or. App. 265, 576 P.2d 36 (1978), turned aside an argument that a bailiff s giving a dictionary to a jury in order that it might look up the meaning of \"tumultuous\u201d was error. The court said that \" 'tumultuous\u2019 is not a word of art,\u201d and that \"any error in the jury\u2019s reading of . . . [the] definition was harmless. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Indiana courts had also opted for the \"harmless error\u201d solution to the jury\u2019s use of a dictionary when \"the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming\u201d and \"no explanation ... [was] offered as to [the jury\u2019s] ... use [of the dictionary].\u201d <em>Shultz </em>v. <em>State, </em>421 N.E.2d 22 (1981). Earlier in <em>Shultz v. State, </em>417 N.E.2d 1127 (1981), the court observed that the so-called \"majority rule\u201d is \"that prejudice to the complaining party is not presumed but must affirmatively appear in order to require or justify a reversal or a new trial... .\u201d <em>Id. See also </em>54 A.L.R.2d 738-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>A rule requiring a showing of substantial prejudice has been adopted by several of our sister states. For example, in <em>Kettler v. Phillips, </em>191 Kan. 486, 382 P.2d 478 (1963), a juror used a dictionary to \"look up\u201d the word \"negligence,\u201d as well as other words. He read his notes to the jury <em>after </em>it had reached its verdict but before it returned to the courtroom. The record did not, in the Kansas court\u2019s view, \"establish with any definiteness\u201d that the dictionary definition of negligence \"was used in arriving at a verdict. The most that can be said is that the dictionary definition <em>might </em>have influenced the jury.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The court concluded that the appellant had not shown that \"substantial rights\u201d had \"been prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Sixteen years later, in <em>State v. Duncan, </em>3 Kan. App. 2d 271, 593 P.2d 427 (1979), the Kansas Court of Appeals held that a jury\u2019s \"alleged\u201d use of a dictionary to define \"assault\u201d was not error in the light of the defendant\u2019s inability \"to show the existence of substantial prejudice to his rights.\u201d Additionally, the court noted that \"evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt of aggravated assault . .. was overwhelming....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Iowa, in <em>In the Matter of the Estate of Cory v. Ankeny State Bank, </em>169 N.W.2d 837 (1969), observed that courts generally hold \"that prejudice to the complaining party is not presumed but must affirmatively appear in order to require or justify a reversal or a new trial. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The State of Missouri, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Suschank, </em>595 S.W.2d 295 (1979) commented that only a few states follow a <em>per se </em>rule with respect to use by a jury of an unauthorized dictionary. Usually, the courts require that the party attacking the jury\u2019s verdict on that ground demonstrate that substantial rights have been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The distillation of what other state courts hold may in our view be fairly stated as: With the exception of a few states, the courts generally agree that if a dictionary is obtained and used by the jury without the knowledge or consent of the trial judge and of trial counsel, the party assailing the use of the dictionary by the jury carries the burden of showing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>jury\u2019s verdict was influenced by the use of the dictionary, and that the rights of the party have been substantially infringed upon to the point that the party has been denied a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Patently, such a rule requires a case-by-case consideration inasmuch as not every extraneous-matter verdict need be nullified. Some complainants will be unable to prove prejudice amounting to a denial of substantial rights. <em>See Nichols v. Seaboard Coastline Railroad Co., supra, </em>341 So.2d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Having that rule firmly in mind, we now examine what, if any, effect the use of the unauthorized dictionary had in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The part-time bailiff<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">\"[The jury] knocked on the door and I. . . they said they wanted a dictionary. I closed the door. I called the bailiff supervisor and asked for a dictionary. I said, 'The jury wishes a dictionary.\u2019 And a dictionary was brought down to me by one of the other Bailiffs. I handed it to the Foreman of the ... knocked on the door, handed it to the Foreman of the jury, and I said T would like to have it back when you\u2019re finished\u2019 and later on the dictionary was given back to me and that\u2019s that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">The bailiff did not tell the judge or counsel of the jury\u2019s desire for a dictionary, nor did he advise them that he had supplied the jury with a dictionary. He did, however, tell the clerk \"afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Although the bailiff could not remember receiving a note from the jury foreman with regard to the dictionary, he did recall the verbal request.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Four jurors submitted affidavits to the effect that the dictionary definition of \"legal\u201d resolved the matter in their minds. The jury seemingly decided that \"proximate cause\u201d meant \"could it be possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">We find it hard to believe that such an approach to an issue as \"could it be possible\u201d would, absent a law of physics or mathematical certainty to the contrary, result in any other answer than \"yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The bailiffs testimony, coupled with the affidavits of the four jurors clearly demonstrated substantial prejudice to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">We are confronted in this case with a clash of two principles:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">1. A juror may not impeach his or her own verdict,</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">and</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">2. Each litigant is entitled to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">The principles seemingly meet here in a head-on collision. Yet, closer examination will reveal that all is not what it appears to be. The four jurors did not launch the invasion of their own verdict. The beachhead was established through the testimony of the errant bailiff; the four jurors served solely as support troops, verifying the breach of the jury\u2019s sequestration via the introduction of the dictionary as well as that book\u2019s effect on the ultimate outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">Ordinarily a juror or jury is not allowed to impeach his, her, or their verdict. Circumstances do arise, however, as in the instant matter, when to permit a verdict to stand in the face of clear contamination of the jury and manifest misinterpretation of legal terminology would be an unconscionable denial of the appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">The trial judge should have granted the motion for a new trial. His failure to so do was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">Ordinarily, under Maryland Rule 1082 a, costs are awarded against the losing party. Here, we deem it appropriate, because of the injection of the dictionary into the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>process by the bailiff, that costs be allocated among all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\n<em>Case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ax\">\n<em>One-fourth costs to be paid by each appellant and one-fourth by appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b52-10\">. Other appellees include Mrs. Wernsing\u2019s husband, son, and daughter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b55-18\">. Professor Prosser, in his <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts, </em>(4th ed. 1971) \u00a7 41, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-19\">\"An essential element of the plaintiffs cause of action for negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>gence, or for that matter any other tort, is that there be some reasonable connection between the act or omission of the defendant and the damage which the plaintiff has suffered. This connection usually is dealt with by the courts in terms of what is called 'proximate cause\u2019 or 'legal cause.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">There may be, as Prosser notes, nothing in the law that generates more disagreement than the expressions, \"proximate cause\u201d or \"legal cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">\"Proximate cause\u201d is, according to Prosser, an unfortunate term. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b56-15\">.
