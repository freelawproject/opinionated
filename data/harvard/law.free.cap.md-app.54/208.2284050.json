Chesapeake appealed to the Maryland Tax Court. The Tax Court concluded that the Comptroller was in error and vacated the assessment. After an appeal to the Baltimore City Court (Levin, J.), an order affirming the Tax Court\u2019s decision was issued. This appeal arises from that order. For the reasons stated we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. The Chesapeake Corporation is engaged in the forest products business, primarily in the manufacturing of paper board, brown paper, and market pulp at its major production facility located in West Point, Virginia. In connection with its manufacturing process, Cheaspeake also maintains a wood fiber procurement plant in Pocomoke City, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">The source of Chesapeake\u2019s raw material is timber located in Virginia, North Carolina, Delaware, and Maryland. Chesapeake obtains the timber from land which it owns in fee simple, from land to which it holds cutting rights, and from individuals who independently cut and sell timber. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Approximately seventy-five percent (75%) of the trees processed at the Pocomoke City facility come from timberland and cutting rights owned by Chesapeake. The remaining twenty-five percent (25%) is purchased from independent growers.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">For federal income tax purposes, Chesapeake recognized taxable income from timber which it cut and sold under \u00a7 631 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code. (26 U.S.C.) (1964 ed.) However, as to timber which was cut and utilized in its manufacturing process, Chesapeake recognized a \"hypothetical\u201d gain permitted under I.R.C. \u00a7 631 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 631 (a) allowed Chesapeake to treat the cutting of timber for use in its business \"as a sale or exchange of such timber cut during such tax year\u201d and accordingly afforded federal capital gains tax treatment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Chesapeake\u2019s \u00a7 631 (a) and \u00a7 631 (b) gains were reported to Maryland and subject to corporate income taxation under Article 81, \u00a7 280A of the Annotated Code of Maryland. The corporation\u2019s \u00a7 631 (b) gains, resulting from an actual sale of timber, were allocated to Maryland or outside of Maryland based on the location of the timber cut pursuant to Article 81, \u00a7 316 (b) 2 (A). Chesapeake\u2019s I.R.C. \u00a7 631 (a) gains, however, which were not generated by an actual sale or exchange of timber, were included in the corporation\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>general business income and apportioned to Maryland according to the three factor formula in \u00a7 316 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The Income Tax Division of the Comptroller\u2019s office subsequently conducted an audit of Chesapeake\u2019s Maryland tax returns. An assessment of additional income was made for the tax years 1974,1975, and 1976. This adjustment was due to the Comptroller\u2019s insistence that Chesapeake\u2019s federal 631 (a) \"capital gains\u201d had to be allocated to the situs state as \"capital gains\u201d under \u00a7 316 (b) 2 (A), rather than apportioned under \u00a7 316 (c) as general business income.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Chesapeake appealed the deficiency assessment to the Maryland Tax Court and argued that its \u00a7 631 (a) income should be apportioned because the gain was not produced by an actual sale of timber under \u00a7 316 (b) 2 (A). The Tax Court agreed and vacated the assessment. After an appeal by the Comptroller to the Baltimore City Court, the Tax Court\u2019s decision was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The single issue on this appeal is whether Chesapeake\u2019s \u00a7 631 (a) income should be allocated under \u00a7 316 (b) 2 (A) because \"capital gains\u201d for federal income tax purposes are \"capital gains\u201d for Maryland income tax purposes or should its \u00a7 631 (a) gains be apportioned as general business income under \u00a7 316 (c) because an actual sale is required under \u00a7 316 (b) 2 (A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">This is a case of first impression in Maryland<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> calling for a construction of Article 81, \u00a7 316 (b) 2 (A). The section provides in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\"Capital gains and losses from sales of tangible personal property are allocable to this State if... the property had a situs in this State at the time of the sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Chesapeake contends that this provision requires an actual sale of timber to effect the tax consequences of its application. The Comptroller, on the other hand, argues that since Chesapeake elected to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange under I.R.C. \u00a7631 (a) and receive preferential federal capital gains tax treatment, the corporation has recognized \"capital gains\u201d within the meaning of this section. We agree with the Comptroller.'</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In <em>Katzenberg v. Comptroller, </em>263 Md. 189, 282 A.2d 465 (1971), certain taxpayers challenged the 1967 revision of the State income tax law. The Court of Appeals observed, quoting in part from an opinion of the Attorney General, that it was,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\"palpably clear that it was the legislative intent that capital gains should be included in the base on which Maryland income tax was to be paid. This was the conclusion reached by the Attorney General: 'when it enacted Chapter 142, <em>the State Legislature deliberately and intentionally pronounced a doctrine of conformance between the State income tax and the federal income tax law. </em>In doing so, it adopted the federal base for determining gross income, <em>and it included capital gains and losses taxed as under federal laws, but at State </em>rates....\u2019 52 Opp. Att\u2019y Gen. 451, 452 (1967).\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 198, 282 A.2d at 470 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added). Judge Singley, writing for the Court in <em>Katzenberg, </em>further emphasized Maryland\u2019s high degree of conformity to federal income tax law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\"[T]he whole thrust of the Maryland [income tax] Act is to impose a tax on the amount determined under the Internal Revenue Code as the adjusted gross income of an individual or taxable income of a corporation. This is a formula or yardstick objectively derived which initially takes no account of the source, nature of composition of the funds; it is simply a figure developed by the federal return.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 204-205, 282 A.2d at 473. Maryland income tax law has consistently remained \"inextricably keyed\u201d to the Internal Revenue Code. <em>See Comptroller v. Diebold, Inc., </em>279 Md. 401, 408, 369 A.2d 77, 81 (1977) <em>(citing Marco Associates v. Comptroller, </em>265 Md. 669, 674, 291 A.2d 489, 492 (1973); <em>Katzenberg, supra </em>at 204, 282 A.2d at 472). See also Article 81, \u00a7304 (a) ..which direct? the Comptroller to \"apply as far as practicable the administration and judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>interpretations of the federal income tax law\u201d. Md. Code Ann. Art. 81, \u00a7304 (a) (1980 Repl. Vol.). Whereas federal law must enumerate and define items of income in a wide variety of factual situations, Maryland law, by virtue of its adoption of the federal law, need not.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Illustrative of this policy is the fact that the Internal Revenue Code provides definitions of numerous items which are to be taken into income, while such definitions are conspicuously absent in the Maryland income tax law. In Maryland the federal base is simply adopted. See Md. Code Ann. Art. 81, \u00a7\u00a7280 (a), 280A (a) (1980 Repl. Vol.). Consequently, various items such as capital losses, capital gains, and sales of property have not been specifically defined in Article 81. Therefore, an item appearing in a corporation\u2019s federal return as \"taxable income\u201d must be similarly reflected as \"net income\u201d in the corporation\u2019s Maryland return.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">As noted earlier, under I.R.C. \u00a71231, the gain Chesapeake recognized for the cutting of timber, pursuant to the \u00a7631 (a) election, was treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset. \"Capital gains\u201d and \"capital losses\u201d are defined in I.R.C. \u00a71222 in terms of a \"sale or exchange of a capital asset\u201d. Although the phrase \"capital gains and losses\u201d is repeatedly used in Article 81, \u00a7316 (b), it is never defined. Clearly the State legislature intended \"capital gains and losses\u201d under \u00a7316 (b) to have the same meaning as in the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, capital gain income under \u00a7 316 (b) 2 (A), including that derived from an I.R.C. \u00a7 631 (a) election, must be allocated to the situs state.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The Tax Court and Baltimore City Court appeared to have focused on the word \"sale\u201d appearing at the end of \u00a7 316 (b) 2 (A) and concluded that an actual sale was required. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>reading of \u00a7 316 (b) 2 (A), however, does not require an actual sale, particularly in view of this State\u2019s policy of conformity to the Internal Revenue Code. Under an I.R.C. \u00a7 631 (a) election, a <em>sale or exchange of timber has occurred </em>insofar as implementing federal capital gains tax consequences. Chesapeake\u2019s characterization of the sale as \"hypothetical\u201d does not, therefore, in our view, diminish the applicability of \u00a7 316 (b) 2 (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Although this is a case of first impression in Maryland, appellant and appellee have cited only two other cases in which the precise question before this Court has been addressed by the high courts of other States. Our research too has revealed that only our neighboring states to the north and south have discussed this issue. Under factual circumstances analogous to the case at bar, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and the Supreme Court of Virginia reached opposite conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Scott Paper Co., </em>425 Pa. 444, 228 A.2d 904 (1967), the corporate taxpayer was a major producer of paper products which had cut various quantities of timber owned by it and located outside the State of Pennsylvania. The timber cut had a fair market value of over $5,000,000. A quantity of this timber, valued at over $3,000,000, was used in the corporation\u2019s business operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Scott realized a capital gain of $4,414,021 on the timber used in its own business pursuant to the election provision under I.R.C. \u00a7631 (a), \u00a71231 (a), and \u00a71231 (b); the gain was computed by deducting the cost of the timber (adjusted basis for depletion) from the fair market value. <em>Id. </em>228 A.2d at 905. Scott\u2019s \u00a7631 (a) income was reported as \"net long-term capital gain\u201d and so included in its federal taxable income. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In its Pennsylvania corporate net income tax report, Scott allocated all of this gain outside the State under \u00a72 of the Pennsylvania\u2019s Corporate Net Income Tax Act. Section 2 provides that gains realized from the sale or exchange of tangible capital assets situated outside of Pennsylvania <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>shall be allocated entirely outside of Pennsylvania. 72 P.S. \u00a73420b. The State, however, treated the $4,414,021 as ordinary income subject to a regular three-part apportionment formula. Thus, under the State\u2019s approach at least part of this income would be diverted to Pennsylvania for tax purposes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania agreed with the state taxing authority and held that the corporation\u2019s \u00a7631 (a) gains were to be apportioned to Pennsylvania rather than allocated outside the state. Justice Cohen, writing for the court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\n<em>TW]e are not disposed to agree with Scott that that Pennsylvania statute was clearly written with both eyes on the Federal laws.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">We believe that the language of the C.'N.I. Act and the history of this language do not evidence a Legislative intent to deny the Commonwealth the right to make its own determination of what constitutes the sale or exchange of a capital asset giving rise to gain allocable as stated by the Act. While this determination may parallel the federal one in most cases, it is not automatically governed thereby but must be based on Pennsylvania\u2019s own decision as to what is a capital asset and what is a sale or exchange.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\"><em>Id., </em>228 A.2d at 908 (emphasis added). The Court made this decision although agreeing with the corporate taxpayer that <em>\"such an approach creates more dif\u00f1culties and uncertainties </em>in the administration of Pennsylvania tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>laws, but this is a matter for the legislature to correct if it so desires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In <em>Department of Taxation v. Champion International Corp., </em>220 Va. 981, 265 S.E.2d 720 (1980), one of the corporate taxpayers, Champion, was a New York corporation that manufactured and sold paper and building materials. In Virginia, Champion owned and operated a manufacturing plant and warehouses, and it owned land from which it harvested timber. The income of the corporation in controversy, however, was derived almost entirely from the cutting of timber grown outside of Virginia. <em>Id., </em>265 S.E.2d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Champion, in 1972, reported to Virginia income from timber transactions as capital gains in the amount of $29,046,941, of which only $122 represented gains from timber cut in Virginia. The corporation allocated the capital gains according to the situs; $122 was allocated to Virginia and the remaining sums were allocated outside the state. Va. Code \u00a758-151.039 (b) (1) (1974 Repl. Vol.).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Virginia\u2019s Department of Taxation conducted an audit and assessed a deficiency against Champion predicated upon its conclusion that all the income from timber transactions was apportionate and thereby subject to a three-factor formula rather than allocable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 58-151.041.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Champion had elected to treat the cutting of timber for sale or for use in its trade or business as a sale or exchange of such timber pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 631 (a). Under I.R.C. \u00a7 1231 (a) and \u00a7 1231 (b) Champion reported its \u00a7 631 (a) income on its 1972 federal income tax return as capital gains. <em>Champion, supra, </em>265 S.E.2d at 724. The Supreme Court of Virginia held that Champion\u2019s \u00a7 631 (a) income constituted allocable capital gains and cited \u00a7 58-151.01 (a) of the State code \"conforming the Virginia income law to the laws of the United States relating to federal income taxes.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>265 S.E.2d at 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">For several reasons we conclude that <em>Champion </em>is more persuasive in resolving the instant controversy than <em>Scott. </em>First, the pronouncements of the Court of Appeals in <em>Katzenberg, Marco Associates </em>and <em>Diebold, supra, </em>clearly indicate that Maryland has adopted and endorsed a \"doctrine of conformance\u201d between state and federal income tax law. 52 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 451, 452 (1967). Maryland income tax law is \"inextricably keyed\u201d to the Internal Revenue Code. <em>Diebold, supra. </em>Similarly, the Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>Champion </em>observed that a policy of \"conforming the Virginia income tax law to the laws of the United States relating to federal income taxes\u201d had been adopted. <em>Champion, supra, </em>265 S.E.2d at 725. Secondly, both the Maryland and Virginia legislatures have enacted.statutes declaring a policy of conformance with federal income tax law. <em>Compare </em>Md. Code Ann. Art. 81, \u00a7 304 (a) (1980 Repl. Vol.) <em>with </em>Va. Code \u00a7 58-151-01 (a) (1974 Repl. Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Finally, the approach adopted'by the court in <em>Scott </em>is contrary to the doctrine articulated by this State\u2019s judicial, executive, and legislative branches. Unlike Pennsylvania, we are convinced that Maryland income tax laws were written \"with both eyes on the federal tax laws\u201d. Furthermore, in finding that \"capital gains\u201d under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>federal tax system are \"capital gains\u201d under Md. Code Ann. Art. 81, \u00a7 316 (b),we avoid <em>Scott\u2019s </em>burdensome impact which the court admitted would \"create[] more difficulties and uncertainties in the administration [of that State\u2019s] income tax laws\u201d. <em>Scott, supra, </em>228 S.E.2d at 908. Our approach, consequently, will make the administration of Maryland income tax law easier from the standpoint of both the taxpayer and the Comptroller. We glean from <em>Scott </em>the court\u2019s uneasiness in conforming what it depicted as a complex package of federal \"artificial tax concepts\u201d to state income tax law. We, however, are not so constrained and reiterate the words of Judge Singley in <em>Katzenberg, supra </em>at 204-205, 282 A.2d at 473:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">\"[T]he whole thrust of the Maryland [income tax] Act is to impose a tax on the amount determined under the Internal Revenue Code as the adjusted gross income of an individual or the taxable income of a corporation. This is a formula or yardstick objectively derived which initially takes no account of the source, nature, or composition of the funds; it is simply a figure developed by the federal return.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We hold that Chesapeake\u2019s I.R.C. \u00a7631 (a) capital gains income should be allocated as capital gains under Article 81, \u00a7316 (b) 2 (A) rather than apportioned as general business income under \u00a7316 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">. \"If the taxpayer so elects on his return for a taxable year, the cutting of timber (for sale or for use in the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business) during such year by the taxpayer who owns, or has a contract right to cut, such timber ... shall be considered as a sale or exchange of such timber cut during such year.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 631 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\">.
