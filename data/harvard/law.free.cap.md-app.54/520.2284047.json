It presents to us two questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">(1) Can a dead person become an adoptive parent; <em>i.e., </em>is a decree of adoption valid if entered after the adoptive parent has died; and</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">(2) If such a decree is invalid, has the Legislature nevertheless insulated it against collateral attack after the expiration of one year?</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">On October 21, 1975, Denward Collins Ayres, then sixty-one years old, filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County in which he sought to adopt appellant, his forty-one year old stepson. The petition was prepared by a Salisbury attorney, Walter D. Webster, who attached to it the written consents of appellant\u2019s mother, then the petitioner\u2019s wife, and appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">The petition alleged that appellant\u2019s father had disappeared in 1936 and was presumed to be dead. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Nonetheless, in an apparent attempt to avoid any subsequent challenge should the natural father still be alive, the parties decided to give public notice of the proceeding in accordance with Maryland Rule D74. Upon petitioner\u2019s motion, however (also prepared by Mr. Webster), the court excused petitioner from giving the notice by publication in the newspaper (Maryland Rule 105b. 1) and instead, on October 22,1975, issued a show cause order noting the filing of the petition and directing,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\"that a copy of this Order be posted by the Sheriff of Wicomico County, Maryland, at the front door of the Court House of Wicomico County, Maryland, for a period of not less than sixty (60) days, giving notice to the public generally of the object and substance of the petition and warning anyone who may have an interest in these proceedings to show cause, if any there may be, on or before the <em>22nd </em>day of <em>January, </em>1976, why a Decree should not be passed as prayed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\"><em>See </em>Maryland Rule 105b.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">A copy of that order was, in- fact, posted on the Court House door by the sheriff on October 24, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">On January 23, 1976, the attorney, Mr. Webster, presented to the court a final order of adoption, declaring appellant to be the legally adopted son of Denward Collins Ayres and changing his (appellant\u2019s) name to Joseph Venables Ayres. Mr. Webster knew at the time that he presented the order that his client, the petitioner, had died on December 4, 1975 \u2014 some fifty days earlier, before even the sixty-day posting period expired \u2014 but he neglected to inform the court of that fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unaware of the petitioner\u2019s death and presuming that all procedural prerequisites had been satisfied, the court signed the order and then, in accordance with Maryland Rule D81, sealed the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>On April 23, 1982 \u2014 more than six years after these events occurred \u2014 John J. B. Ayres, appellee, alleging himself to be the natural son of Denward Collins Ayres, filed a petition to reopen the adoption proceeding and declare the adoption null and void. He averred that he did not become aware of the adoption until March, 1982, when, as an adopted child, appellant claimed a share in the estate of a collateral relative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petition noted that Denward Ayres had died on December 4,1975 \u2014 before the order of adoption was signed, asserted upon information and belief that the court was unaware of that fact when it signed the order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and argued that \"the presentation of said Order to the Court after the death of Denward Collins Ayres was improper and violated the rules of procedure and ethical responsibilities applicable thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Appellant, through Mr. Webster, responded to this petition with a demurrer in which he claimed that (1) there was no procedural irregularity in the adoption proceeding, (2) appellee had no standing to reopen the case, (3) Md. Code Ann. art. 16, \u00a7 79 prohibits any attempt to invalidate a final decree of adoption after one year, and (4) appellee\u2019s petition was barred by laches. The court overruled the demurrer. In an Opinion and Order entered on June 28, 1982, it stated that the court had <em>not </em>been notified of Denward Ayres\u2019 death prior to signing the adoption order. It concluded that it was \"incumbent upon the parties to bring to the Court\u2019s attention the death of one of the primary parties to the adop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>tion,\u201d that \"[s]uch a failure is unjustified and inexcusable,\u201d and that it \"suggests] a grave irregularity in the adoption process.\u201d Acting pursuant to Maryland Rule 625a and upon the authority of <em>Falck </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>190 Md. 461 (1948) and <em>McClary </em>v. <em>Follett, Jr., </em>226 Md. 436 (1961), the court determined that it had the power to reopen the case and vacate the adoption order.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The actual exercise of that authority came on August 31, 1982, in response to appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In a further Opinion and Order, the court confirmed its earlier conclusions, declared the adoption order a nullity, and determined that, as a result, \"neither [appellee\u2019s] standing nor laches are relevant questions.\u201d The court, it said, could and should declare the order null and void <em>sua sponte, </em>which it then'proceeded to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In this appeal, appellant raises essentially the same issues he raised below, which we shall discuss in the context of the questions framed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">(1) <em>Can A Dead Person Become An Adoptive </em>Parent?</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The underlying issue here, of course, is whether the death of the petitioner \u2014 the would-be adoptive parent \u2014 abated the adoption proceeding so as to nullify, or render ineffective, any decree unwittingly entered thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">The general rule regarding the abatement of equity actions derives from Md. Code Ann. Courts art., \u00a7 6-401(b) and Maryland Rule 220b. The Code provision states that \"[a] right of action in equity survives the death of either party if the court can grant effective relief in spite of the death.\u201d The Rule provides that \"[a]n action in equity shall not abate by the death of a party thereto, where the right involved in the action survives.\u201d Read together, what these provisions mean is that the action survives if the right survives and the right survives if the court can continue to grant effective relief. Restated; the conclusion of this categorical syllogism is that an equity action will abate upon the death of a party unless the court can continue to grant effective relief in spite of the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">It is self-evident that, under this standard, an adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>proceeding must necessarily abate upon the death of the would-be adoptive parent. Whether the purpose of the adoption be the normal one of assuming the deeply personal and continuing role of parent or merely to confer upon a stranger the status of heir <em>(see Ex Parte Libertini, </em>244 Md. 542 (1966)), it becomes incapable of fulfillment once the would-be parent has died. Upon that event, therefore, the court loses its ability \"to grant effective relief.\u201d <em>See Besche v. Murphy, </em>190 Md. 539, 552 (1948), where, in <em>dicta, </em>the Court stated unequivocally that \"we cannot declare an adoption after the death of the [would-be adoptive parent].\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also McCurley, Ex\u2019r. </em>v. <em>McCurley, </em>60 Md. 185 (1883) and <em>Corte v. Cucchiara, </em>257 Md. 14 (1970), concluding that a divorce action abates upon the death of one of the parties, and <em>In Re Estate of Freud, </em>331 N.Y.S.2d 224 (1972), where, in a case remarkably similar to the one at bar, the Westchester County Surrogate\u2019s Court held, at pp. 225-26:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">\"The fundamental purpose of an adoption is to establish the relationship of parent and child between living human beings. The proceeding is distinctly personal in nature and, therefore, abates upon the death of either the adoptive parent or the child. The 'adoption does not become final until the order of the court. ..\u2019 and can never become final if either the adoptor or adoptee dies before the order is signed. Any adoption order made thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>whether purporting to speak <em>nunc pro tunc </em>or not, is necessarily void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>See also In Re Estate of Conway, </em>346 N.Y.S.2d 682 (N.Y.Co.Surr.Ct. 1973), and <em>cf. In Re Adoption of Bradfield, </em>642 P.2d 214 (N.M.App. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The holding in <em>Freud </em>is entirely consistent with the pronouncements in <em>Besche, McCurley, </em>and <em>Corte, </em>and we think it is expressive of the Maryland law. <em>Compare </em>Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 210, \u00a7 6B and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(e), as interpreted in <em>Williams v. Richardson, </em>523 F.2d 999 (2d Cir. 1975), in which, under certain circumstances, an adoption is statutorily permitted, or recognized, after the death of the adoptive parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">(2) Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Although conceding at oral argument that, had the court known of the death of Denward Collins Ayres, it would not have signed the adoption order, appellant nonetheless defends the attack against it on the basis of Md. Code Ann. art. 16, \u00a7 79, which is part of the State adoption law. Section 79 provides: \"No attempt to invalidate a final decree of adopting <em>by reason of any jurisdictional or procedural defect </em>shall be received by the court, or by any court of this State, unless regularly filed with such court within one year following the entry of the final decree.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Section 79 is not a particularly easy statute to interpret, especially in light of its history.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">The preceding adoption law (Md. Code Ann. (1939), art. 16, \u00a7\u00a7 78-84) contained no special provisions regarding the reopening of final decrees. By judicial construction, adoption decrees were treated in the same manner as other equity decrees; <em>i.e., </em>\"[i]n adoption cases, as in other equity proceedings, a decree will not be revoked after it is enrolled in the absence of fraud, mistake, surprise, or irregularity in its obtention, but will be considered as final and binding.\u201d <em>Falck v. Chadwick, </em>190 Md. 461, 467 (1948). In <em>Falck, </em>which was decided after the enactment of \u00a7 79, but on the basis of the preexisting law, the Court found sufficient evidence of fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>to permit the reopening of an enrolled adoption decree; <em>compare Backus </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>159 Md. 601 (1930), where the same rule was applied but none of the enumerated deficiencies were found to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Section 79 was enacted in 1947 as part of a general revision of the State adoption laws. The new Act was the product of a gubernatorial study commission, and \u00a7 79 was adopted by the Legislature exactly as proposed by that commission. <em>See Tentative Report Of The Commission To Study Revision Of Adoption Laws, </em>Daily Record, June 1, 1946, p. 2; <em>also </em>1947 Md. Laws, ch. 599, \u00a7 85L.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The commission report is silent as to the exact function and meaning of \u00a7 79. The only contemporary discussion of that section still surviving in the public domain appears in a law review article authored by Professor Strahorn, who was a consultant to the commission; and that is none too illuminating. <em>See Changes Made By The New Adoption Law, </em>John S. Strahorn, Jr., 10 Md.L.Rev. 20 (1949). The relevant passage appears at pp. 43-45:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\"While the old statute had no provision as such for the revocation of an adoption once granted, and left the possibility to be that of either a new adoption by the original family, or an attack on the adoption for fraud in its original obtention, the new statute has more explicit terminology about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">[Slection 85L [now \u00a7 79] ... provides that no attempt to invalidate a final decree for its jurisdictional or procedural defects shall be received by any court unless filed within one year following the entry of the final decree. While this may not have been intended to extend the possibility of revocation, as such, which did not exist under the older statute, yet it certainly puts a limitation on any attempt at revocation, to the extent to which such attempt is possible. Thus it is that, subject to the changes in these connections, applicable only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>part of the State, the seven counties are exempt from this,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] the possibility of revocation has not been very much changed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Section 79 has been before the Court of Appeals on but one occasion. In <em>McClary v. Follett, Jr., </em>226 Md. 436 (1961), the natural father of a child was successful, on the ground of fraud, in vacating an adoption decree that had been entered more than a year earlier. The child\u2019s mother, who had temporary custody following the separation of the parties, put the child up for adoption without the father\u2019s knowledge. The mother falsely swore that she was unmarried, that the child had been born out of wedlock, and that she did not know the whereabouts of his father. The father made diligent efforts to locate his son, but did not learn of the adoption until some seventeen months after the final decree was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The chancellor, finding that the mother had perpetrated a \"gross fraud,\u201d determined that \"irrespective of the provisions of Section 79 .. . due to the fraud and lack of notice or consent, the decree of adoption should be declared null and void.\u201d 226 Md. at 439. The adoptive parents, who were nearly as much the innocent victims of the fraud as the natural father, appealed, primarily on the basis that the father had abandoned the child and that the mother\u2019s fraud had no material bearing on their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The Court of Appeals rejected the \"abandonment\u201d argument. Though acknowledging, and indeed quoting, \u00a7 79, the Court deftly sidestepped it. At p. 441:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\"The appellant\u2019s contention here [abandonment] ... makes it unnecessary for us to determine, at this time, the exact meaning of the provisions of said Section 79, and how far the legislature may preclude the courts from opening, after a prescribed length of time, their judgments that have been rendered as the result of fraud perpetrated upon them, particularly when that fraud has resulted in a 'jurisdictional\u2019 defect as the word 'jurisdiction\u2019 is used in its primary, or fundamental, sense, so we leave the questions open.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We do not have the privilege of the <em>McClary </em>Court of continuing to leave these questions open. Section 79 is squarely before us, and we must deal with it. In doing so, however, we need not remain oblivious to what the Court in fact did in <em>McClary; </em>though expressly declining to address \u00a7 79, it sanctioned the vacating of a final adoption order more than one year after its entry notwithstanding that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">We regret that the <em>McClary </em>Court did not consider the implications of \u00a7 79, as it could easily have reached the same result, in a manner consistent with its earlier decisions in <em>Falck </em>v. <em>Chadwick </em>and <em>Backus v. Reynolds, </em>both <em>supra, </em>by doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Those earlier cases, it will be recalled, treated adoption decrees in the same manner as other equity decrees, and recognized that, even after enrollment, the court could set them aside for fraud, mistake, surprise, or irregularity. That general authority, of course, remains extant in the form of Maryland Rule 625a and Md. Code Ann. Courts art., \u00a7 6-408, the only difference being that \"surprise\u201d is no longer regarded as an independent ground, but is regarded as being in the nature of an \"irregularity.\u201d See <em>Tasea Investment Corp. v. Dale, </em>222 Md. 474, 478 (1960); <em>Cohen v. Investors Funding Corp., </em>267 Md. 537, 540 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">It is not uncommon for States to have special statutes of limitations applicable to final adoption orders, but, unlike its counterparts in several other States, \u00a7 79 is a very limited statute. The Uniform Adoption Act (1969), for example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>provides in \u00a7 15 that, after a specified period and with limited exceptions, a final adoption decree \"cannot be questioned by any person ... in any manner upon any ground, including fraud, misrepresentation, failure to give any required notice, or lack of jurisdiction of the parties or of the subject matter____\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Ala. Code (1982 Supp.), \u00a7 26-10-5(c), precluding attacks after five years \"because of any irregularity, infirmity or defect in the adoption proceedings\u201d; Neb. Rev. Stat. (1978 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 43-116, creating a <em>conclusive </em>presumption that after two years the adoption and the proceedings in connection with it \"are valid in all respects notwithstanding some defect or defects may appear on the face of the record\u201d; and N. C. Gen. Stat. (1976 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 48-28(a), precluding attacks on an adoption decree \"by reason of any defect or irregularity therein, jurisdictional or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">In sharp contrast to these counterparts, \u00a7 79, enacted by a Legislature that was presumably cognizant of <em>Backus, </em>is much more limited. It does not purport to insulate adoption decrees against attack for fraud, or even for mistake, but only \"by reason of any jurisdictional or procedural defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The fraud found to exist in <em>McClary </em>was of the \"extrinsic\u201d type. The father had \"been prevented from exhibiting fully his case, by fraud or deception practiced on him by his opponent, as by keeping him away from court... [he] never had knowledge of the suit, being kept in ignorance by the acts of the plaintiff....\u201d <em>United States v. Throckmorton, </em>98 U.S. 61, 65-66 (1878). That is precisely the kind of fraud that will justify a court, under what was formerly its inherent authority and now under Maryland Rule 625a and Courts art., \u00a7 6-408, in reopening and vacating an enrolled decree. <em>See Schwartz v. Merchants Mort. Co., </em>272 Md. 305 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Thus, the <em>McClary </em>factual setting illustrates that, while there is certainly an area of overlap, \u00a7 79 is not entirely and irreconcilably inconsistent with the court\u2019s broader revisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>power under Rule 625a or \u00a7 6-408, which continue to be applicable to <em>all </em>judgments and decrees, in law and in equity. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Beltway Homes, Inc., </em>276 Md. 382 (1975); <em>Owen v. Freeman, </em>279 Md. 241 (1977). <em>See also Haskell v. Carey, </em>294 Md. 550 (1982); <em>Adoption of Sewall, </em>242 Cal.App.2d 208 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">That analysis, though important to an understanding of the proper scope and relationship of \u00a7 79, does not directly resolve the problem now before us. What the circuit court termed a \"grave irregularity\u201d was nothing short of a fraud. But it appears to have been more of an \"intrinsic\u201d fraud committed upon the court in the course of the judicial proceeding rather than the \"extrinsic\u201d type of fraud evident in <em>McClary; </em>and the law is clear that the court\u2019s authority under Maryland Rule 625a or \u00a7 6-408 to revise an enrolled decree for fraud is limited to the \"extrinsic\u201d type of fraud. <em>See Schwartz </em>v. <em>Merchants Mort. Co., supra, </em>272 Md. 305. The court\u2019s reliance upon <em>Falck </em>and <em>McClary, </em>therefore, was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">That is not to say, however, that the court\u2019s ultimate action was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">An event, or series of events, can have more than one effect, more than one legal implication; and that is the case here. The attorney\u2019s deception \u2014 his concealment of the petitioner\u2019s death \u2014 constituted an intrinsic fraud upon the court which may be beyond remedy under the court\u2019s general revisory power. But the petitioner\u2019s death itself had an independent significance. It abated the action because, as we have concluded, it prevented the court, as a matter of law, from granting further effective relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">A dead person cannot become an adoptive parent because it is naturally and physically impossible for him to discharge any of the duties or accept any of the benefits of that relational status; and a court, whatever its other jurisdictional attributes, can no more wipe away or overcome that impossibility with a piece of paper than it can rearrange the stars or change the tides. The very effort is an entirely futile gesture.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Although the decisions as to whether a defective judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>is void or voidable are not free from conflict, as Freeman points out (1 <em>Freeman On Judgments, </em>\u00a7 325), \"[w]ant of power to grant the relief contained in the judgment\u201d generally renders the judgment a nullity, void on its face. The status of such a void judgment is aptly described by Freeman, \u00a7 322, as quoted by the Court in <em>Fooks\u2019 Executors v. Ghingher, </em>172 Md. 612, 619 (1937):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\"A judgment void upon its face and requiring only an inspection of the record to demonstrate its invalidity is a mere nullity, in legal effect no judgment at all, conferring no right and affording no justification. Nothing can be acquired or lost by it; it neither bestows nor extinguishes any right, and may be successfully assailed whenever it is offered as the foundation for the assertion of any claim or title. It neither binds nor bars any one. All acts performed under it and all claims flowing out of it are void. The parties attempting to enforce it may be responsible as trespassers. The purchaser at a sale by virtue of its authority finds himself without title and without redress. No action upon the part of the plaintiff, no inaction upon the part of the defendant, no resulting equity in the hands of third persons, no power residing in any legislative or other department of the government can invest it with any of the elements of power or of vitality. * * * Such a judgment has been characterized as a dead limb upon the judicial tree, which may be chopped off at any time, capable of bearing no fruit to plaintiff but constituting a constant menace to defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\"><em>See also Hughes v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, </em>383 P.2d 55 (Or. 1963), but <em>compare Husband (G.T.B.) v. Wife (G.R.), </em>424 A.2d 12 (Del. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">That was the nature of the adoption order entered in January, 1976. Although the court formally vacated that order, it did not need to be vacated because it never had life. It was stillborn; there never coursed in its veins anything more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>than embalming fluid. The court\u2019s action, then, was but a perfunctory surplusage designed only to straighten out the court records and clarify that the status of the parties had never changed. Such an action did not need to rest upon the authority of Maryland Rule 625a or \u00a7 6-408; and neither \u00a7 79, laches, nor appellee\u2019s asserted lack of \"standing\u201d to bring the matter to the court\u2019s attention can suffice to prevent or invalidate it. The order did not \"invalidate\u201d the adoption, which is what \u00a7 79 purports to preclude if based on \"jurisdictional or procedural defect\u201d; it simply declared that the adoption never happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Finally, as a cautionary note to trial courts, this case illustrates rather clearly the potential hazards in entering final adoption orders without ever laying eyes on the parties. It is, of course, possible for a party \u2014 either parent or child \u2014 to die in the brief interim between an appearance before the court and entry of the decree; but, as a practical matter, the opportunity for fraud, mistake, or irregularity would, it seems to us, be greatly lessened if the court were to require a personal appearance by the parties (or, in the case of a young child, someone on the child\u2019s behalf) before issuing a final order. Trial courts would thus be prudent to regard Maryland Rule D77 (\"The court shall hold such hearing as justice may require.

In his 1975 petition, Denward Collins Ayres acknowledged that he had a natural son, John James Ayres, then thirty-eight years old, who resided in Amherst, Massachusetts. No other children or blood relatives of any kind were mentioned in the petition. Although Maryland Rule D74c.2 permitted service of the adoption petition upon appellee, as a next-of-kin, no such service was required by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">. Because the court file had been sealed, appellee\u2019s averments were largely based upon collateral information. His petition alleged that, through counsel, he had contacted Mr. Webster, and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\"Mr. Webster advised that he was the attorney for Denward Collins Ayres in said [adoption] Petition but stated that the adoption took place several years prior to Mr. Ayres\u2019 death, but when advised of the facts herein, Stated that he had little recollection of the case due to the passage of time and did not hereafter [sic] deny the facts herein alleged.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b557-5\">. <em>Besche v. Murphy </em>involved an attempt by the complainant to take under the will of a testatrix as an adopted child. Although she had never formally been adopted by the testatrix, the complainant alleged that, since childhood, she had lived with the testatrix and that the testatrix had expressly agreed to adopt her and had always regarded her as an adopted daughter. In light of that, she argued a theory of \"equitable adoption,\u201d claiming the same right of inheritance as though she had been legally adopted. The Court rejected that claim on the basis that, because the complainant was seeking to take under the will and not as an heir at law, for the Court to recognize the claim would be tantamout to rewriting the will. <em>See </em>190 Md. at 552. It was in that context that the Court ended its Opinion <em>thusly:\"Since we cannot declare an adoption after the death of the testatrix, </em>and in the absence of such adoption the appellant does not come within, or constitute the class of those to whom the property is left, the decree will have to he affirmed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>552.

Since the Act also repealed the preexisting adoption laws, that created some concern as to what law prevailed in those seven counties. A curative Act was quickly passed at a special session of the Legislature in the fall of 1947, which exempted the seven counties from certain provisions of the new law, including the predecessor to \u00a7 79, and, in lieu thereof, resurrected the law previously in effect for those subdivisions. It was not until July 1,1982, that the last of the exemptions was repealed and the full Act became applicable Statewide. <em>See </em>1982 Md. Laws, ch. 514, repealing Md. Code Ann. art. 16, \u00a7 88. As of June 30, 1982, four counties remained exempt from \u00a7 79. As the order revoking the adoption order was not entered until after July 1, 1982, however, we need not consider the latent \"equal protection\u201d issue which may arise from the exemptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b562-10\">. 9 U.L.A. 1 (1982 Supp.) reports that the Uniform Adoption Act has been adopted in Arkansas, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, and Oklahoma.
