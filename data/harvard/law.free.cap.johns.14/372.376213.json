This, we think, is all that was necessary. It is enough to prevent surprise on the defendant, and gives him all that is necessary to enable him to plead, and defend the action. <em>Profer\u00ed </em>of the deed being made, he is entitled to <em>oyer, </em>and thereby obtains every particularity he can want. This mode of declaring is sanctioned by the cases, and highly approved by Sergeant <em>Williams, </em>in his notes to <em>Saunders. </em>(1 <em>Saund. </em>233. n. 2.) Courts very much discountenance unnecessary prolixity of pleading; and, therefore, says he, in an action of covenant for non-payment of rent, it is sufficient to allege in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the declaration, that the plaintiff, on such a day and year, at such a place, by a certain indenture made between him of the one part, and the defendant of the other part, (which the plaintiff brings here into court,) demised to the defendant certain premises partic'ularly mentioned and described in the said in denture, without setting out particularly the parcels of land demised. (2 Chitt11's Fl. 192. n. (i.) If this be a sound rule in covenant for non-payment of rent, it is equally applicable to the case before us. We are, accordingly, of opinion, that the declaration is sufficient, and that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
