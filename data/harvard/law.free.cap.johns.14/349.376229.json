Butler </em>brought an action of <em>assumpsit </em>against Campbell, in the court below. One <em>James Low </em>was in treaty with <em>Butler, </em>(the plaintiff below,) for the purchase of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>a horse and waggon, w'hich <em>Butler </em>agreed to sell to <em>Low </em>for ISO dollars, provided he could give security for the payment of the money; and <em>Low </em>offered, as security, to give <em>John Harvey </em>and <em>William Campbell, </em>(the defendant below,) as endorsers of two notes, to be drawn by <em>Low, </em>one for 100 dollars, and the other for 50 dollars, which <em>Butler </em>agreed to accept, and the notes were accordingly drawn and endorsed by Harvey, and afterwards by Campbell, who was not then present. The first note was paid, and the action was brought on the second note for 50 <em>dollars.\u2014Harvey, </em>who was a witness, testified that he and <em>Campbell </em>endorsed the notes, to give <em>Low </em>credit with <em>Butler, </em>upon the purchase of the horse and waggon, and to secure the payment of the 150 dollars* to <em>Butler.'</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-4\">The note was made by <em>Low, </em>payable on the 1st day of <em>May,' </em>(then) next, to <em>James Butler, </em>or order; and when produced at the trial, was endorsed, as follows: \u201c For value received, I undertake and promise to guaranty the payment of the money within mentioned, to the within named <em>James Butler. </em>John Harvey.\u201d\u2014\u201c For value received, I undertake and promise to guaranty the payment of the money within mentioned, to the within named <em>James Butler. </em>William Campbell.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AIW\">It was admitted that the note was endorsed by <em>Harvey Be Campbell, </em>in blank, but being made payable to <em>Butler, </em>(by mistake, as he alleged,) he had, afterwards, for the purpose of bringing his suit against the endorsers, written over their names, respectively, the <em>guaranty, </em>above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-6\">The defendant moved for a non-suit, which was\" refused by the court below, who were of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and directed the jury accordingly, who found a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant tendered a bill of exceptions, on which the writ of error was brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-14\"><em>Vanderheyden, </em>for the plaintiff in error, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2T\">1.

The contract proved varied from the one laid in the declaration.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The note was endorsed in blank. By filling up the endorsement, with this special guaranty, the contract i\u00ae varied, and the rights of the defendant, as endorser, are maternally alter\u00e9d. The defendant is liable, as a mere endorser, on cert lain conditions only, as to due notice, See. but by the guaranty he is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>liable at all events; and without any recourse against the prior endorser. The holder has no right to convert the engagement of a mere endorser into a guaranty. In <em>Josselyn v. Ames,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the supreme court of <em>Massachusetts </em>would not permit the plaintiff to recover on such a guaranty; though they said he might write over an express promise to pay the money, for value received.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-4\"><em>[Spencer J. </em>We have decided this very point in <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Dubois, </em><footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark>]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-11\">Henry, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUZm\">insisted, that the sale to <em>Low </em>being on the express condition that he should find security, and the defendant and <em>Harvey </em>consenting to become security, they must be considered as sureties. . If they are not to be deemed guarantors, the contract made with the plaintiff below will not be fulfilled. <em>Harvey, </em>the first guarantor, has no interest in the suit against <em>Campbell.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-12\">The plain I iff had a right to fill up the blank, so as to render the defendant below liable as a guarantor or surety.
