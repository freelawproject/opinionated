A <em>venire facias de novo </em>being awarded out of this court, the cause was tried before Mr. J. <em>Yates, </em>at the <em>Dutchess </em>circuit, in <em>September, </em>1816.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ArR\">The plaintiffs declared for services rendered to the defendant\u2019s intestate, as his attorneys. The defendant pleaded several debts of the intestate, by specialty, due the defendant and others, amounting to about 900 dollars, and a debt, by simple contract, <em>a </em>. i \u2022 \u2022 diieto the defendant, or 100 dollars, and that he had iully adminis<em>7 </em>v e tered, except goods and chatties of small value; to wit, of the value of one dollar. &amp;c. The plaintiffs replied, that the defendant had goods and chattels beyond the assets confessed, and more than sufficient to satisfy the debts mentioned in the plea, wherewith he could have satisfied the plaintiffs, and tendered an issue to the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-qh\">At the trial, evidence was given on the part of the plaintiffs, <em>to </em>show the sufficiency <em>of </em>the assets, which was opposed by testim0ny on the part of the defendant. <em>James Grant, </em>a witness for <em>J 1 </em>* the defendant, testified, that he was executor of <em>Richard Howard* 71 </em>7 sen the father of the defendant\u2019s intestate, and that the defendant, as administrator, had often applied to him for the payment \u00b0f an obligation of about 2000 dollars, from the defendant to <em>R. Howard, </em>sen. which the witness had always refused, and that the defendent commenced a suit thereon, against the witness, which was pending. The witness, on being cross-examined, testified, that his ground for resisting it was, that <em>R. Howard </em>was a very old man, and sometime before his death was not competent to do business, and also that the witness had a set-off: but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>being informed of the date of the obligation, the witness admit-led that his testator might, at that time, have been competent to give it. The witness had on hand as executor 1,200 dollars. It appeared that the defendant was not entitled to charge more than the sun of 719 dollars 65 cents, to the estate, for money, expended by him, and that he had received the sum of 1179 dollars 12 cents; this, with the addition of the assets in the hands of <em>Grant, </em>his father\u2019s executor, would amount to above 2300 dollars. The demand of the plaintiffs, was 106 dollars and 81 cents. It was proved on the part of the plaintiffs, that the defendant had never filed an inventory, and they gave in evidence a judgment in the court of common pleas of <em>Dutchess </em>county, against the defendant, as administrator, in favour of one <em>Stevens, </em>on a simple contract debt due from the intestate. The <em>capias </em>in that suit was issued a few days after the present action was commenced, and the defendant gave a <em>cognovit </em>therein, by which he confessed damages to the amount of 110 dollars, for which sum, with costs, judgment was entered against him, in <em>July A </em>815.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiffs, subject to the opinion of the court, on a case containing the above facts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-6\"><em>P.

Under a plea of <em>plene administravii, </em>the defendant may give in evidence all previous payments. If the plaintiff elects to take issue on the plea of assets, he can only take judgment for assets in <em>futuro, </em>after debts of a higher grade pleaded, are paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmV\">The neglect to file an inventory merely affords a presumption of assets, which may be repelled by proof. It is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence against the administrator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADq\">The case of <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Layton, </em>as reported by Lord <em>Raymond,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>explains the meaning of the fourth position in the report of the same case in <em>Salkeld, </em>and the case is commented on by <em>Buller, J. </em>who gives a report of it from a MS. of Lord <em>Holt, </em>in <em>Erving </em>v. Peters.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> The report in <em>Salkeld, </em>is no authority for that case, when we have the report of Lord <em>Holt </em>himself. The principle is, that if the administrator suffers judgment to go, by default, against him, he admits assets, to the amount of that judgment, as between him and the plaintiff. To that extent he is es-topped, and no further; it is no estoppel in other suits brought by other persons.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\"><em> Taller's L&gt; of Ex. 250. 251. 4.

The principal question in this cause is, whether the confession of the judgment to <em>Stevens, </em>concludes the defendant, on the question of assets ? This suit was commenced before that of <em>Stevens ; </em>0 and if there were no other debts against the estate; of the intestate, than those of the plaintiff and <em>Stevens, </em>there is no doubt but that the plaintiffs would be entitled to satisfaction of their demand. By commencing this suit before <em>Stevens, </em>the plaintiffs acquired a right to priority of satisfaction over him, the debts being of the same degree; for although an executor has a right to prefer one creditor to another of the same degree, yet this right is restrained and controlled by the commencement of an action against him; and he is not, in that case, warranted -,n making a voluntary payment of such other debt, to defeat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the party of his remedy. When two creditors, in equal degree, \"both commence actions, he who recovers judgment first, is to be satisfied first; and even in the last mentioned case, the right to give a preference still exists, for the executor may confess a judgment to the one. and plead such judgment in bar to the action of the other; but he is bound to plead it, and if he omits to do so, he cannot lake advantage of it in any other way. In this case, then, if there were no other debts, the plaintiff would not be devested of his prior right to satisfaction, for the defendant has omitted to plead the judgment confessed to Stevens, and that he had no assets <em>ultra. </em>This doctrine will be found in the case of <em>Rock </em>v. Leighton, (1 <em>Salk. </em>310. S. C. 1 Lord <em>Raym </em>58.) Probably the best report of this case is by Lord <em>Holt </em>himself, which will be found in <em>Erving </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>(3 <em>Term Rep. </em>689.,) in the opinion of Mr. Justice <em>Buller, </em>who read a note of it from Lord <em>Holt's </em>manuscript. That case, and the case of <em>Platt </em>v. <em>The Administrators of Smith, </em>in this court, (1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>276.,) as well as others, also show, what is very well settled and known, that if a judgment is recovered against an executor, by default, on confession, such judgment is an admission of <em>assets </em>to the amount of the sum recovered; and that in a suit upon it, suggesting a <em>devastavit, </em>the production of the record of such judgment would be conclusive of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">But, in this case, it is attempted to push this principle much farther; it is said that, notwithstanding the defendant has pleaded <em>plene administravit, </em>yet, that the confession of the judgment to <em>Stevens, </em>is an estoppel, not only as between the defendant and <em>Stevens, </em>but, also, as between the parties to this suit. This is a doctrine not to be found in any of the cases that have been cited; and, as I apprehend, is not well founded. The defendant here has pleaded outstanding specialties, and a debt due to himself, sufficient to exhaust all the assets that have ever come to his hands. The replication puts the latter fact only in issue, thereby admitting the debt as pleaded ; and upon this issue, the parties proceed to trial. The defendant, upon the trial, (as may be assumed for the purpose of discussing this point,) proved that he had no assets beyond the debts specified in his plea; now it seems to me the necessary consequence would be, that the defendant is entitled to judgment. The confession of the judgment by the defendant to <em>Stevens, </em>is conclusive as between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>them, that the assets were sufficient to discharge it; but these plaintiffs were neither parties nor privies to that judgment, and it does not, therefore, estop the defendant from showing the truth of the fact in this suit. On the question put in issue by the pleadings, it may well be, that the confession of the judgment to <em>Stevens, </em>might properly have been submitted to the jury, as a strong, though not a conclusive, circumstance, to show that the defendant had assets, over and above the debt specified in his plea, sufficient to satisfy the demand due to the plaintiffs. <em>Valeat quantum valere potest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">It appears to me, that the case of <em>Rock </em>v. Leighton, so much relied upon in behalf of the plaintiffs, has been altogether misapprehended. There, two suits had been brought against the administratrix, one by her brother, <em>Pyke, </em>and the other by <em>Pugh. </em>In the first, <em>Pyke </em>recovered judgment against her, by <em>nil </em>dicit, and in the other she let judgment go by <em>default; </em>and a material fact stated is, that the whole amount of assets was 279/. not sufficient to pay the first judgment. Upo'n this state of facts, the court decided, that by <em>letting judgment go by default </em>in the one case, when she might have pleaded the judgment in the other, with <em>riens inter mains ultra </em>to satisfy it, which would have been a good bar, she tacitly admitted, that she had assets <em>ultra, </em>and was, therefore, concluded by such her admission. And Lord <em>Holt </em>(I quote from <em>Buller\u2019s </em>opinion in <em>Erving </em>v. Peters) says, \u201c So the plaintiff (the administratrix) might have pleaded the judgment at her brother\u2019s suit; that would have defended the <em>assets </em>that she had, against the action brought by <em>Pugh; </em>but she, having admitted the assets she had to be liable to the action by <em>Pugh, by letting judgment go by nihil dicit, </em>is in the same condition as if there had been no judgment against her at her brother\u2019s suit.\u201d The decision in that case is simply this, that as there were assets proved to the amount of 279/. and but two debts against the estate, for which two suits were pending at the same time, and in which both the plaintiffs obtained judgment; that the administratrix was liable to pay both, on the ground of her omitting to plead the judgment first obtained by <em>nil dicit, </em>and <em>suffering a judgment to go against her by default </em>in the last, which was an admission of assets, by estoppel, sufficient to satisfy both. The administratrix was held to be liable, not because she had suffered judgment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>nil dicit, </em>in the suit against her in favour of <em>Pyke, </em>but because she had not pleaded that judgment in bar, and thus made out a complete <em>plene administravit; </em>and because in the suit in favour of <em>Pugh, </em>the judgment by default was an estoppel, and concluded her from showing the truth of the fact; namely, that the judgment in favour of <em>Pyke </em>was sufficient to exhaust the whole of the assets. This case then proves, that the administratrix might have pleaded <em>plene administravit, </em>and that her suffering judgment by <em>nil dicit, </em>at the suit of <em>Pyke, </em>formed no part of the ground upon which the decision was founded; but, on the contrary, that she was in the same condition, as if there had been no such judgment against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Let us now see how these principles affect this case. Here was a judgment in favour of Stevens, which the defendant might have pleaded, if he pleased, and was bound to plead it, had it been necessary to show that he had fully administered. Instead of suffering judgment to go by default, (as in the case of <em>Rock </em>v. Leighton,) which would have concluded him, the defendant pleads a special plea of <em>plene administravit, </em>upon which the plaintiffs took issue, and, on the trial, the defendant proved, that, independently of the judgment in favour of <em>Stevens, </em>there were other debts, (that is to say, the debts specified in his plea,) entitled to priority of satisfaction, exceeding the whole amount of the assets. The plaintiff says he has no right to show this, because he is estopped by confessing judgment to Stevens. This is incorrect, because it has already been shown, by the case relied upon by the plaintiffs, that that judgment is no estoppel as to any other persons, than the parties to it; and because the same case proves, that if the amount of the judgment in favour of <em>Stevens </em>had been sufficient to exhaust the assets in the hands of the defendant, so far is it from being conclusive against him, he might have pleaded it in bar to this very action. It would be most unjust, then, that because an executor has confessed a judgment in one case, by which he has made himself liable to pay a debt out of his own estate, that he should, thnefore. be precluded from showing that, independently of the judgment so confessed, he has faithfully applied all the effects which came to his hands to the discharge of other debts due. from his testator. 1 think, therefore, that, upon this ground, the plaintiffs have no right to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The other points that have been made by the plaintiff are of minor importance, and equally untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">If the demands in favour of the intestate against <em>Grant, </em>the executor of <em>Richard Howard, </em>the elder, are to be considered assets in the hands of the defendant, he has failed to make out his defence; that this debt has ever been received, is not pretended, and there is no reason to believe that it might have been collected by barely demanding it, or that there has been wilful or gross negligence, or carelesness, on the part of the defendant, by which the collection of it has been collusively, fraudulently, or unreasonably delayed. I perceive no ground, therefore, on which to decide that these demands are to be considered as assets in the hands of the defendant. <em>Grant\u2019s </em>testimony discloses the actual state of them; there is no good reason for imputing negligence to the executor, in not having done more than he has done to enforce, the payment of them. Whether they are at all recoverable, cannot now be certainly determined. If these demands are laid out of the case, then the defendant has abundantly established his plea, after making all deductions contended for by the plaintiffs, and giving them the benefit of all the unfavourable inferences to be made against the defendant, from his neglect to file an inventory, upon which, however, much greater stress has been laid in this particular case, than the facts and circumstances will warrant. We are of opinion, accordingly, that the defendant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
