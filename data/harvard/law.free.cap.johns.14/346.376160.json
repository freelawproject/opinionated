After judgment was recovered against him, execution issued, and he was discharged, in <em>March </em>last, from the execution, pursuant to an act of the legislature of <em>Massachusetts, </em>for the relief of insolvent debtors. That suit, though in the names of <em>Sherman, </em>Porter, <em>&amp; Co. </em>was for the sole benefit, and at the sole expense of the plaintiff, who was liable to' them as endorser, and had engaged to indemnify them for bringing the suit. It appeared, from the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, that he had since paid the amount of the bill. The defendant, on his arrival in <em>New York, </em>in <em>September </em>last, was arrested and imprisoned at the suit of the plaintiff, for the same bills.\u2014On application to the <em>recorder, </em>his honour ordered the defendant to be discharged, on filing common bail, on the ground, stated in the order, that the defendant had been before arrested and imprisoned for the same cause of action, in the state of <em>Massachusetts, </em>in the name of <em>Sherman, Porter, fy Co. </em>but at the request and for the sole benefit of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-12\"><em>Slosson, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQY\">now moved for a rule to vacate and set aside the order made by the <em>recorder. </em>He cited <em>Maule </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>7 <em>Term Rep. </em>407. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Spinolla, </em>2 <em>Johns.

Barry,<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> it is said, that if the second suit was brought with an intent to oppress and harrass the defendant, the court would certainly discharge him on common hail.

In <em>Sicard </em>v. <em>Whale, </em>which was a similar case, we refused to order an <em>exoneretur </em>on the bail piece. The plaintiff is entitled to the <em>remedy </em>which our laws afford, and the <em>lex loci contractus </em>does not. apply in such case. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Spinolla, 1 Johns. Rep. </em>198.) The maxim, that no man shall be twice arrested for the same cause, is not universally true, for where the plaintiff is <em>non prossed </em>for want of declaring, or discontinues his suit, on payment of costs, he may arrest the defendant <em>de novo; </em>besides, the rule is applicable only to arrests within the same jurisdiction. We do not, in this respect, take notice of an arrest abroad, or in another state.'&amp;emdash;The expressions used by the plaintiff, in regard to the defendant, were improper, but we do not think that there is' evidence of that oppression and vexation which should require the interposition of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\">ON a question referred to the court by the clerk, relative to . <em>3 </em>the assessment ot damages, whether he was authorized to take \u00b0 . . proof of the loss of the original paper, and assess the damages thereon, in like manner as on an execution of a writ of inquiry of damages before a sheriff; <em>The Court </em>said, the clerk had power to take such evidence as to a lost pnper, and assess the damages accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b359-20\"> Da1ta~, 29~ 388.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
