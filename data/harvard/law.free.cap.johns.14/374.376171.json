The declaration stated, that by a certain indenture of apprenticeship, one part of w-hich indenture sealed with the seal of the defendant the plaintiff brings into court, one <em>Sheldon Curtis, </em>aged 15, put himself an apprentice with the plaintiff to learn his trade of a hatter, and to serve the plaintiff until he should . 1 attain the age of 21 ; that it was thereby covenanted and agreed, \u00ae <em>J n * </em>that the said apprentice, his said master should well and fahy servej &amp;c- &amp;c. ; that for the true performance of the nants on the part of <em>Curtis, </em>the defendant bound himself unto the plaintiff; that <em>Curtis </em>was received into the service of the plaintiff, and that although the plaintiff had on his part fulfilled the indenture, yet that <em>Curtis </em>would not faithfully serve him, but, on the contrary, absented himself, and continued absent from hlS SCrVlCC,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pART\">The indenture, as set upon oyer, was as <em>K </em>v indenture, made the 7lh day of <em>February, </em>in the year of our Lord 1814, witnesseth, that <em>Sheldon Curtis, </em>son of <em>Moses tis, </em>deceased, late of the town of <em>Geneva, </em>being 15 years old on the 14th day of <em>May, </em>in the year of our Lord, 1813, by and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>with the consent of <em>Ebenezer Hoskins, </em>his guardian, of the town of <em>Geneva, </em>in the county of <em>Cayuga, </em>hath, of his free and voluntary will, placed and bound himself apprentice unto <em>Henry Ackley, </em>of the village of <em>Ithica, </em>hatter, to learn the said trade, mystery, or occupation of a hatter, which he, the said <em>Henry, </em>now useth, and with him as an apprentice to dwell, continue, and serve, from the day of the date hereof, until the said <em>Sheldon </em>shall arrive at the age of 21 years; during all which time the said apprentice his said master well and faithfully shall serve, his secrets keep, his commandments gladly do and obey, &amp;c. &amp;c.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Al2v\">delivered the opinion of the court. The question is, whether the defendant is bound by any of the cove<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>nants contained in the indenture. In the case of <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>(10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>99.) the indenture is very different from the present. There, after staling what the master and apprentice respectively stipulated, the indenture concludes, that, \u201c for the true performance of, all and singular, the covenants and agreements aforesaid, the said parties .bind themselves each unto the other.\u2019\u2019 Here the father clearly made himself a party to the covenants, and expressly bound himself for the performance. So, also, in <em>Whitly </em>v. <em>Loftus, </em>(8 <em>Mod. </em>190.) and in <em>Brench </em>v. <em>Ewington, (Doug. </em>518.)</p>\n<p id=\"ACx6\">In the case before us, there are no words importing any covenant or agreement on the part of the defendant. He has done no more than is made necessary by the statute, in order to make the indenture binding on the apprentice. The statute (1 N. <em>R. L. </em>135.) requires that the <em>consent </em>of the father or guardian should be expressed in the indenture, and signified by such parent or guardian, sealing and signing the said indenture. That is all the defendant has done. He might be willing to consent to the binding, yet not be willing to be bound himself, for the performance of all the stipulations contained in the indenture. In this, as in all other covenants, we should endeavour to find out the intention of the parties ; and when\u201cwe can account for the defendant\u2019s signing, and becoming, thus far, a party to the indenture, within the requirements of the statute, without making him a party to the covenants, we ought so to consider his meaning and intention; unless the language of the indenture will fairly warrant a more extended construction. The statute does not require any covenant from the parent or guardian. It has furnished the master with the power of enforcing obedience from his apprentice, and compelling him to a performance of his stipulated service. To make the defendant liable in this case, would be, in effect, saying, that the <em>parent or </em>guardian would, in every possible case, of a valid binding, be responsible for the performance of the covenants contained in the indenture, as the statute requires the <em>consent </em>of the parent or guardian to be expressed .in the indenture, and' that consent to be signified by sealing and signing the same. The statute does not demand, nor ought it to receive such a construction, it would greatly embarrass, and frequently defeat the very objects intended to be carried into effect. The case of <em>Blunt </em>v. Melcher, (2 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>228.) is an adjudication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>expressly in point upon the construction of such an indenture; and goes the full length of exonerating the guardian from all responsibility upon the covenants. We are of opinion that the defendant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
