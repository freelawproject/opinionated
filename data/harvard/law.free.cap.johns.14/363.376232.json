On the trial in the court below, the jury found a special verdict. On the 19th of <em>September, </em>1811, the parties entered into articles\u2019of agreement, by which <em>Ellis </em>agreed to convey to <em>Hoskins, \u201c </em>by a good warrantee deed,\u201d 52 1-2 acres of land, in lot No. 16, in <em>Manlius, </em>on condition that <em>Hoskins </em>should pay to him the sum of 500 dollars ; to wit, <em>?0 </em>dollars in hand, 30 dollars on the 15th <em>o\u00ed February, </em>1812, and 400 dollars in four equal annual instalments. Soon after making the contract, <em>Hoskins </em>went into possession of the land, and having paid to <em>Ellis </em>156 dollars, and interest amounting to 195 dollars and 40 cents, he offered, on the 15th of <em>February, </em>1813, to pay <em>Ellis </em>the balance of the second payment, due on that day, provided <em>Ellis </em>would give him security against a mortgage, executed by one <em>Cook, </em>and which was then a <em>lien </em>on the premises. <em>Ellis </em>refused to give the security; but said he was ready to receive the money tendered, and to fulfill the contract on his.part, alleging that <em>Cook </em>was bound to pay off the mortgage, and was able to do it. <em>Hoskins </em>refused to pay any more money, and <em>Ellis </em>brought an action of ejectment against him, and received possession of the premises. <em>Hoskins </em>thereupon brought this action to recover back the money he had paid. The special verdict stated the mortgage of <em>Cook </em>as outstanding and unsatisfied of record ; but that <em>Cook </em>was a responsible person, and fully able to pay off the mortgage. The court below gave judgment for the plaintiff, for 195 dollars and 40 cents.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-13\"><em>Randall, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6s\">1.

It was registerd at the time of the contract, and the plaintiff must be deemed to have had notice of it, when he made the purchase.

He has acted in good faith; and <em>non constat, </em>that he will not be able- and willing to give a perfect and unincumbered title to the premises, when it becomes his duty to execute a conveyance, according to the covenant. <em>Hoskins </em>has no justifiable cause for Rescinding the contract. For aught that appears, he had full knowledge of the mortgage,-when*he entered into the agreement. To permit, him to recover back the money he has paid would be'allowing him to rescind a fair and voluntary contract, on the ground of his mere will and pleasure, and thereby take advantage of his own default. If he had tendered the whole price -of the land, and demanded a deed free from all incumbrances,-a -different question might have arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">The case of <em>Greenby </em>v. <em>Cheevers </em>is in point for the plaintiff in, error, and the judgment of the court below must, therefore, be -'reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Judgment of reversal;.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
