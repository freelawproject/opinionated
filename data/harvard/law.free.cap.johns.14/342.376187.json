The payment of costs is a sufficient penalty on the defendant for neglecting to plead. We grant the motion, therefore, on payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Rule granted. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b355-7\"> <em>Vide Davenport </em>v. <em>Ferris, </em>6 <em>Johns.
