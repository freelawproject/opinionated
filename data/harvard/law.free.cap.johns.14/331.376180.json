As the jury were about to be sworn for the trial of the cause, in the court below, the filed a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>and removed the cause to this court.

That as special bail was not required in the court below, the plaintiff was entitled only to common bail in this court j that the rule of practice was, that if the bail, in the court below, became bail in this court, the plaintiff must take them; and that he is not entitled to any other, or better bail, than was given in the court below. <em>Tidd</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>lays down the rule to be, that \u201c when the defendant is not in actual custody, at the return of the <em>certiorari, </em>or <em>habeas </em>corpus, he must put in bail, if called upon, in the court <em>above, </em>which bail is either common, or <em>special, </em>as in the court below.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-7\">The defendants are entitled to security for costs on account, of the insolvency of the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-8\"><em>Van Wyck, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\"> <em>1 Tidd.

The motion to vacate the exception entered on the bail piece ought, therefore, to be denied; the plaintiffs, however, should be allowed 20 days to perfect bail in this court. As to the other branch of the defendant\u2019s motion, the plaintiff must file se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>tiurity for costs, and until that is done all further proceedings must be stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u2022 \u2022 Yates, J. and Platt, J., were of the same opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b343-8\">Spencer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVQ\">said, he supposed that the practice in the court of K. B. and in this court to be, that the bail, on the <em>habeas corpus:. </em>was to be either common, or special, as in the court below; and that, if common bail was \"filed in the common pleas, it was sufficient in this court. It was immaterial, however, in his opinion, how the practice was settled, provided the rule was established ; he should, therefore, concur in the rule as stated by the chief justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Van Ness, J., was of the same opinion, and concurred for' the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
