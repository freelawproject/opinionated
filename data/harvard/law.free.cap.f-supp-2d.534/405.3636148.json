Gradante, alleging that all three defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and that Hennessee Group breached its investment advisory contract with South Cherry and breached its fiduciary duly to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">This lawsuit stems from the massive fraud associated with Bayou Group, LLC (\u201cBayou Group\u201d), an affiliated group of legal entities based in Connecticut that created and managed private pooled investment funds, or hedge funds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bayou Group\u2019s principals, Samuel Israel III and Daniel E, Marino, operated Bayou Group as a fraudulent Ponzi scheme and, by August 2005, Bayou Group collapsed under the weight of its principals\u2019 fraudulent acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">South Cherry was one of Bayou Group\u2019s investors, having invested $1.15 million in one of Bayou Group\u2019s affiliates-Bayou Accredited, LLC (\u201cBayou Accredited\u201d) \u2014 from March 2003 to October 2004. According to the Complaint, South Cherry\u2019s investment came at the recommendation of Hennessee Group, an investment advisor specializing in hedge funds. According to South Cherry, Hennessee Group represented that it conducted a rigorous five-step due diligence review of a hedge fund before recommending that a client invest in that particular fund. South Cherry further alleges that positive reports issued by Hen-nessee Group regarding Bayou Accredited \u2014 that were later shown to be inaccurate following discovery of the fraud \u2014 clearly demonstrate that the Group either did not conduct the promised due diligence on Bayou Accredited, or did so in a deficient manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">Approximately eight months after the Bayou Group fraud became public knowledge, plaintiff commenced the instant lawsuit. Before this court is defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the reasons stated below, defendants\u2019 motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">The following well-pleaded facts are presumed true.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">\n<em>A. The Hennessee Group Investor Presentation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">Sometime after August 2001, Hennessee Group mailed a written presentation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>South Cherry\u2019s sole shareholder. Fred Groothuis, entitled, \u201cHennessee 1 ledge Fund Advisory Group Investor Presentation\u201d (\u201cHennessee Investor Presentation\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Compl. \u00b6 21; <em>see also </em>Hennessee Investor Presentation, attached as Ex. A to Declaration of Fred Groothuis (\u201cGroothuis Decl.\u201d).) The Hennessee investor Presentation described the Group as a \u201c \u2018strategic partner in hedge fund investing\u2019 \u201d and an \u201c \u2018Industry Leader: the most recognized hedge fund consulting firm in the industry,\u201d \u2018 whose Hennessee Hedge Fund Indices are \u201c \u2018the oldest, most widely sourced hedge fund index in the financial industry.\u201d \u2018 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, quoting Hennessee Investor Presentation at 6.) The Presentation further represented that the Group\u2019s principals, Hennessee and Gradante, were \u201c \u2018early pioneers in the [hedge fund] industry,\u2019 \u201d who had \u201c \u2018150 direct relationships with hedge funds.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 13, quoting Hennessee Investor Presentation at 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Most significant to plaintiffs Complaint, the Hennessee Investor Presentation outlined the Group\u2019s five-step due diligence process that the Group conducts before recommending that a client invest in a particular hedge fund. Before Hennessee Group subjects a hedge fund to its due diligence review, however, the Presentation indicated that the fund needed to meet several minimum requirements. One of these requirements was that the fund should have \u201c \u20183 years audited track record.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 15, quoting Hennessee Investor Presentation at 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Assuming the hedge fund meets this and other threshold requirements. Level One of the process entails sending a Manager Information Sheet (\u201cMIS\u201d) to the manager of the hedge fund being reviewed. The MIS requests general information about the fund, including \u201csources of capital,\u201d \u201cperformance [including audits and monthly historical performances],\u201d \u201cvehicle structure,\u201d \u201ctax efficiency,\u201d \u201cassociated professionals [including the fund\u2019s legal, tax and audit teams],\u201d and \u201cSEC [history].\u201d (Hennessee Investor Presentation at 10-11.) Level One also includes a review of the completed MIS, and a determination by the Group whether to proceed to Level Two. <em>(Id. </em>at 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Level Two of Hennessee Group\u2019s due diligence includes assessing the hedge fund\u2019s \u201cexperience,\u201d \u201ccredibility,\u201d and \u201ctransparency.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 11.) At this level, the Group also generates an \u201cinternal quantitative analysis\u201d of the hedge fund, and schedules a meeting with the fund\u2019s manager and research staff. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">For those hedge funds satisfying Level Two review, Level Three requires an on-site meeting at the fund manager\u2019s office so that Hennessee Group could \u201c \u2018interact with [hedge fund] Personnel from the top down to develop an impression of overall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>professionalism, attitude and depth of organization.\u2019 \u201d (Compl. \u00b6 17, quoting Hen-nessee Investor Presentation at 12.) The on-site meeting also helps the Group assess certain \u201cqualitative aspects\u201d of the fund, including its \u201csystems,\u201d \u201cculture,\u201d and \u201cenvironment.\u201d (Hennessee Investor Presentation at 12.) South Cherry alleges that Hennessee Group did not have a face-to-face meeting with Bayou Accredited until long alter the Group recommended the hedge fund to South Cherry. (Comply 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">During Level Four of the due diligence process, Hennessee Group \u201cstudied the hedge fund\u2019s \u2018individual positions,\u2019 with an emphasis on its long, short, cash and derivative positions, as well as any \u2018off balance sheet transactions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 18, quoting Hennessee Investor Presentation at 12.) Level Four also required the Group to analyze the fund\u2019s \u201cindividual holdings,\u201d \u201caverage holding period,\u201d and \u201cbeta, market capitalization and trade days of portfolio,\u201d (Hennessee investor Presentation at 12), \u201call factors in determining the degree of risk in the hedge fund\u2019s investment.\u201d (Comply 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">If a hedge fund passed these four stages of review, the Hennessee Investor Presentation stated that the fund was subject to Level Five, the final due diligence stage. According to the Presentation, Level Five scrutiny required the Group to conduct a \u201clegal/audit review,\u201d that included analysis of the fund\u2019s \u201caudited financial statements\u201d and \u201coffering memorandum and limited partnership agreements.\u201d (Hennessee Investor Presentation at 13.) During Level Five review, the Group also performed an \u201cinternal background check\u201d on fund personnel, confirmed the fund\u2019s prime banking relationship, and contacted the prior employers of the fund\u2019s key employees. (Comply 19.) The Presentation also indicated that the Group would \u201c \u2018verify\u2019 \u201d the hedge fund\u2019s auditor. <em>(Id., </em>quoting Hen-nessee Investor Presentation at 13.) Hen-nessee Group also reserved the option to retain a private investigator to perform additional due diligence as circumstances warranted. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">In addition to the five-step due diligence process, the Hennessee Investor Presentation also represented that the Hennessee Group conducts ongoing due diligence, after the Group has recommended that its clients invest in a particular hedge fund. According to the Presentation, the Group\u2019s ongoing due diligence includes scrutinizing the fund\u2019s performance figures and audited financial statements, and compiling monthly portfolio reports. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 20.) The process also monitors \u201c \u2018style drift\u2019 \u201d \u2014 i.e., any variation from a plan in a fund\u2019s investment activities. <em>(Id., </em>quoting Hennessee Investor Presentation at 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Thus, according to the Complaint, the Presentation represented that Hennessee Group \u201cevaluated all candidate hedge funds after each level of due diligence review, and that a hedge fund would have to pass all five levels of due diligence before Hennessee Group would recommend the hedge fund to a client.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 15.) Moreover, if the fund did not pass any single level of the live level process, it would not be passed onto the next level of inquiry and, therefore, could not be recommended to a client. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">According to the Complaint, the Hen-nessee Investor Presentation, \u201cwas specifically intended to induce prospective customers to trust in Hennessee Group\u2019s promised extensive due diligence process, and Groothuis relied upon its representations ... when he decided to invest South Cherry\u2019s assets in hedge funds, including Bayou [Accredited], that Hennessee Group recommended.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 21; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6 8.) Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">it was absolutely material to South Cherry \u2014 which was otherwise inexperi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>enced in hedge fund investing \u2014 that Hennessee Group have conducted a disciplined and complete due diligence process on all recommended investments in hedge funds. Absent Hennessee Group\u2019s representation to South Cherry that it conducted the detailed five level due diligence process, and its agreement to conduct the post-investment ongoing due diligence process set forth in the ... Presentation and elsewhere, South Cherry would not have opened a J Hen-nessee Group account, and would not have invested [in] any hedge fund recommended by Hennessee Group, including Bayou [Accredited].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 10: <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\n<em>B. Hennessee Group\u2019s Alleged Misrepresentations Regarding Bayou Accredited and Bayou Fund</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Arv\">In addition to its alleged misrepresentations regarding its five-step due diligence process and ongoing due diligence, Hen-nessee Group allegedly misrepresented facts to South Cherry concerning Bayou Accredited and its predecessor, Bayou Fund LLC (\u201cBayou Fund\u201d) \u2014 misrepresentations that South Cherry alleges were incorrect precisely because the Group never conducted its promised due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">1. <em>Bayou Accredited\u2019s Accountant</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8l\">Bayou Accredited was formed in January 2003, following the decision of Israel and Marino to replace Bayou Fund \u201cwith the several Bayou Family Funds.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 23.) Bayou Fund had been formed in 1996 and, according to the Complaint, \u201cconsistently lost money.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>In order to hide this fact, in 1998, Israel and Marino fired Bayou Fund\u2019s hedge fund auditor, Hertz Herson &amp; Co. (\u201cHHCO\u201d) and replaced it with \u201ca fake, but purportedly independent, accounting firm, Richmond, Fairfield <em>&amp; </em>Associates (\u201cRichmond-Fair-field\u201d).\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Even though HHCO stopped auditing Bayou Fund in 1998 and never audited any of the Bayou Family Funds established in 2003. Hennessee Group\u2019s Vice President, Leeana Piscopo, represented to South Cherry in a February 2003 mailing that Bayou Accredited was audited by HHCO. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">South Cherry alleges that this false statement demonstrates that Hennessee Group never conducted the due diligence it promised. According to the Complaint, if the Group had taken steps to \u201c \u2018verify\u2019 \u201d Bayou\u2019s auditors, as promised, it would have learned that HHCO no longer worked for any Bayou entities, and that Richmond-Fairfield\u2019s registered principal was Marino and the firm was therefore not a genuine auditor, \u201ccould not possibly have been independent,\u201d and \u201cnever did any auditing.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24, 27.) South Cherry further alleges that Hennessee Group \u201cnever had any contact with Richmond-Fairfield,\u201d and that it did not properly investigate the purported accounting firm even after one of the Group\u2019s investors warned the Group that the firm was not a true independent auditor. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 27.) Moreover, South Cherry alleges that even if Bayou Accredited employed a proper, independent accountant, it was not possible for Bayou Accredited \u2014 formed in January 2003 \u2014 to have three years of audited financial statements by the time Hennes-see Group recommended the fund in early 2003. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">2. <em>Bayou Fund\u2019s Profitability</em></p>\n<p id=\"Afd\">In that same February 2003 mailing from Hennessee Group to South Cherry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the Group represented that Bayou Accredited\u2019s predecessor, Bayou Fund, had been launched in January 1997, it had a greater than 19% annualized return since its inception, and that it was profitable in 78% of the months since its inception. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 26.) South Cherry alleges that all of these statements were false \u2014 Bayou Fund was formed in 1996 and had consistently lost money since its inception \u2014 and the statements further demonstrate that Hennes-see Group never conducted the due diligence it promised. <em>(Id.; see also id. </em>\u00b6 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">3. <em>Bayou Accredited\u2019s Principal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The February 2003 mailing from Hen-nessee Group to South Cherry also included a written \u201c \u2018Biography\u2019 \u201d of Mr, Israel, Bayou Accredited\u2019s \u201c \u2018Founder &amp; Principal.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 29.) According to the biography, prior to forming Bayou Fund, Mr. Israel was \u201c \u2018head trader for Omega Advis-ors, managing assets exceeding $4 billion for Leon Cooperman.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>South Cherry asserts that this representation was particularly impressive as Omega Advisors is one of the hedge fund industry\u2019s most successful funds, and Mr. Cooperman is widely admired as a \u201c \u2018legendary\u2019 \u201d trader; accordingly, South Cherry claims that it relied on this biography when it decided to invest in Bayou Accredited. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Again, South Cherry alleges that had Hennessee Group conducted the due diligence it promised, the Group would have discovered that much of the information in its Israel biography was incorrect. According to the Complaint, Mr. Israel was never Omega Advisors\u2019s head trader, and never held any position remotely comparable. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 30.) Indeed, Mr. Cooperman has since described Israel as an \u201c \u2018order taker.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Thus, South Cherry alleges, the Group\u2019s background check on Mr. Israel was either never performed or \u201cwoefully deficient.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">4. <em>Bayou Accredited\u2019s Investment Strategy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">South Cherry also alleges that on February 6, 2003, Ms. Piscopo emailed Mr. Groothuis with incorrect information regarding Bayou Accredited\u2019s investment strategy. The email advised Groothuis that Bayou Accredited tracks \u201c \u2019250 stocks,\u2019 \u201d that the fund \u201c \u2018will have 50 + investment ideas and because may times they don\u2019t get their target price, they only put on 20-30 trades in one day,\u2019 \u201d that the fund \u201c \u2018rarely use[s] any leverage at all,\u2019 \u201d and that it \u201c \u2018employ[s] stop-loss orders on all securities [Bayou Accredited] trade[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b631.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">Again, South Cherry alleges that if Hen-nessee Group had conducted the promised due diligence, it would have discovered that all of these representations were \u201cfalse or misleading.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>In support of this contention, South Cherry cites an SEC report that found that the Bayou Fund began losing money shortly after its inception in 1996, that Messrs. Israel and Marino began lying to investors regarding the Bayou Fund\u2019s performance at this time, and that Israel and Marino misappropriated investors\u2019 funds from the Bayou Fund and, beginning in 2003, the four successor funds (including Bayou Accredited). <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">\n<em>C. South Cherry Invests in Bayou Accredited</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">Sometime between January 1 and March 3, 2003, Hennessee Group recommended to South Cherry that it invest in Bayou Accredited. <em>(See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23, 25, 32.) South Cherry alleges that in reliance on Hennes-see Group\u2019s recommendation, \u201cand in specific reliance\u201d on its understanding that Bayou Accredited \u201chad passed all stages\u201d of the Group\u2019s five-step due diligence process, South Cherry invested $2.9 million in Bayou Accredited over the period March 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>2003 through June 1, 2003. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 32.) In Spring 2004, South Cherry withdrew $1.75 million, but on October 5, 2004, South Cherry invested an additional $900,000 in Bayou Accredited, for a total net investment of $1.15 million. <em>{Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\n<em>D. Hennessee Group\u2019s Ongoing Due Diligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">South Cherry states that it continued to invest in Bayou Accredited in reliance on Hennessee Group\u2019s assurance that it would conduct ongoing due diligence on the fund. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">During the period from South Cherry\u2019s first investment in March 2003 through at least July 2005, Hennessee Group mailed regularly monthly reports entitled \u201cManager Performance Monitor\u201d to South Cherry. <em>{Id.; see also </em>Manager Performance Monitors, attached as Ex. B to Groo-thuis Decl.) These Manager Performance Monitors are identical in form to the sample report included in the \u201cOngoing Due Diligence\u201d section of the Hennessee Investor Presentation. <em>{Compare </em>Manager Performance Monitors <em>with </em>Hennessee Investor Presentation at 14-15.) Just before the Bayou fraud was discovered, Hennes-see Group reported to South Cherry that its $1.15 million investment had appreciated to approximately $1.5 million. (Comply 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">South Cherry alleges that these Manager Performance Monitors were incorrect and that \u201cnone of the ... reports disclosed the fact that Bayou was a fraudulent scheme.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 34.) Indeed, because Bayou Accredited was part of a criminal Ponzi scheme, South Cherry alleges that its investments in Bayou securities were at all times essentially worthless. <em>{Id.) </em>In support of these allegations, South Cherry again cites to a September 2005 SEC report that stated that Messrs. Israel and Marino began diverting funds from all Bayou entities in 2003, in order to invest the money in private placements of nonpublic start-up companies. <em>(Id.) </em>The SEC report also found that as of April 2004, Israel and Marino stopped trading in Bayou Accredited\u2019s accounts, and instead wired all of the fund\u2019s remaining assets into another company\u2019s Citibank account. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 35.) South Cherry claims that Hen-nessee Group did not report any of these activities to its clients, \u201ceven though a review of statements from Bayou\u2019s prime banker ... would have disclosed that Bayou had stopped trading and had drained its accounts.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Thus, long after Bayou Accredited stopped trading in April 2004, Hennessee Group \u201ccontinued to express positive views\u201d of the fund, which resulted in South Cherry\u2019s $900,000 investment in October 2004. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">\n<em>E. The Bagou Fraud is Discovered</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">On July 27, 2005, Mr. Israel wrote to all Bayou investors, including South Cherry, that the Bayou entities would be liquidated, and that each investor\u2019s capital balance would be distributed by the end of August 2005. No distribution was ever made. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">Following this correspondence, various state and federal regulators commenced investigations into Bayou\u2019s activities. Messrs, Israel, Marino and James Marquez a third Bayou principal \u2014 were subsequently indicted and pled guilty to security fraud. The Arizona Attorney General discovered approximately $101 million that had been \u201cwire transferred repeatedly among different banks around the world, and caused that money ... to be frozen pending further proceedings.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b637.) Other monies were found to be invested in speculative vehicles by entities owned by Israel and Marino, but in which Bayou investors, like South Cherry, had no interest. <em>(Id.) </em>The Department of Justice and other law enforcement agencies report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>that they are seeking to forfeit these assets, to the extent they can be located and seized. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\n<em>F. Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On April 16, 2006. South Cherry filed its original Complaint. Defendants subsequently filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration clause in an executed Investment Advisory Agreement, between Mr. Bollman and Hennessee Group. The motion was denied on December 5, 2006, on the basis that Mr. Bollman was not an employee or agent of South Cherry\u2019s when he entered into the Agreement, and the Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause was therefore not binding on South Cherry.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">On February 27, 2007. South Cherry filed an Amended Complaint, alleging three causes of action; 1) violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78(j)(b) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5 (against all defendants), 2) breach of contract (against Hennessee Group), and 3) breach of fiduciary duty (against Hennessee Group). On April 6, 2007, defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Rule 12(b) (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for dismissal of a complaint that fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The standard of review on a motion to dismiss is heavily weighted in favor of the plaintiff. \u201cIn ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to stale a claim upon which relief may be granted, the court is required to accept the material facts alleged in the complaint as true.\u201d <em>Frasier v. General Elec. Co., </em>930 F.2d 1004, 1007 (2d Cir.1991). The court is also required to read a complaint generously, drawing all reasonable inferences from its allegations in favor of the plaintiff. <em>California Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, </em>404 U.S. 508, 515, 92 S.Ct. 609, 30 L.Ed.2d 642 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">\u201cWhile a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted). Indeed, a plaintiff must assert \u201cenough facts to stale a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1974. This \u201cplausibility standard\u201d is a flexible one. \u201cobliging] a pleader to amplify\u2019 a claim with some factual allegations in those contexts where such amplification is needed to render the claim plausible,\u201d <em>Iqbal v.

Gregor, </em>220 F.3d 81, 88-89 (2d Cir.2000); <em>San Leandro Emerg. Med. Group Profit Sharing v.

Violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-17\">Defendants argue that South Cherry\u2019s \u00a7 10(b) claim must be dismissed for two reasons: First, defendants contend that South Cherry failed to plead fraud against all three defendants with the particularity required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPSLRA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b). Specif-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>ieally, defendants maintain that the Complaint only alleges that Hennessee Group made representations regarding its due diligence to Mr. Bollman, and that the Hennessee Investor Presentation was merely a marketing tool. In addition, defendants argue that plaintiffs allegation that Hennessee Group committed a \u00a7 10(b) violation by failing to uncover a fraud that Bayou\u2019s principals successfully concealed from the entire world for nine years, does not allege the level of recklessness required for a \u00a7 10(b) violation. Second, defendants claim that the Complaint fails to plead loss causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Because this court finds that the Complaint fails adequately to plead scienter, defendants\u2019 argument regarding loss causation need not be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78(j)(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, prohibit fraudulent activities in connection with securities transactions. Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, moreover, imposes joint and several liability on, \u201cEvery person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable\u201d under \u00a7 10(b) or 10b-5. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 781(a). In order to state a claim under Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff \u201cmust plead that in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, the defendant, <em>acting with scienter, </em>made a false material representation or omitted to disclose material information and that plaintiffs reliance on defendant\u2019s action caused [plaintiff] injury.\u201d <em>Acito v. IMCERA Group, Inc., </em>47 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir.1995) (internal quotations marks and citations omitted) (emphasis added); <em>see also In re Veeco Instruments, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>235 F.R.D. 220, 226 (S.D.N.Y.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">It is the scienter element of this pleading requirement on which this court will focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">While Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) stales that \u201cmalice, intent, knowledge or other conditions of mind\u201d may be \u201caverred generally,\u201d the PSLRA and long-standing law in this Circuit impose more stringent requirements for pleading securities fraud. <em>See Veeco Instruments, </em>235 F.R.D. at 230; <em>see also In re Carter-Wallace, Inc., Secs. Litig., </em>220 F.3d 36, 39 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201cthe relaxation of Rule 9(b)\u2019s specificity requirement for scienter must not be mistaken for license to base claims of fraud on speculation and conclusory allegations.\u201d). Thus, in order to state a claim under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, the PSLRA requires a complaint to \u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). In this Circuit, the required state of mind has been defined as \u201cintent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, or reckless conduct,\u201d <em>ATSI Communications, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., </em>493 F.3d 87, 99 n. 3 (2d Cir.2007), and the PSLRA\u2019s requisite \u2018strong inference\u2019 arises where plaintiffs allege either \u201c(1) facts showing that defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit fraud, or (2) facts constituting strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\u201d <em>Gabriel Capital, L.P. v. Natwest Finance, Inc., </em>137 F.Supp.2d 251, 261 (S.D.N.Y.2000); see <em>also Ganino v. Citizens Utilities Co., </em>228 F.3d 154, 168-69 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">South Cherry\u2019s Complaint alleges that Hennessee Group\u2019s misconduct falls into the latter category \u2014 that the Group acted recklessly when it failed to uncover the Bayou fraud after it promised to conduct due diligence on Bayou Accredited, <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 23, 26, 28,30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">The Second Circuit has defined recklessness as conduct that is \u201chighly unreasonable\u201d and that represents \u201can extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care ... to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.\u201d <em>Veeco Instruments, </em>235 F.R.D. at 230-31 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). However, while reckless conduct may satisfy the scienter requirement of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, \u201cthe complaint must make clear that more than mere negligence is alleged.\u201d <em>Modern Settings, Inc. v. Prudential-Bache Secs., Inc., </em>603 F.Supp. 370, 372 (S.D.N.Y.1985). Thus, conclusory \u201callegations that a defendant \u2018knew or [was] reckless in not knowing\u2019 the true facts will not satisfy a plaintiffs pleading requirements.\u201d <em>Hart v. Internet Wire, Inc., </em>145 F.Supp.2d 360, 365 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (quoting <em>Shields v. Citytrust Bancorp, Inc. </em>25 F.3d 1124, 1129 (2d Cir.1994)). \u201cEven an egregious failure to gather information will not establish 10b-5 liability as long as the defendants did not deliberately shut their eyes to the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368-69 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Notably, \u201cWhere a plaintiff relies on allegations of recklessness \u2014 as opposed to motive and opportunity \u2014 to plead fraudulent intent, the strength of the circumstantial allegations must be correspondingly greater,\u201d <em>Gabriel Capital, </em>137 F.Supp.2d at 264; <em>see also Kalnit v. Eichler, </em>264 F.3d 131, 142 (2d Cir.2001), \u201cand the plaintiff must allege facts approaching <em>a knowledgeable participation in the fraud or a deliberate and conscious disregard of facts.\u201d Hart, </em>145 F.Supp.2d at 367 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In addition to this increased pleading requirements for \u00a7 10(b) violations based on recklessness, plaintiffs must also satisfy the heightened standard recently announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007). In <em>Tellabs, </em>the Court held that when a court examines \u201cwhether the pleaded facts give rise to a \u2018strong\u2019 inference of scienter,\u201d under the PSLRA, \u201cthe court must lake into account plausible opposing inferences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2509. Moreover, for an inference of scienter to be \u201cstrong,\u201d the inference \u201cmust be more than merely \u2018reasonable\u2019 or \u2018permissible\u2019\u2014 it must be cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other explanations. A complaint will survive ... only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2510.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Thus, a plaintiff pleading a \u00a7 10(b) violation based on defendant\u2019s recklessness faces two stiff challenges in this Circuit: the strength of the recklessness allegations must be greater than that of allegations of garden-variety fraud, <em>and </em>the inference of recklessness must be at least as compelling as any opposing inferences. South Cherry\u2019s Complaint does not meet the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">South Cherry alleges three categories of misrepresentations made by Hennessee Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>First, South Cherry alleges that Hen-nessee Group provided incorrect information to South Cherry about Bayou Fund\u2019s profitability. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28.) But any representations regarding Bayou Fund are irrelevant, because the Complaint does not allege that Hennessee Group ever recommended that South Cherry invest in Bayou Fund. And South Cherry does not rely on these misrepresentations to obtain relief. <em>(See infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Second, South Cherry alleges that the Group provided incorrect information to plaintiff about the independence of Bayou Accredited\u2019s accountant, the experience of its principal, Israel, and the fund\u2019s investment strategy. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 27, 29-31.) However, South Cherry concedes in its opposition papers that it does not seek relief under \u00a7 10(b) for these misrepresentations either.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Instead, South Cherry states, \u201cThe gravamen of the Amended Complaint is simply that Defendant defrauded South Cherry by representing that before recommending the Bayou investment to South Cherry, Hennessee Group had conducted a great deal of very specific due diligence about Bayou that it simply did not do.\u201d <em>(See </em>Pl.\u2019s Opp. Br. at 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Third, South Cherry alleges that Hen-nessee Group promised to conduct a live-step due diligence process before recommending a hedge fund for investment (and to perform ongoing due diligence after recommending a fund). The Complaint alleges the Group failed to do either. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-22, 33-35.) South Cherry\u2019s Complaint suggests that Hennessee Group\u2019s failure to conduct any semblance of \u201crudimentary\u201d due diligence \u2014 let alone the Group\u2019s unique five-step process \u2014 not only led to its failure to uncover reasons why Bayou was not a sound investment, but also fell short of prevailing industry standards, which constitutes evidence of defendants\u2019 recklessness. <em>(See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b624, 26. 28, 30.) Put otherwise, South Cherry thus argues that Hennessee Group assumed both an initial and ongoing duty to South Cherry to investigate Bayou thoroughly, that its failure to uncover the Bayou fraud demonstrates that it breached that duty, and that the breach of duty demonstrates the requisite recklessness. (Pl.\u2019s Opp. Br. at 9,19-20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The allegation that Hennessee Group promised to conduct a uniquely comprehensive brand of due diligence but failed to do so is insufficient to establish the requisite strong inference of conscious recklessness. \u201cIt is ... unfair to use professionals\u2019 <em>self-imposed standards, </em>which may exceed industry standards, against them to try to prove fraud. This violates public policy which encourages the highest standards, in order to protect the public.\u201d <em>Hart, </em>145 F.Supp.2d at 370 (quoting <em>In re Worlds of Wonder Sec. Litig., </em>147 F.R.D. 214, 217 (N.D.Cal.1992)) (emphasis added). \u201cCourts have refused to assign 10b-5 liability merely for a violation of a defendant\u2019s standard practices and procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Even South Cherry\u2019s alternative allegation that Hennessee Group failed to perform due diligence commensurate with industry standards is inadequate to plead scienter. <em>See, e.g., Stevelman v. Alias Research Inc., </em>174 F.3d 79 (2d Cir.1999) (noting violations of industry standards are not enough to show scienter); <em>Chill v. General Elec. Co., </em>101 F.3d 263, 270 (2d Cir.1996) (finding that \u201cAllegations of a violation of GAAP provisions or SEC regulations, without corresponding fraudulent intent, are not sufficient to state a securities fraud claim.\u201d); <em>Gabriel Capital, </em>137 F.Supp.2d at 264 (\u201cAn investment advisor is retained to suggest appropriate investments for its clients, but is not required to assume the role of accountant or private investigator and conduct a thorough investigation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the accuracy of the facts contained in the documents that it analyzes for the purpose of recommending an investment.\u201d); <em>In re Livent, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>78 F.Supp.2d 194 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (finding that violations of company\u2019s accounting policies and various professional standards, without proof of intent to defraud, were not sufficient to allege fraud under \u00a7 10(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">All of the <em>pre-Tellabs </em>law in this Circuit requires a PSLRA pleader who relies on recklessness to establish scienter to plead stronger allegations than a plaintiff who alleges motive and opportunity to participate in the fraud. <em>See Gabriel Capital, </em>137 F.Supp.2d at 264. Even if using professionals\u2019 self-imposed standards against them to prove fraud were acceptable, Hen-nessee Group\u2019s alleged failure to conduct promised due diligence would still fall short of alleging the requisite scienter because the allegation fails to \u201cshow that the defendants acted with fraudulent intent\u201d (i.e., the intention of deceiving the plaintiff), as they must, \u201ceven when plaintiff[ ] reifies] on the \u2018recklessness\u2019 prong of scienter.\u201d <em>Hart, </em>145 F.Supp.2d at 365 (noting \u00a7 10(b) complaint based on recklessness that \u201cfails to adduce any specific facts supporting an inference of <em>knowledgeable participation </em>in the alleged fraud will not survive a motion to dismiss.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphasis in original); <em>see also Novak v. Kasaks, </em>216 F.3d 300, 312 (2d Cir.2000) (observing \u201cconscious recklessness\u201d is \u201ca stale of mind approximating actual intent, and not merely a heightened form of negligence\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The failure to conduct due diligence is not the same thing as knowing of or closing one\u2019s eyes to a known \u201cdanger,\u201d or participating in the fraud. \u201cWhere third-party advisers are concerned, to meet such a standard the allegations must approximate an actual intent to aid in the fraud being perpetrated by the ... company.\u201d <em>Gabriel Capital, </em>137 F.Supp.2d at 263-64 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). South Cherry does not allege that Hennessee Group knew, or even suspected, that Bayou Accredited was a fraudulent enterprise but \u201cdeliberately shut fits] eyes to the facts.\u201d <em>Hart, </em>145 F.Supp.2d at 365. Neither does plaintiff allege that the Group recommended investing in Bayou Accredited with intent to cause plaintiff to lose money or to assist in the fraud being perpetrated by Bayou. Indeed, South Cherry alleges no facts that suggest Hennessee Group, knowing or suspecting that Bayou was a Ponzi scheme, intended to deceive South Cherry into believing Bayou Accredited was a sound investment. Without alleging such facts, the mere allegation that Hennessee Group failed to follow through on its promise to conduct due diligence (which I assume to be true) falls short of providing a sufficiently strong inference of recklessness. <em>See id. </em>at 365 (granting motion to dismiss where plaintiff investors in company sued wire service for publishing fraudulent\u2014 and negative \u2014 press release written by disgruntled company employee, where plaintiffs alleged it was defendant\u2019s standard practice to confirm press releases).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\"><em>Tellabs </em>\u2014 which requires this court to examine competing inferences when determining whether scienter has been adequately pled \u2014 only buttresses this conclusion. South Cherry argues that this court may draw a strong inference of recklessness from the allegation that Hennessee Group recommended (and continued to recommend) Bayou Accredited at a lime when Accredited was part of a large Ponzi scheme operated by Bayou\u2019s principals. From this, plaintiff asserts, the Group could not possibly have conducted the due diligence it promised. (Pl.\u2019s Opp. Br. at 9-10; <em>see also </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>But according to the Complaint, \u201cBayou was at all relevant times a criminal Ponzi scheme,\u201d <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 33), and the fraud was not discovered until \u201csubsequent to\u201d the mailing of a July 27, 2005 letter from Israel to Bayou investors, (see <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36-37), despite the fact that it \u201chad been formed in 1996, and had .... lost millions of dollars in every single year it traded.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23, 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">One substantial competing inference this court may draw from these alleged facts is that due diligence would not have uncovered the fraud. The Complaint alleges that Bayou concealed the fraud from investors, the public, investment advisors, other industry professionals and regulators \u2014 including the SHC \u2014 for <em>nine years. </em>Given that Israel and Marino managed to deceive the entire investing community for nearly a decade, South Cherry\u2019s allegation that Hennessee Group would necessarily have uncovered the fraud had it conducted the due diligence it promised is far from compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">I therefore find the inference of recklessness alleged by plaintiff \u2014 that the Group\u2019s failure to uncover the fraud evidences a reckless lack of due diligence \u2014 to be less compelling than an opposing inference \u2014 that Hennessee Group\u2019s failure to discover the fraud merely places it alongside the SEC, the IRS, and every other interested party that reviewed Bayou\u2019s finances. The inference proposed by South Cherry is thus not \u201cstrong in light of other explanations,\u201d and its pleading cannot survive a motion to dismiss. <em>Tellabs, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2510; <em>see also Modern Settings, </em>603 F.Supp. at 372 (granting motion to dismiss \u00a7 10(b) claim, where defendant account manager promised to take precautions to insure correct valuation, and plaintiffs alleged defendant\u2019s misvaluation of plaintiffs\u2019 assets evidenced recklessness, noting, \u201cthe mere occurrence of the error is not sufficient to justify the inference that the promised [precautions were] not being employed.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">South Cherry also argues that \u201cdefendants\u2019 continued misrepresentations over a period of years ... is just another indication of defendants\u2019 scienter.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Opp. Br. at 9.) But Hennessee Group\u2019s purported misrepresentations regarding the soundness of Bayou Fund and Bayou Accredited do not form the basis of plaintiffs \u00a7 10(b) cause of action \u2014 they merely provide the context against which plaintiff has attempted to draw a strong inference of recklessness. The alleged misrepresentations regarding due diligence that form the basis of plaintiffs \u00a7 10(b) claim occurred only once when the Group mailed the Hen-nessee Investor Presentation to South Cherry sometime after August 2001. (CompLK 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">For all of these reasons, South Cherry has failed to plead scienter adequately, and its \u00a7 10(b) claim against Hennessee Group must be dismissed. Because South Cherry has failed to plead a primary violation of \u00a7 10(b), its \u00a7 20(a) claim against Elizabeth Lee Hennessee and Charles J. Gra-dante must also be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">\n<em>B. Breach of Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">South Cherry\u2019s second cause of action alleges that Hennessee Group breached its contract with South Cherry by recommending (and continuing to recommend) Bayou Accredited as an investment without conducting both the initial and ongoing due diligence promised in the Hennessee Investor Presentation. (Compl.1ffl 44-50.) The Group moves to dismiss this claim because 1) South Cherry failed to alleged the essential terms of the alleged oral contract, and 2) the contract violates the Statute of Frauds, both because it is incapable of being performed within one year and because it constitutes \u201ca contract to pay compensation for services rendered ... in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>negotiating ... a business opportunity ... and partnership interest.\u201d N.Y. Gen. Obi. Law \u00a7 5 \u2014 701(a)(10) (McKinney 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Regardless of whether South Cherry has pled the essential terms of an oral contract, it is evident that the alleged contract is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. Under New York\u2019s Statute of Frauds, an agreement that by its terms cannot be performed within one year of its creation is void unless it is in writing. N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law \u00a7 5-701(a)(l). In addition, \u201ccontracts of indefinite duration are deemed to be incapable of being performed within a year, and thus fall within the ambit of the Statute of Frauds.\u201d <em>Com-putech Intern., Inc. v. Compaq Computer Corp., </em>No. 02-CV-2628, 2002 WL 31398933, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 24, 2002); <em>see also United Beer Distrib. Co., Inc. v. Hiram Walker (N.Y.) Inc., </em>163 A.D.2d 79, 557 N.Y.S.2d 336, 338 (1st Dep\u2019t 1990) (\u201cSince the agreement called for performance for an indefinite duration and could only be terminated within one year by its breach during that period, it is not one which by its terms could be performed within one year.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Here, all allegations regarding the alleged contract terms between South Cherry and Hennessee Group occur in a single paragraph in the Complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">Hennessee Group contracted with South Cherry that it would recommend to South Cherry suitable hedge fund investments which had passed every stage of Hennessee Group\u2019s detailed and rigorous five-step due diligence process. In addition, Hennessee Group promised South Cherry that it would continue to perform ongoing due diligence on investments South Cherry would make in reliance on Hennessee Group recommendations. In exchange, South Cherry agreed to pay Hennessee Group an annual commission of 1% of each hedge fund investment South Cherry made as a result of a Hennessee Group recommendation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">(Comply 45.) By its pleaded terms, this is a contract of indefinite duration. No termination provision, express or implied, is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">The contract pleaded by South Cherry thus resembles the alleged oral contracts in <em>United Magazine Co. v. Murdoch Magazines Distribution, Inc., </em>146 F.Supp.2d 385 (S.D.N.Y.2001). In <em>United Magazine, </em>plaintiff magazine wholesalers alleged oral contracts with defendant magazine distributors, under which each wholesaler was \u201chistorically\u201d granted \u201cexclusive geographic territories in which it alone sold publications to retailers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392. Beginning in 1995, defendant distributors began permitting some non-plaintiff wholesalers \u2014 including one of the named defendants \u2014 to sell publications to retailers without regard to exclusive geographic regions. <em>Id. </em>at 393. Plaintiffs claimed breach of its oral contract for the territory. The court held that the Statute of Frauds voided these alleged contracts because the contracts were for indefinite terms and. \u201cPlaintiffs do not allege that their contracts with the Distributors contained express termination provisions, but only implied termination provisions. Since no express term was ever alleged, the contracts are for an indefinite duration and so not capable of performance within one year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404; <em>see also Burke v. Bevona, </em>866 F.2d 532, 538 (2d Cir.1989) (\u201cThe New York cases uniformly hold that implied termination terms are not sufficient to take an oral contract out of the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">South Cherry contends that the pleaded contract \u201cis <em>capable </em>of being performed within one year\u201d because \u201conce South Cherry redeems or sells a Hennessee Group-recommended hedge fund \u2014 which it can do any time \u2014 it no longer owes Hen-nessee Group a commission.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Opp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Br. at 16.) (emphasis in original.) In support of this argument, South Cherry relies on <em>Rosbach v. Industry Trading Co., Inc., </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe Statute of Frauds will not act as a bar\u201d to the enforcement of any contract that \u201cmay be fairly and reasonably interpreted such that it may be performed within a year.\u201d 81 F.Supp.2d 522, 525 (S.D.N.Y.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Such reliance is misplaced, because plaintiffs interpretation of the pleaded contract is neither \u2018fair\u2019 nor \u2018reasonable.\u2019 The Complaint clearly pleads a single, overarching advisory agreement, pursuant to which Hennessee Group contracted to recommend hedge fund investments from time to time, in exchange for a 1% commission on each investment that South Cherry chose to make. (Comply 45.) That is a classic example of a contract of indefinite duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Furthermore, if the alleged oral contract were terminated every time South Cherry sold all of its Hennessee Group-recommended hedge fund equity, then the contract would only be capable of being terminated within one year by South Cherry, not by Hennessee Group. \u201c\u2018Under New-York law, however, if performance within one year depends upon an act solely within the control of the party seeking to enforce the oral agreement, the Statute of Frauds remains applicable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Canet v. Gooch Ware Travelstead, </em>917 F.Supp. 969, 984 (E.D.NY.1996) (quoting <em>Zaitsev v. Salomon Brothers, Inc., </em>60 F.3d 1001, 1003 (2d Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">For these reasons, the alleged oral contract is void under New York\u2019s Statute of Frauds, and South Cherry\u2019s breach of contract claim must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\n<em>C. Breach of Fiduciary Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">South Cherry\u2019s third cause of action alleges that Hennessee Group breached its fiduciary duty as South Cherry\u2019s investment advisor. (Compl.1ffl 51-53.) The Group moves to dismiss this claim on the basis that it is preempted by the Martin Act, New York\u2019s blue sky law, which authorizes only the New York attorney general to enforce its provisions. (Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 21.) Plaintiff counters that this cause of action \u201cis created by federal statute, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80b-l <em>et seq.,\u2019\u2019 </em>and it \u201cwould be meaningless for an investment advisor to have fiduciary duties to individual customers, if the customers had no individual recourse for the breach of these duties.\u201d (PL\u2019s Opp. Br. at 18-19.) Moreover, South Cherry contends that a recent Southern District of New York case, <em>Lou-ros v. Kreicas, </em>367 F.Supp.2d 572 (S.D.N.Y.2005), supports a finding that the Martin Act does not preempt plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">To the extent that South Cherry is now attempting to frame its breach of fiduciary duty claim as a private cause of action based on the 1940 Act, that argument fails. It is well-settled that \u201cno implied private right of action for damages exists under Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\u201d <em>In re Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. Research Reports Secs. Litig., </em>272 F.Supp.2d 243, 256 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (citing <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 15-16, 100 S.Ct. 242, 62 L.Ed.2d 146, (1979)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Complaint seeks $1,150,000 in damages for the Group\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty. (Compl. at 24.) Therefore, the Complaint can only plead a claim under stale law.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>And unfortunately for South Cherry, its claim is indeed preempted by the Martin Act, which provides the New York Attorney General with the sole discretion to investigate securities violations within or from the stale of New York. <em>See </em>N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7 352(1) (McKinney 2007). No private right of action exists under the Martin Act, either. <em>See CPC Int\u2019l Inc. v. McKesson Corp., </em>70 N.Y.2d 268, 276-77, 519 N.Y.S.2d 804, 514 N.E.2d 116 (N.Y. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Claims relating to \u201cinvestment advice\u201d have been deemed \u201cactivities within the Martin Act\u2019s purview,\u201d <em>Sedona Corp. v. Ladenburg Thalmann &amp; Co., Inc., </em>No. 03-CV-3120, 2005 WL 1902780, at *21 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2005), as are claims involving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">(a) ... fraud, deception, concealment, suppression, false pretense ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">(b) ... promise or representation as to the future which is beyond reasonable expectation or unwarranted by existing circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">(c) ... representation or statement which is false, where the person who made such representation or statement; (i) knew the truth; or (ii) with reasonable effort could have known the truth; or (iii) made no reasonable effort to ascertain the truth; or (iv) did not have knowledge concerning the representation or statement made ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7 <em>352-c(l).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">The vast majority of state and federal courts have found that \u201ccauses of action related to a plaintiffs securities fraud claim that do not include scienter as an essential element are typically preempted by the Martin Act, in contrast to a claim requiring intent, such as a claim for common law fraud.\u201d <em>Sedona Corp., </em>2005 WL 1902780, at *22; <em>see also Dujardin v. Liberty Media Corp., </em>359 F.Supp.2d 337, 355 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (noting that allowing plaintiff to proceed on claim that lacked scien-ter element \u201cwould effectively permit a private action under the Martin Act, which the New York State Court of Appeals had already determined would be impermissible.\u201d). According to Judge Sand, the courts that have made this distinction</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYr\">have offered a persuasive justification for so doing: the latter two causes of action [for negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty], like the Martin Act itself, do not require proof of deceitful intent; common law fraud, however, does, Courts concerned with preserving the Attorney General\u2019s exclusive domain therefore preclude claims which essentially mimic the Martin Act, but permit common law fraud claims, which require an additional element.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A95\"><em>Nanopierce Techs., Inc. v. Southridge Capital Management LLC, </em>No. 02-CV-0767, 2003 WL 22052894, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 2, 2003); <em>accord Castellano v. Young &amp; Ru-bicam, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 171, 190 (2d Cir. 2001) (\u201csustaining a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty in the context of securities fraud would effectively permit a private action under the Martin Act, which would be inconsistent with the Attorney-General\u2019s exclusive enforcement powers thereunder.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Joffee v. Lehman Bros., Inc., </em>No. 04-CV-3507, 2005 WL 1492101, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. June 23, 2005) (\u201cMartin Act does not preclude private litigants from bringing common law fraud claims because such claims require a plaintiff to prove intent or scienter ... [CJourts allow these claims to proceed while simultaneously dismissing breach of fiduciary duty claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">South Cherry relies exclusively on <em>Lau-ros v. Kreicas </em>to support its contention that the Martin Act does not preempt its breach of fiduciary duly claim. 367 F.Supp.2d at 595-96. But <em>Louros </em>is distinguishable from the instant case. In that case, plaintiff investor sued a trader <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>who was making investments on plaintiffs behalf, claiming \u00a7 10(b) violations in addition to several state law claims. On defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Judge Kaplan concluded that plaintiffs breach of fiduciary duty claim was not preempted by the Martin Act because the claim did \u201cnot allege any kind of dishonesty or deception\u201d and therefore did not \u201cimplicate[ ] ... the plain language of the statute []or its policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because plaintiffs claim \u201csimply alleges that [defendant] breached a fiduciary duty owed to [plaintiff] to manage his accounts in a way that comported with his needs and to keep him informed about the market and the trades in his account,\u201d the claim \u201cdoes not allege deception, deliberate or otherwise. Accordingly, [the claim] does not come within the Martin Act, and it will not be dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Unlike the claim in <em>Louros, </em>South Cherry\u2019s breach of fiduciary claim does allege deception. South Cherry claims Hennessee Group was dishonest when it represented that it would never recommend a hedge fund investment without first conducting due diligence, and then did precisely that. This allegation is part and parcel of plaintiffs claim (see Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-9, 51-52), and South Cherry\u2019s claim is therefore distinguishable from the claim discussed in <em>Louros.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Moreover, I concur with the analysis set forth in <em>Castellano, Nano-pierce, </em>and a host of other stale and federal decisions finding breach of fiduciary duty claims arising in the securities context to be preempted by the Martin Act. This analysis is consistent with the statute\u2019s broad reach and purpose. <em>See First Energy Leasing Corp. v. Attorney-General, </em>68 N.Y.2d 59, 64, 505 N.Y.S.2d 855, 496 N.E.2d 875 (1986) (\u201cthe Martin Act should be liberally construed to give effect to its remedial purpose\u201d); <em>accord People v. Lexington Sixty-First </em>As<em>socs., </em>38 N.Y.2d 588, 595, 381 N.Y.S.2d 836, 345 N.E.2d 307 (1976). South Cherry has alleged that Hennessee Group has breached its fiduciary duties to plaintiff by not conducting sufficient due diligence either prior to or after recommending Bayou Accredited as an investment. The claim thus arises in the securities context, and the Complaint alleges \u201ca substantial part of the events of omissions giving rise to this claim occurred in\u201d New York, (Compl. \u00b6 6; <em>see Sedona Corp., </em>2005 WL 1902780, at *21-22 (finding complaint\u2019s statement regarding proper venue in New York sufficient to establish Martin Act\u2019s geographical prong).) Accordingly, South Cherry\u2019s cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is precluded by the Martin Act and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">For the foregoing reasons, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended Complaint is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">This constitutes the decision and order of the court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-10\">. Bayou Group consists of ten separate entities: Bayou Advisors, LLC. Bayou Equities, LLC, Bayou Supertund, LLC, Bayou No Leverage Fund, LLC, Bayou Affiliates Fund, LLC, and Bayou Accredited Fund, LLC \u2014 all Delaware Limited Liability Companies: Bayou Management, LLC, Bayou Securities, LLC, and Bayou Fund, LLC all New York Limited Liability Companies; and Bayou Group, LLC \u2014 a Connecticut Limited Liability Company-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b450-5\">. This initial communication apparently occurred after Hennessee Group met with Craig Bollman, a secured creditor of South Cherry. Several pages of plaintiff's Complaint are devoted to communications between defendants and Mr. Bollman. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-20.) However, prior to the instant motion, defendants moved this court to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration clause in an executed Investment Advisory Agreement, between Mr. Bollman and Hennessee Group. That motion was denied on December 5, 2006. This court specifically found that Mr. Bollman was never an employee or agent of South Cherry\u2019s, nor was he ever authorized to make investments or enter contracts on South Cherry\u2019s behalf, and the Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause was therefore not binding on South Cherry. <em>(See </em>Mem. Order Denying Defs.' Mot. to Compel Arbitration, attached as Ex. D to Declaration of Matthew Wolper (\"Wolper Decl.\u201d), at 5.) Accordingly, any alleged representations made by defendants to Ms. Bollman, and any agreements between Mr. Bollman and Hennessee Group, are irrelevant to this motion. South Cherry\u2019s opposition papers do not contend otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\">.

Accordingly, the \"question whether and when recklessness satisfies the scienter requirement is not presented in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the PSLRA\u2019s \u201cstrong inference\u201d pleading requirement does not carve out an exception for \u00a7 10(b) cases based on recklessness, and the Supreme Court did not exempt allegations of recklessness from the PSLRA's heightened pleading requirements when it interpreted the statute in <em>Tellabs. </em>Until the Supreme Court comes down one way or the other on whether recklessness is enough for scienter, I must follow Second Circuit law, which permits plaintiffs to plead reckless behavior in support of \u00a7 10(b) liability, and I must apply the heightened pleading requirement announced in <em>Tellabs </em>to such pleadings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\">.
