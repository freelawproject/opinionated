The latter did not appear on the oral argument and has filed no brief; hence some matters, which might have been explained satisfactorily, are in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">When the receiver filed his account appellant objected to it and a hearing was held before the Special Term. After the hearing an order was made charging respondent with $19,311.80 and crediting him. with $16,131.21 and directing him to pay over the balance of $3,180.59. Thereafter respondent made a motion to resettle the order. This motion was granted and the liability of respondent was reduced from $3,180.59 to $2,755.59, a difference of $425.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-17\">There are at least two items for which no adequate explanation has been given. Respondent paid himself, as receiver, at the rate of $50 a week without authorization of the court. In the original memorandum decision, the Special Term said: \u201c The item of receiver\u2019s salary has been omitted from the disbursements for which he originally sought credit as set forth in Schedule B of his account \u201d. This conclusion may be so but we find nothing to substantiate it in the record. A comparison of Schedule B, in the receiver\u2019s account, with the disbursements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>allowed in the order appealed from, seems to leave no room for a deduction of $1,250, which was the total amount the receiver paid himself. The figures in one instance are $16,006.21, and in the other $16,256.21. Another item of $300 should be accounted for. This is represented by a check signed by respondent as receiver and payable to the attorney for the plaintiff in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs, and the matter remitted to the Special Term for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs, and the matter remitted to the Special Term for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Foster, P. J., Heffernan, Brewster, Bergan and Coon, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
