The appealing under-tutor approv\u00e9d the deliberations of the family meeting, the account of the tutrix and made no objection whatever in the trial court, to any part or portion of the proceedings which appear in the record. He \u2022 justifies his action in appealing on the ground that he is illiterate and that his approval to the proceedings was given without a proper understanding thereof. He pleads irregularities and defects in the proceedings and prays that this court annul and set them aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">Appellant has evidently mistaken his remedy.
