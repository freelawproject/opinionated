Arizona Savings moved for a summary judgment on Elson\u2019s answer and counterclaim. The court granted the motion and entered judgment. It is from the judgment and the decree of foreclosure that Elson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The principal amount of the promissory note, dated April 9, 1959, secured by the mortgage, was in the sum of $2,700,000. The note provided that the entire unpaid balance should be due and payable on or before April 9, 1961. In September 1963, Elson being in default on payment of both principal and interest, entered into a supplemental agreement with Arizona Savings which provided, inter alia: that if Elson did not perform on or before December 15, 1963, certain obligations, to-wit \u2014 payment of certain interest, taxes and expenses \u2014 it would abandon the property. The material parts of the agreement are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">\u201c * * * will immediately abandon the property which is subject to the lien of the mortgage owned by ARIZONA,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">and immediately after being served with process in a foreclosure action to be filed by ARIZONA in the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, ELSON will cause its attorney to prepare and file an answer in the said action cn behalf of ELSON</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFJ\">\u201c(a) Admitting that ELSON has abandoned the property subject to the said mortgage and admitting that the said property is not used for agricultural or grazing purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-11\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-12\">\u201c(d) Admitting that ARIZONA is entitled to judgment against ELSON in the sums set forth hereinabove together with additional sums as interest for the period commencing December 1, 1963, plus the cost of a foreclosure search, court costs, taxes paid by ARIZONA, and a reasonable sum (not less than three (3%) per cent nor more than four (4%) per cent of the amount found by the court to be due and payable by EL-SON to ARIZONA) as and for attorneys\u2019 fees. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Elson did not perform in accordance with the supplemental agreement, and Arizona Savings filed its foreclosure action on January 10, 1964, seeking judgment for the sum of $2,086,808.32 plus six per cent interest from April 23, 1963, to August 31, 1963, and eight per cent interest from September 1, 1963, until the principal sum is paid; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>$88,000 as reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees; $21,-688.26 as taxes; and various other sums. The complaint alleged that the premises, the subject of the mortgage, had been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">'Elson, in its answer, denied that $88,000 was a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee, and that any sum in excess of $1,000 would be reasonable; also specifically denied that the premises described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint had been abandoned by Elson. Elson also filed a counterclaim alleging that the agreement entered into in September 1963 was invalid for the reason that the directors did not have authority to enter into the same in that it, in effect, disposes of all the property of the corporation, and specifically alleged that the agreement to abandon the property was against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The bases for the assignments of error of Elson are that there were issues to be determined by a trial, and that for this reason the court erred in granting Arizona Savings\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The lower court, in a motion for summary judgment, does not try issues of fact, but only determines whether the same are genuine and in good faith disputed. Perez v. Tomberlin, 86 Ariz. 66, 340 P.2d 982. A motion for summary judgment is granted erroneously if on an examination of the entire record it is found that any disputed fact issue exists which could, if true, affect the final judgment. Arizona Coffee Shops v. Phoenix Downtown Park. Ass\u2019n, 95 Ariz. 98, 387 P.2d 801; Sarti v. Udall, 91 Ariz. 24, 369 P.2d 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Elson contends \u201cthat a genuine issue of fact to be tried existed by reason of the allegation * * * that $88,000 was a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee to be recovered by the plaintiff in the foreclosure action * * *, and the denial * * * that a reasonable fee for plaintiff\u2019s attorneys amounts to the sum. of $88,000.00 or any sum in excess of $1,000.00.\u201d The supplemental agreement of September 1963 provided for \u201ca reasonable sum (not less than .three (3%) per cent nor more than four (4%) per cent of the amount found by the .court to be due and payable by ELSON to ARIZONA) as and for attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d The judgment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the instant case allowed an attorneys\u2019 fee of $88,000. $88,000 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>more than the three per cent minimum provided in the agreement but is slightly under the maximum of four per cent of the amount found by the court to be due and payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">This court has long recognized the right of parties to a note to agree on the amount of attorney\u2019s fees, by providing that the same shall be fixed at a reasonable amount.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014a definite percentage of the amount recovered, or a specific amount.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In the instant case Arizona Savings sought judgment for attorneys\u2019 fees in an amount more than the minimum of three per cent and slightly less than the maximum of four per cent. The denial of Elson that the amount alleged as reasonable in Arizona Savings\u2019s complaint put this question at issue to be determined by the court. In Crouch v. Pixler, 83 Ariz. 310, 320 P.2d 943, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">\u201c * * * the courts generally hold that to justify a finding of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees there must be evidence in support of such finding. * * * \u201cWe therefore hold that where an action is brought upon a written contract as in the present case, which provides that the defaulting party agrees to pay reasonable attorney\u2019s fees without specifying the amount, that it is error for the court to fix the amount of attorney\u2019s fees or submit the issue to a jury in the absence of proof determining what is a reasonable fee.\u201d 83 Ariz. at 315, 320 P.2d at 946.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">The agreement in the instant case which provided for a reasonable sum \u2014 not less than three per cent nor more than four per cent \u2014 -was indefinite as to the exact amount between three and four per cent which would be reasonable. Under the holding of this court in Crouch v. Pixler, supra, evidence was required to determine the amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">There is also the question raised by Elson\u2019s answer, which denies any attorneys\u2019 fees over a thousand dollars is reasonable, as to whether the court, in fixing the attorney\u2019s fees, should fix it within the limits of three to four per cent. In the case of Owens v. Conelly, supra, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">\u201cBy Assignment No. 3 it is claimed that the note is usurious because it contains this clause:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-16\">\u201c \u2018In case counsel is employed I agree to pay as counsel fees an amount equal to 10% of the amount found to be due at the date of collection.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-17\">* * \u2756 * * ;r</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\"We quote from Citizens Nat. Bank of Orange, Va. v. Waugh [4 cir.], 78 F.2d 325, 329, 100 A.L.R. 939:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">\u201c \u2018We come, then, to the question as to whether the provision for a 10 per cent, attorney\u2019s fee for collection in case of default in the payment of a promissory note is to be condemned as contrary to the policy of the law; and we think that this question, nothing else appearing, must be answered in the negative. Of course, if it should appear that a particular provision were used as a mere cloak for usury or that the provision were for so large an amount or were of such a character as to show an intention to provide a mere penalty for nonpayment, a different question would be presented, and it might well be condemned as in conflict with the well-settled policy of the law. But, where the provision is reasonable in amount and legal services are required and are actually rendered in the collection of the instrument, we can think of no consideration of public policy which should condemn it. * * * &gt; \u201d 77 Ariz. at 354, 272 P.2d at 348.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The case of Citizens National Bank of Orange, Virginia v. Waugh, 4 Cir., 78 F.2d 325, 100 A.L.R. 939, from which we quoted with favor in the Owens case, supra, also passed upon the question in the instant case, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">\u201cIn the light of these decisions and the overwhelming weight of authority in the state courts, we hold the rule to be</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">(1) that a provision in a promissory note for the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees for services actually rendered in collection is not to be condemned as contrary to public policy, if reasonable in amount and not used as a cloak for usury or other forbidden transaction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">(2) that such a provision is enforced as a contract of indemnity and the amount stipulated therein is not absolutely binding on the parties or on the court, but will be enforced to the extent that it provides for a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee for services actually rendered in accordance with its terms; and (3) that, where services have been rendered and the amount stipulated is not obviously excessive, the stipulation as to the amount should govern.\u201d 78 F.2d at 331.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">While one line of authorities holds that the amount stipulated in the note is valid and binding in regard to attorney\u2019s fees, there is another line of cases holding that while they are valid they are nevertheless enforceable only to the extent that the amount stipulated is reasonable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>We are of the opinion that the better rule is set forth in Citizens Nat. Bank of Orange, Va. v. Waugh, supra \u2014 -that a provision in regard to a definite amount of attorney\u2019s fees, or a per cent of the amount found due on a note for attorney\u2019s fees, is binding only to the extent that it is reasonable; however, where the services have been rendered, and the amount stipulated is not obviously excessive, the stipulation as to the amount should govern. When \u2014 as in the instant case \u2014 the reasonableness of the amount is denied, then the court must from evidence and the record determine and fix a reasonable amount for the attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">We hold that, in the instant case as to the three per cent stipulated in the agreement, it is not absolutely binding on the parties, or on the court, and the stipulation of three to four per cent as reasonable attorney\u2019s fees is binding only in the amount that the court finds to be reasonable from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Elson next contends \u201cthat a genuine issue of fact to be tried existed by reason of the allegation * * * of the complaint * * *, that the mortgaged premises had been abandoned by Appellant and the denial in * * * the answer * * *, that the mortgaged premises had been abandoned.\u201d The Arizona revised statutes, as amended in 1963, provide, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\u201c\u00a7 12-1282. Time for redemption</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">\u201cA. The judgment debtor or his successors in interest may redeem at any time within thirty days after the date of the sale if the court determined as part of the judgment under which the sale was made that the property was both abandoned and not used primarily for agricultural or grazing purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">\u201cB. The judgment debtor or his successor in interest may redeem at any time within six months after the date of the sale except when the court has made the determinations as provided in subsection A. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">The statute provides that the court must determine if in fact there has been an abandonment. In the instant case had the issue of abandonment been tried by the court, and Arizona Savings relied solely on the introduction of the agreement to abandon, and Elson presented evidence showing that as a matter of fact it had not abandoned the premises, the court would have had to determine that the property had not been abandoned, under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1282, subsec. A, supra. Arizona Coffee Shops v. Downtown Park. Ass\u2019n, supra; Sarti v. Udall, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">Elson, in its counterclaim, alleged that the September 1963 agreement, wherein it provided for an abandonment, was against public policy and contrary to the law of Arizona. This agreement was, in effect, a partial waiver which shortened the redemption period as provided in A.R.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u00a7 12-1282, subsec. B, supra.. Redemption statutes are enacted in the interest of public policy. Dipple v. Neville, 82 Mont. 280, 267 P. 214. Agreements to waive declarations of public policy are necessarily void. Ross v. Ross, 96 Ariz. 249, 393 P.2d 933; Whipple v. Industrial Commission, 59 Ariz. 1, 121 P.2d 876; Olsen v. Union Canal &amp; Irr. Co., 58 Ariz. 306, 119 P.2d 569. The question thus presented is the validity of an agreement to abandon which in effect is a partial waiver of the time period for redemption. A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1282, subsec. A, supra, was enacted to prevent deterioration of property where a mortgagor in default has vacated the premises. The shortening of the period for redemption in cases of abandonment is therefore to prevent a loss from deterioration during the redemption period. In Commercial Savings and Loan Ass\u2019n v. Curts, 187 Kan. 18, 354 P.2d 86, the court, in reference to a redemption statute similar to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1282, subsec. A, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">\u201c \u2018The great preponderance of the evidence showed the premises to be unoccupied, the farm residence vacant, and many of its windows broken, and its foundations undermined, the arable land idle and untilled, the windmills dismantled, the barns and outbuildings collapsed or collapsing, and that they had no appearance of being in the possession of any <em>bona fide </em>caretaker. To meet such conditions, the legislature wisely limited the redemption to 6 months, and the present case was a proper one for the application for the 6 months\u2019 rule.\u2019 \u201d 354 P.2d at 89.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In the instant case there was an effort to reduce the statutory redemption period by the agreement to abandon. Such agreements would mean that the redemption period would end at a time when the mortgagor might be least able to make redemption. The mortgagee could thereby secure title to the property by bidding less than the amount of the judgment, and less than the real value of the property, thereby defeating the purpose and intent of the provisions of the statutes providing for redemption periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The intent and purpose of the statute providing for redemption cannot be vio-, lated by an agreement. The object of the redemption statute is to give to the mortgagor time to pay his obligation and, avoid the loss of his property. In the case of Skach v. Sykora, 6 Ill.2d 215, 127 N.E.2d 453, 52 A.L.R.2d 1320, the court, in discussing the purpose of the redemption period, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\u201cThe purpose of a mortgage foreclosure is to enforce the payment of the mortgagor\u2019s debt. The purpose of the redemption statute is to give the debtor time and opportunity to avoid the loss of his property and to give his other creditors an opportunity to collect their debts from any surplus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>over the mortgage debt. The statutes are not intended to take the landowner\u2019s property unjustly or for an inadequate consideration. They are not intended to penalize the debtor for his default nor to reward the purchaser by unjust enrichment above the amount of his debt at the expense of the landowner and his other creditors. The statute protects the purchaser to the extent of his bid, costs and interest on his investment. The statute contemplates redemption where the value of the property exceeds the sale price. The purchaser knows this when he makes his bid, whether he is the mortgagee or a stranger, and when he is repaid all that the statute allows upon redemption, that is all he is either legally or equitably entitled to receive. As was said in Hruby v. Steinman, 374 Ill. 465, 30 N.E.2d 7, 10, citing Phillips v. Demoss, 14 Ill. 410, \u2018That he [the purchaser] may be deprived of a deed will not avail him, as his right to the land is no higher or more sacred than to the redemption money, and the statute holds out no inducements for a speculation at a sheriff\u2019s sale, beyond the interest provided for the use of the purchase money.\u2019 These being the purposes of a redemption statute a court of equity would not be justified-in attaching a rigidity to its language which carried it beyond that purpose to work inequities.\u201d 127 N.E.2d at 456.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In Mace v. Norwood, 155 Kan. 302, 124 P.2d 497, the court \u2014 in discussing a subsequent agreement whereby the mortgagor, as additional securities for its mortgage, executed an assignment of the rents of the property to the mortgagee, the consideration set forth in the agreement being that the mortgagee withhold foreclosure of said mortgage under the conditions set forth in the agreement \u2014 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARA1\">\u201c \u2018This rent assignment is given * * * in consideration of the fact that the said mortgage * * * is in default and subject to foreclosure, and the\u2019 mortgagee \u2018has agreed <em>* </em>* to withhold foreclosure of said mortgage upon the performance of the obligations under said substitution agreement.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAN\">ifc <em>\u00bf\u00a1i</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3q\">\u201cAppellant argues that to permit defendant to recover in this case would be to violate the spirit of our mortgage redemption law and the purpose of the legislature in enacting it. We think the point is well taken. The redemption law was- designed to protect the debtor by permitting him to redeem at the price at which the property sold. Fraser v. Seeley, 71 Kan. 169, 172, 79. P. 1081. .Any agreement written into a mortgage which attempts to bar the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>right of the mortgagor to redeem is contrary to the purpose of the act and is invalid. While the legislature did not specifically legislate against the plan used by defendant to get the rents of the property during the period of redemption fixed upon the foreclosure of his mortgage, we think it is contrary to the fundamental purpose and intent of the statute.\u201d 124 P.2d at 499.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The reasoning in the Mace case, supra, is applicable to the instant case. In that case there was an attempt to alter statutory rights during the redemption period by giving the mortgagee the rents during that period. The court ruled that such an agreement was invalid on the grounds that an agreement written into a mortgage which would bar the right of the mortgagor to redeem was contrary to the act, and invalid. Hence, an agreement after default which would alter the rights of the mortgagee during such redemption period was invalid. In the instant case, the attempt was to alter the rights during the redemption period by an agreement to abandon, the effect of which was to give the mortgagee possession and title to the property five months earlier than provided in A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1282, subsec. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In the instant case the facts are different from those where the mortgagee purchases' the mortgaged premises by a fair contract entered into after the mortgage is given, or where a purchaser under contract to convey sells his interest by fair contract to the contractor. A conveyance of mortgage realty by mortgagor to mortgagee in satisfaction of mortgage indebtedness, if made fairly and without fraud, oppression, or undue advantage being taken by mortgagee is not against public policy. The same is true of a conveyance by a purchaser under contract to the contractor. In the case of Stallings v. Little, 191 Old. 399, 130 P.2d 525, the court, in holding a sale by mortgagor to a mortgagee was valid in Oklahoma because of a statute which provided that no realty shall be sold for payment of any money or performance of any contract in security for which it may have been pledged or assigned except in pursuance of a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction under such sale, stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">\u201c * * * \u2018there is no legal inhibition on a mortgagor selling the mortgaged property to the mortgagee in satisfaction of his debt\u2019 although this statute was not referred to. Similar statutory provisions are found in many of the states. 41 C.J. 833, \u00a7 1012. The plaintiff refers us to no decision construing this or a similar statute to prevent the mortgagee from purchasing the mortgaged premises by a fair contract entered into after the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>gage is given. * * * \u201d 130 P.2d at 527.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">There are even greater reasons for holding that agreements to abandon property\u2014 and thereby shorten the time of redemption \u2014 to be against public policy than in other types of agreement because abandonment leaves the property unprotected and subject to deterioration and vandalism, and even a possible menace to public safety. To hold otherwise would be to open the door for such agreements, which would result in the beneficial use of such property being lost to the people of our state during the time of such abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We therefore hold the agreement to abandon the property was invalid and against public policy, and that the pleadings presented an issue to be determined by the lower court as to whether the property was in fact abandoned. It is not necesfeary to pass upon other questions raised by Elson in its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">For the reasons stated, the judgment is reversed, and the case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-8\">STRUCKMEYER, V.
