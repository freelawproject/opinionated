A car in front of him stopped, he applied his brakes, and the scooter tires slipped causing the scooter to run into the car in front. Claimant was also employed at the time of the injury on a part-time basis by the Fred Hurley Trucking Company of Phoenix. The Commission, by order of October 29, 1962, made its findings and award based upon an average monthly wage of $380.00 per month, this being the average monthly wage paid claimant by the respondent city, disregarding the $225.00 per month claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>had received as a part-time truck driver during the year previous to the injury. The figure of $380.00 was used as claimant\u2019s monthly wage, as provided under A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1041, in determining the amount of compensation for both temporary total disability and permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Claimant made timely application for rehearing and \"waived his right to a formal hearing or rehearing and agreed that the matter should be submitted to the Commission since only a question of law was involved as to the determination of average monthly wage.\u201d The Commission, by order of December 11, 1962, affirmed its previous findings and award. Claimant then applied to this court for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Thus, the issue presented upon this petition is whether the Commission erred in failing to consider wages earned by claimant in his part-time employment in its determination of his average monthly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Arizona follows the rule that wages from dual unrelated employments will not be combined where both employers are not subject to the compensation act. Sanchez v. Industrial Commission, 96 Ariz. 19, 391 P.2d 579 (1961); Faulkner v. Industrial Commission, 71 Ariz. 76, 223 P.2d 905 (1950). In the instant case both of claimant\u2019s employers were subject to the compensation act.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Subsequent to the submission of claimant\u2019s opening brief, we held, in Sanchez v. Industrial Commission, supra, that where employments are dissimilar the earnings from dual employments will not be aggregated. The record in the instant case does not show that the Commission made a determination as to the similarity or dissimilarity of claimant\u2019s two employments as a basis for its decision. We have held that where the facts are not in dispute this court may draw its own legal conclusions from the record. Williams v. Williams Insulation Materials, Inc., 91 Ariz. 89, 370 P.2d 59. Cavness v. Industrial Commission, 74 Ariz. 27, 243 P.2d 459. In the instant case there is no dispute as to the facts. The question thus raised is one of law, to-wit: Were claimant\u2019s dual employments similar or dissimilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">In Sanchez, supra, the question of similarity was resolved without difficulty. In that case the petitioner\u2019s two employments involved full-time work as a miner and part-time work as a trumpet player. In declaring the two jobs to be dissimilar, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-10\">\u201cThe Commission could not, as a basis for compensation, have combined the earnings prior to the injury of the dissimilar employments of minor and musician.\u201d 96 Ariz. at 23, 391 P.2d at 582</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">We are here presented with a more difficult problem. The Florida court, in determining whether wages from concurrent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>employments could be combined, stated in J. J. Murphy &amp; Son, Inc. v. Gibbs, 137 So.2d 553:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-4\">\u201c * * * the prime factor is the sameness or similarity of the work performed by the employee rather than the thing done or produced by the employer, although the latter factor may also be considered.\u201d 137 So.2d at 558-559</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">And, in Anderson v. Roberts-Karp Hotel Co., 171 Minn. 402, 214 N.W. 265, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">\u201cOther courts confronted with a similar problem have held that it means the aggregate of his usual earnings in the kind of work in which he was engaged at the time of the injury; that the term employment as there used means the particular trade, occupation, or business in which he was then engaged. *1\u00bb *1\u00bb \u00bb!*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-8\">i}i ijc sjc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-9\">\u201c * * * the <em>compensation </em>in cases like that here presented <em>should be based on the amount earned by the employee in the particular calling or kind of employment in which he was engaged when injured. </em>If, in such a case, the amount recoverable were to be measured by the wage received from the particular employer in whose services the injury was sustained, the employee would receive no compensation for the loss of earnings resulting from his inability to perform in the future the services which he had previously performed for other employers.\u201d 214 N. W. at 266-267</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-13\">The test as set forth in Sanchez, supra, is whether the services performed by claimant were similar. To make this determination, we must compare the type of work performed by claimant for the two employers. In his employment with the Fred Hurley Trucking Company claimant drove a truck. For the City of Phoenix he read water meters, using a motor scooter for transportation. We cannot say the act of reading water meters is similar to the driving of a truck. Claimant used a motor scooter for transportation. A truck and a motor scooter are dissimilar \u2014 both in size and the work for which they are used. The knowledge, skill, and energy required for the operation of a truck is much greater than that required for the operation of a motor scooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-14\">We are of the opinion that the work of reading water meters, which incidentally requires the operating of a motor scooter, is not similar to that of driving a truck. Hence, use of a motor scooter for transportation does not make the work of a meter reader similar to the work of a truck driver. We hold that the work in the two jobs of claimant was dissimilar, and that the Commission did not err in refusing to take into consideration claimant\u2019s part-time employment in determining his average <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>monthly wage as provided in A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Award affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b28-5\">LOCKWOOD, C. J., STRUCKMEYER, V. C. J., and BERNSTEIN and UDALL, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
