The Court of Appeals addressed itself to the following issues: (1) must the whole community estate be probated; (2) are executor\u2019s fees calculated on the entire community estate or only upon the deceased\u2019s interest therein; and (3) is the whole community estate to be charged with the costs of administration and family allowance or is only deceased\u2019s interest therein to be so charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">When Foreman died there was, inter alia, $32,052.57 cash belonging to the community and only a total of $434.70 in community debts. The Court of Appeals cited Nowland v. Vinyard, 43 Ariz. 27, 29 P.2d 139; In re Monaghan\u2019s Estate, 65 Ariz. 9, 173 P.2d 107; In re Monaghan\u2019s Estate, 70 Ariz. 349, 220 P.2d 726; In re Monaghan\u2019s Estate, 71 Ariz. 334, 227 P.2d 227, for the proposition that where there are community property debts at the time of one spouse\u2019s death, the entire estate must be probated. It then went on to hold that since there were $434.70 in community debts the entire community estate must be probated and the costs of administration, attorney\u2019s fees, executor\u2019s fees (based on the entire community property estate of both the husband and the wife) and the family allowance must be borne by the entire community estate. Accordingly, the trial court was reversed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>instructions, but not before the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">\u201cThis may be a harsh rule in many instances, as it seems to be in this case, but it is not for this court to change the clear and established law of this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">With the proposition that where there are community debts the entire community estate must be probated the beneficiaries contend that the $20,000 in attorney\u2019s fees be apportioned to the entire community estate. Similarly the First National Bank argues that the executor\u2019s fees be predicated on the community interest of both husband and wife instead of the deceased\u2019s half only, thereby entitling it to $16,621.50 instead of the $8,310.75 provided for by the trial court\u2019s order. With only these two elements then, the cost of administration would exceed $36,000. Finally, the beneficiaries relying on In re Monaghan\u2019s Estate, 65 Ariz. 9, 173 P.2d 107, try to persuade us that the family allowance is to be assessed to the entire community estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Under the facts of the case at bar we believe it would be unconscionable to submit the survivor\u2019s interest to the high costs of administration here incurred. The facts clearly show that at the outset the community debts could easily have been paid from the community assets on hand thus obviating the need to bring the survivor\u2019s interest into probate. Further, we fail to see how the executor\u2019s efforts were increased by virtue of the fact that the surviving wife\u2019s interest was before the probate court. The In re Estate of O\u2019Reilly, 27 Ariz. 222, 227, 231 P. 916, 918, is here controlling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that the statute providing commissions for executors and administrators contemplated the performance of some service on the part of such officers for which the fee is to be paid. In this case the only duty or obligation which devolved upon the executor with reference to the advances made by the testatrix during her lifetime was to see that the same were deducted from the distributive shares of the beneficiaries to whom such advances had been made. This entailed no appreciable service of administration on the part of the executor for which compensation should be allowed, and, under our construction of the statute, the lower court properly rejected the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">\u201cFair compensation should be allowed officers in the administration of an estate for services actually performed, but it is also the duty of the court to safeguard the property of the estate, and not countenance claims in the absence of reasonable, justification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">When either spouse dies the title to the survivor\u2019s interest in community real property vests immediately, LaTourette v. LaTourette, 15 Ariz. 200, 137 P. 426; In re Estate of Wilson, 19 Ariz. 205, 168 P. 503, and similarly the real property of a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ceased person changes in ownership upon his death by operation of law and becomes vested in his heirs. Home Insurance Co. v. Latimer, 33 Ariz. 288, 264 P. 103; Stephens v. Comstock-Dexter Mines, Inc., 54 Ariz. 519, 97 P.2d 202. Such is not the case with personalty, for title to personal property vests in the administrator upon death. In re Jacob\u2019s Estate, 81 Ariz. 288, 305 P.2d 438. However, despite this distinction the realty of the community estate may still come under the jurisdiction of the probate court to satisfy community debts. Accordingly, the interest of the heirs is subject to the payment of the debts of the estate, the expense of administration and the family allowance as provided by the Arizona Revised Statutes. If there are no community debts or where they are insignificant in comparison to the community assets on hand the interest of the surviving spouse should not be subject to the expenses of administration, where it does not benefit the survivor\u2019s estate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">\u201cWe have held in the case of La Tourette v. La Tourette, supra, that the probate court, in administering community property, may assume jurisdiction of the whole of the estate in order to determine the debts chargeable against it, and to direct their payment out of the community property. And, indeed, this is the proper course in most of the cases where either spouse dies, for, while the title to the property vests immediately upon the death without administration, it vests subject to community debts, and these debts follow the property into the hands of a purchaser, unless they have been settled or barred in the manner provided by statute. It is therefore generally advisable to administer the entire estate, but the only purpose of such administration is to see that all community debts are either paid or barred. If, therefore, it appears that there are no such debts, the interest of the surviving spouse certainly should not he subject to the expenses of the administration, it being of no benefit to such estate.\u201d Roberson v. Teel, 35 Ariz. 166 at 170, 171, 275 P. 2 at 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADY\">This principle applies equally to personalty as well as realty. Faulkner v. Faulkner, 23 Ariz. 313, 203 P. 560; In re Jacob\u2019s Estate, 81 Ariz. 288, 305 P.2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In regard to the family allowance, we believe A.R.S. \u00a7 14-681 is quite clear, and In re Monaghan\u2019s Estate, 65 Ariz. 9, 173 P.2d 107, is inapplicable because of its factual setting. Section A.R.S. \u00a7 14-681 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, the property of a decedent shall he chargeable with payment of * * * the allowance to his family * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">In the first In re Monaghan\u2019s Estate case this court employed the excepting clause of \u00a7 38-1201, A.C.A. 1939 [presently A.R.S. \u00a7 14-681]. The facts in that case showed that the community debts exceeded community assets which there permitted this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u2022court to rely on \u00a7 38-903, A.C.A. 1939, the predecessor of our present A.R.S. \u00a7 14-515, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">\u201cIf the amount set apart be insufficient for the support of the widow and children, or either, the court shall make such allowance out of the estate as may be necessary for the maintenance of the family,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The court there noted the sections preceding \u00a7 38-803, A.C.A. 1939, and held that the estate consists of, amongst other things, the interest of the survivor if such interest is being probated to satisfy community debts. Clearly, in the first Monaghan case the entire community estate was being probated because there the community debts exceeded the community cash on hand and the representative took possession of all community property. Thus, under the facts there the court could say the entire community estate makes up the \u201cestate\u201d and point to the mandate of \u00a7 38-903, A.C.A. 1939 [presently A.R.S. \u00a7 14 \u2014 515] which brought into force the excepting provision of \u00a7 38-1201, A.C.A. 1939, [presently A.R.S. \u00a7 14-681]. The opinion of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the judgment of the superior court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b171-7\">LOCKWOOD, C. J., STRUCKMEYER, V. C.
