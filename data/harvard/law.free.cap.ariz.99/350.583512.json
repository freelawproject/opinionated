Article II, \u00a7 3 purports to set up an \u201cEthics Committee\u201d to investigate, inter alia, violations of the Board\u2019s rules relating to unprofessional conduct. Article III, \u00a7 1 purports to make a violation not only of A.R.S. \u00a7 32-924 (1959) but also of \u201cany of the rules or regulations\u201d of the Board as grounds for suspension or revocation of a chiropractor\u2019s license. Articles IV and V purport to require chiropractors desiring renewal of their licenses to agree to abide by the rules and regulations of the Board of Chiropractic Examiners, in addition to the requirements provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">The plaintiffs (appellees) as licensed, practicing chiropractors alleged that they had been threatened with \u201cpunitive action\u201d by the Board on account of advertising violative of the Code of Ethics, and of us\u00e9 of the term \u201cdoctor\u201d instead of the qualified, \u201cDoctor of Chiropractic.\u201d Other appellees have been threatened with refusal to renew their licenses unless they signed the new application form promising to abide by all the rules and regulations of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">The appellees sought injunctive relief and relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1831 et seq. asking the court to declare that the Board had exceeded the authority delegated to it by the Legislature. Thereafter, appellees filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which was granted on May 1, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">Where the Legislature has by its enactments declared policies and fixed primary standards, it may validly confer on administrative bodies power to prescribe rules and regulations to promote the spirit and purpose of the legislation and its complete operation, in keeping with the clear intent of the enactment. See Employment Security Comm, of Arizona v. Arizona Citrus Growers, 61 Ariz. 96, 144 P.2d 682 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">The enabling statute herein provides only that the Board \u201c * * * shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>adopt rules and regulations for the performance of its duties.\u201d A.R.S. \u00a7 32-904, suhsec. B. Thus, the Legislature did not confer any power in the Board to prescribe rules and regulations other than those necessary to carry out the duties specifically imposed under A.R.S. Chapter 8, Title 32. Any other interpretation would indicate an unconstitutional grant of legislative authority. See, State v. Marana Plantations, 75 Ariz. 111, 252 P.2d 87 (1953); State v. Birmingham, 95 Ariz. 310, 390 P.2d 103 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">If the Legislature had intended to grant the Board power to prescribe rules (within defined limits) regulating professional conduct it could have expressly done so. See, e. g. A.R.S. \u00a7 32-237, suhsec. 2 (attorneys) ; A.R.S. \u00a7 32-703, suhsec. A (1960), (accountants). See also, Arizona State Board of Medical Examiners v. Clark, 97 Ariz. 205, 398 P.2d 908 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">A further requirement that a legislative grant must establish standards within which the administrative hoard may act need not he discussed at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In view of the foregoing it is unnecessary to discuss the Board\u2019s requirement to sign the application agreeing to compliance with the Board\u2019s standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that the Rules and Regulations adopted by the Arizona State Board of Chiropractic Examiners are void and unconstitutional, as they did not represent a valid exercise of authorized power.</p>\n<judges id=\"b372-9\">STRUCKMEYER, V. C. J., and BERNSTEIN, UDALL and McFARLAND, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
