Winchester on June 10, 1856. But until Charles Winchester released his interest in this tract to George C. Winchester, on January 17, 1859, the two Winchesters were tenants in common of the land. An estate of homestead was not created by that statute in land held in common and undivided; and the statute was repealed before the conveyance of January 17, 1859.
