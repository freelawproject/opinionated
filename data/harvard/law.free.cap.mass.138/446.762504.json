Pratt and George F. Moore, upon a promissory note for $1671.08, dated August 11, 1881, payable in two months after date to the order of the plaintiffs, signed by Pratt, and indorsed by Moore. Trial in the Superior Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>before Barker, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\">The plaintiffs are partners doing business in the city of New York. There was evidence that the note was signed by the defendant Pratt, and indorsed before delivery by the defendant Moore. A telegram from Moore to the plaintiffs, dated and received on the day the note matured, was put in evidence, and was as follows: \u201cPratt has not arrived here yet. In the West. Expected next Tuesday. I ask recall of note due, and hold over till I see him.\u201d There was also evidence that, in November, after the maturity of the note, Thomas Corner, Jr., one of the plaintiffs, came to Boston and had an interview with Moore, in which Moore promised to pay the note with interest, two thirds by new notes, and one third, or $560.28, by a check, and Corner agreed that, if the check was sent, he would take the new notes for the balance. Subsequently, Moore sent three notes of $373.52 each, but did not send the $560.28 check or cash. In response, the plaintiffs wrote the following letter to Moore, dated November 22, 1881: \u201c We are to-day in receipt of an envelope from you with three notes for $373.52 each, but no check. We are very much surprised at this, after what you promised the writer a few days ago. If you will recall, your positive promise was made to send a check .for $560.28 on the 18th, and the notes as above for the balance. You have not done so. We certainly did not agree to accept these notes, except in connection with the money. We shall expect to receive the check not later than the 26th. Please attend to it.\u201d The plaintiffs retained Moore\u2019s notes to the time of trial; but after the arguments were closed, and before the jury were charged, tendered them to Moore\u2019s counsel, who declined to receive them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\">There was no evidence of demand and notice, or of waiver of demand and notice, nor of payment or non-payment, except as stated above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\">The defendant Moore requested the judge to rule that, as Moore was an indorser, there was no evidence to go to the jury that there was any notice to him, or any evidence of a waiver of demand and notice on his part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-8\">The judge refused so to rule; and instructed the jury on this point, that they might consider the telegram from Moore to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>plaintiffs, and his subsequent negotiations for a settlement, on the question whether or not he had waived demand and notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\">The defendants also requested the judge to instruct the jury, that, if the plaintiffs entered into an agreement with Moore to receive Moore\u2019s notes for two thirds of the amount of the old note, and the balance in cash, and, in pursuance of that agreement, such notes were received and retained by the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs, could not recover in this action, although the balance of cash was not forwarded. The judge instructed the jury on this point as follows : \u201c If the plaintiffs made an agreement with Moore to accept cash and notes in payment, and they received only the notes, they were not bound to receive the notes alone without the cash in part payment of the original note. There were two courses open to them: they could apply the notes in reduction of their claim, or they could decline to accept them. In the absence of evidence that they did accept the notes and apply them in part payment, you are not to infer that they did so. I construe the plaintiffs\u2019 letter to Moore in this way : they did not accept the notes and apply them to the payment of the old note, as claimed by the defendants, but they merely postponed the time within which the cash was to be paid. And you have seen that the notes given by Moore have been tendered back in your presence. If you find an agreement to give cash and new notes in payment, and that the new notes were sent and the cash was not sent, and the plaintiffs sent the letter of November <em>22, </em>and if you find no other facts, I instruct you that there is no evidence in the case from which you can find that the plaintiffs did accept Moore\u2019s notes and apply them to the payment of the old note. But if, upon all the evidence in the case, you should find that the plaintiffs did so accept and apply Moore\u2019s notes, then there was a part payment of that amount only, and not of the whole amount.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-6\">C. <em>E. Washburn, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-7\"><em>H. Wheeler, </em>for the plaintiffs, was not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b466-8\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"ASZ\">There was clearly sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding a waiver by the defendant Moore of demand and notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>It appeared at the trial, that, after the note in suit matured, the plaintiffs agreed that they would accept in payment of it new notes for two thirds of its amount, and cash for the other third. Moore sent the notes to the plaintiffs, but did not send the money, and the plaintiffs replied, refusing to accept the notes without the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">If this had been all the evidence, the jury would not have been justified in finding that the note in suit was paid. It also appeared that the plaintiffs retained the new; notes until the trial, when they tendered them to the defendants. The fact that they retained them was not conclusive evidence that they accepted them in part payment of the note in suit; it was properly left to the jury, with the other evidence in the case, to be considered by them upon this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">If the jury were satisfied that such notes were not received in part payment, it was sufficient if the plaintiffs returned them at the trial. <em>Whitton </em>v. Mayo, 114 Mass. 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
