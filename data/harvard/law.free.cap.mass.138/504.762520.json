The government contended that the defendant was the proprietor, and, for the purpose of showing this, asked a witness what he had seen the defendant \u201c doing with reference to this place.\u201d The defendant objected; but the question was competent, as it had a tendency to show that the defendant was conducting this express business as its proprietor.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>J. Brown, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b523-5\"><em>H. N. Shepard, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">The defendant principally relies upon the ground that there \u2022was not sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding that the liquors were brought into the town by the defendant with an unlawful intent. It appeared that a constable of the town went to the express office, a room, about fourteen feet square, with a search-warrant; and that he found a large quantity of whiskey in jugs, and of lager beer in bottles. A barrel containing bottles of lager beer, and each of four three-gallon jugs of whiskey had a tag attached, with \u201cS. P. S., Stoughton,\u201d on it in writing, and, in print, \u201c From McArdle Brothers, Foreign and Domestic Ales, Wines, Liquors, and Cigars, No. 206 Eliot Street, Boston.\u201d Another case of lager beer was marked \u201c Mr. Daniel W. Murphy, Stoughton.\u201d Other jugs and packages had no marks. Some of the jugs of whiskey were in locked boxes, and, when the officer asked the defendant for the keys, he replied that \u201c he did not know anything about any keys.\u201d It was also testified that the defendant had been seen at different times carrying jugs from the railroad depot to his express office. The fair inference is, that the defendant brought into the town the liquors found in his office, and that he did not intend them for his own use. We cannot say, as matter of law, that, upon all the facts shown, considered in connection with the fact that the defendant made no explanation of them, when such explanation would seem to be in his power if the liquors were intended for a lawful purpose, the jury were not justified in inferring that he had reasonable cause to believe that they were intended to be sold in violation of law. <em>JExeeptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
