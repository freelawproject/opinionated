The deed is to be delivered and the consideration paid on or before June 1 next.\u201d The bill alleged readiness on the part of the plaintiff, at all times since the signing of the agreement, to perform the same, and a failure on the part of the defendant to perform his part of the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\">The answer denied that the plaintiff had a title in fee to the estate which he could convey ; and alleged that he could convey a title only for the life of one Mary Frazier Curtis; and that the plaintiff\u2019s title was derived as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-9\">Daniel Sargent died, seised in fee of the estate, in 1842. By his will, which was duly admitted to probate, the estate was devised in fee to his daughter, Maria Osborne Curtis, and her husband, Thomas B. Curtis. Maria Osborne Curtis deceased before her father, leaving her husband, Thomas B. Curtis, surviving, and as her only heirs two children, named Daniel Sargent Curtis and Mary Frazier Curtis. By deed dated April 9, 1852, Thomas B. Curtis and Daniel Sargent Curtis united in a deed of said estate to the said Mary Frazier Curtis. The consideration named in said deed was one dollar \u201d and \u201c other good considerations.\u201d By the terms of said deed, Thomas and Daniel did \u201c give, grant, sell, and convey to the said Mary Frazier and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>her heirs and assigns \u201d the said premises, properly described therein, \u201c to have and to hold the premises to the said Mary Frazier, to her sole and separate use, free from the control or. interference of any husband she may have, and to the use of heir [s\u00ed'c] heirs and assigns forever.\u201d The deed contained no covenant whatever. Mary Frazier Curtis, by deed dated October 26, 1854, conveyed the said estate to Daniel S. Curtis, covenanting that the granted premises were free from all incumbrances made or suffered by her, and warranting the same against the claims and demands of all persons claiming by, through, or under her, but against none other. The plaintiff derives his title to the said premises by mesne conveyance from Daniel S. Curtis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-4\">The said Mary Frazier Curtis is still living, and has never been married. Her father, the said Thomas B.

Curtis. The granting part clearly gives her a fee simple. The habendum is to her and \u201cto the use of heir heirs and assigns forever.\u201d Plainly the word \u201c heir \u201d is a clerical mistake for \u201c her.\u201d The provision, that she is to hold the premises free from the control of any husband she may have, is surplusage, but it does not show any intention to cut down or limit the grant of a fee simple clearly made in the granting part of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
