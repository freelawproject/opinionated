He had proved a contract with the defendant for the purchase of standing grass, which was to be fully paid for before any of the hay made therefrom should be removed. He also testified that it had been stated to him by the defendant, at the time of his purchase, that \u201chis wife did the buying and selling, and carried on the general business of the farm for him.\u201d It was further alleged by the plaintiff, that there had been a mistake in the boundaries of the lot on which the grass was growing; and the plaintiff\u2019s son testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>that, after the discovery of the alleged mistake, the wife of the defendant told the plaintiff that he might remove it at any time without paying the balance due. The son further testified, that on a later occasion, at a conversation between the plaintiff and the defendant, in the presence of the defendant\u2019s wife, the defendant distinctly refused to \u201c recognize any mistake, or make any allowance on account of it.\u201d The plaintiff then offered to prove, by the same witness, that the defendant\u2019s wife followed the plaintiff and the witness out of the house immediately, and told the plaintiff that he might remove the hay without making further payment. This was excluded on the defendant\u2019s objection; and the plaintiff excepted. The witness then said, \u201c She said it right there \u201d (referring to the room where the defendant was). \u201c She said, 6 Go on and get the hay, and you need not pay any more money.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">We are not prepared to say that, after he had been distinctly notified by the defendant of his refusal to recognize any mistake, or make any allowance therefor, the plaintiff could rely upon any modification of his contract subsequently made by the wife, whose limited agency is above stated. But if the excluded evidence was relevant and material, the plaintiff has had the full benefit of it by this declaration of the witness, which was received without objection, and was in reply to the inquiry. If evidence sought to be introduced has been laid before the jury in the course of the trial, it is quite immaterial that it was not admitted when first offered. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; Worcester </em>Railroad, 7 Gray, 92, 96. <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>118 Mass. 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\n<em>Fxceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
