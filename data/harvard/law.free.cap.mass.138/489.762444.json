Sts. <em>e. </em>207, \u00a7 13, which provides that the keeper of a house of ill-fame shall be punished by imprisonment in the jail not exceeding two years. The defendant contends that the Municipal Court of the city of Boston has not jurisdiction of this offence. The Pub. Sts. <em>e. </em>154, \u00a7 50, provide that the original criminal jurisdiction of that court \u201c shall include all crimes under the degree of felony,\u201d with certain exceptions not affecting this case. As the offence charged in this case is not a felony, it follows that it is within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court of the city of Boston. Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>210, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled'.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
