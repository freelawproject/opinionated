Street and 0. Street crossed each other in a city. The sidewalk, at both the northeasterly and southeasterly comers, was of concrete, and separated from the carriage path by curbstones. At a distance of about five feet from the curbstone at the northeasterly corner of the two streets, the concrete had been taken up and removed, making a hole in the crossing about four and a half feet long and of the width of the concrete, and leaving the concrete on the northerly side standing up and terminating abruptly, and presenting a perpendicular edge to the hole. A person was injured by falling upon this defect, while crossing the carriage path of W. Street on the concrete; and gave a written notice to the city, stating that the injury occurred \u201c at the comer of W. and O. Streets, .... in consequence of the defective condition of the sidewalk at that point, the concrete having been taken up part of the way and the remainder left, which stood up above the other part of the walk.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that, whether the description of the place of the accident as in the sidewalk was strictly accurate or not, the notice was sufficient.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-9\">Tort, for personal injuries occasioned to the plaintiff by a defect in a concrete crossing in the defendant city.

The minute description of the nature of the defect aids in fixing the place. There is no occasion for us to assume that the city had left such a defect at more than one corner of these streets. Whether the description of the place of the defect as in the sidewalk was strictly accurate or not, (which may be open to question,) we cannot see that an officer of the city, with the notice in his hand, looking for the alleged defect, would have any doubt as to the precise spot. This is all that the statute requires. <em>Lowe </em>v. Clinton, 133 Mass. 526. <em>Welch </em>v. Gardner, 133 Mass. 529. <em>McCabe </em>v.
