Allen, JJ., absent.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b375-5\">In an action upon a poor debtor\u2019s recognizance, it appeared, from the agreed facts upon which the case was submitted, that an adjournment of the debtor\u2019s examination was to ten o\u2019clock of a certain day, at his request, \u201c with agreement that the debtor should in the mean while pay three dollars; \u201d that, on the day appointed, the hearing was resumed at eleven o\u2019clock; that the three dollars were not paid; and that the debtor was discharged. <em>Held, </em>that the agreed facts showed that the debtor was present before the hour elapsed; and that the payment of the three dollars by the debtor was not a condition of his right to be heard at the adjourned hearing, even if the magistrate had the right to impose such a condition.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-6\">Contract upon a poor debtor\u2019s recognizance, entered into, under the Pub. Sts. <em>a. </em>162, \u00a7 28, by one Magee as principal and by the defendant as surety, and containing the usual conditions. The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the defendant, to this court, on appeal, upon agreed facts, in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-7\">Due notice was given by the debtor of his desire to take the poor debtor\u2019s oath before a master in chancery, at ten o\u2019clock A. M., on December 28, 1882, which notice was duly served upon the creditor. The hearing was duly entered upon, and continued to January 2, 1883, at eight o\u2019clock A. M., at which time an examination of the debtor was entered upon. During said examination, the debtor asked for further continuance, which was granted to January 6, 1883, at ten o\u2019clock A. m., with agreement that the debtor should in the mean while pay three dollars. On January 6, the hearing was resumed at eleven o\u2019clock A. M., by arguments on the effect of the debtor\u2019s non-payment of three dollars, which he did not pay. The magistrate decided to proceed ; the creditor said that he had nothing further to say ; and thereupon the magistrate administered the poor debtor\u2019s oath to the debtor, and discharged him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-8\">If, upon the above facts, the plaintiff was entitled to recover, judgment was to be \u2022 entered for him for the amount of the penalty of the recognizance; otherwise, for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-9\">N. <em>D. A. </em>Clarke, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-10\"><em>W. H. </em>Gove, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9i\">The adjournment of the poor debtor\u2019s examination was to ten o\u2019clock. The hearing was resumed at eleven, and ended in the debtor\u2019s discharge. If this is construed fairly, it can only mean that the debtor was present before the hour elapsed, and we are surprised that the contrary should have been argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The continuance was granted at the debtor\u2019s request, \u201c with agreement that the debtor should in the mean while pay three dollars.\u201d This may import that the agreement was the consideration for the creditor\u2019s not opposing the adjournment, but it does not even suggest that payment was a condition of the debtor\u2019s right to be heard at the adjourned hearing. The magistrate\u2019s conduct shows that he had not intended to make such a condition; and it is therefore unnecessary to inquire by what authority he could have imposed it. See <em>Coleman </em>v. Hawkes, 120 Mass. 594. <em>Judgment for the defendant.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
