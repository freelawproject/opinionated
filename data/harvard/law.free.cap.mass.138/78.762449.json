Sts. c. 52, \u00a7 21.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-8\">Tort, for personal injuries occasioned to the plaintiff by reason of a defect in a highway in the defendant city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-9\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Aldrich, </em>J., the plaintiff offered in evidence the following notice, signed by her and dated February 1, 1883, service of which was admitted; \u201c To Michael J. Griffin, city clerk of the city of Holyoke: You are hereby notified that on, Wednesday, the seventeenth day of January, A. D. 1883, between nine and ten o\u2019clock in the forenoon, I received an injury by falling on the sidewalk on the southerly side of Dwight Street, in said Holyoke, and in front of the coal office of William B. Whiting and Company. The cause of said injury was the dangerous condition of said sidewalk, made so by the accumulation of frozen ice and snow on said sidewalk, making the same rough, uneven, and dangerous, and that I claim damages from said city of Holyoke in the sum of four thousand dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-10\">The defendant objected to the sufficiency of the notice, on the ground that it was not a notice to the city of Holyoke, within the requirements of the statute, but a notice to Michael J. Griffin individually.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-11\">The judge sustained the objection; ruled that the action could not be maintained; and directed a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>R. O. Dwight, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-4\"><em>G. M. Stearns &amp; T. B.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuG\">The case of <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Hampshire, ante, </em>74, is decisive of the case at bar. The statute requires that, the notice in writing which a plaintiff must give, as the condition of his right to maintain an action, may be given \u201cin the case of a city, to the mayor, the city clerk, or the treasurer.\u201d Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>52, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The notice in this case was addressed \u201c to Michael J. Griffin, city clerk of the city of Holyoke,\u201d and it expressly states that the plaintiff claims \u201c damages from said city of Holyoke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">It is fuller and plainer than the notice in <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Hampshire ; </em>and, for the reasons stated in that case, we are of opinion that it was a sufficient notice to the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\n<em>JExeeptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
