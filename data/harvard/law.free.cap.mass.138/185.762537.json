Trial in the Superior Court, before Pitman, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">The government introduced evidence tending to prove that, between nine and ten o\u2019clock in the evening of the day named in the indictment, a horse and buggy were driven up to the house of Sarah P. Farnham, in Peabody, and were turned round in the yard, and stopped opposite an open shed, the buggy being twenty-nine feet from the door of the kitchen of the house when stopped. The noise of the carriage attracted the attention of Mrs. Farnham, her husband, and of their servant, one Bohan. The servant testified that, while the horse and buggy were stopped as above stated, she saw a man come from the direction of the shed and get into the buggy, and that he soon drove off. Mrs. Farnham, her husband, and Bohan all testified that, after the man left, they went into the shed with a light, and found there a cartridge of Atlas powder, a fuse, and a bottle of kerosene.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-8\">Mrs. Farnham, among other witnesses who testified to the identity of the man with the defendant, testified that she had known the defendant by sight, but had never heard him speak before said February 6 ; that on that day, about noon, the defendant drove into the yard in a sleigh, with another man, and stopped near the door of the house; that neither of them got out of the sleigh ; that she went to the door, and the defendant said, \u201c Does Mr. Farnham live here ? \u201d and she replied, \u201c Yes, but is not at home ; \u201d that then he said, \u201c Well, he lives here, don\u2019t he ? \u201d and then he drove away; that that was all she ever heard him say; that the voice was coarse, gruff, and very ugly; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>that, on the same evening, while the buggy was stopped in her yard as above stated, she went to the door and said twice, \u201c Who is there ? \u201d and the person in the buggy replied to the second question only, \u201c What do you think ? \u201d and that she did not see the person in the buggy. The district attorney then asked her who it was that spoke. This question was objected to, on the ground that she had no such means of knowledge as would render an answer competent. The judge overruled the objection; and the witness answered, \u201cI can say from the voice .that it was the same man that spoke to me at noon, \u2014 I say it was William Hayes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARz\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-5\"><em>W.
