He also - provided that, if his wife desired the land to be sold, he authorized his executors and trustees to sell the same, pay the proceeds to his trustees, to be invested by them, the income thereof to be paid to his wife for life, and the principal to be disposed of in accordance with the provisions regulating the distribution of the trust fund as provided in the next article of his will. By the fourth article, he bequeathed to trustees a sum of money, in trust to pay the net income to his wife for life, and on her death to distribute the principal among his children then living. The fifth article directed that all \u201cmoneys\" bequeathed to each of his daughters should be managed by the trustees in separate trusts, and the income only paid to each daughter during her life, and on her death \u201c the principal sum \u201d should be \u201c distributed \u201d in a way specified. A subsequent article directed that all \u201c moneys \u201d directed to be given to his sons A. and T. should be managed by his trustees in separate trusts, they to receive only the income for life. By the ninth article, the residue of the testator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>property, real, personal, and mixed, was devised to trustees, in trust to pay over the income to the children equally, and on a certain day, if the fund was then large enough to give each child a certain sum,-to distribute the principal among the children. The eleventh article authorized the trustees to sell \u201c any and all of my said trust property and estate, both real and personal,\u201d preserving to the wife the rights given by the third article of the will. The only land owned by the testator was that mentioned in the third article of the will, and this was not sold during the lifetime of the testator\u2019s widow. <em>Seld, </em>that the trust estate did not include this land, and that the gift to the children in fee contained in the third article of the will was not controlled by the subsequent articles.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-4\">The eirst case was a writ o\u00ed entry, dated March 17,1884, and brought by Francis E.

Parker and Oscar Iasigi, named in the will as trustees, duly qualified and acted as trustees under the will. Oscar Iasigi died on January 18,1884, and the demand-ant Joseph A. Iasigi was, on February 25, 1884, duly appointed trustee in his place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-6\">The testator left ten children surviving him, all of whom also survived the testator\u2019s widow, who died on December 27, 1883. The tenant is one of said children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-7\">The testator was not, at the time of making bis will, or at any time afterwards, entitled to any real estate other than that specified in his will, and none of his real estate was sold in his widow\u2019s lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAP\">If the court should be of opinion that the legal title to the undivided tenth part of said land, which was given by the third clause of the testator\u2019s will, at the decease of his widow, to the tenant, was or became vested in the trustees under said will, judgment was to be entered for the demandants; otherwise, for the tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-9\">The second case was a writ of entry to recover one undivided tenth part of the same estate. It was submitted to the full court, on agreed facts, which differed from those in the first case only in this, that the tenant derived his title by a deed dated January 16, 1884, executed by the testator\u2019s son Augustus D. Iasigi.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-10\"><em>L. S.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOG\">The true construction of this will is certainly very obscure, and we cannot be certain that we arrive at the actual intention of the testator, in respect to the questions which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>have been submitted to us. But the conclusion to which we have come is, that the trust estate under the will did not include the houses and real estate owned by the testator, and that these actions cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In the first place, it is conceded that the third article of the will contains language which, taken alone, sustains the claim of the tenants. In that article, the testator gave, devised, and bequeathed to his wife the use of said houses and real estate, during her life; \u201c and, at her decease, I give and devise said real estate to my children who shall then be living, and to the issue, if any, of any deceased child or children, <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per </em>capita, equally, share and share alike.\u201d Authority was given to his executors and trustees to sell the same, if his wife should desire it; and the proceeds of such sales were to be paid to the trustees, to be by them safely invested and managed, and the income and principal thereof were to be applied and disposed of in accordance with the provisions regulating the management and distribution of the trust fund established by the next succeeding article of the will; that is to say, the net income was to be paid to his wife during her life, and at her decease the trust fund was to be paid over and distributed to and among his children who should then be living, and the issue, if any, of any deceased child or children, \u201c holding, nevertheless, in trust, such distributive shares of my estate as are herein directed to be so held.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Then comes the fifth article, which furnishes the main ground of the demandants\u2019 contention in the action against the testator\u2019s daughter. This article does not of itself contain any bequest of property, but it is designed to regulate the management and distribution of the bequests therein referred to. All the gifts which are made to the testator\u2019s daughters are contained in the third article, already referred to, the fourth article, under which they are entitled to share in the trust fund of #200,000 after the death of their mother, and the ninth article, under which they are entitled to share in the residue; and it appears by the latter portion of the ninth article that the testator contemplated that the final distribution of this residue should be made in money, and ample authority was given in the eleventh article to convert it into money. The gifts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the fourth and ninth articles would naturally be referred to as moneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The gift in the third article, looking only at the language contained in that single article, might be real estate, or moneys, according as a sale might or might not have been made in pursuance of the authority therein conferred. No case has been found by the research of counsel in which the word \u201c moneys \u201d has been held sufficient to include real estate; but it is contended that the provision in the fifth article, that \u201c the net income of each daughter\u2019s share of my estate under this will shall be paid to her during her life, .... and upon her decease my said trustees shall pay over the principal sum of her said several share .... to her issue,\u201d &amp;c., shows an intention to include their interest in the two houses under the trust, even though the same should not be sold during the mother\u2019s life, and that it has the effect to cut down or limit the title which they otherwise take under the third article in the will. The main consideration in support of the opposite view of the fifth article is, that it was not intended to define the gift, but only to regulate the management and distribution thereof; and that the word \u201cestate\u201d means, by reference, the same thing as \u201c moneys,\u201d before mentioned at the beginning of that article; and, looking at it in this aspect, that the words mean that the net income of each daughter\u2019s share of his estate, so far as the same should be held in trust under this will, shall be paid to her, without in any manner defining what that share shall be taken to include. The latter view derives some confirmation from the fact that all the other significant words of the article are specially appropriate for personal estate; for example, \u201cpay over,\u201d \u201cdistribute,\u201d \u201cprincipal sum,\u201d and \u201cinterest.\u201d Moreover, since the third article contains, when taken by itself alone, a clear gift of real estate, the addition of equivocal expressions of, or contrary tendency in, a later portion of the will, ought not to prevent the gift from taking effect absolutely, unless, on the whole, an intention so to limit it can be fairly inferred. The fact that in the sixth and seventh articles, directing moneys given to certain of the testator\u2019s sons to be held in trust, the words are wanting which are specially relied on in the fifth article to show that real estate was intended to be included in the trust, has some tendency to show that no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>effect was designed to be given to them; unless indeed it should be thought that the testator meant to make a distinction in this respect between his daughters and these sons. In all of these cases, it seems probable that, if the testator had intended to put the real estate in trust, he would have said so in some plainer terms than are to be found in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Full effect can be given to the provision of the eleventh article, authorizing the trustees to sell \u201c any or all of my said trust property and estate, both real and personal,\u201d by referring it to the ninth article, in which the testator gives in trust all the rest and residue of his property and estate, of every description, real, personal, and mixed, of which he shall die seised or possessed; clearly contemplating that, under the ninth article, the trust property may include real estate of which he may thereafter become the owner. Certainly the eleventh article was not intended to authorize the trustees to sell the two houses in the lifetime of the testator\u2019s widow, without her consent; and no very distinct meaning can be given to the clause, \u201c preserving to my wife all the rights given to her by the third article of this will,\u201d as no construction by which the trustees could interfere with those rights would be open to even a plausible argument in its favor. No clear inference can be derived from this clause, that the interests of the daughters in the two houses were regarded as trust estate during the lifetime of the testator\u2019s widow, and that such interests might be sold by the trustees, subject to the widow\u2019s right for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The circumstance that, if the houses should be sold, the proceeds were to \"be held in trust, and that, upon the tenants\u2019 construction, if not sold, the daughters will hold their shares absolutely, though entitled to consideration, is by no means decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">On the whole, recognizing that the true construction of the will is open to much doubt and* uncertainty, we think it better to adhere to the plain language of the third article, and to hold that the gift therein contained is not cut down or controlled by the equivocal expressions in other parts of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\n<em>Judgments for the tenants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
