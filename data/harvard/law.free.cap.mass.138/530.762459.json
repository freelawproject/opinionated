The instrument then conveyed from the plaintiff to the defendant one undivided half part of all the moneys, goods, chattels, and property, of every kind and nature whatsoever, to which she was entitled, or in which she had any interest coming to her, from the said Hale\u2019s estate. It also contained this clause : \u201c It is expressly understood, however, that I, the said Mamie Jane Belding, am to be kept and saved harmless by the said George A. Smythe for all costs and charges heretofore or hereafter in any way or manner, unless the said Smythe is successful in establishing my said claim and securing said estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-5\">The second instrument, executed on the same day, was a power of attorney from the plaintiff to the defendant, authorizing him to petition the Probate Court within and for the county of Suffolk, and do all things necessary in obtaining a decree in behalf of the plaintiff as next of kin of William Hale. It also contained this clause : \u201c And Thereby agree to and with my said attorney, that, after deducting all cash expenses in searching for me and procuring said decree, and collecting the same, he shall be entitled to retain fifty per cent of the balance of whatever sum shall be recovered from said William Hale\u2019s estate for his services heretofore rendered and to be rendered herein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-6\">At the hearing, before <em>W. </em>Allen, J., the plaintiff contended that the two instruments constituted an agreement which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>unlawful and void for champerty and maintenance; and that, for that reason, she was entitled to the relief sought. The judge reserved this question for the consideration of the full court; the bill to be dismissed, unless a decree should be entered for the plaintiff for that cause.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-4\"><em>W. G. </em>Bassett, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-5\"><em>H. </em>E. Fales, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b550-6\">Field, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa2\">The two agreements, taken together, purport to assign to the defendant one half of the interest of the plaintiff in the estate of William Hale, and to authorize the defendant to prosecute the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the estate and receive the sum <em>recovered; </em>with the provision that the plaintiff shall be saved harmless from all costs and charges if the defendant is unsuccessful in establishing the claim, and, if he is successful, that the amount of the cash expenses shall first be deducted from the sum recovered, and shall be retained by the defendant, and the remainder be divided equally between the parties. There is no express agreement on the part of the defendant that he will prosecute the claim, but this is clearly implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">We cannot distinguish this agreement from an agreement that the defendant will prosecute the claim at his own expense and risk, unless he is successful; and, if successful, that his cash expenses shall be paid out of the sum recovered, and the remainder be equally divided. The conveyance of the one undivided half part was executed for the purpose of inducing the defendant to prosecute the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and was a method of securing to the defendant the share of the property recovered which it was agreed he should have if successful. If this interest had been previously acquired for other purposes, a subsequent agreement for the prosecution of the claim upon the terms stated would not be champertous, because the defendant would have had a legitimate interest in the litigation. But the two instruments constitute plainly but one transaction, and show that the defendant procured evidence in support of contemplated litigation in which he had no interest, and then prosecuted it only for the share of the proceeds he might get out of it under an agreement made for that purpose with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">We think the agreements are champertous. Pub. Sts. <em>c. 160, </em>\u00a7 6. <em>Ackert </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>131 Mass. 436. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Fowle, </em>132 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Mass. 385. <em>Reynell </em>v. Sprye, 1 DeG., M. &amp; G. 660. <em>Stanley </em>v. Jones, 7 Bing. 369. <em>Sprye </em>v. Porter, 7 E. &amp; B. 57. <em>Hutley </em>v. <em>Hutley, </em>L. R. 8 Q. B. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The defendant in his brief contends that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief in equity, because, if the agreements are champertous, the parties are <em>in pari delicto. </em>No such contention appears in the defendant\u2019s answer. The defendant is an attorney at law, and, in dealing in this manner with one whom he makes his client, the parties are not regarded as <em>in pari delicto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\n<em>Decree for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
