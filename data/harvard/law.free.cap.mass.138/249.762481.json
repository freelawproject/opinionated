There was no evidence tending to show, and it was not contended, that the service performed for Shaw was any less desirable than the service he had agreed to perform for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-5\">There was also evidence tending to show that the plaintiff paid the railroad fare of his son from Belchertown to Amherst when he left the defendant\u2019s employ, and from Amherst back to Belchertown when he returned to work for Shaw; that the son was at his father\u2019s house from Monday until the following Friday; that the plaintiff spent seven days\u2019 time in looking for another place for his son as an apprentice under Oliver Smith\u2019s will, and in executing papers relating thereto, with Shaw, for which the plaintiff claimed damages at the rate of $4 per day. There was no other evidence of any special damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-6\">The defendant contended, and asked the judge to rule, that the defendant had not by the agreement sued on agreed to employ the son for any length of time; and that, inasmuch as by the terms of the agreement all compensation under it was to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>paid to the son, and as, under the agreement between the plaintiff and his son, the son was to have his own wages, the plaintiff could not recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">The judge found as a fact, that the defendant, on January 3, 1882, discharged the son without justifiable cause, and ruled, as matter of law, that after this breach the plaintiff had a right to recover such actual damages as he could prove to have been caused by the breach; that, if the plaintiff\u2019s son was able to receive and did receive wages from another employer for a part of the time after this illegal discharge by the defendant, that must be taken into consideration in diminution of damages; that there was no rule of law which could be laid down to the jury (in a trial by jury) requiring them to find no damages in every case where the plaintiff has actually received as much pay as he would have received if the contract had not been broken by the defendant, but if in fact the plaintiff had been put to trouble, delay, and expense in procuring new employment, the jury might find damages, if on the whole the plaintiff proved he had been injured by the breach of contract by the defendant; and the judge found as a fact, satisfactorily proved upon the whole evidence, that the plaintiff had suffered a pecuniary loss by reason of said breach.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">The defendant also asked the judge to rule that, inasmuch as the son had been paid by the defendant and Shaw a larger sum than that called for by the agreement declared on, namely, the sum of $13 per month for the first year, and $14 per month for the remainder of the term, there was no damage recoverable under said agreement in this action ; that the rule of damage applicable to the case, if the plaintiff could recover, was that the plaintiff had a right to recover the stipulated wages for the full time, less the amount paid to the son under said agreement, and less the further amount which the son did earn, or might during the period have reasonably earned; that the plaintiff could not recover in this action, as damages, anything for time and expenses on the part of the plaintiff in endeavoring to procure employment for his son as an apprentice under Oliver Smith\u2019s will, because the son had failed to perform his part of said agreement, by reason of his indulging in the use of ardent spirits and profane language while in the employ of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Upon the last point, the defendant was allowed, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection, to introduce the contract made on the same day as that declared on, and evidence tending to show that the son had in two instances, during the period of his service with the defendant, drunk ardent spirits to some excess, but both these occasions were while absent in a neighboring town, and when not at work; and had once used profane and vulgar language to a servant girl while engaged in an altercation with her, out of the presence or hearing of the defendant or his wife, both being some time before the time of his discharge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-4\">The judge ruled that, even assuming that this agreement applied to this case, there was no evidence of such an indulgence in the use of ardent spirits or profane language as would take away the right of the plaintiff to recover upon the contract declared on; declined to rule as <em>requested; </em>and assessed damages for the plaintiff in the sum of $25.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-6\"><em>D.

It is presumed that the same will is referred to which was before the court in the case of <em>Smith Charities </em>v. <em>Northampton, </em>10 Allen, 498.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b272-8\">Field, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC_\">By the contract declared on, as we construe it, the defendant covenanted with the plaintiff to pay the monthly wages therein expressed for the services of the plaintiff\u2019s minor son until he reached the age of twenty-one years. The stipulation, \u201c that all compensation shall be paid to the said Louis H. Dickinson,\u201d does not prevent the plaintiff from maintaining the action, as the defendant\u2019s covenant that he will make the payment in this manner is with the plaintiff. <em>Caden </em>v. <em>Farwell, </em>98 Mass. 137. It is not clear that the indenture of apprenticeship put in evidence by the defendant has any relevancy to the case. It does not appear why the parties made the two different contracts, or why the plaintiff in the contract declared on bound himself in the sum of $300 to hold the defendant harmless from all obligations entered into by him in the indenture of apprenticeship. It may be that the latter was executed as a device to enable the minor to obtain the benefits provided by the will of Oliver Smith, while the former was intended to express the real understanding of the parties, but this we do not know. Whatever may have been the reason for executing the two instruments, the provisions of the indenture of apprenticeship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>cannot be imported into the contract declared on so as to affect the liability of the defendant upon his covenants in the contract. It is immaterial, therefore, whether the facts found by the court as to the minor\u2019s use of profane language and of ardent spirits, did or did not constitute a violation of the covenants of the plaintiff contained in the indenture of apprenticeship. The plaintiff had a right to make the contract declared on for the services of his son during his minority. Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>149, \u00a7 22. Gen. Sts. <em>g. </em>111, \u00a7 23. <em>Day </em>v. Everett, 7 Mass. 144. <em>Caden </em>v. Farwell, <em>ubi supra. </em>The alleged emancipation of the son is not a defence to this action, for this reason, among others, that the contract was executed by the son as well as by the father.</p>\n<p id=\"AJM\">The remaining questions relate to the measure of damages. The court allowed in diminution of damages the wages earned by the son during his minority after he was discharged by the defendant; but apparently assessed damages upon the theory that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for his trouble and expenses in obtaining the new employment for his son. As the defendant has had the benefit of the new employment, he ought to bear the expenses incurred which were reasonably necessary to obtain it. The argument is, that the trouble and expenses were the father\u2019s, and that the son received a larger sum in wages than if he had remained with the defendant. There is evidence enough recited in the exceptions to warrant the finding that the services were rendered and money paid by the father at the son\u2019s request; but if this were not so, we are of opinion that, when a minor son, who has been given his time and his earnings by his father, returns to his father without employment, it is competent for the father to revoke the gift so far as it relates to future employment; and, even if this gift is not revoked, that it is the right of the father to obtain future employment for his son, if the son is willing to accept it. The gift of time and earnings by a father to his infant child does not establish a new status, but is in the nature of a license. The reasonable expenses incurred by the father in obtaining the new employment were therefore damages occasioned by the breach of the contract by the defendant. There is no exception to the amount of damages found by the court, if the rulings were correct. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
