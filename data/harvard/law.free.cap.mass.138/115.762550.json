At the trial in the Superior Court, it appeared that the defendant made a writ against the plaintiff, a deputy of the sheriff of Essex, in favor of a resident of another State; that on the original writ, under the words \u201c From the office of,\u201d the name of the defendant was indorsed; that no motion was made for an indorser in the original action; that the defendant caused the action to be entered in court; that judgment therein was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>rendered for the present plaintiff; and that an execution for costs issued, which was returned unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-4\">On these facts, judgment was ordered for the plaintiff; and the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AQq\"><em>C. </em>Lamson, <em>pro se,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apz\">relied upon the last clause of Rule 2 of the Superior Court, which provides that \u201cNo attorney shall give bail or recognize as principal or surety in any criminal matter in which he is employed as counsel or attorney, nor shall he become bail or surety in any civil suit or proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-6\"><em>D.
