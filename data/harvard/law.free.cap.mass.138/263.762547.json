A subsequent section of the act provided that a person injured in property under the act might have the same assessed by an application in writing within one year after the taking of such land or water right, but not thereafter; and that no assessment for damage should be made for the taking of any water right until the water was actually withdrawn or diverted by the town under the authority of the act. <em>Held, </em>that an application for injury to a water right, filed more than a year after the right had been taken, but within a year after the description was filed in the registry of deeds, was filed too late.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b281-7\">A town authorized by a special statute to take water and water rights, and required to file a description thereof, filed a paper containing a recital that \u201c whereas \u201d the town has erected a dam across a certain brook, and has taken and appropriated the water from said brook and water rights connected therewith above said dam, followed by the sentence, \u201c The water so taken as aforesaid is for the purpose of supplying the town with pure water.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the description was sufficient, and that it applied to water rights below the dam as well as to those above.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b281-8\">A town authorized by a special statute to take water and water rights, and required to file a description thereof within ninety days, built a dam across a stream in 1882, and filed a paper about six months afterwards reciting the taking, and that the town \u201c within ninety days after said taking hereby files <em>\u201d </em>a description thereof. By the terms of the statute, a person injured by a taking under the statute was required to file an application for damages within a year after the taking. A petition was filed on the last day of the year after the filing of the description. <em>Held, </em>that, if the town was estopped by the declarations in the description, it could still refer the taking to the earliest point of time consistent with the instrument; and that the petition was filed too late.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b281-9\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgT\">This is a petition for a writ of certiorari to quash a judgment in .favor of one Ranlett for water rights taken under the St. of 1882, c. 192.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Ranlett\u2019s petition was filed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>June 16, 1884. The water was actually withdrawn on December 12, 1882, by closing the gates of a reservoir which had been built under the act just mentioned; so that Ranlett\u2019s petition was not filed' \u201c within one year after the taking of such water right,\u201d as required by the act, (\u00a7 3,) if the actual withdrawal of the water is the taking referred to. We have no doubt that it is, and we think that no argument can make the meaning of the act much clearer than its own language does.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The respondents\u2019 contention, that the taking is the filing of the description of the rights taken in the registry of deeds, tacitly assumes that the word \u201c taking \u201d in the passage just quoted from \u00a7 3 has a different meaning from the same word in \u00a7 2; an assumption which is not justified. We cannot do better than repeat the words of Mr. Justice Bigelow in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>8 Cush. 274, 276: \u201cIt is the taking of the land [here, of the water rights] which gives the party injured a right to damages. By [\u00a7 2] the taking of the [water right] and the filing of a description of it in the registry of deeds are two separate and distinct acts. The former must precede the latter. The taking is first to be made, and within [ninety] days after it, the description is to be filed. It is difficult to see how, under this explicit provision, the filing of the description of the [water right] taken can be made the taking itself. The act of taking is to be first accomplished, and after it is done, the evidence of it, in the form of a description, is to be filed in the registry of deeds. Such seems to be the natural import of the language of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>It may be admitted that, if there had been no actual taking, the filing of the description in the registry might conclude the town, and, at least in regard to lands, might fix the date from which the year would begin to run. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>8 Cush. 277. <em>Ham </em>v. Salem, 100 Mass. 350, 351. Indeed, the dicta or intimations in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>130 Mass. 339, and <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Jamaica Pond Aqueduct, </em>114 Mass. 575, 577, led the counsel for the petitioner partially to concede that the filing would fix the beginning of the year in any case for land. However this may be, we can feel no doubt as to the meaning of the act with regard to water rights, and our construction is confirmed by the further provision in \u00a7 3, that \u201c no assessment for damage shall be made for the taking of any water right .... until the water is actually withdrawn.\u201d See <em>Ipswich Mills </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>108 Mass. 363, on the St. of 1864, <em>c. </em>268, \u00a7 11; <em>Tileston </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>134 Mass. 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">From the view which we have taken it becomes unimportant whether the description filed on March 8, 1883, was sufficient or not.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> For, although the filing may have been a condition subsequent, which the petitioner would have had to show had been complied with if it had been sued in tort and had justified under the statute, as in <em>Wamesit Power Co. </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>120 Mass. 352, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>and in <em>Lund </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>121 Mass. 286, in this case Ranlett treated the taking as lawful, proceeded under the statute, and was therefore bound to proceed within the statutory time. We may add, that the cases last cited are further authorities to show that the taking and the filing are distinct matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">But furthermore we are of opinion that the objections made to the description are unsound. It is true that it begins with a \u201c whereas,\u201d and that, according to the punctuation, there is no conclusion. But, if this be material, it may be remedied by neglecting the periods, and reading the description as the introduction to the statement of the purpose for which the water is taken. The words, \u201c has taken and appropriated the water above said dam,\u201d cover the water rights below the dam which are interfered with. The only interference with them is the withdrawal of the water described.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">A second description was filed on June 16, 1888,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and it is this that the respondents rely upon to make out that Ranlett\u2019s petition was filed in time. But the argument based upon it fails, when it is determined that filing the description is not the taking. To be sure, it might be said that the instrument estopped the town to set up anything inconsistent with its contents. And if the second description had set forth a taking of its date, we might have had to consider whether the powers given by the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>had been exhausted, and, if not, whether it did not sufficiently appear that the purport of the later instrument was only to correct apprehended defects of form in the earlier one. But the most that can possibly be gathered from the second instrument is that the taking was within ninety days before, while it- also shows that the dam and reservoir by which the water was actually withdrawn were already built by authority of the town at the date of their meeting, March 27, 1883. If therefore the petitioner is estopped by its declarations, which we do not intimate, it can still refer the taking to the earliest point of time consistent with the instrument. The withdrawal of the water has been continuous since December 12, 1882, so that there is no difficulty such as might have been raised by a cessation in the use after the first taking. As Ranlett\u2019s petition was filed the last day of the year following the filing of the second description, it whs too late, unless the taking was on the same day that the description was filed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b285-5\"><em>G.
