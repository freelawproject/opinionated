Said foreclosure proceedings were regular in form, and in accordance with the power contained in the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-8\">The defendant contended, and offered evidence tending to prove, that the plaintiff had violated his covenants contained in the agreement dated July 9, and, for the purpose of proving such breach, asked a witness the following question: \u201c Was there as .much hay and fodder raised on the mortgaged farm in 1880 or 1881 as the farm was capable of producing in the usual course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>of husbandry, or as was usual on like farms in that neighborhood?\u201d The judge excluded this question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-4\">The plaintiff testified that he was engaged in the business of selling milk, and produced on said farm a portion of the milk so sold, and purchased the remainder of the farmers in that vicinity, producing about ten cans daily, and purchasing about sixteen, his sales averaging about twenty-six cans per day. To show the damage he sustained by the foreclosure he was then asked the following question: \u201c What was the farm worth from June 1,1882, to July, 1883, with your stock of cows, to you?\u201d The defendant objected to this question; but the judge allowed the plaintiff to answer it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">The defendant asked the judge to instruct the jury as follows : \u201c Under the agreement declared on, the defendant was not precluded from assigning said mortgage, and is not responsible for any act of the assignee to which he was not a party in the matter of the foreclosure or the consequences thereof, and, unless the jury find that said assignment of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage was made for the purpose of foreclosure, and that the defendant in making the assignment knew of such purpose or participated therein, he is not liable.\u201d This instruction the judge refused to give; but instructed the jury as follows: \u201c The contract between the defendant and the plaintiff did not forbid the defendant\u2019s assignment of the mortgage, on terms which did not give the assignee any right to foreclose the mortgage and dispossess the plaintiff of the farm to which the mortgage applied ; but if the defendant made an assignment which disabled him from adhering to that contract, and thereupon the assignee of the mortgage proceeded to foreclose the mortgage and to dispossess the plaintiff of the farm to which the mortgage applied, the defendant would be responsible for that foreclosure and dispossession of the plaintiff as for a violation of that contract, whether the assignment was made for the purpose of such foreclosure and dispossession, and the assignee\u2019s conduct therein was instigated and procured by the defendant for such purpose, or whether the assignee acted therein on his own motion and in his own interest only, under an assignment of the mortgage made to him by the defendant in good faith,-\u00bfand for a valuable consideration.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $384.15, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-4\"><em>J.

The defendant\u2019s covenant with the plaintiff, not to demand payment of the principal of his mortgage note, nor to begin any proceedings for foreclosure of the mortgage, and not to eject the defendant from the mortgaged land for three years, fairly construed, meant more than a covenant against these acts on the part of the defendant personally. It could not be rendered nugatory by an assignment, but was broken when the defendant\u2019s assignee sold under the power in the mortgage. This construction is confirmed by the plaintiff\u2019s covenant to expend the hay and fodder produced upon the land for the use of the land for three years. The ruling on this point was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">2. The plaintiff\u2019s covenant just mentioned did not require him to raise any particular amount of hay and fodder, but only to use what was raised in a certain way, so as not to exhaust the farm. The question whether as much was raised as the farm was capable of producing in the usual course of husbandry, or as was usual on like farms in the neighborhood, was rightly excluded for this reason, as well as because the defendant\u2019s covenant was independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">8. The plaintiff was allowed to testify what the farm was worth to him from June 1, 1882, to July, 1883, with his stock of cows; and the defendant excepted. Generally speaking, such a question is objectionable. But, in view of the argument, and all the circumstances, we assume that it was understood to mean simply, What was the money value of the farm to one engaged in your special business, and in your general position with regard to it? And so understood, we cannot say, on the bill of exceptions, that it was improper. It does not appear what rule of damages was laid down to the jury; but, assuming that they were allowed to adopt the standard suggested by the question and answer, still we cannot say from anything that appeal\u2019s in the bill of exceptions that the defendant\u2019s contract was not madte in express contemplation of the plaintiff\u2019s use of the farm as a milk farm. If there was no such evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>it was for the defendant to disclose the fact in his bill of exceptions. It would rather seem that the plaintiff was using the farm in that way at the time the contract was made; that the defendant knew that fact; and that the contract was made for the very purpose of preventing the breaking up of the plaintiff\u2019s business, according to the understanding of both parties. In that case, at least, the evidence was admissible. <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Nickerson Wharf Co. </em>117 Mass. 501, 503. See <em>Hydraulic Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>McHaffie, </em>4 Q. B. D. 670; <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Greenleaf </em>11 Gray, 98, 102. In <em>Goddard </em>v. Barnard, 16 Gray, 205, where special damage was disallowed for breach of a contract that a roof should be tight for five years, and in default to make the same satisfactory, the decision was put on the ground that the language of the contract itself showed that the only liability contemplated for leaking was the cost of a satisfactory roof, and that the circumstances, including the fact that it was known to be an experiment, confirmed the literal import of the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
