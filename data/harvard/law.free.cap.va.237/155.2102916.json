Because the issue was decided below upon defendants\u2019 pleas of the statute of limitations, the facts will be stated here as alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">J.F. Toner &amp; Son, Inc., a domesticated Delaware corporation operating a dairy farm in Virginia (the borrower), obtained a loan in 1979 from Federal Land Bank Association of Staunton and Staunton Production Credit Association (the lenders), secured by a security agreement covering a part of the borrower\u2019s assets. On March 20, 1981, the lenders, acting through their agents, Richard E. Reeves and C. McCheyne Swortzel, promised to advance additional funds to the borrower in exchange for a further security agreement covering all the borrower\u2019s remaining assets. The borrower gave the additional security requested but the lenders thereafter refused to advance the additional funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">The plaintiffs further allege that on May 17, 1982, Swortzel, acting for the lenders, agreed to lend an additional $200,000 to the borrower if Mary Toner, a major stockholder in the borrower, would pledge certain personal assets to secure the loan. In reliance on that promise, Mrs. Toner pledged securities worth in excess of $400,000 to the lenders, but the lenders thereafter refused to make the additional $200,000 loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">On May 24, 1984, Mary Toner and the borrower brought this action against Reeves, Swortzel, and the lenders. The plaintiffs\u2019 second amended motion for judgment contains nine counts asserting various claims. Only two are pertinent to this appeal: Count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Two, in which the borrower alleges that it suffered damages caused by fraud and misrepresentations on the part of Reeves, Swortzel, and the lenders, and Count Six, in which Mrs. Toner alleges that she suffered damages caused by fraud and misrepresentations on the part of Swortzel and the lenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\">The defendants filed pleas of the statute of limitations to Counts Two and Six, contending that the one-year limitation of Code \u00a7 8.01-248 applied. The plaintiffs contended that the fraud claims were governed by the five-year limitation provided by Code \u00a7 8.01-243(B) and, therefore, that the action was timely. The court, by letter opinion, agreed with the defendants and entered an order in November 1986 sustaining the pleas and dismissing Counts Two and Six. This order had the effect of dismissing Reeves and Swortzel from the action and, therefore, was final and appealable, although the action remains pending in the trial court with respect to other counts. We granted the plaintiffs an appeal limited to the statute-of-limitations question.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">At the times pertinent to this appeal, Code \u00a7 8.01-243 provided a two-year limitation for personal injury claims and a five-year limitation for injury-to-property claims. Code \u00a7 8.01-248 provided a one-year limitation for \u201c[ejvery personal action, for which no limitation is otherwise prescribed.\u201d In <em>Pigott </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>231 Va. 76, 341 S.E.2d 179 (1986), we considered whether an action based on fraud was governed by the one-year or by the five-year statute. In <em>Pigott, </em>purchasers of land alleged that they had been defrauded by an agent\u2019s misrepresentations concerning the zoning of abutting property. The purchasers alleged that they had sought property in a residential neighborhood and had made the purchase on the agent\u2019s assurance that the neighborhood was of that character, while in fact the abutting property was zoned for industrial use and this fact caused them to sustain financial loss resulting from diminution of the property\u2019s value. We held that the purchasers\u2019 claim was based upon personal financial damage, not injury to property. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">The fraud allegedly committed by the realtor had no impact upon the real property itself. The purchasers\u2019 land was in the same condition and was available for the same use after the alleged fraud as it was before. The defendants\u2019 conduct was directed at the plaintiffs personally and not their property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>real or personal. Consequently, the trial court correctly decided the one-year limitation governs an action for fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><em>Id. </em>at 81, 341 S.E.2d at 182. In <em>House </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>233 Va. 197, 201, 355 S.E.2d 303, 306 (1987), we reaffirmed our holding that the one-year limitation period governs actions for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Although the trial court in the present case based its ruling upon <em>Pigott, </em>the plaintiffs contend that <em>Pigott </em>is inapposite. This is so, they argue, because in the present case the defendants\u2019 alleged fraud directly affected their property. The plaintiffs allege that they were fraudulently induced to convey to the lenders a security interest in both corporate and individual assets, which they subsequently lost entirely through foreclosure and repossession. The plaintiffs point out that the allegedly defrauded purchasers in <em>Pigott </em>retained their property, with all the rights of use they would have had in the absence of the agent\u2019s misrepresentations, but that they, the present plaintiffs, have suffered a loss of all use, enjoyment and value in their property by reason of the alleged fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">We think this purported distinction to be more apparent than real. The defendants\u2019 alleged fraud had no effect upon the plaintiffs\u2019 property. The property had the same form, the same value, and was adapted to the same uses after the defendants\u2019 actions as before. The defendants are simply alleged to have persuaded the plaintiffs to part with it. Thus, the allegedly wrongful acts were aimed at the persons of the plaintiffs. Rather than injuring their property, the alleged wrongs caused them to sustain \u201cfinancial damage personal to the individual,\u201d as did the misrepresentations alleged in <em>Pigott.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Because fraud invariably acts upon the person of the victim rather than upon property, its consequence is personal damage rather than injury to property.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We therefore reaffirm our holdings in <em>Pigott </em>and <em>House.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s choice of the applicable limitation period, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\"><em> </em>The General Assembly has clearly taken the same view. In 1987, subsequent to our decision in <em>Pigott, </em>the General Assembly removed actions for fraud from the catchall provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-248 by including such actions under the two-year limitation of Code \u00a7 8.01-243(A), along with \u201cevery action for personal injuries, whatever the theory of recovery.\u201d Acts 1987, c. 679.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
