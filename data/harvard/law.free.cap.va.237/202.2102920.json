In <em>Carbaugh </em>v. <em>Solem, 225 </em>Va. 310, 302 S.E.2d 33 (1983) <em>(Solem I), </em>we decided that the regulation prevented Solem from \u201crenting\u201d one of her goats for $3 a day in return for the \u201cby-products\u201d of that goat. The background of Solem\u2019s activities with her goats is described in <em>Solem I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">After our adverse decision in <em>Solem </em>I, in an avowed effort to avoid the restrictions of Regulation X, Solem modified her business operation by selling, rather than renting, undivided interests in her goats. For $50, an individual who wished to receive unpasteurized goats\u2019 milk could purchase a 24 percent interest in a goat, which, upon payment of a $3 daily \u201cmaintenance\u201d fee, entitled the purchaser to a gallon of milk each day.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Solem then filed this declaratory judgment proceeding against James B. Kenley, State Health Commissioner, and S. Mason Carbaugh, Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services, to determine whether her new plan violated Regulation X. The trial court held that Solem\u2019s new arrangement did not violate Regulation X; because Solem sold undivided interests in the goats and charged a maintenance fee for the transfer of milk to the goat owners, the transfer of milk was a mere delivery of the milk and did not constitute its sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The interests are sold, the goats maintained, and the milk delivered under the following plan. No more than two such interests are sold in each goat so that Solem retains a 52 percent interest in every one of her goats, as well as their possession. The milk is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>distributed to the users from a common container on Solem\u2019s property into which all of the goats\u2019 milk has been collected. Solem charges each owner a maintenance fee based on the amount of milk that owner receives. No owner receives more than 24 percent of the production of the goat in which he owns an interest and, if the owner does not take all of the 24 percent production, Solem gets the excess as a part of her maintenance fee. The payment of the maintenance fee assumes that the owner will get a gallon of milk a day and, if the goat is not producing enough milk so that 24 percent of her daily production will be at least one gallon, Solem supplies the deficiency from \u201cher share of the goat\u2019s milk.\u201d If a goat is producing no milk, its owner pays no maintenance fee but, if Solem has milk available from other goats, she will usually supply the milk of another goat and collect the maintenance fee. If an owner\u2019s goat does not produce milk over a sustained period and has to be \u201cput down,\u201d Solem replaces it with another goat. The record does not disclose whether the owner pays another $50 charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Here, as in <em>Solem </em>/, Solem erroneously focuses upon an alleged sale of an interest in the goat and not on the sale of milk which is the act proscribed by the regulation. Although Solem may have formally transferred an undivided interest in her goats to a user of their milk, the essential, and admitted, purpose of the transaction is to distribute unpasteurized goats\u2019 milk in avoidance of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The owner of the 24 percent interest in a goat does not receive only his goat\u2019s milk \u2014 it goes into a common container, and he gets milk from all of the goats producing milk on that day. In some instances he may not receive any of his goat\u2019s milk. The maintenance fee of $3 per day, geared to the amount of milk each owner receives, is nothing more than a sham for payment for the gallon of milk received by the owner from Solem on that day. We will look to the substance of this transaction and not to its formal trappings. <em>Valley Acceptance Corp. </em>v. <em>Glasby, </em>230 Va. 422, 429, 337 S.E.2d 291, 295 (1985). Given the manner in which Solem handles the milk and deals with her consumers, we hold that her distribution of the milk is essentially a sale of milk in violation of Regulation X.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
