Mae Holland Murphy (Murphy), Holland\u2019s sister, was named defendant, and she filed an answer in which she claimed ownership of the land. Murphy also filed a plea of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">After an ore tenus hearing, the trial court overruled Murphy\u2019s plea of laches and held that Paris was Holland\u2019s legitimate son, entitled to inherit his father\u2019s entire estate. We granted Murphy an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">Then single and living with his parents, Holland purchased the 77.25-acre tract, consisting of unimproved farm land, in 1955. On August 29, 1961, Paris was born of a union between Holland and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Geneva Craddock (Geneva). Holland signed Paris\u2019s birth certificate as \u201cFather\u201d and thereafter treated the child as his own. Another child, Kennon, was born of the union between Holland and Geneva.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Holland and Geneva never went through a marriage ceremony. They were living together as husband and wife, however, at the time of Paris\u2019s birth and continued to hold themselves out as a married couple until Holland\u2019s death on September 28, 1968, when Paris was seven years old. Geneva was known by and used her husband\u2019s surname, and the two were considered a married couple by family members and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Following Holland\u2019s death intestate, his mother, Effie Holland, qualified as his administratrix and listed herself and Holland\u2019s father as Holland\u2019s only heirs. Holland\u2019s parents claimed the land by intestate succession from Holland. After the father\u2019s death in 1969 and the mother\u2019s in 1977, Holland\u2019s sister, the appellant, claimed the property by descent from her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Meanwhile, on January 16, 1969, when Paris was seven years five months old, Geneva, as mother and next friend, filed a bill in chancery on behalf of Paris and his younger brother, Kennon, against Effie Holland, individually and as administratrix of Holland\u2019s estate. Holland\u2019s father was also named a party defendant. The bill prayed that the two brothers be declared Holland\u2019s \u201clegitimate heirs.\u201d The matter reached the point where demurrers had been overruled and an answer filed, but the suit was dismissed on December 20, 1972, because \u201cno action [had] been taken . . . since April 14, 1969.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">By deed dated May 10, 1983, Kennon Holland quitclaimed to Paris all his right, title, and interest in and to the 77.25-acre tract. Then, on August 29, 1983, Paris filed a memorandum of lis pendens, purportedly giving notice of a \u201cpending\u201d suit affecting Murphy\u2019s interest in the 77.25-acre tract. No suit was pending, however, at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The present suit was filed December 21, 1984. Paris testified below he did not discover until mid-1983, when he was twenty-one years old, that his father had owned the 77.25-acre tract and that his mother and father had never been formally married.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">We first consider whether the trial court erred in overruling Murphy\u2019s plea of laches. Concerning such a plea, we said in <em>Morris </em>v. Mosby, 227 Va. 517, 317 S.E.2d 493 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>When a trial court considers the defense of laches, it does not apply an absolute rule such as a statute of limitations, but instead, the court examines each case in light of the particular circumstances. Therefore, whether under the circumstances of a given case a claim is barred by laches is primarily a decision resting within the discretion of the trial court. Absent an abuse of discretion, its decision will not be disturbed on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 521, 317 S.E.2d at 496 (citations omitted). And in <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Newbold, </em>154 Va. 345, 153 S.E. 681 (1930), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">[ L] aches or delay, in order to be effectual as a bar to the party [against whose claim the defense of laches is asserted], must be accompanied with circumstances and facts showing an intention on his part to abandon the [claim]. [The delay] must be unreasonable and injurious to the other party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 351, 153 S.E. at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">It is difficult to discern from Murphy\u2019s brief what event she thinks started the time running on Paris\u2019s claim. At one point, Murphy seems to contend that the time began to run from the date in 1969 when Paris\u2019s mother filed suit on his behalf to have him legitimized. Murphy says that the fifteen years between 1969 and 1984, when the present suit was brought, is a \u201clong . . . time to put off filing a claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">At another point, Murphy appears to take the position that the time began to run when Paris reached his eighteenth birthday in 1979 and that he should have filed suit immediately thereafter. Murphy says that because Geneva, as Paris\u2019s next friend in the 1969 suit, knew of Murphy\u2019s claim to the 77.25-acre tract, Paris \u201ccertainly was responsible for obtaining this information by the time he became 18 years of age.\u201d Under these circumstances, Murphy maintains, the five-and-one-half-year delay in filing suit after Paris became eighteen \u201cis inexcusable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">At yet another point, Murphy argues that, at the latest, Paris became aware of his rights in May 1983, when he secured the quit-claim deed from Kennon. Even then, Murphy says, \u201claches would apply,\u201d for to withhold filing suit from May 1983 until December 1984, another year and eight months, \u201cshowed a lack of diligence\u201d on Paris\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Murphy argues that these periods of delay, amounting to fifteen years, five and one-half years, and one year eight months, respectively, prejudiced her defense. By the time the present suit was filed, Murphy says, her parents had died, and they \u201cknew more about the actions of their son, Raleigh Paris Holland, [Sr.,] than anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">We reject as without merit Murphy\u2019s contention that laches began to run against Paris\u2019s claim from the time the suit was filed in 1969, when he was only seven years old. At the earliest, time began to run against the claim when Paris became eighteen and, even then, he had a reasonable time within which to bring the claim. What is reasonable depends upon the circumstances of each case, and one of the circumstances to be considered is the injury or prejudice the delay in bringing suit causes the opposing party. <em>Hamilton, </em>154 Va. at 351, 153 S.E. at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">As noted previously, Murphy points to the death of her parents and the resulting loss of their testimony as the prejudice she suffered from Paris\u2019s delay in bringing suit. But Murphy\u2019s parents had already died, the father in 1969 and the mother in 1977, before Paris ever reached his eighteenth birthday or discovered his father\u2019s ownership of the 77.25-acre tract. Accordingly, Paris cannot be charged with this loss of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Furthermore, the trial court specifically found that \u201c[n]o evidence was lost or subject to conjecture by the death of anyone, lapse of time or otherwise\u201d and that \u201cthere was ample and clear testimony by witnesses who personally knew all the parties involved and the facts of this case.\u201d The trial judge concluded that since \u201cthe evidence available and . . . presented does in fact allow the Court to make a full and fair ascertainment of the facts,\u201d the \u201cdoctrine of laches does not apply.\u201d <em>See Shirley </em>v. <em>Van Every, </em>159 Va. 762, 775, 167 S.E. 345, 349-50 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">We find from this record no evidence that Paris intended \u201cto abandon the [claim]\u201d or that the delay involved was \u201cunreasonable and injurious to the other party.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>154 Va. at 351, 153 S.E. at 682. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Murphy\u2019s plea of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">This brings us to the question whether the court erred in declaring Paris legitimate and entitled to the land in question. Paris contends that his parents\u2019 relationship was not merely meretricious. Rather, he argues, they entered into a common law marriage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>holding themselves out as husband and wife before and after Paris\u2019s birth and until Holland\u2019s death in 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Paris correctly concedes that Virginia does not recognize common law marriages contracted in this State.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Offield </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>100 Va. 250, 263, 40 S.E. 910, 914 (1902). Indeed, Paris states that \u201cin Virginia such marriages are simply \u2018void,\u2019 \u201d but, he says, this is what legitimizes him. A common law marriage may not be valid as between the immediate parties, Paris opines, yet it qualifies as a marriage \u201cnull in law\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 64-7, and, hence, entitles him to the declaration of legitimacy he received at the hands of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Code \u00a7 64-7 is the focus of the controversy. At the time of Holland\u2019s death on September 28, 1968, the section provided that \u201c[t]he issue of marriages deemed null in law . . . shall nevertheless be legitimate.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Murphy contends that a ceremonial marriage is required for Code \u00a7 64-7 to become operative. Since Holland and Geneva never participated in a ceremony, Murphy opines, their relationship did not provide a sufficient basis for declaring Paris legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In support of her contention, Murphy quotes from <em>Vanderpool v. Ryan, </em>137 Va. 445, 450, 119 S.E. 65, 66 (1923), that \u201cit is essential, in order to legitimize issue under [Code \u00a7 64-7], that there be a marriage of some kind or the statute can have no application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\"><em>Vanderpool </em>involved a claim by a mother that she and the putative father had gone through a marriage ceremony. This Court affirmed a judgment denying legitimacy because it found \u201cincredible\u201d the mother\u2019s claim that a ceremonial marriage had taken place. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 119 S.E. at 66. The Court did not hold that a common law marriage cannot support a finding of legitimacy. Rather, the Court stated that \u201c[t]he facts shown in this case are insufficient to prove even a common law marriage, but clearly indicate a meretricious union.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Paris cites <em>McClaugherty </em>v. <em>McClaugherty, </em>180 Va. 51, 21 S.E.2d 761 (1942). There, in a suit by a child to have herself declared legitimate, the mother testified that she and the putative father were married with license in a ceremony conducted by a preacher. According to the mother, the parties sent out wedding announcements and lived together openly as man and wife for twenty years after the marriage ceremony. The husband denied that the parties had gone through a marriage ceremony or had ever discussed the subject of marriage. He did acknowledge that the parties had lived together for twenty years and that the mother was regarded in the community as his wife. He also treated the child as his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">In a lengthy written opinion, the trial court reviewed the evidence concerning the alleged marriage ceremony and the history of the parents\u2019 life together. The trial court then wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">\u2018The testimony of complainant\u2019s mother, corroborated as it is by such conclusive evidence of the matrimonial reputation, declarations and conduct of her parents, the presumption arising therefrom and the inconclusiveness of the countervailing evidence, prove, on the issues involved in this case, that complainant is . . . legitimate. . . . \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\"><em>McClaugherty, </em>180 Va. at 61, 21 S.E.2d at 765. This holding, of course, would have been sufficient to establish the child\u2019s legitimacy. But in the very next paragraph of its opinion, the trial court stated that \u201c \u2018[s]he relies, however, on the proof as showing that she is the issue of common law marriage, legitimate by reason of section 5270 [later \u00a7 64-7] of the Code.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The trial court then proceeded to discuss the question whether the child of a common law marriage was legitimate under Code \u00a7 5270, later Code \u00a7 64-7. The trial court reviewed the authorities on the subject, including cases from this Court and the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, which had an identical statute. The trial court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">\u2018These decisions of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, and <em>dicta </em>of the distinguished judges of our own Supreme Court of Appeals [in <em>Stones </em>v. <em>Keeling, </em>9 Va. (5 Call) 143 (1804)], concurred in by the entire court, are each entitled to much respect. <em>They concur in construing section 5270 [later Code \u00a7 64-7] to legitimatize the issue of com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number><em>mon law marriages. </em>This construction is supported by sound reasoning from the Virginia decision. There is no Virginia authority to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">\u2018To deny the protection of this section to the innocent and unoffending offspring of common law marriages, requires the most narrow and technical construction of the phrase \u201cmarriage deemed null in law,\u201d defeats the intention of the Legislature as determined by our Virginia court, and violates the principle of liberal construction laid down by them.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><em>McClaugherty, </em>180 Va. at 64, 21 S.E.2d at 766 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We have quoted from the trial court\u2019s opinion in <em>McClaugherty </em>because this Court adopted the opinion as its own. <em>Id., </em>180 Va. at 56, 21 S.E.2d at 762. Hence, this Court approved the trial court\u2019s holding that the forerunner of Code \u00a7 64-7 legitimized issue of common law marriages.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit followed <em>McClaugherty </em>in deciding <em>Grove </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 271 </em>F.2d 918 (1959), a case involving the application of Virginia law. The Court stated that in <em>McClaugherty, </em>\u201c[t]he statute legitimizing the children of marriages \u2018null in law\u2019 was held effective to legitimize the child of a common law marriage.\u201d <em>Grove, </em>271 F.2d at 921.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Murphy argues that both <em>McClaugherty </em>and <em>Grove </em>were decided incorrectly. Murphy says: \u201cEvery lawyer that attended a Virginia law school knows that \u2018Virginia does not recognize a common law marriage.\u2019 \u201d This is true. It is also true, however, that Virginia does not recognize bigamous marriages. Yet, the antecedent of Code \u00a7 64-7 has been held to legitimize issue of bigamous marriages. <em>Stones </em>v. <em>Keeling, 9 </em>Va. (5 Call) 143 (1804). This is because \u201cthe object and purpose of [the] enactment [of Code \u00a7 64-7 and similar statutes] was to remove the stain and disabilities of bastardy from all \u2018innocent and unoffending\u2019 children who for any cause might be classed as illegitimate.\u201d <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>150 Va. 42, 45, 142 S.E. 412, 413 (1928). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>same reason applies with equal force to the issue of common law marriages.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Murphy also argues that the <em>McClaugherty </em>case incorrectly equated common law marriages with ceremonial marriages. We disagree. What the trial court did in that case was to make alternative holdings, and this Court affirmed both. In the first holding, the trial court found the child legitimate on the basis of the ceremonial nature of the parents\u2019 relationship. In the second, the trial court found the child legitimate on the basis that, assuming the absence of a ceremony, the parents\u2019 relationship constituted a common law marriage. Nothing in the section of the trial court\u2019s opinion relating to common law marriages suggests the court thought a ceremony was a necessary incident of such marriages, and this Court certainly knew that the requirement of a ceremony would be antithetical to the concept of a common law marriage as a contractual relationship. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>251 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">While common law marriages are not recognized in Virginia, they are marriages \u201cnull in law\u201d under Code \u00a7 64-7. Hence, the trial court did not err in finding Paris legitimate within the meaning of that section\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">For the reasons assigned, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-9\"><em> </em>A common law marriage is \u201c[o]ne not solemnized in the ordinary way <em>(i.e. </em>non-ceremonial) but created by an agreement to marry, followed by cohabitation.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>251 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-10\"> Code \u00a7 64-7 became \u00a7 64.1-7.
