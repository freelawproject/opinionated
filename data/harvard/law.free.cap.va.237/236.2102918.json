Relying upon Code \u00a7 13.1-857(A), the Vestry contended that the terms run for only one year. The trial court agreed with the Vestry and declared that the trustees\u2019 terms are limited to one year. We granted the Fund an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The Fund was incorporated on January 25, 1918, by a certificate approved by the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond (now the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond). The stated purposes of the Fund are to \u201cacquire and establish in perpetuity a fund . . . and to appropriate the income therefrom ... to the preservation, insurance and improvements of the real [and personal] property [of the church] and also to its religious, charitable and benevolent uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The certificate of incorporation vests the management of the Fund\u2019s affairs in five trustees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From the inception of the Fund until 1985, the trustees served for life, apparently without objection. A dispute then arose over the length of the trustees\u2019 terms, and, on November 12, 1986, the Vestry filed a motion for declaratory judgment which instituted the present proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Pertinent to our inquiry are the provisions of Article 6 of the certificate of incorporation. In part, Article 6 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-3\">The hereinafter named incorporators and their successors shall at all times constitute the members of this corporation, and may be designated as its Board of Trustees; they shall have power to act until their successors shall have been appointed as hereinafter provided. Any vacancy which may hereafter occur in said Board of Trustees from death, resignation, inability or refusal to act, removal, or from causes declared by the By-laws to create a vacancy, shall be filled by election by said Board of Trustees, and the Vestry of said Church shall have the sole power to make nominations to fill said vacancies ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Also pertinent are the provisions of Code \u00a7 13.1-857(A). This section, part of the Virginia Nonstock Corporation Act, states that \u201c[i]n the absence of a provision in the articles of incorporation fixing a term of office, the term of office for a director shall be one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The Fund contends that in order to answer the question whether its certificate of incorporation fixes the term of office of its trustees, it is necessary to ask two other questions. The first is whether \u201ca term for life [is] a \u2018term\u2019 as that word is used in [Code \u00a7] 13.1-857(A).\u201d The second is whether \u201cthe [Fund\u2019s] Certificate of Incorporation . . . establishes] a life term for its Trustees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AW8\">The Fund says that it finds in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Loeffler, </em>175 Ill. 585, 51 N.E. 785 (1898), an affirmative answer to its first question, <em>viz., </em>whether a term for life is a \u201cterm\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 13.1-857(A). In <em>Loeffler, </em>construing the provisions of a civil service act, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">[ T]he words, \u2018fixed time\u2019 ... do not necessarily mean a definite period, as for instance, one year, two years, or three years. On the contrary, they refer to a term of office which is established or settled, as contradistinguished from a term which depends upon the mere will or pleasure of the appointing power. A man who is appointed to hold his office during good behavior, or until removal or discharge for cause, occupies it for a settled and established term; and the time for which he occupies it, is in a certain sense a fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>time, because it does not end at the pleasure of the appointing power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><em>Id. </em>at 603, 51 N.E. at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The Fund then argues that the trial court, citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1639 (4th ed. 1968), incorrectly applied a definition of the word \u201cterm\u201d as meaning \u201ca fixed period, a determined or prescribed duration.\u201d In adopting this definition, the Fund says, the court ignored the phrase \u201cterm of office,\u201d used in Code \u00a7 13.1-857(A), which is defined in the same dictionary as meaning \u201cthe period during which [an] elected officer or appointee is entitled to hold office, perform its functions, and enjoy its privileges and emoluments.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 1640. In this definition, the Fund opines, \u201cthere is no requirement of a specified number of years; a term for life ... is a term of office just as clearly as is a term for a specified number of years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The Fund says it finds in the language of Article 6 of the certificate of incorporation an affirmative answer to its second question, <em>viz., </em>whether the certificate establishes a life term for the trustees. Here, the Fund emphasizes the language authorizing the trustees to act \u201cuntil their successors shall have been appointed\u201d as well as the language providing for the filling of vacancies occurring from \u201cdeath, resignation, inability or refusal to act, removal, or . . . causes declared by the By-laws to create a vacancy.\u201d From this language, the Fund opines, \u201cit is clear that members of the Board of Trustees act either for life or until they could not or would not fulfill their duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The intention of the Fund\u2019s organizers to fix trustees\u2019 terms at life is further demonstrated, the Fund suggests, by a provision in Article 7 of the certificate of incorporation. Article 7 establishes a term of office of one year for the Fund\u2019s president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. The Fund argues that had it been the intention of the organizers to limit the terms of trustees similarly, \u201cthey surely would have done so in the same express terms as provided in Article 7.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">We find this argument unpersuasive. We think it can be argued with greater logic that had the organizers intended to take the unusual step of providing life terms for trustees, they surely would have done so in unmistakable fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The language of Article 6 serves multi-faceted yet limited purposes. It provides for the orderly conduct of the Fund\u2019s business in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the event of vacancies by allowing trustees to serve until their successors are appointed; it prescribes the circumstances under which vacancies may occur; and it defines the method by which vacancies may be filled. But it evinces no intention on the part of the Fund\u2019s organizers to fix the trustees\u2019 terms of office at life.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\">To the contrary, we find in another provision of Article 6 unmistakable evidence of the organizers\u2019 intention not to fix the trustees\u2019 terms of office at life. This provision requires that \u201cnot less than three . . . members [of the board of trustees] shall be Vestrymen of said Church.\u201d This requirement cannot be satisfied if trustees serve for life. The terms of vestrymen are limited to three years. Accordingly, the inevitable result is that from time-to-time the number of vestrymen on the board of trustees would be reduced to less than three. Indeed, this has been the result of the Fund\u2019s previous experience with trustees serving life terms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">We find, therefore, that there is an \u201cabsence of a provision in [the Fund\u2019s certificate] of incorporation fixing a term of office\u201d for the Fund\u2019s trustees, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 13.1-857(A). Hence, if this Code section applies, the terms of trustees are limited to one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Fund argues, however, that Code \u00a7 13.1-857(A) should not be applied retroactively. The Fund says that a corporate charter is a contract between the state and the corporate organizers which cannot be impaired by subsequent legislation such as Code \u00a7 13.1-857(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The Fund concedes that under Code \u00a7 13.1-937, the provisions of Chapter 10, Title 13, which include Code \u00a7 13.1-857(A), are made applicable to all corporations theretofore or thereafter organized. And the Fund acknowledges that we said in <em>Hanshaw </em>v. <em>Day, </em>202 Va. 818, 120 S.E.2d 460 (1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">While it must be conceded that a corporate charter is a contract between the state on the one hand and the organizers of the corporation on the other, and therefore cannot be impaired by subsequent legislation, this principle is subject to the well-recognized limitation that the legislature does not thereby relinquish its authority, under its police power, to supervise, regulate and limit the exercise of corporate functions by appropriate legislative changes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 823, 120 S.E.2d at 463 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">The Fund counters, however, with the argument that Code \u00a7 13.1-857(A) is \u201cmerely an interpretive aid to assist in the determination of directors\u2019 terms\u201d and \u201cdoes not purport to supervise, regulate or limit the exercise of corporate functions.\u201d Hence, the Fund says, \u201corganizers of [a] corporation remain free to establish whatever term of office they deem appropriate for the directors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">We disagree with the Fund concerning the applicability of Code \u00a7 13.1-857(A). As the Vestry points out, the issue in this case is not \u201cwhether the organizers could have created a term for any duration, but whether the [certificate of incorporation does], in fact, fix a term of office.\u201d We have already demonstrated that the certificate does not fix a term of office for the Fund\u2019s trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In these circumstances, Code \u00a7 13.1-857(A) intervenes, not as a mere \u201cinterpretive aid\u201d but as a mandate, to fix the trustees\u2019 terms at one year. Code \u00a7 13.1-857(A) constitutes, therefore, an \u201cappropriate legislative\u201d change \u201cregulating] and limit[ing] the exercise of corporate functions.\u201d <em>Hanshaw, </em>202 Va. at 823, 120 S.E.2d at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Finding no error, we will affirm the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\"> St. John\u2019s, site of Patrick Henry\u2019s \u201cliberty-or-death\u201d speech, is located on Church Hill in Richmond.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\"> A subsequent amendment to the certificate of incorporation provides that the trustees of the Fund should number not less than five nor more than nine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\"> We find untenable the Fund\u2019s suggestion that the three-vestrymen requirement would be satisfied so long as those selected are vestrymen when made trustees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
