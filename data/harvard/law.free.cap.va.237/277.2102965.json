The principal issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in striking the plaintiffs evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Nawal T. Hadeed (Nawal), personal representative of the estate of Teddy M. Hadeed (Hadeed), brought a wrongful death action against five defendants, Medic-24, Ltd. (Medic-24), a corporation; Frederick Kessler, M.D.; Rudolph Bickel, M.D.; Ronald Wilder, M.D.; and Ernest Rafey, M.D. (collectively, defendant-physicians). In her motion for judgment, Nawal alleged that each of the defendant-physicians \u201cacted contrary to acceptable standards of medical care by wrongfully and negligently failing timely to diagnose coronary artery disease in . . . Hadeed, and to examine and treat him for [the] disease;\u201d that because the defendant-physicians were agents of Medic-24, the negligence of the defendant-physicians was imputed to Medic-24; and that the negligence of all defendants proximately caused Hadeed\u2019s death. Each defendant denied liability, and the case was tried to a jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Following a seven-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Dr. Bickel<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but was unable to reach a verdict as to the defendants, Kessler, Wilder, and Medic-24. Thereafter, each of these defendants moved to have Nawal\u2019s evidence struck. The trial court granted the motion and entered summary judgment for the defendants. The court, however, denied Nawal\u2019s motion to strike Medic-24\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">We granted Nawal an appeal limited to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">1. Whether the trial court, in considering the motions to strike at the conclusion of all the evidence, erred in failing to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">2. Whether the trial court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motion to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">3. Whether the trial court erred in denying [Nawal\u2019s] motion to strike the evidence of [Medic-24].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">We first consider whether the trial court applied an incorrect standard in ruling on the defendants\u2019 motions to strike by failing to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Nawal, the non-moving party. The standard we apply in reviewing a case in which the trial court has ruled on a motion to strike a plaintiffs evidence at the conclusion of all the evidence is set forth in <em>Matney </em>v. <em>Cedar Land Farms, </em>216 Va. 932, 224 S.E.2d 162 (1976).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-10\">On review of a case in which the trial court has sustained a motion to strike after the introduction of all the evidence, we apply the principles governing consideration of evidence upon a motion to set aside a verdict as contrary to the evidence. \u201c[W]e examine the evidence to determine whether or not a verdict in behalf of the losing party can be sustained. That is, upon a careful consideration of all the evidence, if we are of opinion that reasonable men may differ on the conclusion to be reached, then it is our duty to hold that the trial court committed error in striking the evidence.\u201d In viewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the evidence we give the plaintiffs \u201cthe benefit of all substantial conflict in the evidence, and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 933-34, 224 S.E.2d at 163 (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>168 Va. 418, 422-23, 191 S.E. 768, 770 (1937)). The standard enunciated in <em>Matney </em>for appellate review also is the appropriate standard to be applied at the trial level.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">It is clear from our reading of the record that the trial court, in passing on the defendants\u2019 motions to strike, misapplied the <em>Matney </em>standard of review by failing to view the evidence and all inferences fairly drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to Nawal. Consequently, we will state the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to Nawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Hadeed was married to Nawal. He and his brother owned and operated a carpet shop in the City of Alexandria. Hadeed\u2019s work required him to do occasional heavy lifting. Hadeed was 50 years old when he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">On the evening of April 5, 1981, Hadeed experienced strong chest pain and nausea. He also was sweating profusely and was so short of breath that he could not speak. After a few minutes, the pain and other symptoms disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Later that night (April 6), however, Hadeed experienced \u201cthe same pain all over again ... the pain in the chest and shortness of breath.\u201d Consequently, he went to Medic-24. Medic-24 maintains medical offices 24 hours each day, providing general family medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">At Medic-24, Hadeed first spoke with a nurse. The nurse\u2019s notes reveal that Hadeed told her that he had \u201c[c]hest pain across chest, both arms and back.\u201d The nurse took Hadeed\u2019s medical history which revealed that he had a family history of high blood pressure and heart disease. The nurse also took Hadeed\u2019s temperature, his pulse, and his blood pressure. His blood pressure was elevated.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Hadeed then saw Dr. Kessler. Dr. Kessler graduated from medical school in 1975, completed a one-year internship in 1976, and then completed a two-year residency in internal medicine. In 1979, he was \u201cboard-certified\u201d in internal medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Dr. Kessler\u2019s notes state that when he saw Hadeed on April 6, Hadeed\u2019s pain was \u201cintermittent, sharp [and] increasingly associated with [shortness of breath],\u201d and the pain \u201c[b]egan in back &amp; then went to chest. Some discomfort in both arms \u2014 [p]ain may last only 4-5 [minutes] &amp; then disappears for a whole day.\u201d The doctor\u2019s chart, however, made no reference to the circumstances under which Hadeed had experienced the pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Dr. Kessler\u2019s examination of Hadeed included the doctor\u2019s review of an electrocardiogram (EKG). From the EKG, the doctor concluded that Hadeed had Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH), which suggests long-standing hypertension that produces a thickening of the heart muscle and imposes greater strain on the heart in providing blood to the body. The EKG also suggested a possible malfunction of Hadeed\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Dr. Kessler opined that the origin of Hadeed\u2019s pain was \u201cnon-cardiac\u201d and was \u201cprobably musculoskeletal,\u201d secondary \u201cto lifting &amp; wrestling.\u201d While he believed the pain was of a muscular origin, the doctor reported that Hadeed\u2019s chest and back were \u201cnon-tender.\u201d Dr. Kessler prescribed Tylenol No. 3 for Hadeed and sent him home. The doctor, however, did not inform Hadeed of the LVH diagnosis, did not arrange for further tests more fully to assess Hadeed\u2019s condition, and did not arrange to have Hadeed\u2019s cholesterol count taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Hadeed returned to Medic-24 twice in May 1981. The first time was early in the morning of May 3. The nurse on duty took Hadeed\u2019s pulse and blood pressure. Both were elevated.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Dr. Bickel, the physician on duty, read Hadeed\u2019s April 6 record and examined him. Hadeed complained of shortness of breath after vigorous work. Dr. Bickel noted that Hadeed had been using marijuana to alleviate tension at home. The doctor concluded that Hadeed had borderline hypertension. He prescribed muscle relaxants, recommended that Hadeed reduce the salt in his diet, advised him to stop using marijuana, and told him to return to Medic-24 in one to two weeks. Dr. Bickel, however, did not tell Hadeed that he had LVH.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Hadeed next visited Medic-24 in the early evening of May 15 and again was seen by Dr. Bickel. Hadeed\u2019s blood pressure was reduced, but he still complained of shortness of breath. He also complained of pain in his neck and shoulders. Dr. Bickel, still of opinion that Hadeed was suffering from hypertension, prescribed medication to reduce Hadeed\u2019s blood pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>On December 17, 1981, Hadeed experienced \u201ca horrible pain\u201d in his chest when he tried to lift a rug for a customer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also was nauseous, dizzy, and short of breath. That evening, Hadeed again visited Medic-24. He told the nurse that his problem was back pain and shortness of breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">This time, Hadeed was seen by Dr. Wilder. The doctor reviewed Hadeed\u2019s charts from previous visits to Medic-24 and gave Hadeed a physical examination. As shown by the chart Dr. Wilder prepared, Hadeed\u2019s subjective complaints on this occasion were the \u201c[sjame problems as before \u2014 see previous visits.\u201d Dr. Wilder concluded that Hadeed was suffering from a muscle disorder called \u201cfibromyalgia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">On December 24, 1981, Hadeed was engaged in work. In the early afternoon, after having parked his truck in a shopping center, Hadeed suffered a fatal heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">An autopsy revealed that Hadeed had severe coronary artery disease. This disease, commonly known as hardening of the arteries, reflects a condition where fatty tissue builds up inside the arteries and blocks the flow of blood from the arteries to the heart. The autopsy also showed that Hadeed had myocardial scarring, which indicated that he had suffered another heart attack sometime prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Hadeed\u2019s left anterior descending artery was blocked 100 percent. His right artery, which was predominant in Hadeed\u2019s coronary system, was blocked 80 percent. A third artery, the circumflex artery, was very small and provided little distribution of blood to Hadeed\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">According to the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, Hadeed\u2019s death was caused by \u201chardening of the blood vessel of the coronary artery with resultant insufficient blood flow to the heart.\u201d The medical examiner testified that \u201cin common terms [Hadeed] had a heart attack and died rather quickly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Expert evidence revealed the nature, symptoms, and diagnosis of coronary artery disease as well as the risk factors in assessing the likelihood that a person has the disease. The experts agreed that when a middle-aged male comes to a physician with chest pain, the physician\u2019s first concern is to either rule \u201cin or out\u201d the possibility that the patient has coronary artery disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Testimony indicated that angina probably is the most common symptom of coronary artery disease. Angina refers to pain that is produced when the heart cannot receive sufficient blood due to arteries that are clogged by fatty tissue. A common sign of angina is chest pain. Most often, the pain is described as a tightness, but the pain also can be sharp. The pain may be in other parts of the upper body, including the neck, the shoulders, the back, and the arms. Generally, the pain lasts for only a few minutes. Sweating, nausea, and shortness of breath are other symptoms associated with angina.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Usually, the pain is induced by an external force, <em>e.g., </em>exertion, eating, emotional anxiety, and exposure to cold. Rest usually alleviates the pain. The frequency of angina attacks can vary greatly, from \u201conce every couple months to many times in one day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Angina is diagnosed on the basis of a patient\u2019s medical history. The history can reveal certain \u201crisk factors\u201d that increase the likelihood of a person\u2019s contracting coronary artery disease. For example, males between the ages of 35 and 55 represent the most vulnerable group, and cigarette smoking can increase the risk of contracting the disease. High blood pressure and high cholesterol also can increase the risk. If a person\u2019s parents or other close blood relatives have had the disease at an early age, the likelihood of that person\u2019s contracting the disease is increased. In considering complaints of pain, therefore, a physician should take these risk factors into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">From a patient\u2019s medical history, a physician should ascertain the location and duration of the pain and the circumstances under which the pain is experienced. In order to obtain an accurate and complete medical history, the applicable standard of care requires a physician to ask probing questions of the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Dr. George Rebecca, a cardiologist, was one of Nawal\u2019s medical experts. He testified that, based upon Hadeed\u2019s history and Dr. Kessler\u2019s examination of Hadeed, Dr. Kessler\u2019s treatment fell below the standard of care in failing to diagnose Hadeed\u2019s pain as angina and in failing to refer Hadeed to a cardiologist or to a hospital for treatment. Had Hadeed been referred to a cardiologist or to a hospital, his heart condition could have been diagnosed and appropriate treatment would have followed. The treatment might have been in the form of medication, or if Hadeed were in a critical state, in the form of bypass surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>According to Dr. Rebecca, treatment would have improved Hadeed\u2019s chance of survival:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">Without treatment at all the chances for mortality rate . . . would be around 10 to 15 percent per year. In other words, each year that he lived he would have a 10 to 15 percent chance of dying. If treatment had been initiated, that would have been reduced to 4 or 5 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Dr. Dennis Donahue, also a cardiologist, was Nawal\u2019s other medical expert. He also testified that Dr. Kessler\u2019s treatment of Hadeed fell below the standard of care in failing to diagnose angina on April 6, 1981, and in failing to refer Hadeed for treatment. Dr. Donahue testified that, had Hadeed been so referred, a cardiologist would have found that Hadeed had severe coronary artery disease. The witness also stated that if Hadeed had had bypass surgery in April 1981, Hadeed would have had an 85 to 90 percent chance of living to age 70. If Hadeed had been placed on medical therapy, he would have had a 50 percent chance of living to age 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Similarly, Drs. Rebecca and Donahue testified that Dr. Wilder\u2019s treatment of Hadeed fell below the applicable standard of care. Based upon Hadeed\u2019s records at Medic-24 and his symptoms on December 17, 1981, they testified that Dr. Wilder fell below the applicable standard of care in failing to diagnose angina and in failing to refer Hadeed for treatment. Had Hadeed received bypass surgery at that time, he would have had an 85 to 90 percent chance of surviving to age 70. With medical therapy, Hadeed would have had a \u201c[f]orty to 50 percent chance of being alive at 10 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">We next consider whether the trial court erred in striking Nawal\u2019s evidence. Ordinarily, negligence and proximate cause are issues for a jury\u2019s resolution. A court decides these issues only when reasonable minds could not differ. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Shively, </em>227 Va. 317, 320, 315 S.E.2d 210, 212 (1984). Moreover, as previously noted, when the sufficiency of a plaintiff\u2019s evidence is challenged by a motion to strike at the conclusion of all the evidence, the trial court must give the plaintiff \u201cthe benefit of all substantial conflict in the evidence, and all fair inferences that may be drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>therefrom.\u201d <em>Walton, </em>168 Va. at 423, 191 S.E. at 770. These principles of tort litigation apply \u201cwith no less force to medical malpractice cases.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Koulizakis, </em>229 Va. 524, 531, 331 S.E.2d 440, 445 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">In <em>Brown, </em>we discussed negligence and proximate cause in the context of a medical malpractice death case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">A physician is not an insurer of the success of his diagnosis and treatment nor is he held to the highest degree of care known to his profession. The mere fact that he has failed to effect a cure or that his diagnosis and treatment have been detrimental to the patient\u2019s health does not raise a presumption of negligence. Nevertheless, a physician must demonstrate that degree of skill and diligence in the diagnosis and treatment of the patient employed by a reasonably prudent practitioner in his field of practice or specialty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">In medical malpractice cases, as in other negligence actions, the plaintiff must establish not only that the defendant violated the applicable standard of care, and was therefore negligent, he must also sustain the burden of showing that the negligent acts constituted a proximate cause of the injury or death. Thus, in a death case, if a defendant physician, by action or inaction, has destroyed any substantial possibility of the patient\u2019s survival, such conduct becomes a proximate cause of the patient\u2019s death. The law does not require the plaintiff to prove to a certainty that the patient would have lived had he received more prompt diagnosis and treatment for the condition causing the death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 532, 331 S.E.2d at 445-46 (citations omitted). <em>Accord Whitfield </em>v. <em>Whittaker Mem. Hospital, </em>210 Va. 176, 183-84, 169 S.E.2d 563, 568-69 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Clearly, Nawal presented sufficient evidence of negligence against both Dr. Kessler and Dr. Wilder to create jury issues. The record contains evidence that both physicians fell below the applicable standard of care in failing properly to diagnose angina and in failing to refer Hadeed to a cardiologist or to a hospital for appropriate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Likewise, proximate cause was a jury question. Nawal presented evidence that the doctors\u2019 failure to meet the applicable standard of care destroyed any substantial possibility of Hadeed\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>survival. A jury reasonably could find that with bypass surgery Hadeed would have had an 85-90 percent chance of living to age 70. With only medical therapy, he would have had a 50 percent chance of living to age 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Dr. Kessler argues that his negligence could not have been a proximate cause of Hadeed\u2019s death because Hadeed was \u201cnowhere near the \u2018threshold of death\u2019 \u201d when he was examined on April 6, 1981. A jury reasonably could have been persuaded by this argument, but from the evidence and its fair inferences, a jury also reasonably could have found that Dr. Kessler\u2019s negligence proximately caused Hadeed\u2019s death. The evidence indicates that Hadeed had severe coronary artery disease in April 1981 and that, had he received the proper treatment at that time, he would have had a substantial possibility of surviving.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Paradoxically, Dr. Wilder argues that his negligence could not have proximately caused Hadeed\u2019s death because there was insufficient time between Hadeed\u2019s visit on December 17, 1981, and his death on December 24, 1981, for either bypass surgery or medical therapy. This argument also might have been made to a jury, but again, applying the correct standard for viewing the evidence on a motion to strike, we conclude that reasonable minds could differ. Thus, whether Dr. Wilder\u2019s alleged negligence proximately caused Hadeed\u2019s death is a question of fact for a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The final issue is whether the trial court erred in denying Nawal\u2019s motion to strike Medic-24\u2019s evidence. Nawal contends that Drs. Kessler and Wilder were employees of Medic-24 and the evidence, as a matter of law, establishes a master and servant relationship. Medic-24 contends, on the other hand, that a jury reasonably could find from the evidence that the doctors were independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Medic-24 is operated by Dr. Rafey. Through Dr. Rafey, it hires other physicians. Some physicians work full-time; others work part-time. Drs. Kessler and Wilder worked part-time.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Dr. Rafey informed all of Medic-24\u2019s physicians that he expected them to practice medicine according to his standards because they were \u201cseeing [his] patients when [he was] not there.\u201d Medic-24 had the power to dismiss at any time any physician who did not follow Dr. Rafey\u2019s instructions or conform to his stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>dards. Indeed, on one occasion, Dr. Rafey fired a doctor who refused to treat children.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Generally, whether a person is a servant or an independent contractor is a question of fact for a properly instructed jury. When, however, the evidence admits of but one conclusion, the question is one of law. <em>See Drake </em>v. <em>Livesay, </em>231 Va. 117, 121, 341 S.E.2d 186, 188-89 (1986); <em>Naccash </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>223 Va. 406, 417-19, 290 S.E.2d 825, 831-33 (1982); <em>Stagg </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>119 Va. 266, 270, 89 S.E. 237, 238 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The elements to be considered in determining whether a master and servant relationship exists are well established.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">Four factors enter into determination of the question whether a master-servant relationship exists within the contemplation of the doctrine of respondeat superior, (1) selection and engagement of the servant, (2) payment of compensation, (3) power of dismissal, and (4) power of control. The first three factors are not essential to the existence of the relationship; the fourth, the power of control, is determinative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\"><em>Naccash, </em>223 Va. at 418-19, 290 S.E.2d at 832. <em>Accord Stover </em>v. <em>Ratliff, </em>221 Va. 509, 511-12, 272 S.E.2d 40, 42 (1980); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Nussman, </em>152 Va. 293, 303, 147 S.E. 246, 249 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">In the present case, the undisputed evidence shows that (1) Medic-24, through its principal, Dr. Rafey, hired the doctors to take care of Dr. Rafey\u2019s patients in his absence; (2) Medic-24 paid the doctors for their services; and (3) Medic-24 had the power of dismissal. We cannot say, however, that with respect to the fourth and determinative element, <em>i.e., </em>the power of control, the evidence is conclusive. Indeed, as Medic-24 asserts, the doctors were expected to exercise their independent judgment and discretion in the treatment of patients. <em>See, e.g., James </em>v. <em>Jane, </em>221 Va. 43, 54, 282 S.E.2d 864, 870 (1980) (in sovereign immunity context, state hospital exercised slight control over its physicians).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">We hold, therefore, that whether the doctors were employees of Medic-24 or independent contractors were factual questions for resolution by a properly instructed jury. Consequently, the trial court did not err in denying Nawal\u2019s motion to strike Medic-24\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">In sum, we hold that the trial court erred (1) in applying the incorrect standard in ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to strike Nawal\u2019s evidence, and (2) in striking Nawal\u2019s evidence. We further hold that the trial court properly denied Nawal\u2019s motion to strike Medic-24\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for a new trial consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-12\"> During the trial of this case, Nawal nonsuited Dr. Rafey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-11\"> The trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of Dr. Bickel is not challenged in this appeal and that judgment has become final.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\"> The evidence reveals that, between April 6, 1981, and December 17, 1981, Hadeed had experienced chest pain on at least three other occasions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
