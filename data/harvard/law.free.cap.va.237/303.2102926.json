Stell in the commission of robbery, abduction, and rape. Code \u00a7 18.2-31. A jury found Hoke guilty of capital murder as charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Pursuant to the bifurcated-trial procedure prescribed by Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4, a separate hearing on the penalty was conducted. In the penalty phase of the trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence of aggravating factors, and Hoke offered evidence in mitigation. The jury fixed Hoke\u2019s punishment at death. Thereafter, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5, and at the conclusion of the hearing the court imposed the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">We have consolidated the automatic review of Hoke\u2019s death sentence with his appeal from his capital murder conviction, Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-110.1(A) and -110.1(F). Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.2, we have given them priority on our docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">PRETRIAL MATTERS</p>\n<p id=\"AWI\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">\n<em>Constitutionality of the Death Penalty Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">Hoke contends that Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.2 and -264.4(C) are unconstitutional because they \u201care overly broad and impermissibly vague.\u201d Hoke correctly acknowledges, however, that we have \u201crejected this claim in other cases.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 320-21, 356 S.E.2d 157, 161 (compiling cases), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. _, 108 S.Ct. 207 (1987). Adhering to our previous rulings, we again reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Hoke also contends that death by electrocution constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Federal and Virginia Constitutions. We have repeatedly rejected this argument, <em>see, e.g., Gray, </em>233 Va. at 320, 356 S.E.2d at 160-61 (compiling cases), and adhere to our previous holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>Change of Venue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Hoke contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant a change of venue. This issue is not properly before us. Hoke made no proffer of evidence to support his assertion that certain newspaper articles and reports by the broadcast media prevented his receiving a fair trial in the City of Peters-burg. Moreover, Hoke has waived the contention. When he first moved for a change of venue, he requested that the motion be continued until it could be determined whether a jury could be impanelled. His counsel agreed that he could renew the motion if jury <em>voir dire </em>indicated that \u201cit\u2019s a problem.\u201d The motion was not renewed, and, therefore, we will not consider this contention on appeal. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">THE GUILT PHASE A</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">On either October 4 or 5, 1985, in mid-afternoon, Hoke and Stell, the victim, were in the European Restaurant in the City of Petersburg. Initially, they were in different areas of the restaurant. Later, however, Hoke came across the room and joined Stell at her table. About 6:00 p.m., Hoke and Stell left the restaurant together.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">On October 7, the police found Stell\u2019s body in the bedroom of her apartment. Stell had sustained two lethal stab wounds, one in the right upper front quadrant of her body and the other in her right back. The front wound was six-and-one-half inches deep; the depth of the wound to the back was two-and-five-eighths inches. Fresh, red bruises were on Stell\u2019s arms. A medical examiner testified that the stab wounds caused Stell\u2019s death. She opined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Stell \u201chad some period of time of survival, at least several minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Stell\u2019s \u201canal ring\u201d was dilated and smeared with \u201cstool\u201d and a greasy, yellow substance \u201clike margarine, butter.\u201d A blue electrical cord was wrapped around Stell\u2019s wrists, binding them so tightly that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any way for her to get out of it.\u201d Her ankles were bound with a brown electrical extension cord, rendering the ankles immobile. Her mouth had been \u201cgagged\u201d with a pair of \u201cpanties,\u201d tied so tight that they left \u201can impression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">A knife was found on an ironing board in Stell\u2019s bedroom. The knife was covered with blood that matched Stell\u2019s blood type. Beside the knife was a clothes iron. The blue electrical cord around Stell\u2019s wrists had been cut from the iron. Several dresser drawers were open, and their contents had been \u201cdumped\u201d on the bedroom floor. Items from two purses \u2014 including empty pill containers \u2014 were strewn upon the floors of the bedroom and an adjacent dining room-kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Swabs and smears were taken and examined in a laboratory for the presence of semen (spermatozoa). Semen was identified \u201con the vaginal swabs and smear, on the anal smear,\u201d and on a \u201ctowel labeled \u2018peri-anal wipings.\u2019 \u201d Semen found on sheets and a bedspread in the bedroom was consistent with Hoke\u2019s blood type.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">On October 15, 1985, about 3:25 a.m., Hoke \u201cflagged . . . down\u201d a police officer in Hagerstown, Maryland. He told the officer that he had murdered a woman in Petersburg, Virginia. The officer immediately advised Hoke of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and took him to police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">At the police station, Hoke related that he had met a woman named Virginia at the European Restaurant, and he and the woman had gone to her apartment. He stated that he murdered the woman by stabbing her twice, \u201conce in the back, once in the abdomen area in the front.\u201d He said that after he stabbed the woman \u201cshe was screaming,\u201d so he \u201cplaced a pillow . . . over her face to muffle her screaming.\u201d Hoke said he knew the woman was dead before he left the apartment \u201cbecause she wasn\u2019t breathing, she wasn\u2019t moving, and her eyes were rolled back in her head.\u201d Finally, Hoke said that he dumped the woman\u2019s purse, \u201ctook some pills and left\u201d the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Petersburg police officers also interrogated Hoke on October 15. At the time, Hoke was in the Hagerstown jail. After \u201cbeing advised of his rights and waiving his rights,\u201d Hoke told the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>that he had murdered Stell in her Petersburg apartment. Hoke said he had met Stell at the European Restaurant and thereafter had accompanied her to her apartment. Upon their arrival at the apartment, they \u201chad sex.\u201d He then \u201cput [a knife] to her throat,\u201d tied her hands together, bound her feet, and gagged her mouth. He stabbed Stell in the back with the knife, muffling her screams with a pillow. He then rolled her over and stabbed her in the stomach. As Stell continued to scream, Hoke held the pillow over her face for four or five minutes until she died. He then \u201cransacked\u201d the apartment and stole some of Stell\u2019s medication that was in her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">On October 17, while confined in the Petersburg jail, Hoke contacted the police and repeated his confession to them. He also stated at that time that he had decided to kill Stell while they were walking to her apartment, adding that he had thought about killing someone for a long time, and \u201cthis seemed like a perfect opportunity\u201d to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Hoke told a fellow inmate in the Petersburg jail that he had come to Petersburg to see Stell. Hoke said that he had \u201csold drugs to the woman or somebody in that apartment complex.\u201d Hoke said he killed Stell when he \u201cfound out that she had ripped him off \u201d and that \u201che couldn\u2019t get his stuff back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In his trial testimony, Hoke stated that he and Stell \u201chad sex\u201d and then \u201cmade love the second time anally,\u201d using margarine as a lubricant. Then \u201c[w]e got into an argument. I can\u2019t remember exactly what it was about, but she started cussing me.\u201d Next, \u201c[s]he slapped me in the face . . \u25a0. and I stabbed her in the back.\u201d Hoke said he \u201ckind of freaked out.\u201d He \u201cgrabbed some cords and started tying her up and she started to scream so [he] went ahead and . . . tried to muffle the screams\u201d with a pillow. Stell continued to scream so Hoke \u201cgrabbed the knife again and stuck it in her stomach.\u201d He then found a bottle of pills in Stell\u2019s pocketbook and left the apartment with the bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\n<em>Juror Claiborne Manns</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Hoke contends that the Commonwealth, in exercising its fourth peremptory jury strike, intended to strike venireman Claiborne Manns, but the clerk \u201carbitrarily\u201d struck Elizabeth G. Moran, whose name immediately followed Manns\u2019. We cannot con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>sider this contention on appeal, however, because no objection was made at trial. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\n<em>Reputation Evidence of Victim\u2019s Unchaste Character</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Hoke contends that the trial court erred in refusing to admit evidence of Steffis unchaste character. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the \u201crape shield\u201d statute, \u201cthe General Assembly intended to preclude evidence of general reputation or opinion of the unchaste character of the complaining witness in all circumstances.\u201d <em>Winfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 211, 220, 301 S.E.2d 15, 20 (1983). Hoke\u2019s counsel, as an apparent proffer, told the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">I think at best I could, through various witnesses, would prove that it was [Steffis] reputation that she would go out with them and quite possibly go back to the apartment but as to any specific sexual act that occurred, I have no such evidence, other than what was the popular belief of the people at the European.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">To this statement, the trial court correctly replied that \u201cgeneral reputation and opinion ... is positively barred by [Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7].\u201d Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">To convict Hoke of capital murder, the Commonwealth not only had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was willful, deliberate, and premeditated, but that it was \u201cin the commission of, or subsequent to, rape,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-31(e), or \u201cin the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-31 (d), or \u201cin the commission of abduction . . . when such abduction was committed with the intent to extort money or a pecuniary benefit,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-31(a). Hoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>contends that the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support the jury\u2019s findings that he committed any of the underlying felonies, and therefore, he cannot be convicted of capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Rape is defined as sexual intercourse against the victim\u2019s will by force, threat, or intimidation. Code \u00a7 18.2-61. <em>See also Sutton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 654, 662-63, 324 S.E.2d 665, 669-70 (1985). Ordinarily, whether the act of intercourse was forcible or consensual is a question for a jury to decide. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 792, 796, 263 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1980). Rape, like any other crime, may be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>Orange </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 423, 435, 61 S.E.2d 267, 272 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The medical examiner found red, fresh bruises on Stell\u2019s body, two inside the left wrist, one on the right forearm, and one on the upper right arm. Stell\u2019s wrists and ankles had been tightly bound with electrical cords. Her mouth was snugly gagged. And yet, Stell was 56 years old and weighed only 125 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">On appeal, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. In so doing, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the act of intercourse was against Stell\u2019s will and resulted from force, threat, or intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Robbery is \u201cthe taking, with intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will; by violence or intimidation.\u201d <em>Pritchard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 559, 561, 303 S.E.2d 911, 912 (1983) (quoting <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 253, 254, 105 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1958)). Hoke contends that the evidence fails to establish a \u201ccausal connection between the murder and the robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Hoke stated that he came to Petersburg to see Stell, that after seeing her he learned that she \u201chad ripped him off,\u201d and that he killed her when he found out that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get his stuff back.\u201d Thus, the jury reasonably could have concluded that Hoke \u201cransacked\u201d the apartment searching for the \u201cstuff,\u201d discovered the pills, and stole them.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Moreover, the jury also reasonably could have found that \u201cthe killing and the theft were interdependent objects of a common criminal design,\u201d and if so, the evidence would support a conviction of capital murder. <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 322, 334, 337 S.E.2d 715, 723 (1985) (quoting <em>Edmonds </em>v. <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>wealth, </em>229 Va. 303, 310, 329 S.E.2d 807, 813, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 975 (1985)), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1112 (1986). <em>See also Linwood Earl Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 532, 544, 273 S.E.2d 48, 56 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1031 (1981) (killing following robbery \u201cpart of the same criminal enterprise\u201d). Indeed, the trial court properly instructed the jury that \u201c[mjurder during the commission of a robbery occurs where the killing is so closely related to the robbery in time, place, and causal connection as to make it a part of the same criminal enterprise.\u201d Thus, we hold that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that Hoke killed Stell in the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Finally, Hoke contends that the trial court erred in refusing to strike the evidence as it relates to capital murder in the commission of abduction because the same restraint was necessary for that offense as for capital murder in the commission of robbery and capital murder in the commission of rape. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 310, 314, 337 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1985), we said that \u201cin the enactment of the abduction statute the General Assembly did not intend to make the kind of restraint which is an intrinsic element of crimes such as rape, robbery, and assault a criminal act, punishable as a separate offense.\u201d When such other crimes involving restraint of the victim are committed, an accused cannot be subject to a separate penalty for a conviction of abduction unless \u201cthe detention committed ... is separate and apart from, and not merely incidental to, the restraint employed in the commission of the other crime[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 337 S.E.2d at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In the present case, Stell\u2019s wrists and ankles were bound securely with' ligatures, her mouth was gagged tightly, and she was detained for a lengthy period. Applying the <em>Brown </em>rule to these facts, we conclude that Stell\u2019s detention was greater than \u201cthe kind of restraint that is inherent in the act of rape,\u201d <em>id., </em>or in the commission of robbery. Thus, we hold that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that Hoke killed Stell in the commission of abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In sum, the jury found Hoke guilty of capital murder in the commission of rape, capital murder in the commission of robbery, and capital murder in the commission of abduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>evidence supports all three convictions. We note, however, that a finding of guilty on any one of the underlying felonies would have supported a capital murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">THE PENALTY PHASE A</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In the penalty phase, the Commonwealth presented evidence of Hoke\u2019s past criminal record, which consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">Year Conviction State</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad7\">1975 simple assault Maryland</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9d\">1979 trespassing, loitering, Florida and prowling</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amf\">1980 attempted arson California</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agv\">1981 carrying a concealed weapon California</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av3T\">1981 vandalism California</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A66\">1982 resisting arrest and California vandalism</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI2\">1983 burglary Maryland</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-20\">On October 17, 1985, Hoke made the following statement to a police detective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-21\">For the last 12 years, I\u2019ve been on my own, just running, traveling, just doing what I wanted to do, getting high all the time. I\u2019ve stole trucks, broke in things, ripped off dope dealers, a little bit of everything. Assaults, jumped people, beat them with things just to collect money together for a dope deal or something. Hell of a life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-22\">Hoke\u2019s mitigation evidence consisted of the testimony of five witnesses, including that of Hoke. Other than Hoke, the witnesses were Barbara Moore, a clinical social worker; Barbara Marget, a social worker who succeeded Moore as Hoke\u2019s counselor; Gary Wiley, a jail chaplain; and Alfred Rimmer, another jail chaplain.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-23\">Shortly after Hoke\u2019s arrest, Moore began counseling Hoke and worked with him approximately eight months. She was counseling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Hoke \u201cfor his depression, his anxiety and his manipulative and suicidal behavior.\u201d Initially, her counseling \u201cinvolved using a lot of confrontation because [Hoke] was manipulative.\u201d Eventually, however, Hoke responded to her treatment. As a result, \u201cthere were fewer incidences of suicidal threats and gestures, and [Hoke] began to verbalize his anxiety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Marget, as Moore\u2019s successor, had been counseling Hoke for the two months prior to his trial. She testified that Hoke \u201ccame from two alcoholic parents,\u201d and he has \u201cbeen on the street since age 13.\u201d He has had \u201ca variety of hospitalizations and incarcerations.\u201d Marget felt that \u201coftentimes [Hoke] tried to reach out for help and looked for assistance within the system,\u201d but until she and Moore counseled him, nothing \u201creally [came] through for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Wiley, the jail chaplain, visited with Hoke on a daily basis for about nine months. Wiley dealt with Hoke \u201cnot only [on] a spiritual level but [on] a social and educational level\u201d as well. Hoke attended church, Bible classes, and other religious programs at the jail. Wiley believed Hoke was remorseful.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Rimmer is the current jail chaplain. He testified that Hoke was participating in a correspondence course.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Hoke testified that his father \u201cdrank a lot.\u201d When his father was drinking, he \u201cused to take it out\u201d on Hoke and Hoke\u2019s siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Hoke began using drugs when he was about 12 years old. He started with marijuana and progressed to heroin and cocaine. He became involved in trafficking narcotics. He travelled around the country, settling at times in Florida and California. In June 1985, Hoke returned to Hagerstown, Maryland. In September 1985, he was in Richmond, then \u201cup in D.C.\u201d He was \u201cjust partying\u201d and \u201c[j]ust drifting around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Hoke has been in nine or ten mental hospitals. Once he was admitted for attempted suicide \u2014 at other times for drug abuse.

On the same day that he was released, he was readmitted to Central State for \u201ca drug overdose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Hoke said he turned himself in for Stell\u2019s murder because he was tired of the life he had, \u201cthe running, the drugs, just going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>through, my whole life like ... a high-speed train.\u201d He stated that the counseling he received in jail had helped him deal with the problems he has \u201chad with suicide and drug abuse.\u201d He testified that he felt \u201cvery sorry\u201d for what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\n<em>Jury Instruction Number 5</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AKk\">Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(D) provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The verdict of the jury shall be in writing, and in one of the following forms:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">(1) \u201cWe, the jury, on the issue joined, having found the defendant guilty of (here set out the statutory language of the offense charged) and that (after consideration of his prior history that there is a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society) or his conduct in committing the offense is outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved (torture) (depravity of mind) (aggravated battery to the victim), and having considered the evidence in mitigation of the offense, unanimously fix his punishment at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Signed.................................foreman\u201d or</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">(2) \u201cWe, the jury, on the issue joined, having found the defendant guilty of (here set out statutory language of the offense charged) and having considered all of the evidence in aggravation and mitigation of such offense, fix his punishment at imprisonment for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Signed.................................foreman\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">The trial court, without objection, granted Instruction Number 5 which set forth the verdict form specified by Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By its verdict, the jury adopted the language contained in part (1) of the statutory forms and fixed Hoke\u2019s punishment at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Hoke contends on appeal that Instruction Number 5 \u201cwas ambiguous and vague and therefore violated [his] constitutional rights to a unanimous verdict.\u201d He argues that the instruction \u201cdoes not delineate\u201d between the future dangerousness and the vileness predicates, although Hoke concedes that \u201cthe death sentence was certainly unanimous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">We rejected a similar contention in <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 226 </em>Va. 31, 307 S.E.2d 864 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1109 (1984). In <em>Coleman, </em>as in the present case, \u201cthe trial court, without objection, gave the jury an instruction stating the verdict form specified in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4D.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53, 307 S.E.2d at 876. The jury returned a verdict \u201cin the exact language of the verdict form, fixing Coleman\u2019s punishment at death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that \u201c[i]t [was] readily apparent that the jury based its sentencing verdict on both statutory alternatives.\u201d <em>Id. Accord Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 201, 213, 257 S.E.2d 784, 791-92 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1049 (1980) (trial court did not err \u201cin following the language of [Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(D)] in instructing the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In the present case, the jury\u2019s verdict, employing the statutory language, found both the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d and the \u201cvileness\u201d predicates in fixing the death sentence. The trial court \u201cpolled\u201d the jury, and each juror affirmed that this was his or her verdict. Clearly, therefore, the jury based the sentence of death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>upon both predicates, <em>i.e., </em>findings that \u201cthere is a probability that [Hoke] would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society\u201d and Hoke\u2019s \u201cconduct in committing the offense is outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence to Establish \u201cVileness\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">A jury may recommend imposition of the death penalty if it finds from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused\u2019s \u201cconduct in committing the offense . . . was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or an aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 (the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate). In the present case, the jury made such a finding. Hoke, however, contends that the evidence does not support the jury\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">We will not repeat the facts in great detail. We only need allude to them. Stell was raped and sodomized. She was bound at her wrists and ankles so snugly that she could not have freed herself. A gag was placed tightly over her mouth. Hoke plunged a knife into her back, and muffled Stell\u2019s screams with a pillow. He then stabbed Stell in her stomach a depth of six-and-one-half inches. As Stell continued to scream, Hoke held the pillow over her face for four to five minutes until Stell died.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Hoke\u2019s conduct falls squarely within this Court\u2019s construction of the vileness predicate. Hoke subjected Stell to torture prior to and following the infliction of her fatal wounds. The battery to her body qualitatively and quantitatively exceeded the minimum necessary to accomplish an act of murder. <em>See Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 478, 248 S.E.2d 135, 149 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979). Clearly, it constituted an \u201caggravated\u201d battery. Moreover, Hoke\u2019s conduct reveals a depraved mind. Indeed, Hoke said that he had thought about killing someone for a long time. Thus, we hold that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of vileness.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence to Establish \u201cFuture Dangerousness\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Hoke contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that \u201cthere is a probability that [Hoke] would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society\u201d \u2014 the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate for the imposition of the death penalty. The jury based its finding on a \u201cconsideration of [Hoke\u2019s] past criminal record of convictions,\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2, his \u201cprior history,\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C), and \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense of which [Hoke] is accused,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">As previously stated, Hoke had prior convictions of, <em>inter alia, </em>assault, attempted arson, carrying a concealed weapon, resisting arrest, and burglary. In addition, Hoke\u2019s \u201cprior history,\u201d objectively and by his own admission, suggests a life of increasingly violent crime. He stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had done \u201ca little bit of everything. Assaults, jumped people, beat them with things just to collect money together for a dope deal or something.\u201d Admittedly, Hoke \u201cwas at one time\u201d addicted to drugs, including heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Moreover, the brutality of the crime itself cannot, and should not, be ignored in assessing Hoke\u2019s future dangerousness. We previously have discussed this in some detail. Suffice it to say, Hoke\u2019s conduct during the commission of the present offense suggests a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">We hold, therefore, that the evidence is sufficient to support the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">SENTENCE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1 provides that \u201c[i]n addition to consideration of any errors in the trial enumerated by appeal,\u201d we must make an independent review of the death sentence on the record. The statute requires us to consider and determine: \u201c1. Whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor; and 2. Whether the sentence ... is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Hoke does not claim that the sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. Nonetheless, pursuant to the statute\u2019s mandate, we have reviewed the record to determine whether any such factors are present. We find nothing from the review to suggest that Hoke\u2019s death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Hoke contends that the death sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. He principally argues that the evidence is insufficient to support the findings of the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d and \u201cvileness\u201d predicates for the imposition of the sentence. We previously have rejected this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In our independent review of the record to determine whether the sentence is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,\u201d our inquiry is whether \u201cjuries in this jurisdiction generally approve the supreme penalty for comparable or similar crimes.\u201d <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 284, 257 S.E.2d 808, 824 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980). Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.1(E), we have accumulated the records of all capital murder cases appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Having considered these records, we determine that Hoke\u2019s sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate. <em>See, e.g., Stout </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. 126, 376 S.E.2d 288 (1989) (capital murder in the commission of robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Gray, </em>233 Va. 313, 356 S.E.2d 157 (capital murder in the commission of robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Pruett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 266, 351 S.E.2d 1 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>482 U.S. 931, 107 S.Ct. 3220 (1987) (capital murder in the commission of rape and robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Edmonds, 229 </em>Va. 303, 329 S.E.2d 807 (capital murder in the commission of robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 229 </em>Va. 469, 331 S.E.2d 422 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986) (capital murder in the commission of robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Clozza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 124, 321 S.E.2d 273 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1230 (1985) (capital murder in the commission of rape, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Coleman, </em>226 Va. 31, 307 S.E.2d 864 (capital murder in the commission of rape, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Quintana </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 295 S.E.2d 643 (1982), <em>cert. de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>nied, </em>460 U.S. 1029 (1983) (capital murder in the commission of robbery, both future dangerousness and vileness found); <em>Clanton </em>v.
