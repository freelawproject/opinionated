The chancellor heard the evidence <em>ore tenus,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">From 1977 until 1983, the City of Norfolk had employed Nathan E. Vaden, Jr., as a police officer. Vaden resigned in good standing in 1983 and worked for a year with Greyhound Bus Lines. In February 1984, the City reinstated Vaden on a probationary basis. On November 24, 1984, the police cruiser Vaden was driving ran off the surface of Interstate 64, struck the guard rail in the median strip, and slid along the rail a distance of 570 feet. Using his radio transmitter, Vaden reported that a Colt automobile had swerved into his lane of travel and forced him off the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Three of Vaden\u2019s superior officers arrived on the scene, and Vaden repeated what he had reported in the broadcast. He explained that he had not pursued the Colt because he thought police policy required him to remain at the scene of the accident. He could recall only the first three letters of the license plate on the Colt. Based upon Vaden\u2019s account of the accident, one of the officers prepared and filed a report that characterized the event as a hit-and-run accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Because the other two officers did not believe Vaden\u2019s story, the deputy chief of police ordered one of the officers, Corporal Steven Taylor, to conduct a second investigation. In his report, Taylor concluded that, considering the absence of skid marks on the road and the lack of heavy damage to the vehicle, \u201cit appears [the car] drifted over, slid down the guard rail for some distance, then was corrected back into the traffic lane,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">Lt. Earl W. Hanna, the division executive officer, confronted Vaden with Taylor\u2019s report. According to Vaden, Hanna told him that he must either resign or be terminated, that they \u201cwould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>bring [him] up on charges for making a false report\u201d if he did not resign, and that \u201cif [he] would resign that they would give [him] a good recommendation when [he] went to another police department\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Hanna testified that he told Vaden that he would be required to take a polygraph test if he persisted in his account of the accident and that, if he failed the test, he would be terminated. Hanna said that \u201cinitially he denied it was a false report and within just a few minutes he said he took too much medication and dozed off.\u201d Hanna escorted Vaden into the office of Major O. C. Scellato, commanding officer of the division, where Vaden \u201cadmitted to the same thing\u201d. Scellato confirmed that Vaden had told him that he \u201cwas under medication and he had fell [sic] asleep and had the accident\u201d and that Vaden admitted further that \u201cno one forced [him] off the road\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Vaden surrendered his police badge and weapon and submitted his resignation. The report based upon Vaden\u2019s original account of the accident was removed from departmental files and replaced by a newly-prepared report based upon his admissions to Hanna and Scellato. Several months later, Vaden applied for employment with the Virginia Beach Police Department. The officer who investigated his application reviewed Vaden\u2019s personnel file, and Vaden submitted to a polygraph test. A Virginia Beach personnel selection board rejected Vaden\u2019s application. Its reasons, reduced to writing, included \u201c[deception on the polygraph\u201d; \u201cproblems handling stress\u201d; \u201c[l]ow score on . . . physical agility test\u201d; and \u201cpoor employer recommendation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Vaden filed a bill of complaint against the City of Norfolk and city manager, Julian Hirst (collectively, the City), asking the court to \u201creinstate complainant with back pay and benefits\u201d, to \u201cdirect the defendants to afford complainant a fair and impartial hearing\u201d, and to \u201corder all false and derogatory information . . . removed from his personnel file\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">In support of his prayer, Vaden alleged that his resignation was \u201cinvoluntary and the result of duress\u201d; that the City had \u201cplaced derogatory and false information in the complainant\u2019s official personnel file\u201d and \u201cdisseminated [it] to complainant\u2019s prospective employer\u201d; that the City\u2019s action \u201cimpairs complainant\u2019s liberty and property interests in that it affects complainant\u2019s good name, reputation, honor and integrity\u201d; that \u201ca stigma attached to his reputation which has impaired his job opportunities\u201d; that \u201ccom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>plainant has been denied due process, in that at no time has he been given an opportunity to be heard in the matter\u201d; and that \u201cdenial of a hearing constitutes an infringement of his liberty and property interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">In a letter opinion, the chancellor ruled that Vaden was entitled to relief but to only part of the relief \u201cprayed for in his suit\u201d. In a decree entered April 10, 1986 referencing his opinion letter, the chancellor ordered that the reports based upon Vaden\u2019s admissions to Hanna and Scellato and certain other adverse documents \u201cbe removed from the files . . . and destroyed and the originals substituted therefor in the files\u201d. On June 24, 1986, the chancellor entered another decree which suspended, pending appeal, \u201cthat part of the Court\u2019s April 10, 1986 decree requiring destruction of certain documents\u201d. The suspension was made \u201cupon the condition that the defendants remove from the plaintifTs personnel file . . . [seven specifically] described documents and transmit them to the Court, to be sealed and made a part of the record on appeal\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The City assigns several errors. One is dispositive of this appeal. The City maintains that the trial court erred \u201cwhen it decided the merits of this case upon a theory not pleaded in the bill of complaint, thereby rendering its judgment void.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The thrust of Vaden\u2019s allegations in his bill of complaint was that the City had coerced his resignation by threats and promises, and that the City had broken its promises and disseminated false information that stigmatized his reputation and damaged his prospects for employment. His prayer for equitable relief was based upon the theory that the City had impaired his liberty and property interests and, thus, had deprived him of due process of law. Vaden\u2019s counsel reaffirmed that theory in his opening statement. Citing the decision in <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564 (1972), counsel asserted that \u201c[t]his case was brought under the 14th Amendment . . . which protects liberty and property interests.\u201d In response to a question from the bench at trial, counsel replied, \u201cYour Honor, what we are arguing is a case of constitutional rights.\u201d Again, in closing argument he said, \u201cThe Court\u2019s role is to determine whether [Vaden\u2019s] liberty interests through the 14th and 5th Amendments have been infringed upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The chancellor made no mention in his letter opinion of Vaden\u2019s theory of tortious deprivation of constitutionally protected inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ests. Instead, he rested his ruling in the final decree upon his finding in the letter opinion that the City\u2019s promises and Vaden\u2019s resignation constituted \u201can agreement or contract between the City and Vaden and that contract has been breached to the detriment of Vaden.\u201d On brief, Vaden acknowledges that the due process issue \u201cwas not decided by the Trial Court\u201d but that \u201c[i]nstead the Trial Court . . . concluded that it would enforce the agreement the parties had entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Nothing in the bill of complaint states a cause of action for breach of contract or prays for specific performance of a contract. \u201cThe function of pleading is to inform the opposing party of the nature of the case to be made against him. That purpose would be defeated if it were permissible to allege one case and prove another.\u201d <em>Bolling </em>v. <em>Acceptance Corporation, </em>204 Va. 4, 9, 129 S.E.2d 54, 58 (1963). If the rule were otherwise, \u201cthe pleadings, instead of being a shield to protect the parties from surprise, would be a snare to entrap them.\u201d <em>Wren </em>v. <em>Moncure, </em>95 Va. 369, 375, 28 S.E. 588, 590 (1897).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">No court can base its decree upon facts not alleged, nor render its judgment upon a right, however meritorious, which has not been pleaded and claimed. Pleadings are as essential as proof, the one being unavailing without the other. A decree cannot be entered in the absence of pleadings upon which to found the same, and if so entered it is void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\"><em>Potts </em>v. <em>Matheison Alkali Works, </em>165 Va. 196, 207, 181 S.E. 521, 525 (1935) (citations omitted); <em>accord Ted Lansing Supply </em>v. <em>Royal Alum., </em>221 Va. 1139, 1141-42, 277 S.E.2d 228, 229-30 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">We hold that the judgment entered below is void. We will reverse the decree and remand the cause to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the bill of complaint with prejudice and to release the records sealed by the chancellor and return them to the City for filing in the manner prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
