The indictment presented that on 5 October 1975 they \u201cwilfully and of deliberately premeditatedly malice aforethought\u201d murdered (1st count) and conspired to murder (2nd count) Randolph Alexander Williamson, Jr. (Joyce Marcine Williamson\u2019s husband). The 3rd count of the indictment charged the common law offense of solicitation to commit a felony, alleging that Mrs. Williamson and Boone solicited Merrick to murder Mr. Williamson. The accused were separately tried in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On 15 March 1976, Merrick, whose case is before us on this appeal, was found guilty by a jury as to the 1st and 2nd counts. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life on each conviction, the sentences to run concurrently. He noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, failed to transmit the record in the time required, and was granted a belated appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>under post conviction procedures. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments. <em>Merrick v. State, </em>No. 1095, September Term, 1976, decided 28 July 1977, unreported. We granted a writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Merrick was arrested on 6 October 1975 on the authority of a warrant issued the day before by a judicial commissioner of the District Court of Maryland upon the sworn application of Officer James V. McConville of the Baltimore County Police Department. The warrant alleged that Merrick unlawfully conspired with Mrs. Williamson on 5 October 1975 \u201cto kill and slay\u201d Mr. Williamson. We quote in full, with only minor editing, the \u201c[cjoncise statement of facts showing that there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that [Merrick] has committed it,\u201d set out by McConville in his application for the arrest warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-7\">\u201c[Merrick] did conspire [with] Joyce Marcine Williamson to murder and possibly did complete the said conspiracy by murdering Randolph Alexander Williamson, Jr. Nelson Leroy Boone has given information that he received from Joyce Marcine Williamson certain monies in Baltimore County, Md. and paid same to Lawrence Maurice Merrick for the purpose of having him murder Randolph Alexander Williamson, Jr. Further that within the last month Lawrence Maurice Merrick has called coconspirator Joyce Marcine Williamson at her home in Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>County. Further that on October 4, 1975 Lawrence Maurice Merrick was aware and told Nelson Leroy Boone that he (Lawrence Maurice Merrick) knew where Randolph Alexander Williamson, Jr. would be in the early morning hours of October 5, 1975. Nelson Leroy Boone gave information that approx, one (1) hour before the body of Randolph Alexander Williamson, Jr. was found dead, Lawrence Maurice Merrick called Williamson\u2019s home in Baltimore County. Nelson Leroy Boone also was told by Joyce Marcine Williamson that she had spoken to Lawrence Maurice Merrick about this murder during the month of September, 1975.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons ... against unreasonable ... seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing ... the persons ... to be seized.\u201d U. S. Const. amend. IV, applicable to the States through the fourteenth amendment, <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684 (1961).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An affidavit for a warrant may be based on hearsay information and need not reflect the direct personal observations of the affiant. <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 268-271, 80 S. Ct. 725 (1960). However, in such circumstances, as is the case here, a warrant may be properly issued only if the issuing official, in discharging his duty as \u201ca neutral and detached\u201d person to make an independent assessment of probable cause, <em>Giordenello v. United States, </em>357 U. S. 480, 486, 78 S. Ct. 1245 (1958), concludes that,(a) the knowledge attributed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>informant, if true, would be sufficient to establish probable cause; (b) the affiant is likely relating truthfully what the informant said; and (c) it is reasonably likely that the informant\u2019s description of criminal behavior accurately reflects reality. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>403 U. S. 573, 587, 91 S. Ct. 2075 (1971) (Harlan, J. dissenting). In the case before us, it is not suggested that the commissioner\u2019s judgment as to elements (a) and (b) was not properly supported. We are concerned only with the final component, (c), of the probable cause equation. This element, that it appears reasonably likely that the informant\u2019s claim that criminal conduct has occurred or is occurring is probably accurate, is satisfied only if there is reason to believe both that the informant is a truthful person generally and that he has based his particular conclusions in the matter at hand on reliable data. <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U. S. 410, 413-417, 89 S. Ct. 584 (1969); <em>Aguilar v. State of Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108, 114-115, 84 S. Ct. 1509 (1964). Thus, the affidavit must set forth facts which enable the issuing official to judge for himself both (1) the probable credibility of the informant (the \u201cveracity\u201d prong of <em>Aguilar) </em>and (2) the reliability of his information (the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong of <em>Aguilar.) Aguilar </em>at 114. Merrick does not claim that the affidavit did not satisfy the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong. His only concern is with the \u201cveracity\u201d prong. The agreed statement of facts included in Merrick\u2019s brief, pursuant to Maryland Rule 828 g, asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-5\">\u201c[Merrick] contended at trial and in the Court of Special Appeals that his arrest was illegal because the arrest warrant was defective, and that statements he made following his arrest must be suppressed under the principles announced in <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U. S. 590, [95 S. Ct. 2254] (1975). The warrant was challenged on the basis that facts alleged as probable cause in the application for the warrant had been received from a named informant whose veracity had not been established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The affiant here provided no information in addition to that obtained from the informant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statements of the informant, Boone, were against his penal interest, for he thereby admitted major elements of criminal offenses. Thus, the question for decision is a narrow one: is the probable credibility of an identified informant sufficiently shown on the sole basis that his statements establishing probable cause are declarations against penal interest? <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the declaration against penal interest contained in the application for the arrest warrant here satisfied the \u201cveracity\u201d prong of <em>Aguilar. </em>It reached this determination on the basis of <em>United States v. Harris, supra, </em>in which Mr. Chief Justice Burger in an opinion announcing the judgment of the Court upholding the validity of a search and seizure warrant, declared, after observing that statements in the application for the warrant were against an unnamed informant\u2019s penal interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">\u201cAdmissions of crime, like admissions against proprietary interests, carry their own indicia of credibility \u2014 sufficient at least to support a finding of probable cause....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">This conclusion, contained in Part III of the opinion, was not shared by a majority of the Court. The Chief Justice was joined only by Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice White and Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Justice Blackmun on the point. Mr. Justice Harlan, with whom Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall joined, expressly disagreed in a dissenting opinion. Thus, although there was a majority of five joining in the judgment, there was only a plurality of four in agreement with the opinion delivering the judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The lack of an agreement by a majority of the Court on the principles of law involved prevents the opinion from being an authoritative determination for other cases. <em>United States v. </em>Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 216, 62 S. Ct. 552 (1942). <em>See </em>Annot., 65 A.L.R. 3d 504 (1975). Its findings, conclusions and views are not constitutionally the \u201cSupreme Law\u201d of Maryland, nor are the \u201cJudges of this State, and all the People of this State ... bound thereby.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In other words, the conclusion regarding statements against penal interest expressed by the four justices in the Burger opinion is not controlling in this State; it is no more binding than is the contrary conclusion reached by the four justices in the Harlan dissenting opinion. Therefore, we may look at the Burger opinion and the Harlan opinion on the question of statements in applications for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>warrants which are against the penal interest of the declarant only in the frame of reference of the persuasiveness of the respective reasons advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">It was found in Part III of the Burger opinion that the declaration against penal interest was an additional reason for crediting the informant\u2019s tip, \u201c[q]uite apart from the affiant\u2019s own knowledge of [Harris\u2019s] activities.\u201d <em>Harris </em>at 583:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">\u201cCommon sense in the important daily affairs of life would induce a prudent and disinterested observer to credit these statements. People do not lightly admit a crime and place critical evidence in the hands of the police in the form of their own admissions. Admissions of crime, like admissions against proprietary interests, carry their own indicia of credibility \u2014 sufficient at least to support a finding of probable cause to search.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 583.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Various arguments to the contrary were anticipated in the opinion. \u201c[T]he residual risk and opprobrium of having admitted criminal conduct\u201d is not eliminated because \u201cthe informant may be paid or promised a \u2018break\u2019.\u201d It is immaterial that the informant's out-of-court declarations may not be admissible at the accused\u2019s trial under <em>Donnelly v. United States, </em>228 U. S. 243, 33 S. Ct. 449 (1913), or under <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U. S. 123, 88 S. Ct. 1620 (1968). The opinion expressed the belief that \u201c[w]hether or not <em>Donnelly </em>is to survive as a rule of evidence in federal trials, it should not be extended to warrant proceedings to prevent magistrates from crediting, in all circumstances, statements of a declarant containing admissions of criminal conduct.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 583-584. \u201c[T]he issue in warrant proceedings is not guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but probable cause for believing the occurrence of a crime____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584. <em>Bruton </em>was patently distinguishable as \u201cthat case rested on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment which seems inapposite to <em>ex parte </em>search warrant proceedings under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Further, it would \u201cnot do to say that warrants may not issue on uncorroborated hearsay. This only avoids the issue of whether there is reason for crediting the out-of-court statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584. \u201cNor,\u201d the Burger opinion stated, \u201cis it especially significant that neither the name nor the person of the informant was produced before the magistrate. The police themselves almost certainly knew his name, the truth of the affidavit is not in issue, and <em>McCray v. Illinois, </em>386 U. S. 300, 87 S. Ct. 1056, 18 L.Ed.2d 62 (1967), disposed of the claim that the informant must be produced whenever the defendant so demands.\u201d <em>Harris </em>at 584-585.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Mr. Justice Harlan thought that the rationale that the magistrate might prQperly have credited the informant\u2019s assertions on the ground that they confessed to the commission of a crime should not have been advanced because of the government\u2019s failure even to suggest it. So he would not decide the question in the case before the Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Had the argument been pressed upon the Court, however, he would have found it difficult to accept. He was inclined to the view \u201cthat magistrates may not properly predicate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>determination that an unnamed confidant is credible upon the bare fact that by giving information he also confessed to having committed a crime.\u201d <em>Harris </em>at 595 (Harlan, J. dissenting). He justified that inclination with three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The first reason touched on the rules of evidence. Mr. Justice Harlan recognized that \u201cstrict rules of evidence certainly do not govern magistrates\u2019 assessments of probable cause,\u201d but, he thought, \u201cit would require a rather extensive relaxation of them to permit reliance on this factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594. \u201cAnd these rules,\u201d he observed, \u201ccannot be completely relaxed, of course, since the basic thrust of <em>Spinelli, [supra], Aguilar, [supra], Nathanson [v. United States, </em>290 U. S. 41. 54 S. Ct. 11 (1933)], <em>Whiteley [v. Warden, </em>401 U. S. 560, 91 S. Ct. 1031 (1971)], and <em>Giordenello, supra, </em>is to prohibit the issuance of warrants upon mere uncorroborated hearsay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594. Mr. Justice Harlan found that the analogy to the hearsay exception was quite tenuous, and cited <em>Donnelly, supra, </em>as holding that declarations against penal interest do not fall within this exception. \u201cMoreover, because it has been thought that such statements should be relied upon by factfinders only when necessity justifies it, the rule universally requires a showing that the declarant cannot be produced personally before the trier of fact, C. McCormick, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 253, 257 (1954), an element not shown to be present here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594. Also, the Court had not found any instance of the application of the rule when the witness declined to reveal to the trier of fact the identity of the declarant, \u201cpresumably because without this knowledge it cannot be readily assumed that the declarant might have had reason to suspect the use of the statement would do him harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The second reason was Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s disagreement with the rationale for this exception to the hearsay rule, that the fact that the declaration was against the speaker\u2019s self-interest tends to indicate that its substance is accurate. He cited 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1457 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">\u201cBut where the declarant is also a police informant it seems at least as plausible to assume, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>further enlightenment either as to the Government\u2019s genera] practice or as to the particular facts of this case, that the declarant-confidant at least believed he would receive absolution from prosecution for his confessed crime in return for his statement.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 595.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The third reason went to the effect of adopting such rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">\u201cThirdly, the effect of adopting such a rule would be to encourage the Government to prefer as informants participants in criminal enterprises rather than ordinary citizens, a goal the Government specifically eschews in its brief in this case upon the explicit premise that such persons are often less reliable than those who obey the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">For discussions of the <em>Harris </em>opinions, <em>see </em>W. Ringel, Searches and Seizures, Arrests and Confessions \u00a7\u00a7 335.01 and 337.01 (1972 and Cum. Supp. 1977); Rebell, <em>The Undisclosed In formant and the Fourth Amendment: A Search for Meaningful Standards, </em>81 Yale L. J. 703 (1972); <em>The Supreme Court, 1970 Term, </em>85 Harv. L.

The State urges us to adopt, as the Court of Special Appeals did, the rationale of the Burger opinion that admissions of crime by informants, named or unnamed, carry their own indicia of credibility, sufficient at least to support a finding of probable cause to arrest or search and seize, <em>Harris </em>at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The issue whether declarations against penal interest are sufficient to satisfy the informant credibility aspect of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>has not been squarely addressed heretofore by this Court. But we have not rejected the general concept that such declarations may provide support for probable cause to arrest. In <em>Mefford and Blackburn v. State, </em>235 Md. 497, 511, 201 A. 2d 824 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U. S. 937 (1965) we held that Blackburn\u2019s arrest was legal. We said that after Mefford had confessed to a police officer to having committed murder and had given his confession support by turning over the murder weapon, the officer from these facts and his prior knowledge of the case had probable cause to believe that Blackburn was Mefford\u2019s confederate, as Mefford claimed, and had the right to arrest Blackburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Cuffia v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 521, 287 A. 2d 319, <em>cert. denied, </em>265 Md. 736 (1972), in discussing probable cause to arrest, observed that the informant made a statement against his penal interest, and simply referred to Harris \u201cfor the effect of an informant\u2019s statement against penal interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523. <em>See Stanley v. State, </em>19 Md. App. 507, 521, n. 8, 313 A. 2d 847, <em>cert. denied, </em>271 Md. 745 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Cases in other jurisdictions are divided concerning the sufficiency of declarations against penal interest to establish credibility of an informant as to probable cause for the issuance of a warrant. We list them according to their holdings, and, as to each, designate whether the informant was identified in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The following cases hold specifically that a declaration against penal interest is sufficient of itself to establish an informant\u2019s credibility: <em>Armour v.

App. 153, 561 P. 2d 701 (1977), it is not clear whether the informant was identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">In the great majority of the cases we have above cited, whether or not the informant was identified in the affidavit was not expressly discussed with respect to the issue of his credibility. And, as we have seen, the Burger opinion in <em>Harris </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>did not find it \u201cespecially significant that neither the name nor the person of the informant was produced before the magistrate,\u201d because \u201c[t]he police themselves almost certainly knew his name,\u201d and it is not necessary that \u201cthe informant must be produced whenever the defendant so demands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>403 U. S. at 584-585. On the other hand, there is some slight authority for the view that unless the informant is identified, there is no true declaration against penal interest. <em>See State v. Mabrey, supra; Commonwealth v. Falk, </em>221 Pa. Super. 43, 290 A. 2d 125 (1972). And on the authority of <em>Donnelly v. United States, supra, </em>it was stated in the Harlan dissent in <em>Harris </em>that the federal rule is that declarations against penal interest do not fall within the hearsay exception. There followed the observation that \u201cwe have not found any instance of the application of this rule where the witness declined to reveal to the trier of fact the identity of the declarant, presumably because without this knowledge it cannot be readily assumed that the declarant might have reason to suspect the use of his statement would do him harm.\u201d 403 U. S. at 594. <em>See, </em>however, Fed.R.Evid. 804 (b) (3). <em>But see </em>the cases cited <em>supra, </em>in which a declaration against penal interest by an <em>unidentified informant </em>was considered with respect to the credibility of the informant in that component of the probable cause equation which requires that it is reasonably likely that the informant\u2019s description of criminal behavior reasonably reflects reality. There are also cases which distinguish between the probative value of the statement against penal interest of an informant who is identified and an informant who is unidentified, giving more weight to the declaration of the identified informant. <em>See United States v. Spach, supra; United States v. Principe, supra; People v. Werber, supra; People v. Trontell, supra; Wilson v. State, supra; Commonwealth v. Fleurant, supra; Gentry v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-2\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Upon analysis of <em>Harris </em>and the cases in other jurisdictions, we find the prevailing view to be that declarations by an informant against his penal interest may be considered in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>determination of the informant\u2019s credibility. We adopt that view. <em>See Abercrombie v. State, </em>528 S.W.2d 578, 584 (Tex. Cr. App.1974) (opinion in State\u2019s motion for rehearing). Given this, we conclude that the probable credibility of the informant here was sufficiently shown on the sole basis of his statements against his penal interest. We' reach this conclusion in light of his identification in the affidavit and the nature of his declaration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We think that the identification in the affidavit of the informant here is significant in assessing his credibility. We have said that the strictures of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>are aimed primarily at unnamed police informers. <em>Mobley and King v. State, </em>270 Md. 76, 85, 310 A. 2d 803, (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U. S. 975 (1974).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">\u201c \u2018The practical distinction is that in dealing with a named source, the very naming of the source and the relationship of the source to the observed information may go a long way (or even be sufficient unto itself), under the facts of a particular case, to establish the credibility of that source or the reliability of his information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Andresen v. State, </em>24 Md. App. 128, 176, 331 A. 2d 78, <em>cert. denied, </em>274 Md. 725 (1975), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>427 U. S. 463, 96 S. Ct. 2737 (1976) (quoting <em>Dawson v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 694, 699, 276 A. 2d 680, <em>cert. denied, </em>263 Md. 711, 712 (1971)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">In the majority of those cases in other jurisdictions in which a declaration against penal interest was found to be sufficient of itself or with other factors to show the credibility of the informant, the informant was identified, indicative of the probative value usually given to his identification. Of course, the informant here was not one of that broad class of secondary sources of police information such as victims of crime, disinterested witnesses of crime or other disinterested civilians who are generally, but not universally, named. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>there is no indication that he was a paid police informer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further, his indictment, prosecution, conviction and sentence, see note 1 <em>supra, </em>show that immunity was not involved and indicate that he had not been promised \u201ca break\u201d for the information he supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">We believe that the informant\u2019s credence was buttressed by the seriousness of the crimes he admitted and the extent of his participation. \u201cPeople do not lightly admit a crime and place critical evidence in the hands of the police in the form of their own admissions.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>403 U. S. at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Our conclusion is in line with the Burger opinion in <em>Harris. </em>The assertion that \u201c[c]ommon sense in the important daily affairs of life would induce a prudent and disinterested observer to credit these statements [by an informant against his penal interest],\u201d and the observation that \u201c[p]eople do not lightly admit a crime and place critical evidence in the hands of the police in the form of their own admissions,\u201d are followed by the flat statement: \u201cAdmissions of crime ... carry their own indicia of credibility \u2014 sufficient at least to support a finding of probable cause to search.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>403 U. S. at 583. This is so, the Burger opinion explains, even though the informant may be paid or promised a \u201cbreak\u201d because \u201cthe residual risk and opprobrium of having admitted criminal conduct\u201d is not eliminated thereby. <em>Id. </em>at 583-584.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>We do not believe that our conclusion is, in substance, at odds with the Harlan dissent in Harris.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That opinion was written in terms of \u201can unnamed informant,\u201d Mr. Justice Harlan asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">\u201cIn short, I am inclined to the view, although I would not decide the question here, that magistrates may not properly predicate a determination than <em>an unnamed confidant </em>is credible upon the bare fact that by giving information he also confessed to having committed a crime.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>403 U. S. at 595 (Harlan, J. dissenting) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Finally, in evaluating the showing of probable cause necessary to support a warrant, we heed, as the Burger opinion declared would be well to do, \u201cthe sound admonition\u201d of <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102, 85 S. Ct. 741 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">\u201c '[T]he Fourth Amendment\u2019s commands, like all constitutional requirements, are practical and not abstract. If the teachings of the Court\u2019s cases are to be followed and the constitutional policy served, affidavits for search warrants, such as the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>involved here, must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a commonsense and realistic fashion. They are normally drafted by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation. Technical requirements of elaborate specificity once exacted under common law pleadings have no proper place in this area. A grudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts toward warrants will tend to discourage police officers from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris, </em>403 U. S. at 577 (quoting <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. at 108).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-6\"><em>\u201cAguilar </em>in no way departed from these sound principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The narrow question for decision, see <em>supra, </em>was within the frame of reference of the question presented in the petition for certiorari, iterated in Merrick\u2019s brief and agreed upon \u201cin substance\u201d by the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">\u201cDid the Court of Special Appeals err in upholding the trial Court\u2019s ruling that [Merrick\u2019s] arrest was not illegal and that a statement given by [Merrick] a short time after his arrest need not be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal arrest?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">We hold that the Court of Special Appeals did not err. As we have indicated, before us, the legality of Merrick\u2019s arrest was attacked only on the basis that the information establishing probable cause set out in the application for the arrest warrant was not sufficient because the veracity prong of <em>Aguilar </em>had not been satisfied as to the informant\u2019s credibility. We have found that the affidavit was sufficient to support a finding that the informant was credible. Therefore, the warrant was valid, and Merrick\u2019s arrest under its authority was legal. Inasmuch as his arrest was legal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>claim that the statement given by him should have been suppressed as a fruit of an illegal arrest evaporates.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b23-8\">.

Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102, 108, 85 S. Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 269, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960). The meaning of \u201csubstantial basis\u201d was explicated by the Supreme Court in <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U. S. at 114, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>elaborated upon in <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U. S. 410. These decisions laid down a bifurcated standard for determining the constitutional sufficiency of an affidavit based in whole or in part on the hearsay declarations of a police informant. Under this two-pronged test, an affiant must supply the commissioner with facts to show 1) the foundation for the informant\u2019s conclusion regarding a suspect's guilt of the crime charged; and 2) the basis for the officer\u2019s conclusion that the informant was credible or his information reliable. <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U. S. at 415; <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U. S. at 114; <em>Peterson v. State, </em>281 Md. 309, 313, 379 A. 2d 164 (1977); <em>State v. Edwards, </em>266 Md. 515, 519, 295 A. 2d 465 (1972). Since appellant concedes that the first element or \u201cbasis-of-knowledge\u201d prong was satisfied in the present appeal, the only issue before us concerns the second element or \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">An affidavit may meet the trustworthiness test in either of two ways. First it may contain information as to the individual declarant\u2019s credibility in the sense of his <em>personal </em>history of honesty and integrity or his <em>personal </em>reputation or character for veracity. In the present case, the declarant was a first-time informer. There was no evidence brought to the attention of the commissioner showing, for example, that Boone had given accurate information in the past or that he had some propensity for telling the truth as a result of moral or religious convictions. In short, on the record before us the commissioner could not have made a neutral and detached assessment of Boone\u2019s personal credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">But, as stated quite clearly in <em>Aguilar, </em>credibility is not the sole determinant of the trustworthiness of an informant\u2019s statement. In rare instances there may be circumstances surrounding the communication of an informant\u2019s declaration, which, when viewed from the perspective of common sense and practicality, render the statement inherently reliable, wholly apart from the character, reputation, history or background of the individual declarant. Thus, for example, a spontaneous statement of an uninvolved eyewitness or victim to a crime may be intrinsically reliable for purposes of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli, </em>even though nothing more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>is known of the informant himself than his name and address. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. State, </em>242 Md. 95, 100-101, 218 A. 2d 7 (1966); <em>King and Mobley v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 546, 555-57, 298 A. 2d 446, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>270 Md. 76, 310 A. 2d 803 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In my view, however, there was nothing so compelling about the circumstances underlying the communication of Boone\u2019s statement to Officer McConville as would imbue his bare utterance with a degree of reliability sufficient to support a finding of probable cause. The majority, embracing without critical comment the views expressed by Chief Justice Burger in Part III of his plurality opinion in <em>United States v. Harris, </em>403 U. S. 573, 583-85, 91 S. Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971), would apparently adopt a <em>per se </em>rule under which an identified informer would be deemed trustworthy for purposes of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>whenever he gives a statement which technically constitutes a declaration against penal interest, as that term has been defined in the law of evidence. C. McCormick, <em>Handbook of the Law of Evidence </em>\u00a7 278 (2d ed. 1972); 5 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1476-77 (3d ed. 1940). Since, by divulging appellant\u2019s involvement in the premeditated murder of Randolph Williamson, Boone admitted his own complicity in the crime, the majority concludes that his tip was inherently reliable, notwithstanding the fact that, save for Boone\u2019s identity, the commissioner had absolutely no basis for evaluating the informant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">I have no quarrel with the universally recognized view that a declaration against penal interest may be considered as a <em>factor </em>in establishing an informant\u2019s veracity under <em>Aguilar-Spinelli. E.g., United States v. Poulack, </em>556 F. 2d 83, 87 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U. S. 986, 98 S. Ct. 613 (1977); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>314 A. 2d 905, 907-908 (Del. 1973). And it may well be that such declarations could, in appropriate instances, constitute the exclusive predicate for a trustworthiness determination. But under no imaginable circumstances would I affirmatively label a statement as intrinsically reliable where, as here, the informant has, in the process of confessing his own participation in the criminal enterprise, attempted to place the blame on (or at least share the blame <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>with) a third party. In my opinion, statements of this nature are fraught with inherent untrustworthiness. The reasons for this are not difficult to divine. An informant who is himself under suspicion has powerful motives for seeking to inculpate a third party regardless of the truth or falsity of his information. As Mr. Justice Harlan cogently observed in his dissenting opinion in <em>United States v. Harris, </em>403 U. S. at 595, an informant may give false or distorted information to the police in hopes of obtaining leniency, absolution, or other concessions for himself. Especially is this likely where the tipster is subject to prosecution for serious offenses carrying the possibility of severe penal sanctions. Furthermore, an accused informant may see the implication of another as an effective means of avenging some past wrong or injustice and thus may incriminate the third party out of sheer spite. <em>See </em>4 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, <em>Evidence </em>\u00b6 804 (b) (3) [03], at p. 804-95 (1977); Comment, 62 Nw. U. L. Rev. 934 (1968); <em>but see United States v. Miley, </em>513 F. 2d 1191, 1204 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U. S. 842 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">By identifying the dangers widely associated with statements of the sort given by Boone in the present case, I do not, of course, mean to imply that all such declarations are unreliable in fact. My point is, rather, that sufficient doubt exists as to the overall trustworthiness of such communications that they ought not to be relied upon as the <em>exclusive </em>basis for establishing the veracity of an informant in the context of assessing whether there was adequate probable cause to justify the issuance of an arrest warrant grounded solely on a tipster\u2019s uncorroborated hearsay accusations. At a minimum, the Fourth Amendment demands that there be some additional extrinsic evidence of the informant\u2019s trustworthiness before the warrant will issue. A contrary result would, in my estimation, make a mockery of Aguilar-Spinelli\u2019s veracity requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Accordingly, I would hold that the affidavit submitted by Officer McConville in support of the arrest warrant chalenged in the instant appeal was constitutionally defective for lack of factual allegations sufficient to demonstrate the trustworthiness of the informant Boone. The judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>of the Court of Special Appeals should therefore have been reversed with instructions to remand to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Judge Eldridge authorizes me to state that he joins this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
