He was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of eight years and five years, respectively, to begin at the expiration of a sentence he was then serving. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments on direct appeal. <em>Bennett v. State, </em>No. 587, September Term, 1977, decided 27 December 1977, unreported. At trial, the judge in considering whether a State\u2019s witness was an accomplice should be submitted to the jury for determination,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> said: \u201cI think the law is that the burden is on the defendant to prove that a witness was an accomplice by a fair preponderance of affirmative evidence.\u201d He did not believe that Bennett had so met the burden with regard to a witness, Leonard Fritz, as to exclude the submission of the matter to the jury. In affirming the judgments, The Court of Special Appeals stated flatly: \u201cThe burden of showing that Fritz was an accomplice was on [Bennett].\u201d We granted Bennett\u2019s petition for the issuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>a writ of certiorari. The sole question presented was: \u201cDid the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that [Bennett] had the burden of proving that Leonard Fritz was an accomplice?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Whether the State\u2019s witness was an accomplice is significant because of the role an accomplice plays in a .criminal prosecution in Maryland. A conviction may not rest on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Brown v. State, </em>281 Md. 241, 243-245, 378 A. 2d 1104 (1977), and cases therein cited. We have heretofore expressed in certain terms our view regarding the burden of proving whether a witness was an accomplice. We said in <em>Lusby v. State, </em>217 Md. 191, 201, 141 A. 2d 893 (1958), quoting 7 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>(3d ed. 1940), \u00a7 2060 (e): \u201cAnd, of course, \u2018the burden of <em>proving </em>the witness to be an accomplice is ... upon the party alleging it [the defendant] for the purpose of invoking the rule.....\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Campbell v. State, </em>221 Md. 80, 84-85, 156 A. 2d 217 (1959), we declared, citing <em>Lusby </em>and <em>Wigmore: </em>\u201cIt is clear that the burden of proving a witness is an accomplice is on the defendant who asserts it.\u201d In <em>Strong v. State, </em>261 Md. 371, 376, 275 A. 2d 491 (1971), <em>vacated as to death sentence only, </em>408 U. S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2872 (1972), we baldly stated, on the authority of <em>Campbell: </em>\u201cThe burden of showing that a witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>is an accomplice is on the accused.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals said in <em>Burley v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 469, 473, 248 A. 2d 404 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>253 Md. 733 (1969), on the authority of <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Lusby, </em>that \u201cthe burden of proving that a witness is an accomplice is on the defendant who asserts it.\u201d It added: \u201cIn the absence of statutory provisions (there are none in Maryland) it is generally accepted that only a preponderance of the evidence is necessary to prove that a witness for the prosecution is an accomplice; it is not necessary to prove that fact beyond a reasonable doubt to invoke the rule requiring corroboration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473. This is in accord with 7 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>(Chadbourn rev. 1978). <em>Wigmore </em>states that when the question whether the witness is in truth an accomplice is left to the jury to determine, they are to apply the rule requiring corroboration only if they conclude that the witness is an accomplice. \u201cIf they are in doubt and unable to decide, the rule is not to be applied, but they need only believe by the preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2060 (e) (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See People v. Tewksbury, </em>15 Cal. 3d 953, 544 P. 2d 1335, 127 Cal. Rptr. 135, <em>appeal dismissed, cert. denied, </em>429 U. S. 805 (1976). The trial courts and the Court of Special Appeals have consistently recognized as the rule that the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a witness is an accomplice is on the defendant asserting it. They have applied it, and we have not repudiated it. <em>See, </em>in addition to <em>Burley, Early v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 182, 187, 282 A. 2d 154 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>264 Md. 747 (1972); <em>Sutton v. State, </em>10 Md.

We deem it to be the rule in this State.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Bennett contends that \u201cplacing on a defendant the burden of proving that a witness is an accomplice is a violation of due process.\u201d He looks to <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U. S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068 (1970) as applied in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U. S. 684, 95 S. Ct. 1881 (1975). He seeks support in <em>State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. 197, 362 A. 2d 629 (1976) and <em>State v. Grady, </em>276 Md. 178, 345 A. 2d 436 (1975). We find that in the light of <em>Patterson v. New York, </em>432 U. S. 197, 97 S. Ct. 2319 (1977), the cases he relies on do not lead to the conclusion he advocates.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In <em>Winship, </em>the Court declared that the \u201cDue Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d 397 U. S. at 364. In <em>Mullaney, </em>the Court announced that \u201cunder the Maine law of homicide, the burden could not constitutionally be placed on the defendant of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the killing had occurred in the heat of passion on sudden provocation.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>432 U. S. at 205. The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Evans v. State, </em>28 Md. App. 640, 654, 349 A. 2d 300 (1975) concluded that <em>Mullaney </em>\u201cdooms as unconstitutional any procedural device which 1) imposes upon a defendant a burden of proving, by any standard, his innocence as to any element of a crime or 2) relieves the State of its burden of ultimate persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt as to any issue fairly in the case.\u201d We granted certiorari to review the impact of <em>Mullaney </em>and <em>Winship </em>on the law of homicide in Maryland. We were in accord with the first conclusion of the Court of Special Appeals but rejected the broad sweep of the second. We went no further than to hold \u201cthat the principles of <em>Mullaney </em>cover the allocation of the burden of persuasi\u00f3n in homicide cases tried before a jury where ... the defenses of mitigation and self-defense were generated by the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. at 209.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>In <em>Grady </em>we determined that <em>Winship </em>and <em>Mullaney </em>\u201capply to the issue of who has the burden of proof and what that burden is when an accused relies on an alibi as a defense.\u201d 276 Md. at 182. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">\u201cIn sum, under the Federal Constitution, as well as the law of Maryland, the burden is on the State to prove all elements of the alleged crime and to do so beyond a reasonable doubt; hence, the defendant does not have to establish his alibi, not even by a minimal standard of proof.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The rationale of our holding in <em>Grady </em>is found in our acceptance \u201cas a succinct and accurate expression of the law of this State,\u201d 276 Md. at 184, of the words of Moylan, J. written for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Robinson v. State, </em>20 Md. App. 450, 316 A. 2d 268, <em>cert. denied, </em>272 Md. 747 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201cWe think the sound view to be that an alibi is not an affirmative defense, placing any burden upon a defendant beyond the self-evident one of attempting to erode the State\u2019s proof to a point where it no longer convinces the fact finder beyond a reasonable doubt. Proof of an alibi, like any other defense testimony, is simply a means of controverting the State\u2019s effort to establish criminal agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\"><em>Patterson </em>made clear that <em>Mullaney </em>went no further than to hold that \u201ca State must prove every ingredient of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, and that it may not shift the burden of proof to the defendant by presuming that ingredient upon proof of the other elements of the offense----Such shifting of the burden of persuasion with respect to a fact which the State deems so important that it must be either proved or presumed is impermissible under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Due Process Clause.\u201d 432 U. S. at 215.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In short, the <em>Winship-Mullaney </em>mandate is simply that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which an accused is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Both <em>Grady </em>and <em>State v. Evans </em>are in complete accord with this. In <em>Grady, </em>as we have indicated, we concluded that under the teachings of the Supreme Court \u201cthe burden is on the State to prove all elements of the alleged crime and to do so beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 276 Md. at 182. In <em>State v. Evans </em>we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\u201cOf course, nothing in <em>Mullaney^&amp;c </em>se precludes the use of traditional presumptions, or logical inferences arising from established facts; what <em>Mullaney </em>precludes is the use of such presumptions or inferences only when they operate, ultimately, to relieve the State of its burden of persuasion in a criminal case, <em>i.e., </em>its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt all the facts necessary to constitute the offense when the issue of their existence becomes an issue in the case. <em>State v. Hankerson, </em>288 N. C. 632, 220 S.E.2d 575 (1975).\u201d 278 Md. at 207.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The answer to the question presented to us is obvious. Proof by a defendant that a State\u2019s witness is an accomplice involves no shifting of the burden to him to disprove any fact essential to the offenses charged since whether or not the witness was an accomplice bears no direct relationship to any element of robbery with a deadly weapon or the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. That is, the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Fritz was an accomplice <em>vel non </em>was not a fact necessary to constitute the crimes with which Bennett was charged. It was not even an affirmative defense or an exculpatory or mitigating circumstance affecting the degree of culpability or the severity of punishment. Nothing was presumed or implied against Bennett. Whether Fritz was an accomplice went only to Fritz\u2019s credibility. If he were an accomplice, his credibility is so thought in this State to be in question as to require that the evidence adduced through his testimony be corroborated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We believe it to be fundamental that a party who seeks to attack the credibility of a witness has the burden of going forward. This is indicated by the general principle that a party ordinarily may not sustain the credibility of his own witness absent an attack upon credibility by the other side. <em>City of Baltimore v. Zell, </em>279 Md. 23, 27, 367 A. 2d 14 (1977), citing McCormick, <em>The Law of Evidence </em>\u00a7 49, p. 102 (2d ed. 1972); Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1104, 1122-1124 (Chadbourn rev. 1972); 98 C.J.S. <em>Witnesses </em>\u00a7\u00a7 471-472, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">As placing the burden on a defendant to prove that a witness against him is an accomplice has no constitutional proscriptions and is pursuant to the existing rule of this State, it necessarily follows that the Court of Special Appeals did not err in holding that Bennett had the burden of proving that the State\u2019s witness, Fritz, was an accomplice. The judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-12\">. .\u201c[Nlor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of <em>law____\" </em>U.S. Const., amend.

In construing art. 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States on the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution are practically direct authorities.

We steadfastly followed\u2019it over the years. <em>See </em>Watson v. State, 208 Md. 210, 117 A. 2d 549 (1955); Mulcahy v. State, 221 Md. 413, 158 A. 2d 80 (1960); Boggs v.

We had occasion to re-examine it in the face of a vigorous attack in Brown v. State, 281 Md. 241, 378 A. 2d 1104 (1977). We recognized that the federal courts and some thirty of our sister states follow the common law view that the testimony of an accomplice, although uncorroborated, was sufficient to warrant a conviction if it satisfied the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. <em>Id. </em>at 242. We adhered to our position, however, seeing \u201cas much need today, perhaps more so in view of the escalating prosecutorial trend freely to utilize accomplices as State witnesses, to retain the requirement that a person accused of crime not be convicted on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\">.
