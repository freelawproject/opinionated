Vu also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of a third motion to reopen. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) and review the denial of Vu\u2019s motions to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Siong v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 1030, 1036 (9th Cir.2004). The BIA commits an abuse of discretion when its denial of a motion to reopen is arbitrary, irrational or contrary to law. <em>Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2000). We grant Vu\u2019s first petition, deny the second and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-20\">Vu asserts that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his first motion to reopen because the Board erroneously disregarded substantial evidence of his attorneys\u2019 incompetence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Vu\u2019s first counsel presented an incomplete and grammatically incorrect asylum application, did not submit relevant country condition reports, withdrew corroborating evidence, did not elicit material facts relevant to Vu\u2019s claims for relief, did not object to the blatant translation errors that occurred during the immigration hearing, and did not object to the IJ subjecting Vu to a quiz to determine whether his knowledge of Catholicism matched her own. Vu\u2019s second attorney missed the deadline to file a timely notice of appeal with the BIA and forfeited Vu\u2019s ability to pursue cognizable and meritorious issues on appeal. We are persuaded that the representation provided by Vu\u2019s first two lawyers rose to the level of ineffective assistance because their mistakes \u201cprevented [Vu] from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 993, 997 (9th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The BIA denied Vu\u2019s first motion to reopen because it concluded that Vu did not suffer prejudice as a result of his lawyers\u2019 incompetence. That ruling was an abuse of discretion. Prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1999). Although the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum was based in part on an adverse credibility finding, the transcript reflects that Vu\u2019s credibility was undermined by his inability to understand the translator and his inability to articulate his Catholic beliefs according to the IJ\u2019s understanding of Catholicism. We are compelled to find that if Vu\u2019s first attorney had provided effective assistance by objecting to the translation and the IJ\u2019s religious quiz, the outcome might have been affected. The BIA\u2019s finding to the contrary was arbitrary and irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The BIA denied Vu\u2019s second motion to reopen because it concluded that Vu had not overcome the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and had not demonstrated it was more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to Vietnam. The BIA\u2019s conclusion did not violate Vu\u2019s due process rights because the BIA clearly stated the reasons for its denial. <em>See Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1013 (9th Cir.1998). Vu\u2019s reliance on <em>Campos-Sanchez v. INS, </em>164 F.3d 448 (9th Cir.1999), and <em>Stoyanov v. INS, </em>172 F.3d 731 (9th Cir.1999), is misplaced. In those cases, we found a due process violation because the BIA reversed the IJ\u2019s finding of credibility sua sponte and without notice to the petitioner. Here, the IJ made the adverse credibility finding in the first instance; Vu was well aware of the IJ\u2019s determination when he filed his second motion to reopen and therefore was not deprived of adequate notice. Accordingly, we affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of Vu\u2019s second motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Because the BIA committed an abuse of discretion in rejecting Vu\u2019s first motion to reopen, we grant the petition for review in 04-70937 and remand with instructions to grant the motion to reopen. <em>See Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 802-03 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Vu also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his third motion to reopen, which asserted that Vu\u2019s prior counsel had presented grossly inadequate motions to reopen to the BIA and IJ. In his third motion to reopen, Vu also introduced nearly 400 pages of new documentation supporting his claim for asylum. The BIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>dismissed Vu\u2019s third motion to reopen because it was not timely filed. We do not disturb that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Vu filed the motion almost seven years after the IJ\u2019s final administrative order, well after the 90-day deadline established by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although this court has stated that deadlines on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled \u201cwhen a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or <em>error, \u201d Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2003) (emphasis added), we have never equitably tolled a deadline where, as here, the alien alleges ineffective assistance of counsel without any hint of fraudulent activity. <em>See, e.g., Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1224 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Varela v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1237, 1240 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Lopez v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir.1999). Even in <em>Iturribar-ria </em>\u2014 the case upon which Vu primarily relies \u2014 this court tolled the filing deadline because the alien was misled by his lawyer into believing that necessary motions had been timely filed. <em>Id. </em>at 898 (holding that failure to timely file an application for suspension of deportation <em>\u201ccombined with deceptive behavior </em>that misled [the client] into believing that their representatives were proceeding effectively and appropriately\u201d justifies equitable tolling) (emphasis added). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review in 05-75174.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.

In my view, the BIA\u2019s denial was reasonably based on the questionable authenticity of the identification documents that Vu submitted and by the vague and nonrespon-sive answers Vu gave to the questions posed by the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d). Certainly, counsel might have done more, but it was Vu\u2019s own testimony that provided a solid basis for the IJ\u2019s denial of relief. Moreover, Vu\u2019s first motion to reopen did not set forth any evidence that overcame the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. As in my opinion, Vu has not shown that counsel\u2019s performance was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings <em>(see Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 793-94 (9th Cir.2005)), I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s partial grant of relief.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
