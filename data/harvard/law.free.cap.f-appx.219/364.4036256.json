We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">Mayers-Carrillo first contends that the district court erred when it characterized his 1996 Kansas burglary conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Mayers-Carrillo properly concedes that this argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Murillo-Lopez,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b391-18\">Mayers-Carrillo also contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>Mayers-Carrillo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United </em>States<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and circuit precedent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-19\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b391-20\">Mayers-Carrillo next contends that the district court erred by \u201capplying the Guidelines [to his <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentence] in the same sort of mandatory fashion struck down in BookerBecause Mayers-Carrillo makes this argument for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under plain-error review, we have \u201ca limited power to correct errors that were forfeited because [they were] not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>timely raised in the district court.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We \u201cmay not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If all of these conditions are met, we \u201cmay then exercise [our] discretion to notice a forfeited error but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Under the first two prongs, a district court commits plain error if it treats the Guidelines as mandatory in violation of Booker.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Booker, </em>which was decided on January 12, 2005, excised the provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 \u201cthat requires sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cWithout the \u2018mandatory\u2019 provision, the Act nonetheless requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals [in \u00a7 3553(a) ].\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> MayersCarrillo was sentenced in October 2005, nine months after <em>Booker </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">When we examine the entire sentencing record, we cannot reasonably conclude that the district court believed that the Guidelines were mandatory or effectively treated the Guidelines as mandatory. First, the record shows that the district court was aware that the Guidelines were advisory after <em>Booker. </em>The district court, in its Statement of Reasons, checked the box beside the statement, \u201cThe Court adopts the presentence report and Guideline applications without change,\u201d and the presen-tence report states in two different places that the Guidelines are advisory under <em>Booker. </em>Also, at the top of the Sentencing Recommendation, it states, \u201cIn light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the guideline provisions listed below are advisory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Next, there is no indication in the record that the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory when it sentenced Mayers-Carrillo. At sentencing, the district court made the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">I\u2019ll just tell all of you, I go back to the days when judges were real judges and we didn\u2019t have guidelines and looked at the whole deal and imposed the sentence that we thought was proper. And that\u2019s probably what I ought to put in all of these. I know that all of you are hard bound by all of this mumbo-jumbo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">I don\u2019t mean to be critical at all about what the probation officer goes through, but my first ten years or so was in the good old days. You know the story \u2014 I might as well lighten it just a little bit\u2014 I said this yesterday: Things aren\u2019t what they used to be and they never were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">Mr. Mayers-Carrillo, the court faces rules of law that I have to follow. You are going to face a serious sentence no matter how we resolve that, but I\u2019ll do the lowest I can under the circumstances, recognizing that you are going to still have a very significant amount of time for unlawful entry for a one-day period, which is what it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Pursuant to the sentencing reform act of 1984, it is the judgment of the court that the defendant Lorenzo Luis May-ers-Carrillo is hereby sentenced to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned for a term of 77 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">... [Y]our total sentence is the lowest end of the guidelines, 77 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">Mr. Mayers-Carrillo, the only thing I can tell you is you\u2019ve gotten the lightest sentence that would be possible under the circumstances for me still following the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">And it\u2019s a big stretch. I\u2019m doing it because it is still a significant sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">If you ever come back again, I don\u2019t believe you will ever go back to Mexico. You are going to spend all your time in the federal penitentiary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Mayers-Carrillo contends that the district court\u2019s statements that \u201cthe court faces rules of law that I have to follow ... but I\u2019ll do the lowest I can under the circumstances ...\u201d and describing the sentence as \u201cthe lightest sentence that would be possible under the circumstances for me still following the law\u201d indicate that the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory. Mayers-Carrillo also argues that the fact that the district court did not mention any of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors at the sentencing hearing shows that the district court only considered the Guidelines when sentencing Mayers-Car-rillo in violation of <em>Booker. </em>In its Statement of Reasons, however, the district court stated, \u201cThe Court finds the guidelines adequately address the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">When we consider the district court\u2019s statements at the sentencing hearing along with its statement in the Statement of Reasons, we conclude that the district court followed the <em>Booker </em>requirement that the district court must consult both the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the Guidelines when sentencing. Therefore, the reasonable interpretation of the district court\u2019s statement that it was giving \u201cthe lightest sentence that would be possible under the circumstances for me still following the law\u201d is that the district court was following the law from <em>Booker </em>that it consult both the sentencing factors and the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">The district court\u2019s meaning becomes even more apparent when we examine the circumstances surrounding Mayers-Carril-lo\u2019s conviction and sentence. Mayers-Car-rillo contends that he re-entered the United States only for a one-day period to visit his attorney about a lawsuit and that he was planning to return to Mexico. He contends that based on his \u201cinnocent and transitory reason\u201d for his illegal re-entry, the district court could have concluded that 77 months was excessive in light of many of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors that the court must consider: \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;\u201d \u201cthe seriousness of the offense;\u201d the need \u201cto provide just punishment for the offense;\u201d and the need \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.\u201d Mayers-Carrillo argues that this supports his contention that the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory and would have sentenced him to a lower sentence if it had treated the Guidelines as advisory and properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">In making this argument, Mayers-Carrillo ignores how several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors apply to his circumstances. Section 3553(a) requires the sentencing judge to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d the need \u201cto promote respect for the law,\u201d the need \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d and the need \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The presentence report that the district court adopted detailed that Mayers-Carrillo had been previously arrested in the United States at least nine times since 1980, convicted of at least twelve crimes, including four times for illegal reentry after deportation, and deported to Mexico after at least five of those arrests and convictions. At the sentencing hearing, Mayers-Carrillo admitted to the district court that he had previously been sentenced to 77 months for illegally reentering the United States. Therefore, the district court was aware of MayersCarrillo\u2019s long history of illegally re-entering the United States and committing crimes. A reasonable reading of the record indicates that these are the \u201ccircumstances\u201d to which the district court referred when it stated that it would give Mayers-Carrillo \u201cthe lightest sentence that would be possible under the circumstances for me still following the law.\u201d We therefore cannot reasonably conclude that the district court believed that the Guidelines were mandatory or effectively applied the Guidelines as mandatory. MayersCarrillo has failed to establish that the district court committed plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Even if Mayers-Carrillo could establish that the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory, he cannot show that this error affected his substantial rights. To demonstrate that the error affected his substantial rights, Mayers-Carrillo bears the burden of persuasion to show \u201cthat the error \u2018must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Mayers-Carrillo must demonstrate \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine the confidence in the outcome.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Specifically, MayersCarrillo must show \u201cthat the sentencing judge would have reached a different result had it sentenced [him] under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cOur cases have placed a substantial burden upon defendants to show specific statements of the sentencing judge that suggest a lower sentence would be imposed under an advisory scheme.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s statements in this case do not indicate that it would have sentenced Mayers-Carrillo to a lower sentence outside of the Guideline range. Accordingly, Mayers-Carrillo has not met his burden to show that the error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Mayers-Carrillo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
