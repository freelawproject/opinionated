On appeal, Hartley argues that the district court misunderstood the scope of its discretion under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-23\">After reviewing the record, we agree that the district court may have sentenced Hartley while operating under an errant conception of the scope of its discretion under our precedent. Under our post-<em>Booker </em>cases, a district court may impose a sentence below the guidelines range if, after assessing the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2006), it believes such a sentence is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to achieve the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). \u201cThe farther the court diverges from the advisory guideline range, the more compelling the. reasons for the divergence must be.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.2006). Although we do not accord district courts a free hand with respect to variances, we also do not foreclose a variance if accompanied by an explanation which makes the final sentence a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>reasonable one. Nothing in this opinion should be read to suggest that we have formed any view regarding the appropriate outcome of Hartley\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Because the record indicates that the district court misunderstood our precedent, we vacate its judgment and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
