The district court sentenced him to life imprisonment on one count and terms of years on the remaining counts. McKinney appeals, asking that we direct judgment of acquittal on all counts for insufficient evidence. We find the evidence overwhelming and therefore decline his request. McKinney seeks alternatively a new trial on the grounds that the court abused its discretion in admitting evidence and the cumulative effect of erroneous rulings. These grounds are meritless. We also find meritless the claim that his life sentence violates the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
