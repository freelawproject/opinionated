We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm substantially for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Alford v.

We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-20\"> Alford\u2019s failure to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation as to his race discrimination claims, after proper notice of the consequences of his failure to do so, results in waiver of this issue on review. <em>Wright v.
