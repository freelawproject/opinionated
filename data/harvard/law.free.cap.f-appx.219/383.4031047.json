He argues that the BIA erred in finding that his removal would not result in extreme hardship to his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-23\">Because it involved the exercise of discretion, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s hardship determination. <em>See Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir. 2004); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(b) and 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. Moreover, to the extent Elizondo argues that we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s interpretation of INA \u00a7 213, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1183, because it is a legal question not subject to the jurisdiction-stripping provision of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), see, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), his claim is unexhausted, and we are therefore without jurisdiction to consider that claim. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, Elizondo\u2019s petition for review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-25\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
