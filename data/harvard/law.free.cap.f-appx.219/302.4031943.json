He also appeals two margin orders denying his motions for reconsideration. Wilson was clearly attacking his sentence and because he had previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court correctly found it was without authority to consider these filings unless Wilson had authorization from this court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In addition, Wilson appeals the district court\u2019s orders denying his request for records and files and denying two motions for reconsideration. Because there was no reason to grant the relief sought, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-17\"> To the extent Wilson may be seeking authorization from this court to file a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, we deny the request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
