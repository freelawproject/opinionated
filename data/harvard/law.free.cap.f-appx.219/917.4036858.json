We affirmed his conviction and sentence on September 22, 2003. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>85 Fed.Appx. 192 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">On March 9, 2004, Petitioner moved the district court to vacate his conviction and sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on the ground that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to file a motion to suppress the drugs found in his automobile. Following an evidentia-ry hearing, the magistrate judge, in her Report and Recommendation, recommended that the district court deny the motion. The court did so, and issued a certificate of appealability on one issue: \u201cwhether the failure of petitioner\u2019s counsel to investigate and file a motion to suppress constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">To make out a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient and that he was prejudiced as a result. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The dispositive question is \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. \u201cGiven the strong presumption in favor of competence, the petitioner\u2019s burden of persuasion \u2014 though the presumption is not insurmountable \u2014 is a heavy one.\u201d <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1314 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also Rogers v. Zant, </em>13 F.3d 384, 386 (11th Cir.1994) (noting that \u201cthe cases in which habeas petitioners can properly prevail on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel are few and far between\u201d). Unless the petitioner can rebut the \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d he cannot establish that counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. \u201cThe test has nothing to do with what the best lawyers would have done. Nor is the test even what most good lawyers would have done. We ask only whether some reasonable lawyer at the trial could have acted, in the circumstances, as defense counsel acted at trial.\u201d <em>White v. Singletary, </em>972 F.2d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir.1992); <em>see also Waters v. Thomas, </em>46 F.3d 1506, 1514 (11th Cir.1995) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>(stating that \u201cperfection is not the standard of effective assistance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The Fourth Amendment guarantees \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. Evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be suppressed. <em>United, States v. Gilbert, </em>942 F.2d 1537, 1541 (11th Cir. 1991) (citing <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">In most circumstances, unless there is consent, police officers must obtain a warrant supported by probable cause to justify a search under the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v. Magluta, </em>418 F.3d 1166, 1182 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2966, 165 L.Ed.2d 949 (2006). There are, however, several exceptions to this rule, including \u201cthe automobile exception,\u201d which allows \u201cofficers [to] search any container in an operational car without a warrant as long as they have probable cause to believe that the container holds evidence of a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>California v. Acevedo, </em>500 U.S. 565, 579-80, 111 S.Ct. 1982, 1991, 114 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991)). \u201cProbable cause for a search exists when under the totality of the circumstances there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted). \u201cIn examining the totality of the circumstances, a reviewing court must give due weight to the officer\u2019s experience.\u201d <em>United States v. Briggman, </em>931 F.2d 705, 709 (11th Cir. 1991). Another exception to the warrant requirement for a search is the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine. \u201cThe \u2018plain view doctrine permits a warrantless seizure where (1) an officer is lawfully located in the place from which the seized object could be plainly viewed and must have a lawful right of access to the object itself; and (2) the incriminating character of the item is immediately apparent.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1290 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 990, 166 L.Ed.2d 747 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">The district court\u2019s findings of fact demonstrate, as the court explained in its dis-positive order (which appropriately relied in part on the magistrate judge\u2019s findings), that the performance of Petitioner\u2019s attorney satisfied the Constitution\u2019s requirement and, further, caused Petitioner no prejudice whatever. The outcome of this case would have been the same had counsel moved the court \u2014 prior to Petitioner\u2019s plea of guilty \u2014 to suppress the drugs seized from the automobile. A motion to suppress would have failed for two reasons. First, the agents saw the drugs in plain view; second, the they had probable cause to search the car. The agents had seen Petitioner attempt to hide drugs, which they visually identified as such. They were in a place they had a right to be \u2014 outside the car \u2014 and they immediately identified the item Petitioner attempted to hide as cocaine. In sum, the search was valid under the plain view doctrine. It was also valid because, as the district court concluded, the agents has probable cause to search the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
