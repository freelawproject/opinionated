R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1.9(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-26\">Appellant Gideon Michael Robles pled guilty to one count of assault with a dangerous weapon within Indian country in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 113(a)(3) and 1153. He now appeals his sentence, contending the district court erred in failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>to sentence him below the applicable United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d or \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) range, based on certain sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) which he raised during sentencing. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm Mr. Robles\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">On December 11, 2005, Mr. Robles and a fifteen-year-old companion attended a late-night party at a home located on the Navajo Indian Reservation in Church Rock, New Mexico. Witness accounts differed on what occurred that evening, but all agreed that during an altercation between Aaron Begay and the fifteen-year-old, Mr. Robles intervened by picking up a knife from the kitchen counter and inflicting a half-inch-deep stab wound in Mr. Begay\u2019s chest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A local medical center treated Mr. Begay and released him six days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">II. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Following a four-count indictment, Mr. Robles pled guilty to one count of assaulting Mr. Begay with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 113(a)(3) and 1153, and in return, the government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts against him and recommend a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range. Following Mr. Robles\u2019s guilty plea and dismissal of the other counts against him, a probation officer prepared a presentence report calculating his base offense level at fourteen, but recommending a four-level increase because Mr. Robles used a dangerous weapon in committing the crime, and an additional three-level increase because Mr. Begay sustained bodily injuries. After reducing Mr. Robles\u2019s offense level by three levels for acceptance of responsibility, the probation officer calculated his total offense level at eighteen, which, together with his criminal history category of I, resulted in a Guidelines range of twenty-seven to thirty-three months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Mr. Robles, through counsel, filed a sentencing memorandum in which he did not oppose the presentence report, including the Guidelines range calculations, but argued a twelve-month sentence, rather than a twenty-seven- to thirty-three-month Guidelines-range sentence, was warranted based on the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In support of his argument, Mr. Robles asked the district court to consider the nature and circumstances of his offense, including the fact he was attempting to defend the fifteen-year-old from an armed attack; his lack of a prior criminal record, which showed a reduced risk of recidivism; and his history and characteristics, including a childhood spent in a series of foster homes, his young age of eighteen, his lack of, and need for, educational and vocational training, and his stable relationship with the woman bearing his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">At the sentencing hearing, Mr. Robles\u2019s counsel again did not object to the sentencing range calculations in the presen-tence report but reiterated the same argu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>merits in support of a below-Guidelines-range sentence. Following these arguments and Mr. Robles\u2019s statement regarding his remorse for his conduct, the district court stated it had \u201creviewed the presen-tence report factual findings and ... considered the sentencing guideline applications and the factors set forth in 18 United States Code Section 3553(a)(1) through (7).\u201d It acknowledged the Guidelines range was twenty-seven to thirty-three months imprisonment and further noted Mr. Robles assaulted the victim and caused him bodily harm. It then sentenced Mr. Robles at the low end of the Guidelines range to twenty-seven months imprisonment followed by three years supervised release. Mr. Robles and his counsel raised no contemporaneous objection to the district court\u2019s calculation or explanation of his sentence and a judgment was entered on August 30, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">On appeal, Mr. Robles argues the district court erred by: 1) failing to meaningfully consider his meritorious arguments under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) for a below-Guidelines sentence; 2) failing to give adequate weight to the non-Guidelines \u00a7 3553(a) factors; 3) failing to explain its reasons for the sentence imposed; and 4) unreasonably imposing a sentence greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals in \u00a7 3553(a). In support, he contends the district court only \u201cperfunctorily\u201d stated it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but did not address the application of those factors nor explain why a \u201c27-month sentence ... was necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing.\u201d He also suggests the compelling circumstances previously raised warrant a below-Guidelines sentence based on \u00a7 3553(a). In so doing, he argues the record is inadequate to determine whether the sentence is \u201cgreater than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">We review for reasonableness the sentence imposed and have determined a presumption of reasonableness attaches to a sentence, like here, which is within the correctly-calculated Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Kristi, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1053-54 (10th Cir.2006) <em>(per </em>curiam). We require reasonableness in two respects\u2014 \u201cthe length of the sentence, as well as the method by which the sentence was calculated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1055 (emphasis omitted). This involves an assessment of the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>See United States v. Cage, </em>451 F.3d 585, 591 (10th Cir.2006). If the district court \u201cproperly considers the relevant Guidelines range and sentences the defendant within that range, the sentence is presumptively reasonable,\u201d but \u201c[t]he defendant may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the other sentencing factors laid out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Kristi, </em>437 F.3d at 1055. In determining whether the district court properly considered the applicable Guidelines range, we review its legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">We have held \u201c[tjhere is no question that, in addition to guiding our reasonableness review on appeal, the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) must be considered by the district court itself when imposing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez-Juarez, </em>446 F.3d 1109, 1115 (10th Cir.2006). When the district court allows a defendant to make an argument that any of these factors warrant a below-Guidelines-range sentence and then imposes a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range, we have said this \u201cmay fairly be read as a functional rejection of [his] arguments and a denial of his request for a below-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When addressing a district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201c[w]e do not require a ritualistic incantation to establish consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>eration of a legal issue, nor do we demand that the district court recite any magic words to show us that it fulfilled its responsibility to be mindful of the factors that Congress has instructed it to consider.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Flores, 444 </em>F.3d 1218, 1222 (10th Cir.2006) (quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Jul. 7, 2006) (No. 06-5217). While \u201cwe will not demand that the district court recite any magic words\u201d to support its conclusions, neither will we \u201cpresume the district court weighed a party\u2019s arguments in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors where the record provides no indication that it did so and no clear explanation of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Sanchez-Juarez, </em>446 F.3d at 1115-16 (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">[W]here a defendant has raised a non-frivolous argument that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors warrant a below-Guidelines sentence and has expressly requested such a sentence, we must be able to discern from the record that the sentencing judge did not rest on the guidelines alone, but considered whether the guidelines sentence actually conforms, in the circumstances, to the statutory factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKj\"><em>Id. </em>at 1117 (quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">With these principles in mind, we note the district court in this case explicitly considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the record provides a clear \u201cindication\u201d it considered these requisite factors, together with Mr. Robles\u2019s argument for a below-Guidelines-range sentence. See <em>Sanchez-Juarez, </em>446 F.3d at 1115-16. When the district court imposed a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range, it was \u201ca functional rejection of [his] arguments and a denial of his request for a below-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1115. Moreover, we note Mr. Robles and his counsel raised no contemporaneous objection to the district court\u2019s calculation or explanation of his sentence. Finally, because the district court properly considered the relevant Guidelines range and sentenced Mr. Robles within that range, his sentence is presumptively reasonable and he clearly has not rebutted this presumption by demonstrating the sentence is unreasonable in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Kristl, </em>437 F.3d at 1055. In other words, he has not shown that the circumstances delineated by him, when viewed in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, are sufficient to transform his presumptively reasonable sentence into one that is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM Mr. Robles\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b862-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-9\">. Mr. Begay and his sister claimed Mr. Robles also intentionally stabbed her in the side before he stabbed Mr. Begay. In contrast, Mr. Robles, who was drinking that night, claimed he accidently stabbed Ms. Begay when he passed through the sliding glass door when leaving the house and that he believed he stabbed her after he stabbed Mr. Begay, but admitted he did not remember the sequence of events. Regardless of which version of events is correct, Mr. Robles admitted he stabbed both of them and ultimately pled guilty to assaulting Mr. Begay with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm. Counts in the indictment against Mr. Robles for assault on Ms. Begay with a deadly weapon and for causing her serious bodily injury were dropped as part of the plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b865-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) provides, in part, that the court shall consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-8\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-9\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-10\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-11\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-12\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-16\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-17\">(3) the kinds of sentences available; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-18\">(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-19\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
