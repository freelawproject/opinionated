Upon denial of the motion, Wendt entered a conditional plea of guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). After conviction, Wendt was further charged with, and pleaded guilty to, violation of supervised release due to possession of a firearm. Wendt also appeals that conviction, arguing that the improper denial of his motion to suppress led to both of his convictions. Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that denying the motion to suppress was proper for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion and order. Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Circuit Rule 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-24\">. The Honorable Nanette K.
