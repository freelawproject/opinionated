Wicks argues the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred by concluding Wicks was ineligible for safety valve relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5C1.2. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-25\">Wicks entered into a proffer agreement with the government in which he stated Curtis Tatem (Tatem), his brother and co-defendant, distributed crack cocaine. Later, Wicks recanted these statements, asserting law enforcement officers had pressured him into making incriminating statements about Tatem. The district court found Wicks was ineligible for safety valve relief because, by recanting his prior statements, Wicks had not provided truthful information about his offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-26\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s findings regarding whether a defendant is eligible for safety valve relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Alvarado-Rivera, </em>412 F.3d 942, 947 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1096, 163 L.Ed.2d 909 (2006). \u201cDefendants have the burden to show affirmatively that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>have satisfied each requirement for the safety valve, including whether truthful information and evidence have been given to the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court\u2019s finding that Wicks was ineligible for safety valve relief, because Wicks recanted his prior statements and thus never provided complete, truthful information to the government, is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Morones, </em>181 F.3d 888, 891 (8th Cir.1999) (stating \u201cthe defendant [who] initially tells the government the whole truth but later recants\u201d is \u201cno more entitled to safety valve relief than the defendant who never discloses anything about the crime and its participants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-20\">. The Honorable Ronald E. Longstaff, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-21\">. A defendant is eligible for safety valve relief if:</p>\n<p id=\"b623-29\">(1) the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines;</p>\n<p id=\"b623-30\">(2) the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b623-31\">(3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person;</p>\n<p id=\"b623-32\">(4) the defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>in section 408 of the Controlled Substances Act; and</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">(5) not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the Government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-23\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
