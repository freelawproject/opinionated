On September 22, 2006, Fortune filed this petition seeking a writ of mandamus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">On October 16, 2006, the District Court entered an order denying Fortune\u2019s motion for contempt. Because Fortune has received the relief he sought in filing his mandamus petition \u2014 a ruling on his motion for contempt \u2014 we will deny his mandamus petition as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-14\">.
