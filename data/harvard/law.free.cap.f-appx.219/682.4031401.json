Pursuant to a plea agreement, Pham pleaded guilty to arson resulting in death and was sentenced to life in prison. The government filed a Rule 35(b) motion to reduce Pham\u2019s sentence to 30 years based on his substantial assistance after sentencing. The district court granted the motion and reduced Pham\u2019s sentence to 45 years. Assuming we have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 to review Pham\u2019s sentence reduction for legal error, <em>see United States v. Doe, </em>351 F.3d 929, 932 (9th Cir.2003), despite Pham\u2019s appeal waiver, <em>see United States v. Jeronimo, </em>398 F.3d 1149, 1153 n. 2 (9th Cir.2005), there was no legal error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The district court was not required to provide Pham with notice that it intended to rely on a mortality table when determining the extent of Pham\u2019s sentence reduction nor did the district court\u2019s reliance on the mortality table and Pham\u2019s potential for good time credits violate any law. The district court considered Pham\u2019s substantial assistance, as it was required to do, in determining the extent of Pham\u2019s sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
