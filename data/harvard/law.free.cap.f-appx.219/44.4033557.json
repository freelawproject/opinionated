KATZMANN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b70-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b70-21\">Defendant Daniel Ticas appeals the sentence imposed on him after he pled guilty to illegally reentering the United States after having been deported following conviction for an aggravated felony, without having obtained the express permission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the Attorney General of the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) &amp; (b)(2). Judge Berman sentenced Ticas principally to 46 months of imprisonment, which was within the 46- to 57-month range prescribed by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines as a result of the calculations in Ticas\u2019s Presentence Investigative Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), as corrected by the District Court following a determination that Ticas\u2019s criminal history category under the Guidelines was III rather than IV. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the issues on appeal and the procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We have jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, <em>see United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), notwithstanding that the sentence imposed was within the applicable Guidelines range, <em>see United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 25-26 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Ticas argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the District Court should have granted his applications for a downward departure on the basis of: (1) his criminal history category\u2019s alleged over-representation of the seriousness of his criminal conduct, and (2) his \u201ccultural assimilation\u201d to the United States. Ticas asserts that the District Court misapprehended its authority to grant a departure on the basis of cultural assimilation, and that this misapprehension serves as a basis for vacating his sentence. <em>See </em>Appellant Br. at 15 (citing <em>United States v. Monk, </em>15 F.3d 25, 28-29 (2d Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Haynes, </em>985 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Ticas\u2019s claims are without merit. \u201c[W]e have held in the <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing regime that \u2018a refusal to downwardly depart is generally not appealable,\u2019 and that review of such a denial will be available only \u2018when a sentencing court misapprehended the scope of its authority to depart or the sentence was otherwise illegal.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>465 F.3d 113, 114 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>426 F.3d 178, 184 (2d Cir.2005)). The District Court clearly understood its authority to grant Ticas a downward departure on the basis of his criminal history category\u2019s alleged over-representation of the seriousness of his criminal history, but nonetheless chose not to depart. This determination is unreviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Moreover, the District Court\u2019s decision not to grant a downward departure on the basis of cultural assimilation was not based on a misapprehension of its authority to depart. As Ticas acknowledges, we have never recognized cultural assimilation as a basis for a downward departure. The District Court nonetheless proceeded to consider the degree to which Ticas\u2019s circumstances might support a finding that he was culturally assimilated to the United States. It found that Ticas\u2019s stated reason for returning to the United States \u2014 to be with his family and to support his family\u2014 was not sufficient to support a finding of cultural assimilation. Moreover, according to the District Court, Ticas\u2019s substantial prior criminal history weighed against a finding that he had culturally assimilated because \u201c[ajssimilation ... would normally have ... a law abiding characteristic to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that we may review the District Court\u2019s finding that Ticas did not merit a downward departure on the basis of cultural assimilation, we agree with the District Court\u2019s decision substantially for the reasons stated by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">Finally, upon consideration of the entire record, we conclude that the sentence was well within the broad range of reasonable sentences that the District Court could have imposed in the circumstances presented. Ticas\u2019s substantial criminal record and history of recidivism supported a sentence that was within the applicable Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>We have considered all of Ticas\u2019s arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
