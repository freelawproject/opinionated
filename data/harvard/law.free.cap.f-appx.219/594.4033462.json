The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to a total of 240 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release. On appeal, Redd argues that it violated the Sixth Amendment for the district court to find the fact of his prior convictions and their nature as violent felonies, which subjected him as an armed career criminal to enhanced statutory and Guidelines penalties. Our precedent holds to the contrary. <em>See United States v. Headbird, </em>461 F.3d 1074, 1079 (8th Cir.2006) (district court has authority to find both existence and nature of prior convictions that trigger armed-career-criminal enhancements; <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), remains good law, unaffected by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\">. The Honorable Charles A.
