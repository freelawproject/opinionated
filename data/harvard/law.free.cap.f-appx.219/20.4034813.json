Medina, </em>427 F.3d 88 (1st Cir.2005) <em>(\u2018Medina </em>I\u201d) (affirming defendant\u2019s conviction but remanding for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). On remand, defendant was sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, the mandatory minimum for the offenses of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-16\">In this appeal from that sentence, defendant focuses solely on the mandatory minimum contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, which he continues to argue applies only to offenses involving crack cocaine, despite this court\u2019s ruling to the contrary in his first appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Medina I, </em>427 F.3d at 92 (holding that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 regulates exactly what it\u2019s terms suggest: the possession of any form of \u201ccocaine base\u201d). Under the doctrines of law of the case and stare decisis, we decline to reconsider this court\u2019s prior rulings on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-17\">Under the relevant branch of the law of the case doctrine, \u201ca legal decision made at one stage of a civil or criminal proceeding ... remain[s] the law of that case throughout the litigation, unless and until the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>sion is modified or overruled by a higher court. That branch binds ... a successor appellate panel in a second appeal in the same case.... \u201d <em>United States v. Moran, </em>393 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2004); <em>see also Ellis v. United States, </em>313 F.3d 636, 646-47 (1st Cir.2002) (explaining the \u201csalutary policies\u201d behind this doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Although that branch of the doctrine is prudential and has certain exceptions, the only one even potentially applicable here\u2014 that adhering to the law of the case would yield \u201ca manifestly unjust result,\u201d <em>Ellis, </em>313 F.3d at 648 \u2014 is unavailing. \u201c[A] litigant seeking to fit within [the] confines [of this exception] must negotiate a steep uphill climb----[A] finding of manifest injustice requires, at a bare minimum, \u2018a definite and firm conviction that a prior ruling is unreasonable or obviously wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moran, </em>393 F.3d at 8 (quoting <em>Ellis, </em>313 F.3d at 648).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">That demanding standard is not met here. Far from being \u201cobviously wrong,\u201d the panel\u2019s ruling in the first appeal was itself dictated by the decisions of other panels on this issue in previous cases, <em>Medina I, </em>427 F.3d at 92 (citing <em>Lopez-Gil, </em>965 F.2d at 1134, and <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>225 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 2000)), which that panel was not free to revisit, absent supervening authority, which did not and still does not exist, <em>see United States v. Anderson, </em>452 F.3d 66, 86 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 696, 166 L.Ed.2d 542 (2006). Apparently acknowledging that point, defendant suggests in his brief that this appeal be heard en banc. However, he filed no petition to that effect. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 35(b). That procedural consideration aside, under the law of the case doctrine discussed above, this case would be an unlikely vehicle for en banc consideration, which could have been but was not sought before or after the panel\u2019s decision in the first appeal. <em>United States v. Ticchiarelli, </em>171 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Because we therefore decline to revisit our prior rulings that the phrase \u201ccocaine base\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 applies not only to crack cocaine but to any form of cocaine base, we do not reach defendant\u2019s subsidiary arguments that he was entitled to but did not receive a jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt, or even a judicial finding by a preponderance of the evidence, that the substance involved here was crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\"><em>Affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. Loe. R. 27.0(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-11\">. Although in <em>Medina I, </em>this court was interpreting the phrase \u201ccocaine base\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 to determine whether the district court accurately defined the substantive offense, while here the same phrase is being interpreted to determine whether the mandatory minimum provision of that same statute applies, the difference is immaterial. Indeed, the very case that established the meaning of that phrase in this circuit did so in the sentencing context. <em>United States v. Lopez-Gil, </em>965 F.2d 1124, 1134 (1st Cir.1992) (per cu-riam) (as amended on rehearing).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
