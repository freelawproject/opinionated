We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts of the case, its procedural history and the arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-23\">Pettus acknowledges that defendants Gloria Lemmott-Taylor and Jane San Jose rendered medical care to him and he alleges only that the care was inadequate. Under even the most sympathetic reading, their actions would, at most, constitute negligence. But because mere negligence is insufficient to state a claim of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, summary judgment on Pettus\u2019 claims was appropriate. <em>See Weyant v. Okst, </em>101 F.3d 845, 856-57 (2d Cir.1996). Pettus\u2019 claims against defendants Bacon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>and Horn are deemed abandoned, as they were not raised on appeal. <em>See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.1995). Moreover, Pettus failed to show that Bacon and Horn knew or should have known that the frequent rotation of medical staff was allegedly causing his inadequate medical care. <em>See Weyant, </em>101 F.3d at 856-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion with respect to Pettus\u2019s requests for additional discovery, appointment of counsel or amendment of his pleadings. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b), the district court has the discretion to limit depositions and it did not abuse its discretion under the circumstances presented to it. The district court considered appointment of counsel under the proper standard and correctly determined that the claim likely lacked merit. <em>See Ferrelli v. River Manor Health Care Ctr., </em>323 F.3d 196, 203-04 (2d Cir.2003). Similarly, the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend was not an abuse of discretion as the proposed amendment, to include unnamed defendants, would have been futile. <em>See Jin v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>310 F.3d 84, 101 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to defendants-appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
