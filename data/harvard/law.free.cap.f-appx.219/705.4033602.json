The IJ denied Velasco\u2019s request for cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-19\">We reject Velasco\u2019s contention that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to sustain the Board\u2019s finding that he is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record contains an Order of Probation from the Superior Court of California, County of Mendocino, stating that Velasco pled guilty to a violation of California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11377, possession of methamphetamine. The record also contains a Probation Officer\u2019s Report and Recommendation, which sets forth the date of the offense, the charges, the terms of the plea bargain, the details of the police report, and Velasco\u2019s statement. Moreover, Velasco admitted to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>conviction during his hearing before the IJ and on his application for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A) (rendering inadmissible an alien who is \u201cconvicted of, <em>or who admits having committed, </em>or who admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of\u2019 a controlled substance violation) (emphasis added). The BIA did not err in finding Velasco statutorily ineligible for cancellation. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b) (listing the requirements for cancellation, including that an alien not have a conviction under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Velasco\u2019s motion for a continuance. <em>See Gonzalez v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir.1996) (stating that a decision whether to grant a continuance will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion). Velasco does not offer any evidence contrary to his admission to the controlled substance violation or any evidence that he is eligible for cancellation of removal. Nor does he cite any evidence that he would have presented had the continuance been granted. In fact, he does not cite any specific way in which he was prejudiced. \u201c \u2018Due process challenges to deportation proceedings require a showing of prejudice to succeed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Halaim v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 1128, 1136 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1999)). Velasco has failed to establish any prejudice from the denial of the continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b732-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
