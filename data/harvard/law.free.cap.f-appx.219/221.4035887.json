Scibelli moved to amend his complaint, and the District Court ordered him to file an amended complaint by March 24, 2006. Thereafter, the District Court twice extended the time to file the amended complaint. The District Court ultimately advised Scibelli that failure to file an amended complaint by May 12, 2006, would result in dismissal of the action. On that date, Scibelli filed a motion for recusal. Three days later, Sci-belli filed an amended complaint. The District Court dismissed the complaint, noting that it was \u201cexceptionally difficult to understand and in many instances [] either illegible or incomprehensible.\u201d Sci-belli filed a motion for reconsideration, which the District Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">Scibelli timely filed a notice of appeal. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Having granted Scibelli leave to proceed in <em>forma pawperis </em>on appeal, we must now determine whether his appeal should be dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal may be dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that a complaint contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), and that each averment be \u201cconcise, and direct,\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(e)(1). We agree with the District Court that Scibelli\u2019s amended complaint was \u201cillegible or incomprehensible.\u201d We discern nothing in the complaint that qualifies as a short and plain statement of a federal claim. Although Scibelli alleges defendants caused him \u201cinjuries and violations of his Constitutional Rights,\u201d the complaint fails to identify a federal constitutional or statutory basis for relief. Accordingly, the District Court properly dismissed Scibelli\u2019s complaint. Although the order does not provide that the dismissal is without prejudice, an order dismissing a complaint under Rule 8 clearly is without prejudice as it is not an adjudication of the merits. <em>See, e.g., Bennett-Nelson v. La. Bd. of Regents, </em>431 F.3d 448, 450 n. 1 (5th Cir.2005). The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Scibelli\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which asserts error but does not clarify Scibelli\u2019s claims or otherwise provide a basis for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">For the foregoing reasons, Scibelli\u2019s appeal will be dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) for lack of legal merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
