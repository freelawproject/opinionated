Williams argues that imposition of a statutory minimum sentence based on an alleged prior conviction violates his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights as established in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), he also questions the continued viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (prior conviction is sentencing factor for court to decide).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-22\">We conclude the district court did not err in determining that Williams\u2019s prior conviction qualified under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) as abusive sexual conduct involving a minor. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738 (reaffirming prior-conviction exception to facts that must be admitted by defendant or proved to jury beyond reasonable doubt); <em>United States v. Torres-Alvarado, </em>416 F.3d 808, 810 (8th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Cir.2005) (\u201cwe are bound by <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>until the Supreme Court explicitly overrules it\u201d); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>411 F.3d 928, 931 (8th Cir.) (Sixth Amendment does not require that fact of prior conviction be determined by jury; once court determines that prior conviction exists, characterization of that conviction is legal matter for court), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 505, 163 L.Ed.2d 382 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-14\">.
