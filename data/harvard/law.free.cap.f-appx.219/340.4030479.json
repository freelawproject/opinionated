For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-20\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b367-21\">Miranda has been an employee of the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) since 1981. He began there in a mail handler position in the Odessa, Texas post office and in 1989 was transferred to a mail handler position at the Midland Processing and Distribution Facility. Defendant NPMHU is the exclusive bargaining representative for members of the mail handler craft employed by USPS, and De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>fendant Local 311 represents the mail handlers at the Midland facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">In June 2001, Miranda voluntarily transferred to a letter carrier position in Odessa, Texas, a position outside the mail handler craft. In January 2002, however, he returned to a mail handler position in Midland, Texas. Sometime after Miranda\u2019s return, he discovered that he had lost his seniority due to his transfer. Because he returned to a mail handler position within one year of his transfer out, Miranda believed that he should have retained his seniority. Miranda filed a grievance through his union steward. USPS initially complied with Miranda\u2019s request, restoring his seniority date to 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Sometime in the fall of 2003, however, Local 311 official Robert Rodriguez (\u201cRodriguez\u201d) contacted USPS management, claiming that the restoration of Miranda\u2019s seniority had been in error. According to Rodriguez, the collective bargaining agreement between NPMHU and USPS provided that seniority could be restored only for persons in management positions. Miranda\u2019s seniority was again rescinded, and a seniority list reflecting this correction was posted on the employee bulletin board in November 2003. Miranda claims that the loss of his seniority has prevented him from obtaining vacation time during Thanksgiving week and has precluded him from successfully bidding on certain jobs. Miranda also claims that Rodriguez \u201cused intimidation tactics against him\u201d by convincing management to schedule Miranda for work on December 25, 2004, after Miranda had initially be given that day off.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Miranda filed suit against the Defendants for breach of fiduciary duty in Texas state court on December 27, 2005. Defendants filed a notice of removal to federal court on January 20, 2006. Subsequently, Defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis of untimeliness. Defendants argued that Miranda\u2019s state law claim was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq., and that a six-month statute of limitations applied. The district court determined that removal to federal court was proper under this court\u2019s holding in <em>Richardson v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>864 F.2d 1162, 1170 (5th Cir.1989). Finding that Miranda\u2019s claim was cognizable only as a duty of fair representation claim under the NLRA, the district court concluded that a six-month limitation period applied. Because none of the instances of Defendants\u2019 purported breach of duty occurred within six months of the date Miranda filed his suit, the district court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Miranda does not renew his objection to the removal of his suit, and only challenges the district court\u2019s granting of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this court has jurisdiction over an appeal from a grant of summary judgment. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Dallas County Hosp. Disk v. Assocs. Health &amp; Welfare Plan, </em>293 F.3d 282, 285 (5th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings, discovery responses, and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.CivP. 56(c). A dispute about a material fact is genuine if the evidence is such that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>a reasonable fact-finder could return a verdict for the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). When deciding whether there is a genuine issue of material fact, this court must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Daniels v. City of Arlington, </em>246 F.3d 500, 502 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Miranda maintains that his claim against the Defendants is a state law claim for breach of fiduciary duty. It is clear from Supreme Court and this court\u2019s caselaw, however, that Miranda\u2019s claim is cognizable only as a duty of fair representation claim under the NLRA. As such, it is timed barred under the applicable six-month statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">A. Preemption Under the Duty of Fair Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The duty of fair representation is a duty held by the Supreme Court to be implied in the NLRA. <em>See, e.g., Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, </em>345 U.S. 330, 73 S.Ct. 681, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953); <em>Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. Co., </em>323 U.S. 192, 65 S.Ct. 226, 89 L.Ed. 173 (1944). Because the NLRA empowers a union to become the exclusive bargaining agent of all employees in a bargaining unit, whether or not members of the union, it correspondingly implies a duty of fair representation by the union of all those employees. <em>Bass v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Boilermakers, </em>630 F.2d 1058, 1062 (5th Cir.1980). The duty of fair representation requires the union \u201cfairly to represent all of those employees, both in its collective bargaining with [the employer] ... and in its enforcement of the resulting collective bargaining agreement\u201d and \u201cto serve the interests of all [bargaining unit] members without hostility or discrimination toward any.\u201d <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 177, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">In <em>Richardson v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>864 F.2d 1162, 1166 (5th Cir.1989), this court interpreted <em>Vaca </em>as holding that the federal duty of fair representation preempts state substantive law. In <em>Richardson, </em>as in the instant case, we faced an appeal by plaintiffs who brought a claim against their representative union for breach of a \u201cTexas common-law tort duty owed by a union to its members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1164. We explained that \u201c[b]ecause the plaintiffs in this case alleged that the Union breached a duty that arose from its status as their exclusive collective bargaining agent under the NLRA, <em>Vaca </em>requires that this duty be defined by federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1166-67. We held that \u201c[t]he Union\u2019s right to act as plaintiffs\u2019 bargaining agent is conferred by the NLRA, and ... the duties corresponding to this right conferred by federal labor law are likewise defined solely by federal labor law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1165. Thus, though the appellants had depicted their claims as state law claims, we affirmed the district court\u2019s characterization of those claims as \u201cNLRA duty of fair representation claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">The circumstances of this case and those in <em>Richardson </em>are fundamentally alike. As in <em>Richardson, </em>the duty allegedly breached by the Defendants arises from their status as Miranda\u2019s collective bargaining representatives, thus compelling the conclusion that Miranda\u2019s claims are also properly characterized as duty of fair representation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">B. Attempts to Distinguish <em>Richardson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">Miranda does not address <em>Richardson </em>directly, but he does make arguments that appear to be implicit attempts to distinguish that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>\n<em>1. Defendants\u2019 Conduct as Bargaining Agent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">In <em>Richardson, </em>the plaintiffs acknowledged explicitly that the union\u2019s duties stemmed from its status \u201cas the bargaining agent for Plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1164. Miranda, however, argues that he \u201cis not complaining of the Union\u2019s representation against him against the employer\u201d and that \u201cthe Union was not acting as the exclusive bargaining representative on conditions of employment for Miranda.\u201d Rather, Miranda proposes that he \u201cis complaining of the insular conduct of the Union\u201d and that \u201c[Rodriguez] acted unilaterally to rescind the seniority to [his own] advantage.\u201d This characterization of Miranda\u2019s claim is inaccurate. Rodriguez was acting in his capacity as collective bargaining agent when he persuaded USPS management to rescind Miranda\u2019s seniority in accordance with Rodriguez\u2019s interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement. That Rodriguez\u2019s action may have been improperly motivated by hostility, bias, or self-interest does not imply that Rodriguez did not act as collective bargaining representative. Rodriguez\u2019s motivations go to the merits of Miranda\u2019s claim but do not change the fact that this claim is properly characterized as a duty of fair representation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\n<em>2. Independent State-Law Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Our opinion in <em>Richardson </em>acknowledged that that case did not \u201cpresent the question of whether the Union was subject to an independent state-law duty of care ... arising simply from the relationship of the union to its members\u201d and not preempted by the NLRA. <em>Id. </em>at 1167 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <em>Richardson </em>plaintiffs\u2019 petition \u201cdid not even allege that plaintiffs are or were members of the union.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">By contrast, Miranda\u2019s complaint and appeal do state that he is a member of the NPMHU and its Local 311. To the extent that Miranda attempts to establish an independent state-law duty of care on this basis, however, his argument is woefully unsupported. Miranda claims that the Defendants \u201cbreached a fiduciary duty\u201d toward him. To demonstrate that this duty exists, Miranda cites to a single Texas case, <em>Fitz-Gerald v. Hull, </em>150 Tex. 39, 237 S.W.2d 256, 261 (1951), for the proposition that \u201cTexas courts have found a fiduciary duty when one person trusts or relies in another.\u201d However, in addition to being an older case that concerns the relationship of parties to a joint venture, rather than that of union member to union, <em>Fitz-Gerald </em>nowhere indicates that subjective trust and reliance alone are sufficient to create a fiduciary relationship under Texas law. Miranda has failed to establish an independent state tort duty that would escape preemption by the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">\n<em>3. Preemption Under \u00a7 301</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Finally, Miranda proposes a standard for preemption different from that established by this court in <em>Richardson. </em>Miranda argues that whether a state law claim is preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\u201cLMRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, depends upon whether \u201cresolution of the state claim requires interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Wells v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>881 F.2d 166, 173 (5th Cir.1989) (emphasis omitted). Arguing that his claim against the Defendants does not require interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement between the union and USPS, Mi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>randa therefore contends that his state law claim is not preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">While Miranda correctly articulates the standard for preemption under \u00a7 301, he fails to recognize that this standard does not apply to his case. LMRA \u00a7 301 provides a cause of action for suits to enforce the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. Miranda\u2019s suit is not correctly categorized as a \u00a7 301 breach-of-contract claim, as he is not suing USPS for a failure to uphold its responsibilities under the collective bargaining agreement. Instead, Miranda\u2019s claim is properly characterized as a duty of fair representation claim, as he is suing his union for its failure to represent him faithfully in its dealings with USPS. <em>See, e.g., DelCostello v. Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 164, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983) (distinguishing between a \u00a7 301 claim against an employer and a duty of fair representation claim against a union).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, the appropriate standard for preemption is whether Miranda is alleging that \u201cthe Union breached a duty that arose from its status as [his] exclusive collective bargaining agent under the NLRA.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>864 F.2d at 1167. Despite his protestations to the contrary, Miranda is indeed alleging the breach of such a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">C. Statute of Limitations for Duty of Fair Representation Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">In <em>DelCostello, </em>the Supreme Court held that the six-month statute of limitations of NLRA \u00a7 10(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b), applies to a \u201chybrid \u00a7 301/fair representation claim,\u201d that is, a suit that combines a \u00a7 301 claim against the employer with a duty of fair representation claim against the union. 462 U.S. at 163-64, 171-72, 103 S.Ct. 2281. In <em>Richardson, </em>864 F.2d at 1167, and in <em>Smith v. International Organization of Masters, </em>296 F.3d 380, 382 (5th Cir.2002), this court held that the same statute of limitations applies to duty of fair representation claims brought independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Miranda filed suit against the Defendants on December 27, 2005. Each of the supposed instances of breach of duty by the Defendants, the last of which is alleged to have occurred in December 2004, took place more than six months before Miranda filed suit. Miranda\u2019s claims are therefore untimely. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Because we agree with the district court that Miranda\u2019s claims against the Defendants are time barred, we AFFIRM the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>order of the district court granting summary judgment to the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">. The district court also granted Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion as to a claim for retaliation that Miranda alleged for the first time in his response. Miranda has not raised this issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">. We also noted that state law actions that involve strong state interests such as \"the health and well-being of its citizens\u201d and are only peripherally related to the NLRA are not preempted by the NLRA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\">. In <em>DelCostello, </em>the Supreme Court acknowledged that a duty of fair representation suit against a union was \"inextricably interdependent\u201d with a \u00a7 301 suit against the employer, for \"the case [the employee] must prove is the same whether he sues one, the other, or both.\u201d 462 U.S. at 164-65, 103 S.Ct. 2281. In order to prove injury in a duty of fair representation suit against the union, an employee must show that the employer violated the collective bargaining agreement, and an employee normally cannot bring a \u00a7 301 action against his employer unless he can show that the union breached its duty of fair representation in handling his grievance. <em>Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helpers, Local No. 391 v. Terry, </em>494 U.S. 558, 564, 110 S.Ct. 1339, 108 L.Ed.2d 519 (1990). Nevertheless, <em>Richardson </em>did not adopt the \u00a7 301 standard for preemption analysis for duty of fair representation claims, and we are bound to follow <em>Richardson's </em>approach here.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">Even if we did apply the \u00a7 301 standard to Miranda\u2019s claims, however, it would be clear that his claims are preempted. In order to show injury from the Defendants\u2019 actions, Miranda would have to demonstrate that USPS\u2019s adjustment of his seniority violated the collective bargaining agreement. This demonstration would require interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement, thus satisfying the test for preemption under \u00a7 301.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
