In 2004, the district court abated this action upon the parties\u2019 stipulation that the facts and issues herein were the same or almost identical to those in <em>Ballard v. City of Crystal River, </em>Case No. 5:02-cv-240-OC-10-GRJ, in which the district court had granted summary judgment to the City and which was then on appeal to this court. After we affirmed that judgment, Anderson sought to re-open this case and the district court agreed, holding that Anderson\u2019s claims for recision and for damages under the Whistleblower Act were not barred by the judgment affirmed in <em>Ballard. </em>This case was re-opened and discovery commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-16\">Following discovery, the City moved for summary judgment on both counts of Anderson\u2019s complaint. After due consideration, the district court agreed and entered summary judgment for the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-17\">The City then moved the district court to award of costs and fees against Anderson, under the frivolous litigation provisions of both the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and the Whistleblower Act, as well as for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees against Anderson\u2019s counsel under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 for the allegedly vexatious and unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>able multiplication of these proceedings. The City argued that Anderson\u2019s claims were frivolous and filed in bad faith as to the validity of their allegations. The City contended that Anderson knew that his claims were barred by his previous settlement agreement with the City as well as by the Whistleblower Act\u2019s statute of limitations. As to Anderson\u2019s counsel, the City argued that the prosecution of this case \u201cafter pursuing to the appellate level a virtually identical claim,\u201d unnecessarily prolonged these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The district court denied the City\u2019s motion for costs and fees as to both Anderson and his counsel. The district court held that as to the allegation of frivolity, it must determine whether this case was so lacking in arguable merit as to be groundless or without foundation, rather than whether the action was ultimately unsuccessful. Under this standard, the court said, the City was not entitled to costs and fees because Anderson\u2019s claims were not so frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation as to justify such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">The district court noted that Anderson\u2019s claim for recision was based upon an allegation of duress that raised factual issues not resolved prior to this litigation. Furthermore, his claim under the Whistleblower Act would not have been barred by the statute of limitations had the settlement agreement been rescinded. Thus, the district court concluded, it cannot be said that Anderson\u2019s present claims were without arguable merit, groundless, or without foundation. Additionally, in considering Anderson\u2019s motion to reopen this case, the district court noted that it had carefully considered whether <em>Ballard </em>controlled Anderson\u2019s present claims and had determined that it did not. Therefore, the district court concluded, Anderson\u2019s counsel did not unnecessarily prolong this litigation by reopening this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Our review of the district court\u2019s decision not to award costs or fees against Anderson and his counsel is for an abuse of discretion. <em>Amlong &amp; Amlong v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>457 F.3d 1180, 1188 (11th Cir. 2006). Under this standard, we must affirm the district court unless we find that it has applied the wrong legal standard or made a clear error of judgment. Our review of this case reveals no such error of law or judgment. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion and its denial of the City\u2019s motion for costs and fees is due to be</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
