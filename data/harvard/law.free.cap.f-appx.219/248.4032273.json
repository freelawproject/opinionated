For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-23\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with the baek-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ground of this case, we need not repeat the factual or procedural background. The only issue raised on appeal is whether the award of $520,000 for pain and suffering was excessive. We have reviewed the extremely thorough, careful and thoughtful Memorandum of Decision filed by Magistrate Judge Rueter dated, November 2, 2005, setting forth his findings of fact and conclusions of law. We will affirm the award for pain and suffering substantially for the reasons set forth in Magistrate Judge Rueter\u2019s Memorandum of Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In explaining why he was denying the government\u2019s motion for remittitur, the Magistrate Judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">The [amount] is well supported by the court\u2019s 32 page opinion, which contains 155 findings of fact and conclusions of law. There is no need for this court to say more to support its decision in this case, except to note the obvious. Reasonable minds will differ when quantifying the emotional and physical pain and suffering and the loss of life\u2019s pleasures of another individual .... the mere fact that the government disagrees with the court\u2019s assessment of Mr. Harris\u2019 non-economic damages is no basis for this court to alter its award which was given after careful deliberation and reflection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApS\">App. 004 (citing <em>Herb v. Hallowell, </em>304 Pa. 128, 154 A. 582, 584 (1931) and <em>Waldorf v. Shuta, </em>142 F.3d 601, 623 (3d Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Nothing more needs to be said. It is clear to us that the award which the government is challenging was indeed \u201cgiven after careful deliberation and reflection,\u201d and the fact that the government disagrees with the result of the court\u2019s analysis clearly does not justify our setting aside an award for pain and suffering which the Magistrate Judge properly calculated and explained.</p>\n<p id=\"AlW\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the order denying the Government\u2019s Post-Trial Motion For A Remittitur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
