Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989); and (2) that the rule of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), should be applied retroactively. The former argument is without merit and the latter argument is foreclosed by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Whorton v. Bockting, </em>549 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007). For the reasons that follow, the District Court\u2019s judgment denying Coleman\u2019s habeas petition will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-18\">Because we write for the parties only, we will forgo a lengthy recitation of the factual and procedural history of this case. On January 23, 2001, a grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania returned an indictment charging Coleman with possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Coleman proceeded to trial on May 9, 2001. At trial, the statements of an adverse witness who had died were introduced pursuant to the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d hearsay exception of Federal Rule of Evidence 803(2). On May 11, 2001, the jury convicted Coleman on all counts and on July 29, 2001, the District Court imposed a sentence of 220 months of imprisonment, five years of supervised release, a $1,000 fine, and a special assessment of $300. On June 3, 2003, we affirmed the conviction and sentence. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>States v. Coleman, </em>68 Fed.Appx. 300 (3d Cir.2003) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">On October 18, 2004, Coleman filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition raising, inter alia, the issue of a violation of his right to confront witnesses pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 60, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The Government did not raise the affirmative defense of <em>Teague </em>\u2014 that is, the principle that with rare exception for \u201cwatershed rules,\u201d new rules of criminal procedure do not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review. 489 U.S. at 311, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion). However, the District Court invoked the principle of <em>Teague </em>sua sponte, finding that in order to raise a challenge based on <em>Crawford, </em>Coleman first had to establish that the rule announced in that case applied retroactively. Applying <em>Teague, </em>the District Court found that <em>Crawford </em>did not announce a watershed rule of criminal procedure and did not affect primary rights. Accordingly, it denied Coleman\u2019s habeas petition. Coleman filed a motion for reconsideration. Although the District Court denied the motion, it granted a certificate of appeala-bility as to whether <em>Crawford </em>applies retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The District Court had jurisdiction over this criminal matter pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and over Coleman\u2019s collateral petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because the District Court issued a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 regarding its final decision denying habeas relief, we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Cepero, </em>224 F.3d 256, 258 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Coleman challenges the District Court\u2019s authority to raise the issue of the retroac-tivity of <em>Crawford </em>sua sponte. This challenge must fail. Although \u201ca court need not entertain the [non-retroactivity issue] ... if the State has not raised it ...,\u201d <em>Goeke v. Branch, </em>514 U.S. 115, 117, 115 S.Ct. 1275, 131 L.Ed.2d 152 (1995) (per curiam), we clearly retain the discretion to reach the issue sua sponte. <em>See Schiro v. Farley, </em>510 U.S. 222, 229, 114 S.Ct. 783, 127 L.Ed.2d 47 (1994) (\u201c[A] State can waive the <em>Teague </em>bar by not raising it.... Although we undoubtedly have the discretion to reach the State\u2019s <em>Teague </em>argument, we will not do so in these circumstances.\u201d); <em>Wilmer v. Johnson, </em>30 F.3d 451, 455 (3d Cir.1994) (\u201cAlthough we have the discretion to reach the ... [non-retroactivity issue] sua sponte ... we decline to do so in this case.\u201d). Although the doctrine of nonretroactivity is not a jurisdictional hurdle, it remains a \u201cthreshold question,\u201d <em>Caspari v. Bohlen, </em>510 U.S. 383, 389, 114 S.Ct. 948, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994), that a court appropriately raises as the \u201cfirst step\u201d in its review of a habeas petition. <em>Schiro, </em>510 U.S. at 228, 114 S.Ct. 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Coleman also argues that, even if it was not error for the District Court to raise the issue of the retroactivity of <em>Crawford </em>sua sponte, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that <em>Crawford </em>should not be retroactively applied was erroneous. This argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Whorton v. Bockting, supra, </em>that the rule of <em>Crawford </em>is not a watershed rule of criminal procedure to be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment denying the petition for habeas relief.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
