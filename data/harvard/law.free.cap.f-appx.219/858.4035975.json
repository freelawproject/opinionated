For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm Wims\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The instant case arose out of an investigation of Cleveland Ferguson, Jr., a drug dealer in Gainesville, Florida. Wims and Ferguson previously had been involved in the sale of cocaine in the Gainesville area. In 1991, Wims was convicted of cocaine distribution and sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Wims was released from custody in 1995, but his supervised release was revoked in 1996 because he committed a home invasion. Wims was subsequently released from custody in 2002. Following that release from prison, Wims contacted Ferguson regarding his desire to sell drugs again. Ferguson provided money to Wims, with which Wims bought cocaine in Miami and transport it back to Ferguson in Gainesville. Wims also purchased cocaine for himself during these transactions and converted it into cocaine base for further distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">In September 2003, Wims was involved in a drug transaction with his half-brother. During that transaction, Wims\u2019s half-brother shot Wims twice in the back of the head and left him to die. Wims survived and, according to his girlfriend, Wims thereafter attempted to reestablish himself as a drug dealer in Virginia. Wims made approximately four trips from Miami to Virginia to buy and sell cocaine. Wims was later arrested in Virginia. During the time between Wims\u2019s arrest and sentencing, Wims made several threats to cooperating defendants and witnesses against him. Wims also ran after and threatened a witness against him while they were both imprisoned in Tallahassee, Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">At sentencing, Wims\u2019s counsel requested that, if the court was going to stay within the guideline range, the court sentence Wims to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment because Wims was not the leader of the conspiracy. Wims\u2019s counsel further stated that Wims had stopped engaging in criminal activity the day that he was shot by his half-brother. The government responded that Wims continued to sell drugs after he had been shot. Wims then stated on his own behalf that he \u201cdidn\u2019t immediately involve [himself] back in a drug gang after [he] got shot on September 13, 2003, but eventually [he] couldn\u2019t get no assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ax3-dedup-0\">After hearing the arguments from the parties, the court stated that Wims had engaged in a life of crime and every time he was released from custody he returned to crime and drugs. The court also found that Wims had \u201ca very long, long, long criminal record.\u201d The court then determined that Wims\u2019s guideline range was 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment, and sentenced Wims to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court noted that it was the low-end of the guideline range and that, even though the court was not bound by the guidelines,.the range was appropriate in Wims\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">On appeal, Wims argues that his 360-month sentence was unreasonable in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>of the facts and circumstances of his case, and that the court should have sentenced him below the advisory guideline range. Wims maintains that his sentence should have been below the guideline range because he: (1) renounced criminal activity after he was shot and long before he was arrested for the instant offense; (2) was not the leader of the conspiracy; and (3) cooperated with law enforcement even though he did not qualify for a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Ordinarily, we review final sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, 431 F.3d 784, 786 </em>(11th Cir.2005). We do not reach the merits of Wims\u2019s arguments, however, because we conclude that Wims induced or invited the ruling he now claims was error. We have held that \u201ca party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d <em>United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). \u2018Where invited error exists, it precludes a court from invoking the plain error rule and reversing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">At sentencing, Wims\u2019s counsel explicitly requested that, if the court intended to sentence Wims within the guideline range, the court should sentence him to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. Even though Wims\u2019s counsel prefaced his request by stating \u201cif the court is inclined to follow\u201d the guideline range, Wims\u2019s counsel never explicitly requested that the court impose a below-guideline sentence, nor did counsel direct the court to another term of imprisonment that would be appropriate in Wims\u2019s case. As such, Wims\u2019s counsel invited the court to sentence Wims to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, which sentence the court imposed. Thus, Wims is precluded from claiming that his sentence was unreasonable. <em>See Love, </em>449 F.3d at 1157. Accordingly, Wims\u2019s 360-month sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-17\">. Wims was also charged with (1) attempting to use physical force against another person with the intent to influence, delay, and prevent the person from testifying in an official proceeding before a court of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(a)(2)(A), (a)(3)(B)(ii); and (2) threatening and attempting to cause bodily injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>another person with the intent of retaliating against that person for giving information to a police officer relating to the commission of a federal offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513(b)(2). However, those charges were later dismissed upon the government\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-13\">. The district court calculated Wims\u2019s guideline range based upon his adjusted offense level of 38 and his criminal history category of VI. Wims does not challenge the court\u2019s guideline calculation on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b886-6\">. Were we to review this sentence for reasonableness we would have no difficulty in affirming based upon the instant criminal activity, the extensive criminal record of Wims, the thorough review made by the sentencing judge and his consideration of the legal precedents controlling sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
