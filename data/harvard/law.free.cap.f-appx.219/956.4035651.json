Both stayed longer than the six months they were allowed to visit. The Immigration and Naturalization Service charged them with removability for overstaying their trip to the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-29\">Domlatjanov and Snitko conceded they were removable. At the same time, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Domlatjanov claimed that he was persecuted in Uzbekistan for practicing his Baptist faith. Snitko relied on her husband\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">In support of their claims, Domlatjanov testified that he converted to the Baptist faith in 1978. He further testified that starting in 1995 he had several confrontations in Uzbekistan because of his religion. Domlatjanov testified to the following incidents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-5\">\u2022 In 1995, Domlatjanov was expelled from the Uzbek national rocket modeling team for being a Baptist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-6\">\u2022 On April 12, 1997, the Uzbek police interrupted Domlatjanov at an unregistered prayer service in the home of one of his fellow congregants. The police insulted and interrogated those who were praying and warned them that they would be criminally prosecuted the next time they held a service without registering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-7\">\u2022 In March 1998, at another secret prayer meeting, the police, wearing camouflage, stopped the prayers, searched everyone who was there, and confiscated all Baptist religious material found in the house. Domlatjanov and some of his fellow congregants were also taken to the police station for three days. While there, the police tore off a toenail on Domlatjanov\u2019s left foot with pliers and beat him with a baton. (We will refer to this as the \u201ctoenail incident.\u201d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-8\">\u2022 In May 1999, following a prayer meeting, Domlatjanov and other congregants were waiting at a bus stop to go home. While waiting, ten people approached them and told them that Baptists did not belong in Uzbekistan. The ten people then physically attacked Domlatjanov and his fellow congregants. During the altercation, Domlatjanov was stabbed with a knife in his left hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-10\">\u2022 In March 2000, Domlatjanov\u2019s sixteen-year-old son was attacked at school by four of his classmates. His nose and face were injured as a result of the attack. The attackers claimed to beat Domlatjanov\u2019s son because his father was Baptist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-11\">\u2022 In September 2002, when returning home from a prayer meeting, five men, who Domlatjanov believed were Muslims, beat him and threatened to kill him. The men said that Baptists do not belong in Uzbekistan. As a result of this beating, Domlatjanov had bruising on his neck.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">Domlatjanov also submitted documentary evidence to the immigration judge supporting his claim that he was persecuted on account of his Baptist faith. These supporting documents included (1) a letter from the First Baptist Church of Florida regarding Domlatjanov\u2019s involvement in the church, (2) letters from Domlatjanov\u2019s children in Uzbekistan stating that they fear for their father\u2019s safety if he returns because people continue to threaten him with death for his faith, (3) medical records, and (4) humanitarian reports regarding the conditions in Uzbekistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">Domlatjanov\u2019s medical records indicated that he was treated for anxiety, sleep disorders and headaches due to the physical abuse he suffered in Uzbekistan. The records also showed that he had a \u201cwell healed knife wound on his left hand.\u201d A separate clinical report from a licensed clinical social worker provided that Dom-latjanov had major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of the violence he suffered in Uzbekistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Human Rights Watch\u2019s 1999 report for Uzbekistan provided that the Uzbek government was known to make arbitrary arrests, torture men in custody, and discriminate against certain religions. The 1999 report told of a specific incident where a Baptist pastor was arrested and sentenced to two years of hard labor for organizing unsanctioned gatherings, meetings, and demonstrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Human Rights Watch\u2019s 2000 report for Uzbekistan gave as an example of religious intolerance in the country an incident where an unregistered Baptist meeting was raided by the police and the participants were detained and tortured. The 2000 report went on to add that torture in Uzbekistan was \u201croutine\u201d and that police misconduct went unpunished.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The 2002 State Department country report for Uzbekistan said that the government continued to restrict religious freedom but that Christians who did not proselytize \u201cgenerally had no problems.\u201d However, according to the report, the Uzbek government continued to require that religious groups register with the government using \u201cstrict and burdensome criteria\u201d to approve religious activities. Baptist churches had a hard time registering under the strict criteria. And Baptists who prayed at unregistered churches had meetings broken up by the police, were fined, and sometimes imprisoned. The report also noted that religious literature was highly censored.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">The 2003 State Department country report for Uzbekistan also stated that \u201cChristians were generally well tolerated.\u201d But the report told of an incident where members of an unregistered Baptist church were arrested and sentenced to prison for ten days and fined for conducting a religious service in a private home.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">After hearing Domlatjanov\u2019s testimony and reviewing the documentary evidence he submitted, the IJ found that Domlatja-nov\u2019s testimony regarding the toenail incident was \u201cto a large extent ridiculous\u201d and \u201cnot ... credible or believable.\u201d However, the IJ also found Domlatjanov\u2019s \u201ctestimony to be believable that he was a Baptist.\u201d As to the other evidence that Domlatjanov \u201csuffered some additional problems and he was harassed by hooligans,\u201d the IJ concluded that Domlatjanov \u201chad not shown, to [his] satisfaction, that he had suffered past persecution of a severe nature which would constitute past persecution.\u201d The IJ also concluded that Domlatjanov had not shown that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution if returned to Uzbekistan. Because Dom-latjanov and Snitko had not met their burden as to asylum, the IJ concluded that they could not meet the higher standard required for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Finally, as to the couple\u2019s claim for CAT relief, the IJ said that the toenail incident would be sufficient to constitute torture. But, because the IJ found that Domlatja-nov\u2019s testimony regarding the toenail incident was not credible, Domlatjanov and Snitko had not shown that Domlatjanov was subjected to past torture, or had a well-founded fear of future torture, by the Uzbek government.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">The couple appealed the IJ\u2019s denial of their asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief claims to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Specifically as to their asylum claims, Domlatjanov and Snitko argued that the IJ erred in concluding that Domlatjanov had not suffered past persecution and did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. The BIA took issue with part of the IJ\u2019s justification for finding that Dom-latjanov\u2019s testimony about the toenail incident was not credible. However, the BIA</p>\n<p id=\"b986-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>ultimately \u201cagree[d] with the Immigration Judge that [Domlatjanov]\u2019s vague testimony [was] of limited credibility.\u201d The BIA concluded that, of the remaining evidence, Domlatjanov and Snitko did not adequately support their burden of proof as to each of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Domlatjanov and Snitko now petition this Court for review of the BIA\u2019s decision to deny their asylum claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They argue that the BIA and IJ committed two errors in denying their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The couple first contends that the IJ\u2019s credibility finding regarding the toenail incident, affirmed by the BIA, was not supported by substantial evidence. The government responds that we do not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s credibility finding because Domlatjanov and Snitko failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by challenging the credibility finding in their appeal to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">The government is correct that \u201c[w]e lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d <em>Amayar-Ar-tunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam); <em>accord </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (\u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d) That is, we \u201clack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the BIA.\u201d <em>Sundar v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cThus, if an alien fails to challenge an adverse credibility determination in his appeal to the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider such a challenge in his petition for review.\u201d <em>Amaya-Artundua-ga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">Here, we have reviewed Domlatjanov and Snitko\u2019s notice of appeal and brief to the BIA. In neither pleading did the couple raise a challenge to the IJ\u2019s credibility finding. Accordingly, they have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as to the credibility finding on the toenail incident, and we do not have jurisdiction to review the part of their petition that challenges the credibility finding here.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">Our exhaustion analysis is not changed by fact that the BIA addressed the credibility finding <em>sua sponte </em>in its order affirming and adopting the IJ\u2019s decision. In <em>Amayaj-Artunduaga, </em>the BIA, as it did here, considered the IJ\u2019s credibility finding even though the issue was not raised by the alien in his appeal to the BIA. <em>Id. </em>We said that \u201c[t]his leaves open the question whether we have jurisdiction over a claim when an alien, without excuse or exception, fails to exhaust that claim, but the BIA nonetheless considers the underlying issue <em>sua sponte.\u201d Id. </em>Answering the question in the negative, we held that the \u201cthe goals of exhaustion are better served by our declining to review claims a petitioner, without excuse or exception, failed to present before the BIA, even if the BIA addressed the underlying issue <em>sua sponte.\u201d Id. </em>at 1251. Thus, we concluded, the exhaustion requirement in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) divested us of jurisdiction to review the alien\u2019s argument for the first time in this Court, even if raised <em>sua sponte </em>by the BIA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Likewise, despite the fact that the BIA addressed the IJ\u2019s credibility finding in its order affirming and adopting the IJ\u2019s decision, we do not have jurisdiction to review Domlatjanov and Snitko\u2019s argument raised for the first time here that the IJ\u2019s credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence. We therefore dismiss this part of the couple\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Domlatjanov and Snitko also contend that the IJ and BIA erred in finding that Domlatjanov did not suffer past persecution. This issue was raised before the BIA and we have jurisdiction to review it here. We review the IJ\u2019s findings under the substantial evidence test, which means that we \u201cmust affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230. \u201c[T]he IJ\u2019s decision can be reversed only if the evidence \u2018compels\u2019 a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">Here, the evidence does not compel a conclusion that Domlatjanov suffered past persecution. We have said that persecution is an extreme concept that requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237-38 (11th Cir.2006). Mere harassment does not amount to persecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">Excluding the toenail incident, which we must given the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding, Domlatjanov has not demonstrated that the harm he suffered in Uzbekistan because of his religion was severe and pervasive enough to constitute persecution. Getting kicked off the national rocket team and being threatened by the police were mere harassment and not persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (\u201cmenacing telephone calls and threats ... do not rise to the level of past persecution\u201d). Only two of the incidents Domlatjanov described, which took place three years apart, involved any physical violence targeted at him, and they were not severe enough to compel a finding that Domlatja-nov was persecuted. <em>Cf. Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 766 n. 2 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that record compelled persecution finding where alien had been threatened, beaten on two occasions and then kidnapped for eighteen days); <em>see also Tawm v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 740, 742-43 (8th Cir. 2004) (two beatings four years apart which resulted in swelling did not constitute persecution); <em>Dandan v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 567, 573-74 (7th Cir.2003) (not persecution where alien was detained for three days and beaten which resulted in a swollen face).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">Because the record does not compel a finding that Domlatjanov was persecuted in Uzbekistan, he and his wife are not eligible for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A) (only refugees entitled to asylum), 1101(a)(42)(A) (refugee defined in part as one who is persecuted on account of his religion). Accordingly, we deny their petition to review the denial of the asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b986-8\">. Domlatjanov and Snitko\u2019s brief to this Court does not address their claims for CAT relief and addresses only in passing their claims for withholding of removal. They therefore have abandoned here any issues they had with regard to these claims. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
