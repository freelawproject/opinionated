Ray, proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>appeals the dismissal of his civil rights complaint. For the following reasons, we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">Ray is a prisoner at the Federal Correctional Institution at Estill, South Carolina, serving a seventy-month sentence imposed following a federal fraud conviction. In 2005, Ray filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging that his federal rights were violated by the unauthorized dissemination and use of a Presentence Investigation Report, which was compiled pursuant to Ray\u2019s federal conviction. Ray alleges that his court-appointed counsel in the federal prosecution sent the report to Louis Barbone, a New Jersey attorney representing Ray in matters arising from a state theft charge. Ray claims that Barbone then forwarded the report to New Jersey Deputy Attorney General Kerry Menchen,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who allegedly used information contained in the document to further an additional criminal investigation against Ray. This investigation yielded evidence that Ray perpetrated a fraud upon the court after pleading guilty to the theft charge in 2002. In 2005, a grand jury in Atlantic County, New Jersey indicted Ray on charges of bail jumping, forgery, and falsifying records. These charges were pending at the time Ray filed his federal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">The complaint names Menchen and Bar-bone as defendants, along with the State of New Jersey; Atlantic County, New Jersey; the Superior Court of New Jersey; Peter C. Harvey, Attorney General, State of New Jersey; and the grand jury panel that issued the 2005 indictment. Ray seeks monetary relief from Menchen, Bar-bone, and Harvey, and an injunction ordering dismissal of the 2005 indictment. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)-(iii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(l)-(2) after concluding that all of Ray\u2019s claims were legally barred. Because Ray is proceeding in <em>forma pauperis, </em>we will dismiss the appeal if it lacks an arguable legal or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>factual basis. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B); <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">We agree with the District Court that Ray has failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1983 against Atlantic County and Harvey. The complaint does not allege that either of these parties had any direct involvement in the alleged wrongdoing. <em>See Rode v. Dellarciprete, </em>845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.1988). The claims against these parties fail to the extent that Ray alleges they should be held liable based on their supervisory roles. <em>See id. </em>at 1207-08. Ray also cannot state a claim against the Superior Court of New Jersey because that party is not a \u201cperson\u201d subject to liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 70-71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); <em>Johnson v. State of New Jersey, </em>869 F.Supp. 289, 296-97 (D.N.J.1994). Moreover, the Eleventh Amendment bars Ray from obtaining relief against this party. <em>See Cory v. White, </em>457 U.S. 85, 91, 102 S.Ct. 2325, 72 L.Ed.2d 694 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Next, we agree with the District Court that the doctrine of absolute prosecutorial immunity shields Menchen from liability for damages under \u00a7 1983. The doctrine protects an official acting in a prosecutorial capacity from liability for acts committed while \u201cinitiating and pursuing a criminal prosecution and presenting the state\u2019s case in court.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Long, </em>242 F.3d 121, 125 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976)); <em>see also Bernard v. County of Suffolk, </em>356 F.3d 495, 505 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that county prosecutor was immune for preindictment conduct, including presentation of evidence to grand jury). Menchen is entitled to this defense because Ray\u2019s claims against her are solely based on her use of the contents of the report in court proceedings antedating the 2005 indictment. The complaint does not allege that Menchen disseminated the information while acting in a non-prosecutorial capacity. <em>See Yarris v. County of Delaware, </em>465 F.3d 129, 135-36 (3d Cir.2006) (noting that immunity does not apply if prosecutor committed misconduct while acting as an administrator or investigator). We also note that the grand jurors are entitled to absolute immunity. <em>See United States v. Navarro-Vargas, </em>408 F.3d 1184, 1201 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Ray is also unable to state a claim under \u00a7 1983 against Barbone because he was not acting under color of law at any time. <em>See Groman v. Township of Manalapan, </em>47 F.3d 628, 633 (3d Cir.1995). Although the complaint is unclear as to whether Barbone was privately retained or appointed by the court, this distinction is irrelevant for the purpose of determining whether he is a proper party to this action. A privately retained attorney does not act under color of law for purposes of \u00a7 1983. <em>See Henderson v. Fisher, </em>631 F.2d 1115, 1119 (3d Cir.1980). Nor does a public defender act under color of law \u201cwhen performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Furthermore, we note that Ray has requested an inappropriate form of injunctive relief. We agree with the District Court that <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), bars a federal court from ordering dismissal of the challenged indictment. <em>See also Juidice v. Vail, </em>430 U.S. 327, 335-36, 97 S.Ct. 1211, 51 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977). If a conviction has taken place in the interim, Ray must challenge it in state court before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>collaterally attacking it in federal court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; <em>Leamer v. Fauver, </em>288 F.3d 532, 542 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Because Ray\u2019s detailed complaint alleges misconduct committed by parties not amenable to suit under \u00a7 1983 and seeks monetary and injunctive remedies that are legally barred, the District Court did not err in dismissing the complaint without giving Ray an opportunity to amend. <em>See Shane v. Fauver, </em>213 F.3d 113, 117 (3d Cir.2000) (noting that leave to amend may be denied on futility grounds). For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the appeal is merit-less and we will dismiss it under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-14\">. It appears from the exhibits attached to the complaint that Barbone was in the process of negotiating an amended plea agreement relating to the theft charge and that the report was transmitted as part of the negotiation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
