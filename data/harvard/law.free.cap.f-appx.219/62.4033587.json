We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">A grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. Beth Israel Med. Ctr. v. Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey, Inc., 448 F.3d </em>573, 579 (2d Cir.2006). \u201c[Sjummary judgment is appropriate where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and, based on the undisputed facts, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">The district court concluded that the claim against Kroogman was barred by legislative immunity. We agree. \u201cLocal legislators, like their counterparts on the state and regional levels, are entitled to absolute immunity for their legislative activities.\u201d <em>Almonte v. City of Long Beach, </em>478 F.3d 100, 106 (2d Cir.2007). This immunity \u201cis not limited to the casting of a vote on a resolution or bill; it covers all aspects of the legislative process, including the discussions held ... regarding a legislative matter in anticipation of a formal vote.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The actions complained of were part of the administration of a legislative committee\u2019s \u201cdeliberative and communicative processes.\u201d <em>Eastland v. U.S. Servicemen\u2019s Fund, </em>421 U.S. 491, 503-04, 95 S.Ct. 1813, 44 L.Ed.2d 324 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">We have considered all of Avila\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
