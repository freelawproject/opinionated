Following a California state court trial, Darden was convicted of second degree murder for the fatal shooting of Cherisse Wilson (\u201cWilson\u201d). Darden raises three challenges in her habeas petition. All fail, and are addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-17\">First, Darden argues that the erroneous inclusion of intent to kill as an element of the lower offense of voluntary manslaughter was constitutional error under <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 704, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). <em>Mullaney, </em>however, is implicated when the government is unlawfully relieved of its burden of proof, not because an additional element is added to an offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-18\">Even if a constitutional violation were present, any error was harmless under <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). The alleged error did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d because we conclude that the jury\u2019s finding of second-degree murder \u201cwas not substantially swayed\u201d by the erroneous inclusion of an intent to kill element in the lower offense of voluntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 642, 113 S.Ct. 1710; <em>see also Sullivan v. Loui</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>siana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 279, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (examining the \u201cbasis on which the jury actually rested its verdict\u201d to determine harmlessness). The strength of the evidence supporting an intent to kill eliminates any potential prejudice to Darden. <em>See Inthavong v. Lam-arque, </em>420 F.3d 1055, 1060-61 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that the court \u201cwill often make numerous independent evaluations about the weight and sufficiency of the various items of evidence, the inferences to be drawn, and the different theories of the case\u201d in the harmlessness inquiry). During their argument, Darden approached Wilson while carrying a loaded gun in her purse, and then shot Wilson in the neck at close range in a manner strongly suggesting that the safety had been previously disengaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Second, Darden argues that her due process rights were violated by the trial court\u2019s refusal to give perfect and imperfect self-defense instructions. However, due process is implicated only when a defendant fails to receive an instruction to which she is entitled. <em>Hopper v. Evans, </em>456 U.S. 605, 611, 102 S.Ct. 2049, 72 L.Ed.2d 367 (1982). Because substantial evidence of a fear of \u201cimminent danger to life or great bodily integrity\u201d did not exist, Darden was not entitled to any self-defense instructions under California law. <em>See People v. Lemus, </em>203 Cal.App.3d 470, 476, 249 Cal.Rptr. 897 (Cal.Ct.App.1988). The state court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law by denying Darden\u2019s habeas petition based on the trial court\u2019s refusal to give self-defense instructions. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405-07, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Last, Darden argues that she is entitled to habeas, or in the alternative, an evidentiary hearing, under her alleged ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Dar-den, however, has not \u201calleged facts that, if proven, would entitle [her] to habeas relief\u2019 so an evidentiary hearing is not warranted. <em>Williams v. Woodford, </em>384 F.3d 567, 586 (9th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). Darden\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was not ineffective for failure to investigate \u201creaction-response times\u201d research in shootings because it did not \u201cfall below an objective standard of reasonableness ... measured against the prevailing legal norms of the time <em>of </em>representation.\u201d <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 522-23, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). The state court\u2019s denial of Dar-den\u2019s habeas petition and request for an evidentiary hearing based on her ineffective assistance of counsel claims was not an objectively \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law. <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The district court properly denied Dar-den\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b734-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-13\">. Darden argues that habeas relief for the erroneous instruction is appropriate under a second theory, namely that the voluntary manslaughter instructions deprived her of instructions on her theory of defense. <em>Conde v. Henry, </em>198 F.3d 734, 739 (9th Cir.1999). Darden concedes that this second theory relies on the same conclusion that the instruction was erroneous under <em>Mullaney, </em>421 U.S. at 704, 95 S.Ct. 1881. We are unconvinced that a federal error is present, but even if the instructions violated Darden\u2019s constitutional rights, the error is harmless under <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710, for the reasons stated above.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
