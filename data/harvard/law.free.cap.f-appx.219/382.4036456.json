The court pretermits the issues whether Meraz adequately briefed a challenge to his appeal waiver and whether the waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-23\">Meraz argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the sentence was greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court\u2019s statements at sentencing in response to Meraz\u2019s several arguments show that the court was aware of the advisory nature of the Guidelines and that it adequately considered \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors when it sentenced Meraz. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Moreover, Meraz\u2019s sentence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>which was within the applicable guidelines range, is presumed to be reasonable, and does not present \u201crare\u201d circumstances that would warrant a conclusion that it is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
