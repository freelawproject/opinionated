We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-23\">The district court adopted the recommendations contained in the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and calculated an advisory Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months. Irvin made no objections to the PSR. Prior to the sentencing hearing, Irvin submitted a sentencing memorandum, to which he attached five character letters. At the sentencing hearing, the government called a detective involved with the investigation of Irvin\u2019s case, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>testified about the background of the case leading up to Irvin\u2019s arrest. Most of the detective\u2019s testimony corroborated information contained in the PSR. In addition, the detective testified that Irvin had forcibly performed a body cavity search on a woman whom he thought stole drugs from him and had pistol-whipped her companion who attempted to intervene. The detective received this information from the victim of the body cavity search, as well as from the confidential informant who ultimately led the detectives to Irvin. Irvin did not object to the detective\u2019s testimony, and his counsel cross-examined the detective. Irvin asked for a sentence at the bottom of the advisory range of 262 to 327 months, and the district court sentenced him to 312 months of imprisonment. Irvin claims on appeal that the district court erred in determining his sentence by relying on irrelevant and unreliable hearsay evidence from the detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Because Irvin did not object to the detective\u2019s testimony, we review his claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Sharpfish, </em>408 F.3d 507, 511 (8th Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 550 (8th Cir.) (en banc) (plain error standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 266, 163 L.Ed.2d 239 (2005). The Federal Rules of Evidence, with the exception of the privilege rules, do not apply to sentencing proceedings. Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3); <em>see also United States v. Wise, </em>976 F.2d 393, 402 (8th Cir.1992) (en banc) (\u201cUncorroborated hearsay evidence is a proper topic for the court\u2019s consideration, as long as the defendant is afforded an opportunity to explain or rebut the evidence.\u201d (internal marks omitted)), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 989, 113 S.Ct. 1592, 123 L.Ed.2d 157 (1993). Thus, a sentencing judge may base his sentencing decision on relevant hearsay evidence \u201cif it is accompanied by sufficient indicia of reliability to support the conclusion that it is probably accurate.\u201d <em>Sharpfish, </em>408 F.3d at 511. The detective who provided the hearsay evidence was involved in investigating Irvin\u2019s case, and he testified that both the victim of the body cavity search and the confidential informant gave consistent statements about Irvin\u2019s behavior. The evidence was certainly relevant to the district court\u2019s consideration of Irvin\u2019s history and characteristics under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), particularly in light of the character letters submitted by Irvin. Given the state of the record, we cannot say the district court plainly erred in considering the unobjected to hearsay evidence when it determined Irvin\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Irvin does not contest the district court\u2019s calculation of the advisory Guidelines range. We review his ultimate sentence for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and we find nothing to suggest that the district court acted unreasonably in sentencing Irvin toward the top end of the advisory Guidelines range. The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-12\">.
