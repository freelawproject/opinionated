For the following reasons, we will dismiss the petition in part for lack of jurisdiction; to the extent we have jurisdiction, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-27\">Ng, native and citizen of Indonesia, entered the United States on or about August 5, 1999, on a non-immigrant visitor\u2019s visa. Ng was authorized to remain for a temporary period not to extend beyond January 29, 2000. But he remained in the United States for longer than permitted and a removal proceeding was initiated against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-28\">On April 1, 2002, Ng applied for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Identifying himself as a Christian \u201cIndonesian of Chinese descent\u201d in his affidavit, Ng stated he had been the victim of two robberies in Indonesia, in 1992 and 1999,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that prompted his decision to move to the United States for greater safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-29\">On August 17, 2004, the IJ found Ng ineligible for asylum under section 208 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, because of failure to file his application within one year of the date of his arrival in the United States or to establish either changed or extraordinary circumstances sufficient to excuse the delay. He also found Ng ineligible for protection under the Convention Against Torture Act. Ng appealed to the BIA, which adopted and affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge, dismissing the appeal. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA when, as here, the BIA adopts the findings of the IJ and discusses the underlying bases for the decision. <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Whether this Court has jurisdiction over an untimely asylum claim is a question of law, reviewable <em>de novo. See Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2003). Whether petitioner has demonstrated past persecution, a well-founded fear of future persecution, a clear probability of persecution, or that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured in Indonesia, are factual determinations reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Reynoso-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>369 F.3d 275, 278 (3d Cir.2004) (citing <em>Senathirajah v. INS, </em>157 F.3d 210, 216 (3d Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Ng\u2019s untimely asylum claim. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to any alien who qualifies as a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). Asylum eligibility depends on proof that an applicant is unable or unwilling to return to his home country \u201cbecause of persecution or well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see also INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Further, \u201ca showing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Mulanga v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 123, 132 (3d Cir.2003) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)). The burden of proving persecution is on the asylum applicant. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a); <em>see also Ambartsoumian v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 85, 88 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">But, the alien must demonstrate \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Notwithstanding the one year limitation, a tardy application may be considered if the applicant \u201cdemonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) we lack jurisdiction to review Ng\u2019s untimely asylum application. As noted, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General that an asylum application was not filed within the one year limitations period and that such period was not tolled by extraordinary circumstances. <em>Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627, 633-35 (3d Cir.2006); <em>see also Tarrawally, </em>338 F.3d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">Assuming we had jurisdiction, the factual determination about past persecution or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>fear of future persecution, as well as credibility determinations, are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 212, 216 (3d Cir. 2005). These determinations must be upheld \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). To support an asylum claim, persecution means severe conduct, and \u201cdoes not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Li v. Attorney General, </em>400 F.3d 157, 167 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The record here, particularly Ng\u2019s testimony, does not compel a conclusion contrary to that reached by the IJ and the BIA. The two robberies that victimized Ng in Indonesia would not constitute past persecution, nor were they sufficiently \u201csevere\u201d to justify a finding of past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution in the future. Ng\u2019s contention that \u201cmany equities ... weigh in favor of a positive exercise of discretion\u201d including his \u201csignificant period of time in the United States,\u201d his obedience of the laws, and his good character, does not compel a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">If Ng could not meet the \u201celigibility requirements for asylum he could not meet the more stringent applicable standard for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Mudric v. Attorney General, </em>469 F.3d 94, 102 n. 8 (3d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Janusiak v. INS, </em>947 F.2d 46, 47 (3d Cir.1991)). This would require demonstrating by \u201ca clear probability\u201d that his life or freedom would be threatened in Indonesia. <em>Li Wu Lin v. INS, </em>238 F.3d 239, 244 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>Chang v. INS, </em>119 F.3d 1055, 1066 (3d Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Ng was not able to qualify for relief from removal under the Convention Against Torture because he did not meet the burden of proving that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be tortured in Indonesia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). The standard for relief under the Convention on Torture \u201c \u2018has no subjective component, but instead requires the alien to establish, by objective evidence\u2019 that he is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 175 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>In re J-E- </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 291, 302, 2002 WL 481156 (BIA Mar. 22, 2002) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Accordingly, we will dismiss the petition in part for lack of jurisdiction; to the extent we have jurisdiction, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-20\">.
