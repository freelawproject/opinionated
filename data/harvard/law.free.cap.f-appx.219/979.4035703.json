Nicholson, </em>2006-7362. Lucien J. Ingrassia opposes and moves to dismiss the Secretary\u2019s appeal. The Secretary opposes the motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The court considers sua sponte whether summary affirmance of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 judgment, <em>Ingrassia v. Nicholson, </em>04-516, 2006 WL 2128621 (Vet. App. 2006), is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-28\">In <em>Mayfield v. Nicholson, </em>444 F.3d 1328, 1333 (Fed.Cir.2006), we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-29\">[T]he duty of affirmative notification [as to the evidence that is needed and who shall be responsible for providing it] is not satisfied by various post-decisional communications from which a claimant might have been able to infer what evidence the VA found lacking in the claimant\u2019s presentation____ [S]ection 5103 requires the VCAA notification to be issued prior to the initial decision on the claim, not afterwards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-31\">In the decision on appeal, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims determined that \u201cthe Board relied solely on post-deci-sional documents in determining that Mr. Ingrassia received adequate notice under section 5103(a)\u201d thus committing remanda-ble error under <em>Mayfield.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-32\">Summary affirmance of a case \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed. Cir.1994) (summarily affirming the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 dismissal of a complaint). The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims correctly determined that remand was required pursuant to <em>Mayfield. </em>Thus, because no substantial question exists regarding the outcome of the Secretary\u2019s appeal, the court summarily affirms the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">(1) The motion to stay is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">(2) The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1005-24\"> We grant the Secretary's motion for an extension of time to file his opposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
