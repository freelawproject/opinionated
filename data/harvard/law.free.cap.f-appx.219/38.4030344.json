July 25, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-18\">When the BIA denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or concluso-ry statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-19\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Liu\u2019s motion to reopen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>proceedings because Liu failed to abide by the time limitations for such motions, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. 1003.2(c)(2) (providing a 90-day deadline); <em>In re G-C-L-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 359, 362 (B.I.A.2002) (announcing that BIA would no longer accept untimely reopening motions based on coercive population control policies after July 9, 2002, and Liu failed to establish that he had a cognizable reason for not meeting the July 9, 2002, deadline). <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Moreover, to the extent that Liu challenges the BIA\u2019s refusal to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to consider the merits of his claim, the present case is beyond the Court\u2019s review, because the decision of the BIA whether to reopen a case <em>sua sponte </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) is entirely discretionary. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, we DENY Liu\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
