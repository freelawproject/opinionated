The district court sentenced Williamson to 270 months\u2019 imprisonment, and Williamson appealed. His counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal but requesting this Court review the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy and the sentence. Williamson did not file a pro se supplemental brief, despite being notified of his right to do so. The Government declined to file a responsive brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Counsel contends the district court erred in accepting Williamson\u2019s guilty plea when it faded to advise Williamson of any applicable forfeiture. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. ll(b)(l)(J). Williamson did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea; therefore, we review his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (holding \u201cplain error analysis is the proper standard for review of forfeited error in the Rule 11 context\u201d). We find the alleged error did not affect Williamson\u2019s substantial rights and therefore find no plain error in the court\u2019s acceptance of Williamson\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">Counsel also contends the district court erred when it failed to require the Government to move for a downward departure pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5K1.1 (2005). Williamson did not raise this issue in the district court, so it is reviewed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>plain error. The district court was not obligated to require the Government to move for a downward departure at the sentencing hearing. The Government remained the appropriate party to assess whether Williamson cooperated adequately to that point, and it was entitled to have that assessment reviewed only for bad faith or unconstitutional motive, neither of which Williamson alleged. <em>See United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir.2000). Thus, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Finally, counsel contends the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). In determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are required to calculate and consider the applicable guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). We will affirm a post-Booker sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, 445 </em>F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"A8N\">Williamson\u2019s sentence was both within the guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment and below the statutory maximum of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) (2000). The district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guidelines range and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We conclude the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Williamson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Williamson, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Williamson requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Williamson. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
