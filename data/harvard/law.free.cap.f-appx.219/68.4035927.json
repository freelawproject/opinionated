Treece recommending dismissal of plaintiffs complaint, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. PlaintifPs complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as punitive damages, against defendant Robert Dennison, Chairman of the New York State Board of Parole (\u201cParole Board\u201d), for alleged due process violations committed in connection with the Parole Board\u2019s decision denying plaintiff parole. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the issues on appeal and the procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Upon a review of the record, and substantially for the reasons set forth in the portions of Magistrate Judge Treeee\u2019s ruling that were adopted by the District Court, we conclude that the District Court did not err in holding that plaintiff\u2019s requests for punitive damages and injunctive relief were barred by the Eleventh Amendment, defendant\u2019s absolute immunity from suit, and \u00a7 1983. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that plaintiffs request for declaratory relief is not barred by immunity doctrines or \u00a7 1983, it nonetheless fails on the merits. New York State\u2019s parole scheme does not create a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. <em>See Barna v. Travis, </em>239 F.3d 169, 171 (2d Cir.2001). Thus, plaintiff has no basis for arguing that defendant\u2019s alleged actions violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">We have considered all of plaintiffs arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
