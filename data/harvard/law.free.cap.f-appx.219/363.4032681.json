The BIA declined to consider arguments similar to Sarfraz\u2019s first two arguments in its denial of Sarfraz\u2019s motion to reconsider because it already had considered the arguments in its affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision, and the BIA denied the third argument on the merits. Sarfraz does not address any of the BIA\u2019s stated reasons for denying these claims. Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Al-Ra\u2019id v. Ingle, </em>69 F.3d 28, 33 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Sarfraz also argues for the first time in his petition for review that his due process rights were violated when the IJ determined that he was eligible for voluntary departure and that his case was unfairly treated differently than his brother\u2019s case. He also contends that he is entitled to reopen his case because of his marriage to a United States citizen and because of the approval of his 1-140 application after the BIA denied his motion to reconsider. However, because Sarfraz did not exhaust his administrative remedies concerning these issues by first raising them before the BIA, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Sarfraz\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. The Government\u2019s motions for summary affirmance and for dismissal of the case are DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
