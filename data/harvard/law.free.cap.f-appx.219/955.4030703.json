The first trial resulted in a mistrial because of a hung jury. After the second jury trial, Harper was found guilty of robbing the Conyers SouthTrust Bank in July 2004 and March 2003, robbing the Perimeter SouthTrust Bank in April 2003, using firearms to commit the three robberies, and being a felon in possession of the pistol recovered from the March 2004 robbery in Conyers (Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). The jury acquitted Harper of robbing the Perimeter SouthTrust Bank in September 2000. Harper was sentenced to 1,044 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-23\">Harper presents the following issues for appellate review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-24\">1. Whether the district court abused its discretion in not conducting an eviden-tiary hearing on Harper\u2019s second supplemental motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-25\">2. Whether the district court abused its discretion in permitting Agent Fonseca and Lt. Dunn to testify about their interview of Mrs. Harper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>3. Whether the district court committed plain error in permitting Agent Fonse-ca and Lt. Dunn to testify about their interview of Mrs. Harper in violation of the Confrontation Clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-4\">4. Whether the district court, after considering the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), imposed an unreasonable sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-5\">5. Whether Almendarez-Torres, 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is viable post <em>Booker.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">After reviewing the record, reading the parties\u2019 briefs, and having the benefit of oral argument, we conclude that there is no merit to any of the arguments Harper makes in this appeal. Accordingly, we affirm his convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
