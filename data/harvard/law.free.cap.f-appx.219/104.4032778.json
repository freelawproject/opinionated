July 22, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 264 409 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 17, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Where, as here, the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun </em>Gao <em>v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). However, we review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). We will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 336-340 (2d Cir.2006) (agreeing with this principle, but avoiding remand in spite of deficiencies in an adverse credibility determination because it could be confidently predicted that the IJ would adhere to the decision). We construe <em>pro se </em>litigants\u2019 briefs liberally, reading such submissions to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest. <em>See Burgos v. Hopkins, </em>14 F.3d 787, 790 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">The IJ\u2019s finding regarding the vagueness of Canaj\u2019s testimony was not supported by substantial evidence and could not on its own sustain an adverse credibility determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While Canaj\u2019s testimony was \u201cspare,\u201d it identified sufficient facts to establish each element of her claim for asylum. <em>Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 114 (2d Cir.2005). In cases of persecution on account of an imputed political opinion, it is the persecutor\u2019s perception of the applicant\u2019s opinion that matters. <em>See Chun Gao, </em>424 F.3d at 129. Canaj testified that during two separate incidents \u2014 an attempted kidnapping in May 2002 and a rape in June 2002 \u2014 her attackers called her a \u201cdirty democrat.\u201d The IJ acknowledged that \u201cif a person ... makes mention of somebody being a \u2018dirty democrat\u2019 that ... provides very convincing evidence, if true, of a nexus in the mind of the persecutor.\u201d Canaj\u2019s testimony that she suffered egregious physical harm on account of what her alleged persecutors perceived to be objectionable political beliefs was therefore not vague, but rather established the elements required for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>Jin Chen, </em>426 F.3d. at 114; <em>Chun Gao, </em>424 F.3d at 129; <em>see also Tian-Yong Chen, </em>359 F.3d at 128 (persecution clearly includes physical harm that threatens the victim\u2019s \u201clife or freedom,\u201d and non-life-threatening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>violence and physical abuse may constitute persecution as well) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, to the extent that Canaj\u2019s claim was based on the persecution allegedly suffered by her husband, the rape and attempted kidnapping of Canaj by men who called her a \u201cdirty democrat\u201d may sufficiently establish past persecution of Canaj herself, independent of any harm that befell her husband. <em>See TianYong Chen, </em>359 F.3d at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The IJ\u2019s decision failed to point to any details absent in Canaj\u2019s testimony that were necessary to establish her claim. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 151 (2d Cir.2003). The IJ noted that there was a lack of detail concerning her and her husband\u2019s activities in support of the Democratic Party, but these facts were not crucial to her asylum eligibility when she had already provided testimony that her attackers perceived her as supporting the Democratic Party. <em>See id.; see also Chun Gao, </em>424 F.3d at 129. Because Canaj\u2019s testimony was specific as to the \u201cessential facts ... [it] was sufficiently specific to establish past persecution.\u201d <em>Jin Chen, </em>426 F.3d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The IJ\u2019s flawed vagueness finding cannot be overcome by affirming \u201con the alternative ground that [Canaj] failed to discharge [her] burden of proof by faffing to submit sufficient corroboration.\u201d <em>Jin Chen, </em>426 F.3d at 115. Because the critical factor was the persecutors\u2019 perception of Canaj\u2019s political opinion, <em>see Chun Gao, </em>424 F.3d at 129, and not the extent of her and her husband\u2019s involvement with the Democratic Party, it was unnecessary for Canaj to provide corroborative testimony from her husband and relatives about her or her husband\u2019s political activism. <em>Cf. Jin Shui Qiu, </em>329 F.3d at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Most importantly, \u201ca lack of corroboration is not a sufficient basis on its own for denying a claim where testimony was credible, specific, and detailed.\u201d <em>See Jin Chen, </em>426 F.3d at 115 (citing <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287-88 (2d Cir.2000)). Neither can a lack of corroboration form the sole basis for an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 287. As in <em>Jin Chen, </em>\u201cto the extent that the IJ relied on the lack of corroboration of [Canaj\u2019s] claims, such a finding was <em>inextricably intertwined </em>with the IJ\u2019s erroneous findings that [her] testimony in support of [her] claim ... was incredible and lacking in detail or specificity.\u201d <em>See </em>426 F.3d at 115 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Because of the aforementioned errors, the IJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence and it cannot be confidently predicted how the agency would decide Canaj\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims on remand, absent those errors. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 336-340. Remand is therefore required. Accordingly, we grant the petition for review with regard to Canaj\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">Canaj did not apply for relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) before the IJ. (Regardless, the IJ found that Canaj was not eligible for CAT relief.) Canaj\u2019s brief to the BIA did not address CAT relief outside of a single cursory reference. Thus, even though Canaj devotes a portion of her brief to this Court to the question of CAT relief, that issue was not properly exhausted before either the IJ or the BIA. We therefore lack jurisdiction to review it and dismiss the petition for review in this regard. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 343 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED in part and DISMISSED in part, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this order. Having completed our review, petitioner\u2019s pending mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>tion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\">. The IJ noted several inconsistencies in the record, but characterized them as minor and rejected them as an alternative basis for his adverse credibility determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
