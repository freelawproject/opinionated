Blasingame was sentenced to a total of nineteen years imprisonment, and Bradley was sentenced to a total of sixteen years and two months imprisonment. Bla-singame independently raises two issues on appeal: (1) the district court plainly erred in allowing the introduction of a non-testifying codefendant\u2019s confession, which implicated Blasingame; and (2) the district court erred in allowing the admission of a photograph depicting Blasingame\u2019s gunshot wound and tattoo.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">Bradley independently raises five issues on appeal: (1) the district court informed the jury of Bradley\u2019s incarceration in violation of his due process rights; (2) the district court erred in denying Bradley\u2019s Motion for Severance; (3) the district court erred in allowing a government agent to testify that a witness refused to testify out of fear; (4) the district court erred in allowing prosecutors to improperly cross examine Bradley\u2019s alibi witnesses; and (5) the district court erred in allowing the prosecutors to read several witnesses\u2019 prior testimonies aloud. In addition, both Defendants appeal their sentences pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons explained herein, we find no reversible error and affirm both Defendants\u2019 convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b963-15\">On April 8, 2003, a federal grand jury returned a two-count superseding indictment charging Defendants Blasingame and Bradley along with five other coconspirators<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Count One with conspiracy to commit robbery of a business involved in interstate commerce, and in Count Two with using and carrying a firearm. Both Defendants pled not guilty at arraignment and were incarcerated pending trial. A jury trial was held beginning October 27, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-16\">At trial, Milton Prince and Paul Sample-ton, both employees of Brinks Armored Car Company, recounted the events that took place during the attempted robbery of their truck on May 1, 2002. Paul Sam-pleton, a supervisor at Brinks, testified that on that particular morning the usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>driver for the route did not come to work and Sampleton had to fill in as driver that day. He arrived at the First Union Bank on Flat Shoals Parkway in Decatur, Georgia at approximately 9 a.m. to deliver cash to the bank. Although the regular driver usually parked in a particular area, he noticed that there was an abundance of cars in that area and decided to back the truck up to the bank on the opposite side of the building. He testified that after he parked he observed a suspicious gray Suburban circling the parking lot several times. Minutes later he heard a shotgun blast and saw that his partner, Milton Prince, had been shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Prince testified that he was taking coins off the truck to deliver to the bank when he heard footsteps behind him. When he turned around a man with a ski mask fired a shotgun at him. Although Prince had been hit, he managed to climb inside the Brinks truck and yelled for Sampleton to leave. A second masked man attempted to enter the truck and fired his weapon several times. As the truck pulled out of the parking lot the second individual fell off the truck and Sampleton was able to flee the scene. Although no money was taken, Prince was shot in the chest, arm and foot. He showed the jury where the shot was embedded in his arm and testified that he continues to experience pain in his foot. Because both robbers were masked, neither Sampleton nor Prince was able to identify either shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Three cooperating co-defendants, Willard Mahan, Andy Marbury, and Michael Davis, testified at trial. Mahan testified that as a former employee of Brinks, he was responsible for devising the plan to rob the truck. He testified that co-conspirator Dwight Elder advised him as to when the truck would be making the deliveries and how much money would be on the truck because he had a contact who was still employed with Brinks. Mahan testified that he and others had attempted to rob the Brinks truck on numerous prior occasions. All attempts failed and he testified that he recruited Blasingame and Bradley because he felt they were people on whom he could depend. Marbury testified that he had been in involved in the conspiracy since the beginning and his account of the events leading up to the attempted robbery were consistent with Ma-han\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Davis, who had not met either Blasin-game or Bradley until the night before the attempted robbery, named Defendants as the gunmen on the day of his arrest before entering into any agreement with the Government. Davis\u2019s account of the conspiracy and attempted robbery were also consistent with Mahan\u2019s testimony. In addition, Davis testified that he was threatened by Blasingame while they were in custody together at the Union City Jail. Davis testified that Blasingame \u201cexpressed to me that he read my testimony and he knew what I said and if I testified, I\u2019d better stay in jail or he would kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">Mahan, Marbury, and Davis all admitted that they were cooperating with the Government in order to receive shorter sentences and that they all had used either marijuana or cocaine. In addition, the following inconsistencies were shown in their testimony: (1) Marbury stated that he did not provide Davis with cocaine or rum on the day of the robbery, but Davis stated that he did; (2) Mahan told the Grand Jury that the handgun used in the robbery was not his, but later admitted that he gave his handgun to Bradley to use during the robbery; (3) A government agent\u2019s report indicated that Marbury initially stated he used Elder\u2019s Mercedes, yet Mar-bury testified at trial that the Mercedes he used belonged to his mother and the agent was mistaken; (4) Davis called Marbury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>\u201cAndy Rapper\u201d on one occasion; (5) Davis initially said he was picked up from his house, but then testified that he was picked up at the bus stop \u201cright up the street\u201d from his house; (6) Mahan testified that Marbury was driving his mother\u2019s Mercedes, but he previously indicated Marbury was driving his mother\u2019s Monte Carlo.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Clifford Wilson, a close friend of both defendants, testified that Defendant Bradley admitted to him on the day of the robbery that he and Defendant Blasin-game participated in the attempted robbery of the Brinks armored truck. Wilson testified further that he was told by Defendant Mahan and Defendant Bradley that they planned to rob a Brinks truck. He also testified that the conspirators had gathered at Mahan\u2019s home the night before the robbery attempt to discuss the final details of the robbery, and that Bla-singame was present that night. Wilson also testified about statements allegedly made to him by Bradley in which Bradley stated that he and Blasingame participated in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Blasingame chose to testify in his own defense and testified that he did not know Michael Davis, and that co-defendants Ma-han and Marbury were \u201cnot in his social circle.\u201d However, Blasingame could not account for his whereabouts on the morning of the robbery. He claimed at first to have been at work, but when pressed could not say for whom, where, or for what period of time he worked that day. Bla-singame then claimed that he could have been working in his yard that morning. He also claimed that because he had asthma he could not have been one of the shooters who ran up to the truck during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Blasingame called Alexis Bradley who confirmed that Blasingame had asthma and stated that he could not run. In addition, Toyin Kadiya testified that she witnessed the attempted robbery and that the shooter she saw through the tinted window of the vehicle was darker than Blasingame. She first testified that she ducked into the seat as soon as she saw the man with the gun exit his vehicle, but then stated that she saw the man with the gun shoot before ducking into her seat. Further, the jury was shown a picture of a window of a vehicle that had heavily tinted windows and Kadiya agreed that was what the window of the robber\u2019s car had looked like when she saw through it.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">In his defense Bradley presented the testimony of Ronald Christian and Christian\u2019s nephew, Jeffrey Bernard Christian. Both testified that on May 1, 2002 at 9:15 in the morning while they were cutting the grass in Bradley\u2019s yard they spoke to Bradley about a party he had thrown. Ronald\u2019s log book, which referenced cutting Bradley\u2019s grass on that day, was admitted to corroborate his testimony. He also testified that he knew what time it was when he saw Bradley that day because his routine was to take his child to school, return to his home to get his lawn equipment, pick up his nephew, and proceed to the lawn he was cutting on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Bradley also presented the testimony of his fiancee, Larhonda Ward, who testified that Bradley drove her to work on the day in question, and therefore could not have been at the scene of the attempted robbery across town. She testified that she knew it was May 1, 2002, because she was pregnant and suffering from morning sickness, but had to go to work anyway because it was the first of the month.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">On cross-examination all three witnesses had no recollection of dates and times of significant events that had occurred in their own lives, but maintained that they recalled the specific date and time of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>conversations with Bradley. Further, Ward admitted that her son was born exactly nine months after the attempted robbery, suggesting that it was unlikely that she was suffering from morning sickness on the morning in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Upon deliberation the jury convicted Bradley and Blasingame of both counts in the indictment. Blasingame timely moved for a new trial on four grounds: (1) the court erred in allowing Wilson to testify about Bradley\u2019s confession; (2) the court erred in admitting a photograph showing his tattoo; (3) the court sentenced him pursuant to the unconstitutional sentencing guidelines; and (4) the court\u2019s comments informed the jury that he was incarcerated. Bradley also timely filed a Motion for a New Trial arguing that the court should not have used the federal sentencing guidelines, and that he was prejudiced when the jury was informed that he was incarcerated. The district court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">In determining Blasingame\u2019s sentencing guidelines range with respect to Count One, the probation officer assigned Blasin-game a base offense level of 20, pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B3.1. This base offense level was increased by two since \u201cthe property of a financial institution ... was taken, or ... the taking of such property was an object of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l). Because Blasingame discharged a firearm seriously wounding the Brinks employee, his base level was further increased by four for causing serious bodily injury. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(B). Blasingame also received a four-level enhancement for being an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more persons, <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(a) and a two-level enhancement for obstructing justice. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. With these enhancements, Blasingame\u2019s total offense level was 32, and when coupled with his Criminal History Category of II, his guidelines range on Count One was 135 to 168 months. As to Count Two, there were no guidelines calculations because that offense called for a consecutive statutory mandatory minimum term of ten years. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.4,18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Blasingame objected to the leadership role enhancement, as well as the obstruction of justice enhancement, on sufficiency of evidence grounds. At sentencing, the district court overruled Blasingame\u2019s objection to the obstruction of justice enhancement, but sustained his objection to the leadership enhancement because there was insufficient evidence that he played a leadership role. Without that enhancement Blasingame\u2019s new total offense level was 28, and his guidelines range for Count One was 87 to 108 months. The court sentenced Blasingame to 108 months in prison as to Count One and to a consecutive 120 months prison term on Count Two for a total sentence of 228 months. In imposing the sentence the court remarked that it pronounced a sentence at the top of the guidelines range \u201cbecause of the aggravating factors in this case; based on the evidence in the case, there was an actual attempt to kill one of the drivers of the vehicle.\u201d Blasingame did not raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence based on his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">In determining Bradley\u2019s sentencing guidelines range with respect to Count One, the probation officer assigned him a base offense level of 20, pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B3.1. This base offense level was increased by two since \u201cthe property of a financial institution ... was taken, or ... the taking of such property was an object of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l). Because Bradley discharged a firearm seriously wounding the Brinks employee, his base offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>level was further increased by four for causing serious bodily injury. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(B). Bradley also received a four-level enhancement for being an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more persons, <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(a), and a two-level enhancement for obstructing justice. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. As a result of these enhancements, Bradley\u2019s total offense level was 32, and, when coupled with his Criminal History Category of I, his guidelines range on Count One was 121 to 151 months. As to Count Two, there were no guidelines calculations because that offense called for a consecutive statutory mandatory minimum term of ten years, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 and \u00a7 924(c). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.4, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Bradley objected to receiving the enhancements for being a leader and for obstructing justice on sufficiency of the evidence grounds. At sentencing, the district court sustained both of Bradley\u2019s objections, which yielded a new total offense level of 26 and a guidelines range of 63 to 78 months. Bradley then requested a downward departure due to poor pre-trial prison conditions. The district court denied his request, stating \u201cI don\u2019t think a downward departure is appropriate but I will consider that type of punishment when I impose a sentence on Count 1.\u201d The district court also asked defense counsel to address its \u201cconcern\u201d that Bradley\u2019s co-defendant, Patrick Blasingame, seemed to be more of the leader, and Bradley seemed to be more of the follower. The district court commented that while Bradley\u2019s role would not be \u201cgrounds for a downward departure,\u201d it would be a consideration in determining where to sentence Bradley within the guidelines range. After hearing argument on this point, the district court said \u201cI\u2019m not going to the bottom of the guideline range but I\u2019m going to the upper level of 74 months.\u201d When the Government attempted to defend the pre-trial prison conditions Bradley was subjected to, the district court explained that its reason for the \u201creduction is more on the grounds that my impression is that Mr. Bradley was more of a follower in this situation.\u201d The court then sentenced Bradley to 74 months on Count One, 120 months on Count Two, to be served consecutively, for a total of 194 months. Bradley did not raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence based on his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">II. Defendant Blasingame</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">\n<em>A. Bradley\u2019s Confession to Clifford Wilson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">First, Blasingame argues that his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated, according to the rule announced in <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), when Bradley\u2019s confession to Clifford Wilson, which also implicated Blasingame, was entered into evidence. Although Blasingame admits he did not object to the testimony in the district court, he nevertheless argues that he did not waive the <em>Bruton </em>issue because the Government failed to comply with its duty under Rule 14 to notify the district court of a potential <em>Bruton </em>issue. He argues that Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure imposed an implicit duty upon the Government to make the district court aware of any potential <em>Bruton </em>issue. Pursuant to that alleged duty, Blasingame argues that the Government\u2019s failure to put the parties or the district court on notice that a <em>Bruton </em>issue existed in the case excuses his failure to object in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that \u201c[bjefore ruling on a defendant\u2019s motion to sever, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>court may order an attorney for the Government to deliver to the court for <em>in camera </em>inspection any defendant\u2019s statement that the Government intends to use as evidence.\u201d The text of the rule clearly imposes a duty upon the Government to notify the court of a potential <em>Bruton </em>issue only after being ordered to do so by the court. Nothing in the record indicates that the district court ever contemplated or entered such an order. Accordingly, since the text of Rule 14 does not impose a duty upon the Government to introduce <em>Bruton </em>issues absent a court order, any failure on the Government\u2019s part to comply with this nonexistent duty cannot excuse Blasingame\u2019s failure to object to the testimony. Because Blasingame failed to object to Wilson\u2019s testimony at trial, he must show that the district court committed plain error by allowing a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession into evidence. Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">To establish plain error a defendant must show (1) that the district court erred, (2) that the error was plain, and (3) that the error was prejudicial. <em>United States v. Foree, </em>43 F.3d 1572, 1578 (11th Cir.1995) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-79, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). With respect to the third element, it \u201cis the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508. Further, even if a defendant established all three elements, an error should only be corrected if it \u201cseriously affectfs] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Foree, </em>43 F.3d at 1579 (citing <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736-38, 113 S.Ct. at 1779-80, 123 L.Ed.2d 508).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">In <em>Bruton, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the admission of a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession, which directly implicated the defendant, violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, even if the jury was given instructions to consider the confession only against the co-defendant. 391 U.S. at 126, 88 S.Ct. at 1622, 20 L.Ed.2d 476. The Court explained that the credibility of these types of confessions was not only inherently suspect, but was especially unreliable when the confession could not be tested on cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 88 S.Ct. at 1628, 20 L.Ed.2d 476. Here, Clifford Wilson was allowed to testify that Bradley confessed that he and Blasingame participated in the attempted robbery. As Bradley did not take the stand, Blasin-game was not allowed the opportunity to cross-examine him about these allegations. Yet, even if we assume that allowing Wilson\u2019s testimony was error and that the error was sufficiently plain to satisfy the second prong of the plain error test, Bla-singame cannot meet the hefty burden of showing that the error affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">In an attempt to satisfy the prejudice element of the plain error test, Blasingame asserts that Wilson\u2019s testimony was the only incriminating evidence presented by a witness not cooperating with the Government. He claims that the three cooperating witnesses who implicated him were \u201csuccessfully impeached\u201d and that an eyewitness to the incident could not identify him as one of the robbers. He also points to <em>United States v. Veltmann, </em>6 F.3d 1483 (11th Cir.1993), and <em>United States v. Morales, </em>477 F.2d 1309 (5th Cir.1973),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as similar cases in which a <em>Bruton </em>error amounted to reversible error. Finally, he argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>that the prejudice requirement is satisfied because Wilson\u2019s testimony was by far the most damaging evidence presented. Contrary to Blasingame\u2019s assertion, the prejudice requirement of the plain error test is not established merely because the error allowed damaging evidence to be admitted. Blasingame must show that the error affected the outcome of the district court proceeding. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005) (citing <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 632, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Initially, the cases cited by Blasingame do not advance his argument as they are inapplicable to the facts of this case. In <em>Veltmann, </em>this court reviewed a <em>Bruton </em>violation under the harmless error standard, not the plain error standard that is applicable here. 6 F.3d at 1501. Although both standards are similar, the harmless error standard places the burden on the Government to prove the error did not affect the outcome of the proceedings, while the plain error standard places the burden on the defendant to establish that the error did affect the outcome of the proceeding. Likewise, although the Morales court did review a <em>Bruton </em>error under the plain error standard, the case was decided before the Supreme Court established, in <em>Olano, </em>the specific elements and burdens of the plain error standard. The <em>Morales </em>court rather concluded that the improperly admitted confession amounted to plain error because the confession was one the major pieces of evidence that linked the defendant to the crime. 477 F.2d at 1316. Under <em>Olano, </em>a defendant must establish not only that the improperly admitted confession contributed to the outcome of the proceeding, but that without the confession the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508. Moreover, as the prejudice element of the plain error test heavily depends on the facts of the particular case, there can be no hard and fast rule that will apply to every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">Further, all three cooperating co-conspirators consistently told the same general story and all identified Blasingame as one of the shooters. Although defense counsel was able to point out some discrepancies in their testimonies, the cooperating co-conspirators were far from successfully impeached; any discrepancies in their testimonies were minor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aso, the fact that the three co-conspirators all cooperated with the Government does not, as Blasingame suggests, mean that their testimony should be summarily ignored in determining whether the district court\u2019s error prejudiced Blasingame. Athough the fact that the co-conspirators were cooperating with the Government in exchange for shorter sentences may have made the jury more skeptical of their testimony, there is no evidence that suggests that the jury completely disregarded their testimony, especially considering the consistency of their statements. Further, although the eyewitness stated the man she saw was darker than Blasingame, she saw the man through the heavily tinted rear window of a vehicle and testified that she ducked immediately after seeing the gun. Given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>the overwhelming evidence provided by the cooperating co-defendants, who each identified Blasingame as one of the shooters, the jury likely placed little weight in her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Because the trial transcript establishes that there was substantial independent evidence of Blasingame\u2019s involvement, we find that Wilson\u2019s testimony regarding Bradley\u2019s confession was just another cumulative piece of evidence establishing Blasingame\u2019s guilt. Initially, all three cooperating co-conspirators testified that Bla-singame was one of the shooters during the attempted robbery. In addition, although Blasingame took the stand asserting his innocence, he could not affirmatively recall where he was or what he was doing the morning of the attempted robbery. Blasingame first asserted that he was working that morning, but after he could not recall where or for whom he worked, he admitted that he may have been at his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">In addition, the properly admitted remainder of Wilson\u2019s testimony also established Blasingame\u2019s involvement. Wilson independently testified that Blasingame was present at Mahan\u2019s home the night before the robbery when the plans for the robbery were finalized. This testimony confirmed the testimony of all three cooperating co-defendants that Blasingame was involved in the planning of the robbery and had been present the night before when the details were finalized. As there was substantial and overwhelming evidence of Blasingame\u2019s involvement, independent of Wilson\u2019s testimony, Blasingame cannot meet the prejudice requirement of the plain error test.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">\n<em>B. Picture of Blasingame\u2019s Tattoo and Wound</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Blasingame next argues that the district court erred when it allowed the Government to introduce into evidence a photograph of his torso, which showed his tattoo and a gunshot wound. Mahan, one of the cooperating co-conspirators, testified at trial that in order to help identify the person he knew to be \u201cPat,\u201d he described to authorities a scar that \u201cPat\u201d had on his stomach. Agent Fonseca also testified that Mahan had described \u201cPat\u2019s\u201d scar and tattoos and recounted Mahan\u2019s description of the scar for the jury. Over Blasingame\u2019s objection, the district court admitted a photograph of Blasingame taken at the time of his arrest that depicted a similar scar and numerous tattoos for the purpose of showing that \u201cPat\u201d was Blasin-game and to corroborate Mahan\u2019s identification of the defendant as one of the two masked gunmen who shot the victim. Bla-singame argues initially that the photograph is not relevant and should not have been admitted into evidence. He asserts that the Government\u2019s proffered reasons for introducing the photograph are not valid. In the alternative, Blasingame argues that even if the photograph is relevant in some way, the prejudicial impact of the photograph far outweighed any probative value it had.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for a clear abuse of discretion and will only reverse an erroneous ruling if it affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088, 1119 (2002). District courts have broad discretion in admitting relevant evidence. <em>United States v. Terzado-Madruga, </em>897 F.2d 1099, 1117 (11th Cir.1990) <em>(citing United States v. Finestone, </em>816 F.2d 583, 585 (11th Cir.1987)). Thus, \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence\u201d is generally admitted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401. In contrast, a district court\u2019s discretion under Rule 403 to exclude relevant evidence because it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>be unfairly prejudicial is limited. <em>Fine-stone, </em>816 F.2d at 585. Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is an extraordinary remedy that should be utilized sparingly. <em>United States v. Elkins, </em>885 F.2d 775, 785 (11th Cir.1989). Furthermore, because the balancing test under Rule 403 should favor admissibility, this court views the evidence \u201cin a light most favorable to its admission, maximizing its probative value and minimizing its undue prejudicial impact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 785 (citing <em>Finestone, </em>816 F.2d at 585).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Blasingame first argues that the photograph was not relevant and that the reasons proffered by the Government for its introduction are not valid. Blasingame argues that Mahan had known him for over ten years and therefore the photograph was not needed to prove his identity. Because Mahan\u2019s testimony clearly shows that he initially identified the shooter as \u201cPat,\u201d the Government used the photograph to show that \u201cPat\u201d was actually Blasingame. Blasingame also contends that because Mahan did not describe the scar and tattoos to the jury, there was no evidence to show whether the photograph was consistent with Mahan\u2019s description of the scar and tattoos. Agent Fonseca, however, recounted Mahan\u2019s description of the scar for the jury. Thus, the photograph was admitted to allow the jury to see whether the scar in the photograph matched \u201cPat\u2019s\u201d scar that Mahan described to Agent Fonseca.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Blasingame also asserts that if the photograph was relevant he was unfairly prejudiced by it because a jury would be persuaded that a man with a gunshot wound and graphic tattoos would likely be involved in a conspiracy to commit an armed robbery. Blasingame argues that any probative value the photograph may have had was outweighed by its obvious prejudicial effect. Blasingame relies on <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>321 F.3d 627 (7th Cir.2003), for the proposition that the photograph\u2019s probative value was eclipsed by its prejudicial impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">Here, the probative value of the photograph of Blasingame\u2019s scar and tattoos was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Although Ma-han had known Blasingame for over ten years, it is clear from his testimony at trial that he described Blasingame as \u201cPat\u201d when he initially spoke to authorities. Further, Blasingame tried to distance himself from Mahan and the other co-conspirators by claiming that Mahan and he were not in the same social circle or friends. Blasingame further testified that Mahan was a liar who had falsely incriminated him. Therefore, the photograph was used by the Government to show that Blasin-game was the person identified by Mahan as \u201cPat\u201d and to further corroborate Ma-han\u2019s identification of Blasingame as one of the two masked gunmen who shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">Blasingame\u2019s reliance on <em>Thomas </em>is mistaken. In <em>Thomas, </em>the district court allowed the prosecution to admit a photograph of defendant\u2019s gun tattoo for the purpose of showing that the defendant approved of guns in order to refute the defendant\u2019s contention that he did not possess the firearm in question. <em>Id. </em>The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the tattoo of two crossed revolvers had no probative value because the tattoo only showed that because the defendant had a pair of guns tattooed on his forearm, he was the kind of person who was likely to possess guns. <em>Id. </em>The facts of the present case are strikingly different. Here, unlike the photograph in <em>Thomas, </em>Blasingame\u2019s photograph had significant probative value. As already discussed, the photograph was used to identify \u201cPat\u201d and corroborate Ma-han\u2019s identification of Blasingame. Any unfair prejudice Blasingame may have ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>perienced from the photograph does not overcome the photograph\u2019s probative value. Moreover, given the presumption of admissibility under Rule 403, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the photograph to be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">III. Defendant Bradley</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">\n<em>A. Comments about Defendant\u2019s Incarceration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Bradley first argues that he was denied a fair trial when the jury was informed several times that he was in custody during trial. Bradley claims that he was denied a fair trial, because: (1) the district court judge made remarks which informed the jury that he was incarcerated; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) Michael Davis testified that Blasingame threatened him in jail;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) Herbert Durham testified that he had visited Bradley in jail.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bradley also contends that the combination of these incidents amounted to a constant reminder that he was incarcerated, which deprived him of the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>A presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is a basic element of a fair trial in our system of justice. <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 503, 96 S.Ct. 1691,-1692, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976). That presumption of innocence is impaired and an accused\u2019s right to a fair trial is violated when the accused is required to attend trial in prison clothing. <em>Id. </em>at 504, 96 S.Ct. at 1693, 48 L.Ed.2d 126. <em>See also United States v. Harris, </em>703 F.2d 508, 509-11 (11th Cir.1983)(right to a fair trial impaired when defendant was compelled to attend voir dire in prison clothing). Further, we have previously noted that whether the jury directly learns of a defendant\u2019s incarceration from testimony or infers the fact from a defendant\u2019s clothing is of no consequence. <em>United States v. Villabona-Garnica, </em>63 F.3d 1051, 1058 (11th Cir. 1995). Yet, \u201cthe mere utterance\u201d of the words jail or prison does not automatically entitle a defendant to a new trial. <em>United States v. Veteto, </em>701 F.2d 136, 139-40 (11th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>United States v. Barcenas, </em>498 F.2d 1110, 1113 (5th Cir.1974)). Rather, it is the \u201cconstant reminder of the accused\u2019s condition\u201d that is \u201cso likely to be a continuing influence throughout the trial\u201d that presents an \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d to the presumption of innocence. <em>Estelle, </em>425 U.S. at 504-05, 96 S.Ct. at 1693, 48 L.Ed.2d 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Even assuming that the comments and testimony complained of either directly informed the jury of defendant\u2019s incarceration or allowed the jury to infer the fact, the comments and testimony, individually do not raise to the level of a \u201cconstant reminder.\u201d The court\u2019s initial comments at most caused the jury to speculate about whether the defendant was incarcerated, and the court\u2019s cautionary instructions to the jury specifically attributed the increased presence of United States Marshals to the incarcerated witnesses. These comments were not only brief, but required the jury to make several inferential steps to conclude the defendant was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">Likewise, any comments that indicated Bradley was incarcerated from either Davis\u2019s testimony or Durham\u2019s testimony were also brief passing comments. None of these comments rise to the level of reversible error. <em>See United States v. Beasley, </em>2 F.3d 1551, 1559 (11th Cir.1993) (no reversible error because witness\u2019s response to a question on cross-examination that he met the defendant in prison was a passing remark followed by a curative instruction); <em>United States v. Markovic, </em>911 F.2d 613, 616 (11th Cir.1990)(\u201cIt is almost frivolous to argue that a mistrial should have been granted because three jurors saw the defendants in handcuffs when they were being removed \u2014 especially since the court gave cautionary instructions.\u201d). Furthermore, these four brief comments, which do not independently amount to reversible error, do not combine to create a \u201cconstant reminder\u201d of the defendant\u2019s incarceration. Even considering the combined effect of these comments, they were nevertheless brief and occurred sporadically over the course of a multi-day trial. They simply do not amount to a \u201cconstant reminder\u201d or rise to the level of reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">\n<em>B. Denial of Bradley\u2019s Motion for Severance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">Bradley next argues that he suffered compelling prejudice when the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>trict court abused its discretion in denying his motion for severance and required him to be jointly tried with Blasingame. Bradley argues that he was prejudiced in two ways: (1) Davis was allowed to read the transcript of his plea colloquy which contained assertions that the defendants had threatened him while they were in custody; and (2) Blasingame pursued a trial strategy which confirmed to the jury that he was in pre-trial custody. Bradley further argues that because the evidence against him relied entirely upon word of mouth, with no physical evidence to corroborate the stories of the co-conspirators, the prejudice he suffered was compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">\u201cThe general rule in this circuit is that defendants who are jointly indicted should be tried together, and this rule has been held to be particularly applicable to conspiracy cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarez, 755 </em>F.2d 830, 857 (11th Cir.1985). A severance under Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should be granted only if the defendant can demonstrate that a joint trial would result in specific and compelling prejudice to the conduct of his defense. <em>United States v. Marszalkowski, </em>669 F.2d 655 (11th Cir.1982). When a district court denies a defendant\u2019s motion to sever, we review that denial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jacoby, </em>955 F.2d 1527, 1542 (11th Cir.1992). We will only reverse a district court\u2019s denial of a severance motion if the denial \u201cresultfed] in compelling prejudice against which the district court could offer no protection.\u201d <em>United States v. Walser, </em>3 F.3d 380, 385 (11th Cir.1993). The test for compelling prejudice is \u201cwhether under all the circumstances of a particular case, as a practical matter, it is within the capacity of the jury to follow the [instructions] and accordingly ... appraise the independent evidence against each defendant\u2019s own acts, statements and conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Kabbaby, </em>672 F.2d 857 (11th Cir.1982). Further, even if a defendant can show some prejudice, a defendant is entitled to severance only if that \u201cprejudice flowing from a joint trial is clearly beyond the curative powers of precautionary instruction.\u201d <em>United States v. Morrow, </em>537 F.2d 120, 126 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Here, Bradley argues compelling prejudice is established because testimony of a threat made by Blasingame, that improperly implied that Bradley also threatened the witness, was admitted and because Blasingame chose to freely admit to the jury that he was in custody during the trial. First, the district court specifically instructed the jury that the testimony regarding the threat should only be considered against Blasingame and not Bradley. Because the district court gave appropriate instructions to the jury and Bradley has offered no evidence suggesting that the jury was unable to follow the court\u2019s instructions, the threat testimony does not establish compelling prejudice. In addition, because compelling prejudice does not exist merely because there is evidence at trial that is applicable only to a co-defendant, the fact that Blasingame chose to inform the jury that he was in custody does not establish compelling prejudice either. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, 755 </em>F.2d 830, 857 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201cdefendant does not suffer \u2018compelling prejudice\u2019 simply because much of the evidence at trial is applicable only to his codefendants.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">\n<em>C. Agent Fonseca\u2019s Statement that a Witness Refused to Testify out of Fear</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Bradley argues that the district court erroneously admitted hearsay evidence that a witness refused to testify at trial due to fear. Bradley argues the district court erred in allowing Agent Fonseca to testify that Jeff Ridley, who was involved in one of the earlier robbery at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>tempts but later withdrew from the conspiracy, was scared to testify against the defendants. Bradley argues that allowing Agent Fonseca\u2019s testimony violated the confrontation clause because his statement was testimonial hearsay. He further argues that because the evidence in the case consisted solely of the testimony of co-conspirators, without independent corroboration, the admission of this statement by the non-testifying declarant cannot be considered harmless, and the conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Rule 801 of the Federal Rules of Evidence defines hearsay as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d \u201cStatement\u201d is further defined as \u201c(1) an oral or written assertion, or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an assertion.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(a). Here, Agent Fonseca stated, \u201c[Ridley] flat-out did not want to testify; he was scared to testify against the defendants.\u201d This statement is not hearsay. Agent Fonseca neither repeats Ridley\u2019s oral statements nor describes Ridley\u2019s nonverbal conduct. Agent Fonseca simply asserted that in his opinion Ridley refused to testify because he was scared to testify against the defendant. His statement may have been an irrelevant opinion;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> however, it is not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">\n<em>D. Prosecutors\u2019 Cross-examination ofBradley\u2019s Alibi Witnesses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Bradley argues that counsel for the Government was allowed to ask Bradley\u2019s alibi witnesses questions regarding events which negatively impacted the witnesses\u2019 characters. He asserts that the prosecution\u2019s purpose for asking these damaging questions was not to test the memory of the witnesses regarding dates, but rather to improperly attack the witnesses\u2019 characters. Yet, the Government asserts that the questions were designed to demonstrate that the witnesses\u2019 testimonies were unworthy of belief because none could remember significant events which had occurred in their own lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">Bradley called three alibi witnesses. The mother of his child, Larhonda Ward, testified that on the morning of the attempted robbery she was suffering from such severe morning sickness that Bradley had to drive her to work and he therefore could not have been at Mahan\u2019s home gearing up for the robbery. However, on cross-examination, Ward admitted that her son was born exactly nine months after the attempted robbery, a fact which established that at the time she claimed to be having morning sickness she was only at the most a few days pregnant. Jeffrey Christian and Ronald Christian testified that they cut defendant Bradley\u2019s grass on the day of the robbery and that they recalled that at exactly 9:15 a.m. that day they were talking to him in the backyard. On cross-examination, Government counsel questioned both men regarding their recollection of events which had occurred in their personal lives. Ronald Christian was asked about the birth of his child, an award he received, and a reprimand he had received at work. Jefferey Christian was questioned about his recollection of a speeding ticket he received less than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>week after the robbery and about his firing by his employer on suspicion of theft. In each instance the witness had no recollection of the dates and times of significant events in his own life, but they both maintained that they recalled the date and specific time at which they had a backyard conversation with Bradley.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">\u201c[EJvidence relevant to a material issue is not rendered inadmissible because it happens to include references to specific bad acts of a witness. Extrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019 prior misconduct should be excluded where that evidence is probative only of the witness\u2019 general propensity for truthfulness.\u201d <em>United States v. Calle, </em>822 F.2d 1016, 1021 (11th Cir.1987). The prosecutor\u2019s questions were relevant to show that it was unlikely that the alibi witnesses could actually remember the exact time and date of everyday events that occurred over a year prior when the same witnesses could not remember the exact time and date of significant events that occurred in their respective lives around the same time. Accordingly, the questions were not offered solely as evidence of the witnesses\u2019 general propensity for truthfulness and were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">\n<em>E. Prosecutor\u2019s Recitation of Witnesses\u2019 Prior Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Bradley argues that the district court erred in allowing prosecutors to read several witnesses\u2019 prior testimony aloud. He argues that the proper method would have been to ask if a witness recalled the testimony, and if not, to refresh the witness\u2019s recollection by allowing them to silently review the testimony. While Bradley is correct in his explanation of the requirements of Rule 612 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, he neglects to consider Rule 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Rule 801 provides that a prior consistent statement of a declarant testifying at trial and subject to cross-examination is admissible when offered \u201cto rebut an express or implied charge against him of recent fabrication, improper influence or motive.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B). Thus, to rebut an express or implied charge that the witness is motivated, has been influenced to testify falsely, or that the witness\u2019s testimony is a recent fabrication, evidence is admissible that the witness told the same story before the motive or influence came into existence or before the time of the alleged recent fabrication. <em>Tome v. United States, </em>513 U.S. 150, 157, 115 S.Ct. 696, 701, 130 L.Ed.2d 574 (1995). Moreover, \u201c[wjhere credibility has been challenged on the basis of facts absent from the prior statement, the [prior] statement [is] admitted when it [is] consistent with the remaining testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>689 F.2d 1262, 1273 (6th Cir.1982) (citing <em>United States v. Lombardi, </em>550 F.2d 827, 828 (2nd Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">Here, defense counsel suggested to the jury that both Mahan and Davis recently fabricated their testimony because they failed to include specific facts in prior statements each had given to authorities. Accordingly, this assertion entitled the Government, under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B), to respond by demonstrating, with evidence of the witness\u2019s prior consistent statements to the court, that the witness had indeed told authorities the specific facts referred to by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">IV. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">Both Blasingame and Bradley appeal their total 228-month and 194-month sentences, respectively. Both defendants argue that their sentences under Count One are unconstitutional as a result of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and now <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because their offense levels were increased due to findings of fact made by the district court and not the jury. They further challenge their sentences on Count Two by arguing that <em>Blakely </em>overruled <em>United, States v. Gray, </em>260 F.3d 1267 (11th Cir. 2001), and <em>United States v. Pounds, </em>230 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.2000), two cases in which this Court held that whether a defendant brandished or discharged a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) is a sentencing factor that need not be included in the indictment nor submitted to a jury. <em>Pounds, </em>230 F.3d at 1319, <em>Gray, </em>260 F.3d at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Because Blasingame and Bradley both failed to properly raise their <em>Blakely </em>claims at sentencing in the district court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we review their sentencings for plain error. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298. Under plain error review, the court will not reverse unless (1) there is error, (2) it is plain, (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) if left uncorrected, would seriously affect the \u201cfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To satisfy the third prong of the plain error test in the <em>Blakely/Booker </em>context, a defendant must show that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion by the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301. Even if we assume Defendants can meet the first two elements of the plain error test, they cannot establish that their sentences would have been any different had the sentencing guidelines been advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">The district court sentenced Blasingame to the maximum possible sentence available under the guidelines and commented that it imposed this sentence because of the \u201caggravating factors in this case,\u201d including \u201can actual attempt to kill one of the drivers of the vehicle.\u201d With such commentary by the district court at sentencing, Blasingame cannot show that there is a reasonable probability of a different result had the guidelines been advisory. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>408 F.3d 745, 755-56 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the defendant failed to satisfy the third-prong of the plain error test because the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing indicated that it had sentenced the defendant at the top of the guidelines range because the facts of that case warranted it, and not because the sentence was mandated by the guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">The district court also sentenced Bradley near the top of the guidelines, after carefully considering several factors, including whether he was a leader or a mere participant. The district court had an opportunity to depart downward in sentencing, but declined to do so because it thought that would be inappropriate. It appears that the district court sentenced Bradley near the top of the guidelines because it believed such a sentence was warranted under the facts of this case, and not because the guidelines mandated it. The fact that Bradley did not receive the maximum possible sentence under the guidelines, standing alone, does not mean there is a reasonable probability that he could receive a lesser sentence. Indeed, this Court' has recently recognized that even a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines was insufficient, in and of itself, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>conclude that the treatment of'the guidelines as mandatory affected the district court\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Fields, </em>408 F.3d 1356, 1360-61 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the convictions and sentences of both Blasingame and Bradley are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-17\">. Willard Mahan, Andy Marbury, and Michael Davis testified in the present case pursuant to a plea agreement, and Dwight Elder and Darrell Cooper remain at large.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b968-5\">. Decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit handed down prior to September 30, 1981 are binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit. <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b969-6\">. Perhaps the most significant discrepancy was that Davis stated that Marbury had given him some cocaine and rum the day of the robbery and Marbury denied doing so. Ma-han did admit that he lied to the Grand Jury about owning a gun; however, because both Marbury and Davis also identify Blasingame as a shooter, it is unlikely that Mahan\u2019s lie had any effect on whether or not the jury believed that Blasingame was one of the shooters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b972-7\">.
