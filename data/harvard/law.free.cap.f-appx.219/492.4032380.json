R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Mary Corner, who ran unsuccessfully for president of her local postal workers union, sought judicial review of a decision by the Department of Labor not to bring a civil action under Title IV of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481, for alleged irregularities in the ballot tally. The district court dismissed her complaint, determining that she failed to establish that the Department\u2019s decision not to bring an action against the union was irrational. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">In analyzing a motion to dismiss, we accept as true all well-pleaded facts alleged in the complaint. <em>Richards v. Kier-nan, </em>461 F.3d 880, 882 (7th Cir.2006). We thus recite the facts as Corner describes them. Corner ran for president of Local 7140 of the American Postal Workers Union in April 2005. Two \u201cobservers\u201d oversaw the voting on her behalf. When the voting was complete, Honest Ballot, a private company, bundled the votes and noted vote totals on the back of each bundle. Honest Ballot tallied those totals and found that another candidate had won. When Corner\u2019s observers then tallied the totals, they, however, found that Corner had won. Honest Ballot subsequently recounted, reached the same result it had previously, and pronounced the other candidate the winner.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">Convinced she was the true winner, Corner pursued local union remedies but was unsuccessful. Then in November 2005, pursuant to the LMRDA, she filed a grievance letter with the Department of Labor seeking to compel the Department to overturn the election. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(a); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 452.135. In her grievance letter Corner alleged that (1) the final vote totals were inaccurate, and she cited the discrepancy between Honest Ballot\u2019s count and her observers\u2019 count; (2) ballot tampering had likely occurred; (3) the union\u2019s voter eligibility lists were incomplete and accordingly, some eligible voters did not vote at the election; and (4) her election observers should have been allowed to check the totals on the final tally sheet and then sign it (although she did not indicate how originally denying her this request affected the election).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">The Department investigated her allegations and in February 2006 informed her that it found no cause to overturn the election. The Department added that a \u201cstatement of reasons\u201d setting forth the basis of the decision would be mailed to her \u201cat a future date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">Corner did not wait for the reasons, however, and promptly filed a complaint in the district court, reiterating the allegations in her grievance letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">The Department issued a detailed statement of reasons (SOR) in May 2006, and the following month moved to dismiss Corner\u2019s complaint. The Department appended the SOR to its motion and argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the reasons it offered for declining to overturn the election were not \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d In the motion, the Department contended that all of Corner\u2019s allegations were fully investigated and addressed in the SOR. For instance, in response to Corner\u2019s charge of miscounts in the ballot tally, the SOR explained that the Department had conducted its own recount and reached results that confirmed Honest Ballot\u2019s final tally. In response to Corner\u2019s claim that the eligible voter lists were incomplete, the SOR explained that this claim was time-barred because Corner had failed to file a grievance with her union within 72 hours upon learning the voter lists were allegedly flawed, and Corner had so admitted this prior to the election. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482 and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 452.135. And finally, the SOR explained that neither the LMRDA nor Corner\u2019s local union constitution contain any provisions that give observers the right to sign final tally sheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The district court accepted the analysis set forth in the SOR, and dismissed the complaint. In a thorough discussion, the district court concluded that the Department had considered all of Corner\u2019s allegations and provided rational and defensible reasons for its decision not to sue. The court concluded, for instance, that the results of the Department\u2019s own recount sufficiently dispelled Corner\u2019s belief that there had been a tallying error. The court also concluded that eyewitness testimony referenced in the SOR provided a reasonable basis for the Department\u2019s finding that ballot tampering was unlikely to have taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We review the grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo. See Massey v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc., </em>464 F.3d 642, 645 (7th Cir.2006). Our review is \u201cexceedingly narrow\u201d in light of the Department\u2019s broad discretion in determining whether filing suit is warranted. <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski, </em>421 U.S. 560, 569-70, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975) (Burger, C.J., concurring). We are \u201cconfined to examination of the [Department\u2019s] \u2018reasons\u2019 statement, and the determination whether the statement without more, evinces that the [Department\u2019s] decision is so irrational as to constitute the decision arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572-73, 95 S.Ct. 1851. We should affirm as long as the SOR contains a rational and defensible basis for the Department\u2019s decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Corner devotes the majority of her brief to re-alleging the irregularities and wrongdoing that she believes tainted the election. She only briefly \u2014 and in a general fashion \u2014 takes issue with the Department\u2019s decision and the SOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Corner first argues that the Department\u2019s decision was arbitrary because the Department disregarded several facts that support her allegations. She asserts, for example, that the Department ignored the vote totals her observers reached. But Corner\u2019s proposed numbers were improbable: the SOR demonstrated that when the Department aggregated the totals reached by Corner\u2019s observers, the result was a total number of votes that exceeded the number of voters who participated in the election. And, as the district court noted, the SOR also set forth the results of the Department\u2019s own recount, which confirmed the results reached by Honest Ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Corner next argues that the Department\u2019s conclusions are arbitrary because they lack factual support. Specifically, she questions the Department\u2019s rejection of her allegation of ballot tampering because the SOR does not contain the statements of the various witnesses who were interviewed. But an SOR need include only the \u201cgrounds\u201d and \u201cessential facts\u201d upon which the De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>partment relied. <em>Dunlop, </em>421 U.S. at 573, 95 S.Ct. 1851. And we must defer to the Department\u2019s factual findings. <em>See id. </em>Here the SOR explained that the interviews established that the tallies had remained in the sole possession of Honest Ballot until the Department began its investigation. Accepting this finding as true \u2014 which we must \u2014 we see nothing arbitrary about the Department\u2019s conclusion that ballot tampering was unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Corner then takes issue with the Department\u2019s finding that she was time-barred from pressing her claim that the voting lists were incomplete because she had not complained to her local union within 72 hours of discovering the problem before the election. Corner argues that the complaint she filed with her local union 72 horn\u2019s after the election was timely because her problem with the lists did not arise until election day when eligible voters omitted from the lists never cast their votes. But that is mere semantics; it was reasonable \u2014 and certainly not arbitrary\u2014 for the Department to conclude that this claim arose on the date Corner admitted to perceiving what she viewed as irregularities in the lists. We may not substitute our judgment for that of the Department\u2019s. <em>Dunlop, </em>421 U.S. at 571, 95 S.Ct. 1851.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
