In his plea agreement, defendant agreed to waive right to appeal. Nonetheless, defendant has filed a notice of appeal. The government has now moved to enforce defendant\u2019s appeal waiver under <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc). We grant the motion and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-21\">Defendant\u2019s plea agreement states that he \u201cknowingly and voluntarily waives any right to appeal or collaterally attack any matter in connection with this prosecution, conviction and sentence.\u201d Plea Agreement at 6 (filed May 18, 2005). More specifically, it recites that defendant \u201cknowingly waives any right to appeal a sentence imposed which is within the guideline range determined appropriate by the court,\u201d reserving the right to appeal only \u201cto the extent, if any, the court departs upwards from the applicable sentencing guideline range determined by the court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-22\">Under <em>Hahn, </em>we consider \u201c(1) whether the disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights; (2) whether the defendant knowingly and vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>untarily waived his appellate rights; and (3) whether enforcing the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325. The government\u2019s motion addresses these considerations, explaining why none undermines defendant\u2019s appeal waiver here. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The defendant has not filed a response to the government\u2019s motion, thus, the motion to enforce is unopposed. Having reviewed the pertinent materials, we find nothing to except this case from the consequences of the broad appeal waiver included in defendant\u2019s plea agreement. The district court imposed a sentence of 121 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was well below the maximum statutory penalty of forty years and below the 135-to-168 month advisory guideline range. Thus, the sentencing issues asserted on appeal fall within the scope of the appeal waiver. The plea agreement and the plea colloquy demonstrate that defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered into the plea agreement, including the waiver of appellate rights. Further, we find nothing to suggest that enforcement of the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The government\u2019s motion to enforce the waiver is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b803-15\">This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
