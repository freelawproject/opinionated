Our review of the record discloses that this appeal is without merit. Williams has not raised any meritorious issues nor presented any evidence not previously considered by the district court as to its dismissal of Williams\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion as untimely. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>We therefore find that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration was not an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 203 (4th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
