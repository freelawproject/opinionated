Sukkar denying her application for, <em>inter alia, </em>political asylum. <em>In re Li Chen, </em>No. A76-164-999 (BIA January 22, 2004), <em>aff'g </em>A76-164-999 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 17, 2002). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural background and issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-22\">The BIA dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal of her asylum claim based both on an adverse credibility finding and on petitioner\u2019s failure to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. We review both grounds for substantial evidence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-23\">The adverse credibility finding is supported by, <em>inter alia, </em>petitioner\u2019s failure to allege personal involvement in Falun Gong until her hearing before the IJ, at which point she was unable to describe anything about her practice. The finding of a lack of a well-founded fear of persecution is also supported by substantial evidence: petitioner was never herself arrested and her family has lived unmolested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>China since November 1999. Moreover, although the BIA did not expressly find that petitioner failed to demonstrate past persecution, she has not even alleged events that would constitute persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition is hereby DENIED and the stay of removal previously granted is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
