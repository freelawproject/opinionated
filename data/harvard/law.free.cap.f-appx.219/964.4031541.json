We dismiss his petition in part, and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-26\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b991-27\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, and we review the BIA\u2019s decision. To the extent the BIA\u2019s decision was based upon a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">A. <em>Removability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Irabor was issued a Notice to Appear (NTA) charging him with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, as an alien who has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude. Specifically, the NTA alleged that Irabor was convicted of forgery in the first degree in Georgia on March 20, 1996. At his preliminary hearing, Irabor admitted the allegations and conceded remova-bility as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Irabor now challenges the finding that he was removable based on the forgery conviction. Irabor, however, failed to appeal the IJ\u2019s finding that he was removable in his arguments to the BIA. We may only review a final order of removal if the alien has exhausted all available administrative remedies. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Irabor did not exhaust his administrative remedies, and we have no jurisdiction to review the finding that Irabor was removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">B. <em>Discretionary Relief from Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">Irabor requested discretionary relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c) and filed an application for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b and relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). The IJ and BIA concluded Ira-bor was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal or \u00a7 1182(h) relief because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony, simple battery under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-23. Additionally, the BIA concluded Irabor was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because his conviction was the result of a bench trial, not a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">1. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), we lack jurisdiction to review a discretionary decision of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security. Irabor\u2019s eligibility for relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, 1182(h), and former INA \u00a7 212(c) is within the discretion of the Attorney General. Notwithstanding \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), we retain jurisdiction to consider \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-15\">Irabor has arguably made the following constitutional or legal arguments on appeal: (1) his simple battery conviction was not a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a); (2) the BIA violated his due process rights when it failed to remand the case to the IJ for consideration of his pardons; and (3) it was error to retroactively apply the expanded definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d created under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-16\">2. <em>Crime of violence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-17\">First, Irabor argues simple battery under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-23 is not a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a), and does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>not qualify as an aggravated felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, he contends one can be convicted of simple battery in Georgia even if one does not apply force, and, therefore, simple battery under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-23 is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) because one of its elements is not the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The Attorney General may cancel removal for certain permanent resident aliens who are inadmissible or deportable, but only if the alien has not been convicted of any aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). Similarly, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) gives the Attorney General discretion to waive inadmissibility for lawful permanent residents in certain circumstances, but lawful permanent residents who have committed aggravated felonies since the date of their admission are ineligible for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">A conviction is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for immigration purposes if the offense involves \u201ca crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of Title 18 ...) for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). The definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes \u201can offense\u201d that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-23(a), \u201c[a] person commits the offense of simple battery when he or she either: (1) [i]ntentionally makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with the person of another; or (2) [intentionally causes physical harm to another.\u201d We recently addressed the question of whether a conviction for simple battery under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(1) qualifies as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9), a provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>See United States v. Griffith, </em>455 F.3d 1339, 1340-45 (11th Cir. 2006), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(No. 06-7831) (U.S. Oct. 13, 2006). Under that statute, a crime may qualify as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d if it has as an element \u201cthe use or attempted use of physical force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341. We concluded a person \u201ccannot make physical contact\u2014 particularly of an insulting or provoking nature \u2014 with another without exerting some level of physical force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1342. Accordingly, we held the physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature made illegal by O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(l) satisfied the physical force requirement of \u00a7 922(g)(9). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">Based on our reasoning in <em>Griffith, </em>we conclude the crime of simple battery under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-23(a) contains as an element \u201cthe use of physical force\u201d as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a). Therefore, the BIA did not err in finding Ira-bor\u2019s simple battery conviction was an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">3. <em>Consideration of Pardons</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">Irabor next argues the BIA violated his due process rights when it failed to remand his case to the IJ for consideration of his pardons. He notes 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A), \u201cspecifies the effect of a ... pardon on a certain ground of removability.\u201d He argues the pardon extinguished, for immigration purposes, his crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>The pardon-waiver provision in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A) provides the provisions that make an alien deportable after a conviction for certain crimes, including a crime of moral turpitude or an aggravated felony, shall not apply if the alien has been granted a full and unconditional pardon. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A). We have concluded this section does not provide relief for any <em>inadmissible </em>alien who has received a pardon for their conviction. <em>Balogun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1362-63 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Irabor\u2019s argument the BIA should have remanded the case to the IJ for consideration of his pardon for the forgery conviction, because, as discussed above, Irabor failed to raise the removability argument in his appeal to the BIA. Even if Irabor had preserved the argument, he was charged with inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)\u00a9 when he attempted to reenter the country. That section does not provide relief for any inadmissible alien who has received a pardon for their conviction. <em>See Balogun, </em>425 F.3d at 1362. To the extent Irabor argues his pardons affected his eligibility for discretionary relief, this argument fails as well because the pardon provision he references does not apply to provisions affecting the grant or denial of discretionary relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">4. <em>INA \u00a7 212(c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">Finally, Irabor contends the BIA should have allowed him to seek discretionary relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1996), because his simple battery conviction occurred before the enactment of IIRIRA, which repealed \u00a7 212(c) relief and expanded the definition of \u201caggravated felonies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Under former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1996), legal permanent residents such as Irabor who temporarily traveled abroad voluntarily and were returning to a lawful, unrelinquished domicile of at least seven years could be admitted into the United States in the Attorney General\u2019s discretion under a waiver of inadmissibility. Even though \u00a7 212(c) has been repealed, the Supreme Court held \u201c\u00a7 212(c) relief remains .available for aliens ... whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2293, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). We have subsequently held, however, the retroactive application of IIRIRA\u2019s more expansive definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d to an alien who pled guilty to an aggravated felony was both statutorily and constitutionally appropriate. <em>Mohammed, </em>261 F.3d at 1247-51 (concluding retroactive application of \u201caggravated felony\u201d did not infringe upon alien\u2019s due process rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">Irabor was convicted after a bench trial, thus the concerns regarding the retroactive application of the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) to an alien who made a plea agreement are not present. <em>See St. Cyr, </em>121 S.Ct. at 2291. Further, the BIA\u2019s retroactive application of IIRIRA\u2019s more restrictive definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d was legally and constitutionally appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">Accordingly, we deny Irabor\u2019s petition to the extent he raises constitutional and legal challenges to the BIA\u2019s order, and otherwise dismiss his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">PETITION DENIED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-10\">. Irabor also argues he should not have been found removable or denied discretionary relief based on the simple battery conviction because the charge in the NTA was not related to a conviction for an aggravated felony. Because Irabor did not raise this argument in his appeal to the BIA, he has failed to exhaust this claim, and, therefore, we have no jurisdiction to consider this claim on appeal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b993-8\">. Although Irabor fails to articulate why this argument is important to his appeal, it is assumed he is contending that, because his simple battery conviction did not qualify as an aggravated felony, he should have been eligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, or relief under 8 U.S.C. 1182(h). To the extent he argues he would also be eligible for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c), we address this issue below.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
