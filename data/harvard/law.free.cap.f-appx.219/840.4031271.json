MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b866-26\">Plaintiff Joann Young, proceeding pro se, appeals from the district court\u2019s judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>ment affirming the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security denying her disability insurance benefits (DIB) under Title II of the Social Security Act. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In her application for DIB, Ms. Young claimed disability due to a blood disorder (thalassemia), a heart condition (arrhythmia), hypertension, and arthritis. After her application was denied initially and upon reconsideration, she requested and received a de novo hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). Ms. Young appeared without counsel and offered testimony. A vocational expert also offered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">In his decision, the ALJ applied the five-step sequential evaluation process set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). <em>See generally Williams v. Bowen, </em>844 F.2d 748, 750-52 (10th Cir.1988) (explaining steps in detail). At step one, the ALJ found that Ms. Young had not engaged in any substantial gainful activity since her alleged onset date. At steps two and three, the ALJ found that Ms. Young had a number of impairments, including adjustment disorder with mixed depression and anxiety, thalassemia, hypertension, hypothyroid, gastric reflux, mild degenerative disc disease, and mild osteoarthritis. The ALJ found that, in combination, these impairments were severe but not severe enough to meet or medically equal one of the impairments listed in 20 C.F.R., Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Finding Ms. Young\u2019s subjective complaints not fully credible, the ALJ determined at step four that she retained the residual functional capacity (RFC) to \u201clift up to 20 pounds occasionally and 10 pounds frequently; stand and walk approximately 6 hours in an 8-hour workday; sit approximately 6 hours in an 8-hour workday; and follow directions from a supervisor.\u201d Admin. R. at 16. He further found that she \u201cshould [be] expected to experience some mild to moderate discomfort and anxiety and some mild difficulty in dealing with the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In view of her RFC, the ALJ found that she was capable of performing her past relevant work as a telemarketer, data entry worker, and hand packager, and therefore not disabled at step four of the process. The Appeals Council denied review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. <em>See Jensen v. Barnhart, </em>436 F.3d 1163, 1164 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">Ms. Young then filed a complaint in the district court and demanded a jury trial. The district judge referred Ms. Young\u2019s complaint to a magistrate judge for a submission of findings and a recommendation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b). The magistrate judge recommended that the district court affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision. After considering Ms. Young\u2019s timely written objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rejected Ms. Young\u2019s demand for a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>trial, and affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Ms. Young appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Ms. Young raises two issues on appeal. Her first issue is: \u201cThe SSA Law Judge and other SSA determination officials did not conduct a true and just examination of the Plaintiffs medical records.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 3. She then states only that agency officials selected medical data from her records to justify that she does not have severe impairments instead of reviewing her overall medical condition. <em>Id. </em>Despite the liberal reading we give to the pleadings and other papers of pro se litigants, <em>see Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 &amp; n. 3 (10th Cir.1991), Ms. Young\u2019s generalized and conclusory statements wholly fail to frame or develop any perceived error in the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Accordingly, she has waived review of any decisional errors in the administrative process. <em>See Murrell v. Shalala, </em>43 F.3d 1388, 1390 n. 2 (10th Cir.1994) (holding that \u201cperfunctory complaints [that] fail to frame and develop an issue [are][in]sufficient to invoke appellate review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Ms. Young\u2019s second issue is that she was denied her right to a jury trial in the district court. Whether Ms. Young was entitled to a jury trial is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Mile High Indus, v. Cohen, </em>222 F.3d 845, 855 (10th Cir.2000). The statute providing for judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), is a waiver of the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity. <em>See Bowen v. City of New York, </em>476 U.S. 467, 479, 106 S.Ct. 2022, 90 L.Ed.2d 462 (1986); <em>Huie v. Bowen, </em>788 F.2d 698, 705 (11th Cir.1986). \u201cSince there is no generally applicable jury trial right that attaches when the United States consents to suit, the accepted principles of sovereign immunity require that a jury trial right be clearly provided in the legislation creating the cause of action.\u201d <em>Lehman v. Nakshian, </em>453 U.S. 156, 162 n. 9, 101 S.Ct. 2698, 69 L.Ed.2d 548 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Section 405(g) does not clearly provide a jury trial right, and another subsection of \u00a7 405 provides that \u201c[n]o findings of fact or decision of the Commissioner of Social Security shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h). Therefore, Congress did not clearly provide a jury trial right in the legislation creating a cause of action for review of a social security benefits decision. Consequently, the district court properly rejected Ms. Young\u2019s demand for a jury trial. <em>See Ginter v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health, Educ., &amp; Welfare, </em>621 F.2d 313, 313-14 (8th Cir.1980) (per curiam) (holding that district court\u2019s role under \u00a7 405(g) \u201cis limited to reviewing the administrative record to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the [Commissioner]\u201d and that the court \u201ccannot grant a trial de novo before either the court or a jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b866-17\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-9\">. Our local rule requires an appellant to include with her opening brief a copy of a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation when a district court adopts it. 10th Cir. R. 28.2(A)(1). Because Ms. Young did not include a copy of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation with her opening brief, the Commissioner was required to include it with his brief. <em>See </em>10th Cir. R. 28.2(B) (\"If the appellant\u2019s brief fails to include all the rulings required by (A), the ap-pellee\u2019s brief must include them.\u201d). Because the Commissioner did not include a copy of the report and recommendation, we remind him of his obligation to do so in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
