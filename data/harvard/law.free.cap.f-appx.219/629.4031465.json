We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>evidence, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on inconsistencies going to the heart of the petitioners\u2019 asylum claim. <em>See id. </em>For example, Xue\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with record evidence as to whether he was personally threatened with sterilization. Further, the petitioners\u2019 testimony was internally inconsistent about their alleged escape from the Chinese authorities. In addition, the IJ offered specific and cogent reasons for the adverse credibility determination based on a demeanor finding. <em>See Singhr-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the petitioners failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156-57 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Because the petitioners\u2019 CAT claim is based on the same testimony that the agency found not credible, and they point to no other evidence the agency should have considered, their CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The petitioners\u2019 unopposed motion to add Chen as a party to this petition is granted. The Clerk shall amend the docket accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b655-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
