The IJ denied Hu\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cConvention Against Torture\u201d). We have jurisdiction to review the petition pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and for the reasons set forth below, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>i.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Because we write solely for the benefit of the parties, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis. Hu entered the United States without inspection through Chicago on February 9, 2001 and was detained and interviewed by asylum officers on the same date. Shortly thereafter, asylum officers conducted two additional interviews with Hu, on February 13, 2001 and February 28, 2001, respectively. On May 16, 2001, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cINS\u201d) initiated removal proceedings against Hu, alleging he was inadmissable as an immigrant not in possession of valid entry documents in violation of section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">At a removal hearing on May 16, 2001, Hu conceded removability but sought asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Hu submitted two asylum applications: one dated May 7, 2001 and another dated August 20, 2002. He also testified at a merits hearing before the IJ on June 13, 2003. His claim for relief is based on alleged persecution by the Chinese government on account of his and his family\u2019s Christian beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In his initial interview on February 9, 2001, the day Hu entered the United States, Hu stated that his purpose in coming to the United States was to study, and that a friend of his father\u2019s would pay for him to study in the United States. At no time during this initial interview did Hu mention religion or religious persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">In addition, Hu said he had never been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Four days later, during a second asylum interview, Hu stated he did not want to return to China because he would be arrested on account of his and his father\u2019s Christian beliefs. However, consistent with the first interview, Hu again said he had never been arrested in China or any other country. And, when asked about the purpose of his trip, Hu again stated he came to the United States to study.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">In the third and final interview on February 28, 2001, Hu told the asylum officer that, prior to coming to the United States, he and his brother had been arrested and detained in China because of their father\u2019s religious beliefs. Hu stated that he was released after ten days and told to find his father, and that his brother was still being detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">At the June 13, 2003 merits hearing, Hu testified that he and his family are Christian and belonged to the Cheng Guan Church, a secret, underground Christian church in Lian Jiang that his parents attended regularly. Hu testified that he lived in a school dormitory, away from home, beginning in 1995, but attended the church whenever he returned home from school.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">Hu also provided additional details about the events leading up to his flight from China. He alleged he was home from school on May 4, 2000 when Chinese government officials came to his home to arrest his parents for practicing Christianity. Because his parents were not home, the officials arrested Hu and his brother. Hu claimed he was detained for ten days, during which time \u201cnothing much happened.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>A.R. at 127. He was released on May 14, 2000 and told to find his parents and tell them to report to the police. At the time of the hearing, Hu stated his brother was still in detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Hu testified that after he was released from detention he went to look for his parents at his aunt\u2019s house and, not finding them there, went back to his house and waited for ten days. When his parents did not return home, Hu went to Yun Nan, a province about ten hours away. He stayed in Yun Nan for about seven to eight months, where he rented an apartment from his sister\u2019s friend and worked side jobs, including a job at a bookstore shelving books. Hu did not attend church in Yun Nan because he did not know the people and his sister told him not to go out. Hu also testified that he last saw his parents in Yun Nan and that his sister told him that they left China, but he did not know where they were at the time of the hearing. However, on his May 7, 2001 asylum application, Hu indicated that his parents\u2019 \u201cCurrent Location\u201d was \u201cLian Jiang, China.\u201d A.R. at 299. Moreover, when asked if his parents were in the United States, Hu responded unequivocally that they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Hu left Yun Nan on February 4, 2001 and arrived in the United States on February 9, 2001 by way of India and England. He testified that he began living in Philadelphia in August 2001 and attended a church near the Philadelphia airport. However, he did not know the name of the church and admitted that he rarely attended the services, which were conducted in English, because he could not understand the language. Hu stated he was unaware of churches in Chinatown that held services in the Chinese language.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Hu provided the IJ with three pieces of documentary evidence: a copy of a baptism certificate card from the Cheng Guan Church indicating Hu was baptized in 1998; a copy of a verification letter from the Cheng Guan Church indicating Hu arrived in the United States in 2000 and Hu\u2019s family are all \u201cChristian followers,\u201d A.R. at 277; and a copy of the Chinese government\u2019s Household Registration for Hu\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">On June 13, 2003, the IJ issued an oral decision in Hu\u2019s case. She found his testimony was \u201ctotally fabricated\u201d and denied his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. A.R. at 60. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion on March 10, 2005. Hu filed a timely appeal, seeking review of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Where the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ. <em>Partyka v. Attorney General, </em>417 F.3d 408, 411 (3d Cir.2005). We review agency findings of fact, including an adverse credibility determination, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002). Under this standard, we look to whether the decision is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Balasubramanrim, v. INS, </em>143 F.3d 157, 161 (3d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)) (internal quotations omitted). An agency\u2019s factual findings will be upheld unless a \u201creasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">Hu contends the IJ\u2019s credibility determination is not supported by substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>dence because the record is \u201creplete with nonsensical and obviously biased observations on the part of the IJ,\u201d who was inclined to \u201cfish\u201d for inconsistencies. Hu\u2019s Br. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">An adverse credibility finding must be supported by \u201cspecific cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus to the finding.\u201d <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 276. \u201cWe look at an adverse credibility determination to ensure that it was appropriately based on inconsistent statements, contradictory evidences, and inherently improbable testimony in view of the background evidence on country conditions.\u201d <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 249 (3d Cir.2003) (internal citation and quotations omitted). Adverse credibility findings based on \u201cspeculation or conjecture, rather than on evidence in the record, are reversible.\u201d <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272. Furthermore, the underlying basis of an adverse credibility determination must go to the heart of the alien\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In a thorough and well-written opinion, the IJ provided numerous specific, cogent reasons to support her finding that Hu was not credible. First, she pointed out that Hu\u2019s stated reason for coming to the United States changed over the course of his three separate asylum interviews in February 2001. The IJ credited Hu\u2019s statement that he came to the United States to study because it was the reason Hu gave when he first arrived in the United States. She noted that Hu\u2019s story changed \u201conly after he was placed in detention, along with other individuals from China.\u201d A.R. at 25. The IJ also identified inconsistencies between Hu\u2019s testimony and his 1-589 applications. On both applications, Hu indicated his parents lived in Liang Jiang, China, but he testified at the hearing that his parents had fled China and he did not know their current location. Moreover, on his original 1-589 application, Hu indicated he lived in Liang Jiang from his birth in 1983 until he left China on February 4, 2001. However, at the hearing, Hu testified that he fled to Yun Nan after he was released from detention and lived there for seven to eight months before coming to the United States. The IJ concluded, \u201cthe respondent may have traveled to Yun Nan to work for a while, but he certainly was not in hiding if he was working different jobs and working in a bookstore, shelving books. The respondent was not in hiding.\u201d A.R. at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The IJ also concluded that Hu\u2019s extremely limited knowledge of Christianity made his claim incredible. For example, although he testified he had read the Bible, Hu could not identify the difference between the Old and New Testaments and erroneously identified the Book of Matthew as being in the Old Testament. She also questioned his statement that he was unaware of churches in Chinatown that conducted services in the Chinese language.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Furthermore, the IJ concluded she could give little weight to Hu\u2019s documentary evidence. She found it implausible that a secret, underground church hiding from the Chinese government would issue laminated baptismal certificates with its address and photographs of church members. She also questioned why the certificate provides Hu\u2019s exact date of birth but lists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>only the year in which Hu was baptized, finding it \u201cstrange\u201d that a baptism card \u201cwould give more information about the individual\u2019s birth than the individual\u2019s baptism.\u201d A.R. at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">In sum, the IJ found that Hu\u2019s testimony was \u201ctotally fabricated\u201d and concluded that his purpose in coming to the United States, as he told officials when he first arrived, was to continue his studies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She concluded that \u201ceach time the respondent tells his story, the story becomes more and more elaborate.\u201d A.R. at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The IJ cited numerous instances in which Hu\u2019s testimony was vague, inconsistent, and contradictory. She has provided specific, cogent reasons, supported by the record, for reaching an adverse credibility determination. Furthermore, these reasons go to the heart of Hu\u2019s claim of religious persecution and could lead a reasonable adjudicator to doubt the veracity of his claim. Accordingly, we are not compelled to overturn the IJ\u2019s determination that Hu lacked credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">We have considered all other arguments made by the parties on appeal and conclude that no further discussion is necessary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the foregoing reasons, we find that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision and we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\">. On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist and its functions were transferred to the newly formed Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, within the United States Department of Homeland Security. <em>See Kna-pik v. Ashcroft, </em>384 F.3d 84, 86 n. 2 (3d Cir.2004) (citing Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, \u00a7\u00a7 441, 452, 471, 116 Stat. 2135).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b283-7\">. The Real ID Act of 2005 changes the standards governing credibility determinations, such that a determination may be made \"without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claims.\u201d Pub.L. 109-13, div. B, \u00a7 101(a)(3)(B)(iii), 119 Stat. 231, 303 (to be codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii)). This provision applies only where an alien has filed for asylum, withholding of removal, or other relief after the effective date of the Act, May 11, 2005. Because Hu applied for relief in 2001, this provision does not apply to his claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\">. At one point during his testimony, when asked why he did not want to go back to China, Hu responded, \"because America is better than China\u201d and because \"I don't have that much freedom in China.\u201d A.R. at 143.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\">. Although not supported by any argument or citation in his brief, Hu made a conclusoiy assertion that the BIA erred in summarily affirming the IJ without opinion. As the gov-eminent points out, Hu has abandoned and waived this argument because it was not pursued in the argument section of Hu's brief to this Court. <em>Nagle v. Alspach, </em>8 F.3d 141, 143 (3d Cir.1993). However, even if we were to consider the argument, we find it lacks merit. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (federal regulation governing BIA procedures that provides for affirmance without opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
