A hearing is required when a movant presents a colorable Sixth Amendment claim showing disputed material facts and a credibility determination is necessary to resolve the issue. <em>See United States v. Witherspoon, </em>231 F.3d 923, 925-27 (4th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-25\">In its informal brief to this court, the Government concedes \u201cthat the record before the district court raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether trial counsel\u2019s performance was <em>per se </em>ineffective under <em>Peak. </em>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s summary dismissal of this claim without resolving the dispute was in er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ror.\u201d We agree. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order as to Robertson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim and remand that claim for further proceedings. We grant Robertson leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-18\"><em>In the same </em>order, we denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed Robertson's appeal with respect to his remaining claim that his sentence violated <em>United States v.
