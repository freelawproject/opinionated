Nov. 8, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006). To the extent that Wong\u2019s September 2005 motion requested that the BIA reconsider its prior affirmance of the Id\u2019s decision denying Wong\u2019s motion to rescind the order of exclusion <em>in absentia, </em>the motion to reconsider was properly denied as untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">To the extent Wong\u2019s September 2005 motion can be construed as a motion to reopen, because it was filed more than ninety days after the BIA\u2019s last decision in his case, it was required to demonstrate changed conditions in China that give rise to a claim for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Because he alleged no changed conditions in China, and rather raised the same claim he raised in his 1993 application, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See id.; Cf. Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">Because Wong failed to show that the new evidence in his motion was previously unavailable, the BIA was not required to address it. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Finally, contrary to Wong\u2019s argument, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in failing to provide him with an opportunity to address the timeliness of his motion. The regulations provided Wong with sufficient notice that his motion was untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2), (c)(2), (c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
