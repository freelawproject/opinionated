Crocetti, </em>263 F.3d 102, 104 n. 1 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">We accordingly dismiss the petition for review. We deny Gonzalez-Gonzalez\u2019s motion for stay of removal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
