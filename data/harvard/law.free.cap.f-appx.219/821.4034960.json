HENRY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">Anthony Harold Whaler appeals his conviction on one count of possessing pseu-doephedrine knowing or having reasonable cause to believe it would be used to manufacture methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(c)(2). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-17\">On the night of January 8, 2005, Benjamin Ray Dodson drove Mr. Whaler and Kassandra Gayle Fox approximately sixty-eight miles from Cache, Oklahoma, to Wichita Falls, Texas, ostensibly to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>change a DVD player at Wal-Mart. In Wichita Falls, they visited two Wal-Mart stores. At about 9 p.m. at one store, one of the group purchased three boxes of cold medicine. By 10:30 p.m. the group had reached the other Wichita Falls store, where one of them used a shopping card to purchase another two boxes of cold medicine and to activate two Wal-Mart shopping cards (2-B transaction). Then at 10:40 p.m. one of the group went through another register and purchased two more boxes of cold medicine with one of the newly activated shopping cards (2-C transaction). In all, the group participated in at least four transactions at this store within thirteen minutes, all at different registers. By 11:15 p.m., the group had returned to the first store, where the shopping cards activated at the second store were used to purchase boxes of cold medicine in at least three separate purchases at different registers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Soon after the three crossed back over the Oklahoma state line, a police officer stopped the car for failing to stop at a stop sign. Mr. Dodson consented to a search of the vehicle, and the officer discovered twenty-three boxes of cold medicine in Wal-Mart bags in the trunk. Knowing that cold medicine commonly is used to make methamphetamine, the officer became suspicious and arrested the three. During a pat-down search the officer found two receipts in Mr. Whaler\u2019s pocket, which Mr. Whaler said he took off the dash of the car. The receipts were from the 2-B and 2-C transactions. Initially Mr. Whaler stated he did not know anything about the cold medicine, but after Mr. Dodson was placed in a different car, Mr. Whaler told police that Mr. Dodson gave him and Ms. Fox a ride to Wichita Falls and had asked them to buy cold medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Mr. Dodson and Ms. Fox eventually pleaded guilty to possessing pseudoephed-rine knowing or having reasonable cause to believe it would be used to manufacture methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(c)(2). Mr. Whaler was tried before a jury. At trial, A Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent testified that pseudoephedrine is a key ingredient for making methamphetamine. He testified that in 2004 Oklahoma had passed a law limiting individuals\u2019 ability to purchase cold medicines containing pseudoephed-rine, and that after the law passed, the DEA began to see more people leaving the state to acquire pseudoephedrine. He also testified that if taken according to the package directions, the pills presented as exhibits at trial would last for about six months. In addition, the officer who stopped the car described the stop and testified that there were Wal-Mart stores in Lawton, Oklahoma, which is approximately twenty-five miles closer to Cache than Wichita Falls. A Wal-Mart loss-prevention employee testified that the Wichita Falls Wal-Mart stores had seen an increase in purchases of products containing pseudoephedrine after the passage of the Oklahoma law, and so they voluntarily limited customers to purchasing three boxes of cold medicine per transaction. He also identified the Wal-Mart videotape of the 2-C transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Mr. Dodson and Ms. Fox both testified against Mr. Whaler, stating that the three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>had decided to buy pills to make methamphetamine to split among themselves. Mr. Dodson testified that he and Mr. Whaler had previously cooked and used methamphetamine together and that Mr. Whaler provided the shopping cards to purchase the pills. He testified that he bought clothes at Wal-Mart to change into and disguise himself as he went back through the registers, and that each member of the group bought cold medicines that night. He also identified Mr. Whaler on Exhibit 3, the Wal-Mart videotape. Ms. Fox testified that she and Mr. Whaler had used methamphetamine together previously, that she, Mr. Dodson, and Mr. Whaler had discussed using the cold pills to make methamphetamine, that all three of them were involved with buying the cold medicine the night of January 8, and that they had stopped at one point and counted the grams to see how close they were to their goal of sixty grams. Both Mr. Dodson and Ms. Fox admitted that they had pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the arrest and that their cooperation could result in them receiving more favorable treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">The jury found Mr. Whaler guilty, and the district court sentenced him to serve 115 months\u2019 imprisonment. Mr. Whaler appeals his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Mr. Whaler first argues that the district court erred when it failed to give the jury a separate accomplice-testimony instruction. He concedes that the standard of review is for plain error because he did not raise this issue in the district court. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Under this standard, an error must be \u201cplain\u201d and \u201caffect[] substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quotations omitted). Even if these conditions are met, \u201c[Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure] 52(b) leaves the decision to correct the forfeited error within the sound discretion of the court of appeals, and the court should not exercise that discretion unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">\u201cAccomplice instructions are required when a defendant is tied to a crime solely through the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice-witness.\u201d <em>United States v. Serrata, </em>425 F.3d 886, 900 (10th Cir.2005). Thus, \u201cif the testimony of an accomplice is uncorroborated, the court must instruct the jury that testimony of accomplices must be carefully scrutinized, weighed with great care, and received with caution,\u201d and a failure to do so may constitute plain error. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>627 F.2d 1052, 1053 (10th Cir.1980) (quotations omitted). \u201cAccomplice testimony is uncorroborated \u2018when the testimony ... is the only testimony directly tying the defendant into the criminal transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gardner, </em>244 F.3d 784, 789 (10th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>463 F.2d 393, 395 (10th Cir. 1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Clearly Mr. Dodson and Ms. Fox were accomplices. Unlike the situation in <em>Gardner, </em>however, there was evidence other than their testimony connecting Mr. Whaler to the crime, including the Wal-Mart videotape, the receipts found in Mr. Whaler\u2019s pocket, and Mr. Whaler\u2019s own statement to police that Mr. Dodson asked him to purchase cold pills. Thus, although the accomplices testified about matters not addressed by other evidence, their testimony as a whole was \u201csubstantially corroborated,\u201d and the district court did not plainly err in failing to give a separate accomplice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>instruction. <em>Serrata, </em>425 F.3d at 900-01; <em>see also United States v. Wiktor, </em>146 F.3d 815, 818 (10th Cir.1998) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Shuckahosee, </em>609 F.2d 1351, 1356-57 (10th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Waldron, </em>568 F.2d 185, 187 (10th Cir.1977) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Even assuming, as Mr. Whaler contends, that the lack of corroboration regarding Mr. Whaler\u2019s intent required a separate accomplice instruction and the failure to provide such an instruction constituted an error that was plain, this court should exercise its discretion to correct the forfeited error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quotations and alteration omitted). We do not believe that any error here would qualify for an exercise of discretion. \u201c[T]he concern is whether [the defendant\u2019s] rights were recognized in the court\u2019s rulings and in the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>627 F.2d at 1054 (quotation omitted). In Instruction 18, the jury was instructed that \u201c[a]ll evidence of a witness whose self-interest or attitude is shown to be such as might tend to prompt testimony favorable or unfavorable to an accused should be considered with caution and weighed with great care.\u201d R. Doc. 69 at 11-12.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the instruction does not identify Mr. Dodson and Ms. Fox by name, it certainly applies to them and generally conveys the same message as an accomplice instruction. <em>See Waldron, </em>568 F.2d at 187 (\u201cThe instruction would have informed the jury to scrutinize the accomplice\u2019s testimony carefully because he had allegedly been promised immunity from prosecution for his testimony.\u201d); <em>United States v. Birmingham, </em>447 F.2d 1313, 1317 (10th Cir.1971) (\u201c[T]he court must instruct the jury that testimony of accomplices must be carefully scrutinized, weighed with great care, and received with caution.\u201d). In light of this instruction, and the principle that \u201c[a] defendant is not entitled to any specific wording of instructions,\u201d <em>United States v. McGuire, </em>27 F.3d 457, 462 (10th Cir.1994) (quotation omitted), if there were error, we would not exercise our discretion to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">Mr. Whaler next contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, an issue he preserved in the trial court. \u201cSufficiency of the evidence is a question of law that we review de novo, asking only whether taking the evidence\u2014 both direct and circumstantial, together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom \u2014 in the light most favorable to the government, a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Chavis, </em>461 F.3d 1201, 1207 (10th Cir.2006) (quotations and alteration omitted). For conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(c)(2), the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Whaler (1) knowingly or intentionally possessed a listed chemical (2) knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the listed chemical would be used to manufacture a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">Mr. Whaler\u2019s insufficiency argument rests on disregarding the testimony of his accomplices. But accomplice testimony alone, even uncorroborated accomplice tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>timony, may support a conviction, and it is the jury\u2019s job to evaluate credibility and believe or disbelieve the testimony of the witnesses. <em>See United States v. Magalla-nez, </em>408 F.3d 672, 682 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 468, 163 L.Ed.2d 356 (2005). There is no reason to ignore the accomplice testimony presented at Mr. Whaler\u2019s trial. The evidence summarized above, taken in the light most favorable to the government, is sufficient to support Mr. Whaler\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Finally, Mr. Whaler argues that \u00a7 841(c)(2) is unconstitutionally vague because it \u201ccompletely fails to define the phrase reasonable cause to believe.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 34. He contends that the statute fails \u201cto give an ordinary person reasonable notice as to the prescribed conduct,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that it fails to give law enforcement sufficient guidance to avoid the subjective and arbitrary enforcement of the law. Moreover, he argues that the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him because the jury instructions defining \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d relied on an objective mental standard rather than a subjective standard. Again, Mr. Whaler failed to raise these issues in the district court, so our review is for plain error. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770. \u201cWe conduct this analysis less rigidly when reviewing a potential constitutional error.\u201d <em>United States v. Dazey, </em>403 F.3d 1147, 1174 (10th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">\u201cThe void for vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>United States v. Saffo, </em>227 F.3d 1260, 1270 (10th Cir.2000) (quotations and alteration omitted). \u201cVagueness challenges to statutes which do not involve First Amendment freedoms must be examined in light of the facts of the case at hand. One to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted). In <em>Saffo, </em>we concluded that \u201c[t]he evidence produced at trial demonstrates that Saffo had knowledge of the illegality of her activities, and thus this is not a situation where she could not reasonably understand that her contemplated conduct is proscribed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted). While the evidence in this case is not as compelling as the circumstances in <em>Saffo, </em>the evidence presented at Mr. Whaler\u2019s trial indicates that he is one to whose conduct the statute clearly applies. Accordingly, he may not successfully challenge \u00a7 841(c)(2) for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">In addition to his general vagueness challenge, Mr. Whaler also asserts an as-applied argument regarding mens rea. In <em>Saffo, </em>we held \u201cthat the \u2018knowing or having reasonable cause to believe\u2019 standard in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(d)(2) [now \u00a7 841(c)(2) ] imposes a constitutionally sufficient mens rea requirement.\u201d 227 F.3d at 1268. <em>Saffo, </em>however, further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqY\">In so holding, we note that the standard involves a subjective inquiry that looks to whether the particular defendant accused of the crime knew or had reasonable cause to believe the listed chemical would be used to manufacture a controlled substance. This requires scienter to be evaluated through the lens of this particular defendant, rather than from the prospective of a hypothetical reasonable man. In this context, the \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d standard is one akin to actual knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1268-69. Mr. Whaler complains that his jury was instructed under an objective \u201creasonable person\u201d standard, rath<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>er than the S'ajffo-mandated subjective standard. The jury instruction states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-5\">You are instructed that pseudoephed-rine is a listed chemical as a matter of law and that methamphetamine is a controlled substance. You are also instructed that it does not matter whether the defendant knew that pseudoephed-rine was a listed chemical. It is sufficient that the defendant knew or had reasonable cause to believe that it would be used to manufacture methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-6\">A \u201creasonable cause to believe,\u201d as used in the indictment, means to have knowledge of the facts which, although not amounting to direct knowledge, would cause a reasonable person, knowing the same facts, to reasonably conclude that the pseudoephedrine would be used to manufacture methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFG\">R. Doc. 69 at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">In light of <em>Saffo, </em>it appears that the last paragraph of this instruction may have been erroneous, as it arguably encourages the jury to focus on the knowledge of a hypothetical reasonable person. <em>See also United States v. Buonocore, </em>416 F.3d 1124, 1133 (10th Cir.2005) (stating the court\u2019s instructions in \u00a7 841(c)(2) case correctly stated the law where \u201c[t]he court instructed the jury that Defendant must have known or had reasonable cause to believe that the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine he sold would be used to manufacture methamphetamine\u201d and \u201cfurther instructed the jury that this inquiry is entirely subjective, the inquiry is not to be viewed from the perspective of a hypothetical reasonable person, and the <em>mens rea </em>element is not satisfied if Defendant acted through mistake, negligence, carelessness, or belief in an inaccurate proposition\u201d). Even where there is an error, though, under the plain error standard it is within our discretion whether to correct it. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770. We are not convinced that any error here \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alteration omitted). The second paragraph quoted above appears to be in the nature of a general definition refining the last sentence of the first paragraph, which informed the jury that Mr. Whaler himself had to have the required knowledge or \u201creasonable cause to believe.\u201d R. Doc. 69 at 12. Thus, the jury actually was instructed to focus on Mr. Whaler\u2019s own state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Moreover, the evidence presented at trial generally focused on \u00a7 841(c)(2)\u2019s \u201cknowing\u201d prong rather than the \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d prong. Consequently, it does not appear that Mr. Whaler\u2019s substantial rights were affected by any error in the \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d instruction. <em>See United States v. Lajoie, </em>942 F.2d 699, 702 (10th Cir.1991) (holding that, where the erroneous instruction concerned a component of the charge other than the component which was the focus of the government\u2019s case, the misstatement was harmless); <em>see also United States v. Parnell, </em>581 F.2d 1374, 1382 (10th Cir. 1978) (\u201cIt is well established that where a crime denounced disjunctively in the statute is charged in the conjunctive, proof of any one of the allegations will sustain a conviction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-6\">. The appellate record does not contain copies of the exhibits presented at trial, so our review is limited to the testimony concerning the exhibits. Exhibits 2-A through 2-D were identified as receipts from the Wal-Mart transactions, with 2-B being the receipt from the 2-B transaction and 2-C the receipt from the 2-C transaction. Exhibit 3 was identified as a Wal-Mart videotape showing the 2-C transaction. Apparently Exhibit 4, a summary presented by the government, showed that the group used Wal-Mart shopping cards eight times on January 8, 2005, to purchase cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-6\">. Although both parties quoted the jury instructions (district court record document No. 69) in their briefs, neither party designated them to be included in the record on appeal. We remind Mr. Whaler\u2019s counsel that it is the appellant\u2019s responsibility to provide us with a proper record on appeal. In this case, however, we sua sponte supplement the record with district court document No. 69.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
