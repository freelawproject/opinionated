Gonzalez Padilla argues on appeal that the district court erred in refusing to grant a minor role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">We review the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 938 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion in making this fact-intensive determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2002). The defendant bears the burden of proving his minor role by the preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 939. Allegations made by defense counsel alone may not be a sufficient basis on which to resolve a disputed sentencing issue. <em>See United States v. Kapelushnik, </em>306 F.3d 1090, 1095 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that allegations by defense counsel were an insufficient basis on which to grant a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">In determining a defendant\u2019s role, the district court must first \u201cmeasure the defendant\u2019s role against [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934. We have not established a <em>per </em>se rule as to whether a drug courier is or is not entitled to a minor role reduction but we have said that \u201cwhen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43. Furthermore, in the drug courier context, \u201cthe amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct\u201d and, in some cases, could be dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">Although analysis under the first principle may be dispositive in the court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s role, the district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 944. When measuring a defendant\u2019s conduct against other participants\u2019 conduct, a district court may consider only those participants who are identifiable by the evidence and who were involved in the relevant conduct for which the defendant was convicted. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of [his] role in the offense, since it is possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Here, Gonzalez Padilla\u2019s relevant conduct was identical to his actual conduct, a large amount of cocaine (over three tons) was involved, and, except for the captain, nothing in the record indicated that Gonzalez Padilla was less culpable than the other crew members on the vessel. Thus, he was not less culpable than the other participants in the conspiracy and the district court\u2019s denial of a role reduction was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-13\">.
