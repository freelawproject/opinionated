The court sentenced Ruiz to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release. Ruiz\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. Califor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>nia, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that enhancing Ruiz\u2019s sentence based on prior convictions (for which he has already been punished) resulted in double punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">We reject this argument. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>930 F.2d 12, 14 (8th Cir.1991) (use of prior crimes to enhance sentence does not violate Double Jeopardy Clause). Further, having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivo-lous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-25\">. The Honorable Linda R.
