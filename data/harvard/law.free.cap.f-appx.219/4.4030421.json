R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b30-18\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s minute order, filed October 10, 2006, denying appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, be affirmed. That court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reconsider its dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See Smalls v. U.S., </em>471 F.3d 186, 191 (D.C.Cir.2006) (the legal error warranting reversal of a denial of reconsideration under Rule 60(b) must be clear). Because appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was filed more than 60 days after entry of the district court\u2019s June 13, 2006 order dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), the notice of appeal was untimely as to the June 13th order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. 4(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-19\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
