July 17, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-16\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006). We will find an abuse of discretion when the BIA applies \u201ca legally erroneous standard.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). The regulation governing the filing of briefs with the BIA explicitly provides an exception to the briefing deadline, stating, \u201c[i]n its discretion, the Board may consider a brief that has been filed out of time.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">The BIA distinguished petitioner\u2019s claim from the case of <em>Zhong Guang Sun v. United States Department of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 105, 111 (2d Cir.2005), explaining that in <em>Zhong Guang Sun </em>the \u201cshipper ... acknowledged an error in delivery.\u201d It further found petitioner\u2019s case to be distinct because the \u201cairway bill is unsigned\u201d and there is \u201cno evidence that [petitioner] attempted to track delivery of the brief.\u201d However, the BIA failed to acknowledge that the petitioner in Zhong Guang Sun failed to timely file the notice of appeal, whereas petitioner here timely filed the appeal and only did not timely file the brief in support of the appeal. This distinction is important because, as noted above, the BIA has the discretion to accept an untimely brief, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(c). In contrast, the regulation governing filing of appeals uses mandatory language, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.38(b) (2006), such that \u201cunder normal circumstances the BIA cannot hear late-filed appeals,\u201d and may only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u201chear such appeals in unique or extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Zhong Guang Sun, </em>421 F.3d at 108; <em>see also In re Vladimir Liadov, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 990, 991-92 (B.I.A. 2006) (holding that the BIA does not \u201chave the authority to extend the appeal time,\u201d but may \u201ccertify a case to itself\u2019 where it \u201cpresents exceptional circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The BIA appears to have believed that <em>Zhong Guang Sun </em>constrained its ability to accept the untimely brief in this case. This was error, as the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard applies only to filings of appeals. We therefore remand this case so that the BIA can consider whether to accept petitioner\u2019s brief in the exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED and REMANDED for further proceedings. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is GRANTED, and the removal order is stayed until the BIA renders a new decision on petitioner\u2019s motion. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
