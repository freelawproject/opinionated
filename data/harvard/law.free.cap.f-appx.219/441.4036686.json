For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Bennett has trained and bred Tennessee Walking Horses since 1980. He has a AAA judge\u2019s license with the National Horse Show Commission, and a trainer\u2019s license with the Walkers Training Association, both in good standing. Bennett and his wife, who is also a licensed trainer and judge, advised some acquaintances, not parties to this case, to purchase The Duck, and in 2002 the Bennetts began training The Duck. The Duck is a stallion and a previous world grand champion, and Bennett\u2019s goal was to prepare The Duck to win another championship at the 64th Annual Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration Show in Shelbyville, Tennessee in August of 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">On August 26, 2002, Bennett entered The Duck as a contender in the competition at the Celebration that day. As a breeding stallion, The Duck had a nervous temperament; he did not like strangers and was easily excited when around other horses. Therefore, Bennett, who was to ride The Duck in the competition, waited until the horse inspection area was empty of other horses before bringing The Duck to be inspected. Mark Thomas, a \u201cdesignated qualified person\u201d licensed to inspect horses for violation of the federal Horse Protection Act and employed by the privately-run National Horse Show Commission, conducted a pre-show inspection of The Duck to determine whether The Duck had been illegally \u201csored\u201d to enhance his gait. Thomas gave The Duck the highest possible score for his general appearance, his locomotion, and his reaction to palpation. The Duck was approved for exhibition, and Bennett led him to the warm-up area.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">On his way to the warm-up area, Bennett was stopped by Dr. Michael Guedron, a United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) veterinarian authorized by the Secretary to inspect horses for violations of the Horse Protection Act. Dr. Guedron displayed appropriate credentials indicating this authority, of which Bennett was also previously aware. Dr. Guedron told Bennett to return The Duck to the inspection area for a second inspection; he did not volunteer an explanation for this instruction, nor provide one when Bennett asked. Bennett complied initially, but when he observed Dr. Guedron palpating The Duck\u2019s left front pastern in a manner Bennett believed to be intended to provoke a \u201csore\u201d response from a horse that was not sore, he led The Duck away from Dr. Guedron. Dr. Guedron asked whether Bennett were refusing inspection; he responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just asking that you inspect the horse properly.\u201d Tr. at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">Also present was Dr. Lynn Bourgeois, another USDA veterinary medical officer. Dr. Bourgeois was also the \u201cshow veterinarian,\u201d meaning that he was the veterinarian in charge of the show, and was responsible to oversee Dr. Guedron, other federal inspectors, and the designated qualified persons. Dr. Bourgeois asked Bennett whether he would allow Dr. Gue-dron to finish the inspection. Bennett replied, \u201cNot Dr. Guedron.\u201d Tr. at 160. Bennett requested that Dr. Bourgeois inspect the horse himself, but Dr. Bourgeois would not. Bennett never agreed to allow Dr. Guedron to complete the inspection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>and eventually everyone left; The Duck did not compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The USDA took no further action regarding this incident until April 13, 2004, when an administrator for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (the \u201cAPHIS\u201d) filed a complaint under the Horse Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821-1831, with the Secretary. The complaint alleged that Bennett had refused to allow a representative of the Secretary to inspect The Duck, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1824(9), 1823(e). The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) before whom the case was argued found that the USDA had not met its burden of proving a violation of the Horse Protection Act by a preponderance of the evidence because it had not shown that Dr. Guedron\u2019s inspection was performed \u201cin a reasonable manner.\u201d ALJ Opinion at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The USDA appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to a Judicial Officer of the Secretary. The Judicial Officer reversed the ALJ, finding Bennett\u2019s belief that Dr. Guedron was performing his inspection unreasonably \u201cnot relevant\u201d to the question of whether Bennett violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1824(9). Opinion of Secretary at 17. The Judicial Officer found that Bennett had refused to allow Dr. Guedron to inspect The Duck, and therefore decided there had been a violation of the Horse Protection Act. Opinion of Secretary at 19-20. The Judicial Officer therefore ordered Bennett to pay a $2,200 fine, and disqualified him for one year from \u201cshowing, exhibiting, or entering any horse, directly or indirectly through any agent, employee, or device, and from managing, judging, or otherwise participating in any horse show, horse exhibition, horse sale, or horse auction.\u201d Opinion of Secretary at 23, 27. Bennett now appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">II. REFUSAL OF AN UNREASONABLE INSPECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">\u201c[Cjourts are to \u2018give substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations.\u2019\u201d <em>St. Francis Health Care Ctr. v. Shalala, </em>205 F.3d 937, 943 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, </em>512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Secretary\u2019s <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> interpretation may be overturned \u201cif it is \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law,\u2019 \u201d but \u201cif \u2018it is a reasonable regulatory interpretation we must defer to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944 (quoting <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ., </em>512 U.S. at 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381; <em>Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hosp., </em>514 U.S. 87, 94-95, 115 S.Ct. 1232, 131 L.Ed.2d 106 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">Regarding statutes, however, courts give less deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation. To \u201cassess[] an agency\u2019s construction of a statute that it administers,\u201d courts perform the two-part analysis set forth in <em>Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Harris v. Olszewski, </em>442 F.3d 456, 466 (6th Cir.2006). That analysis inquires: (1) \u201chas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Congress \u2018directly spoken to the precise question at issue?\u2019 \u201d and (2) \u201cis \u2018the agency\u2019s answer [ ] based on a permissible construction of the statute?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The Horse Protection Act prohibits \u201c[t]he failure or refusal to permit access to or copying of records, or the failure or refusal to permit entry or inspection, as required by [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823].\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1824(9). This \u201cinspection\u201d is explained in \u00a7 1823:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">[T]he Secretary [of Agriculture], or any representative of the Secretary duly designated by the Secretary, may inspect any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction or any horse at any such show, exhibition, sale, or auction .... Each such inspection shall be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness and shall be conducted within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1823(e). The Department of Agriculture\u2019s regulations further provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">Each horse owner, exhibitor, trainer, or other person having custody of, or responsibility for, any horse at any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction, shall allow any APHIS representative to reasonably inspect such horse at all reasonable times and places the APHIS representative may designate---- APHIS representatives will not generally or routinely delay or interrupt actual individual classes or performances at horse shows, horse exhibitions, or horse sales or auctions for the purpose of examining horses, but they may do so in extraordinary situations ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">9 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">Both the statute and the regulation address the \u201creasonableness\u201d of an inspection. The statute requires <em>\u201creasonable </em>promptness,\u201d <em>\u201creasonable </em>limits,\u201d and a <em>\u201creasonable </em>manner,\u201d and the regulation states that USDA officials will <em>\u201creasonably </em>inspect\u201d at <em>\u201creasonable </em>times and places.\u201d However, neither expressly provides that a trainer or owner may refuse inspection due to a lack of such reasonableness. The Judicial Officer\u2019s opinion does not expressly address the regulation. It does explain his interpretation of the statute\u2019s reasonableness requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">The failure of a representative of the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct an inspection in a reasonable manner, as required by section 4(e) of the Horse Protection Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823(e)), may be used to challenge the results of the inspection, but may not be used as a basis to refuse to permit completion of the inspection or as a basis to require inspection by another representative of the Secretary of Agriculture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">Opinion of Secretary at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">At oral argument, the USDA conceded that there might exist extreme circumstances under which a trainer or exhibitor could refuse an inspection due to its unreasonableness without violating \u00a7 1824(9). Thus, the court is not presented with the question of whether it would ever be permissible for an exhibitor to refuse an inspection because it was unreasonable. The court need only decide whether, in this case, Bennett\u2019s refusal of an inspection he believed to be unreasonable was a violation of the Horse Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-17\">Because the statute itself does not specify whether the \u201creasonableness\u201d language provides a basis for owners and trainers to refuse inspection, Congress has not \u201cdirectly spoken to the precise question at issue\u201d in this case, the first question under the <em>Chevron </em>analysis. The second <em>Chevron </em>question is whether the USDA\u2019s interpretation is \u201cbased on a permissible con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>struction of the statute.\u201d <em>Harris </em>explains that \u201c[i]f so and if Congress has given the agency authority to interpret the statute, a federal court will defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation.\u201d 442 F.3d at 466 (citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The Supreme Court explained in <em>Smiley v. Citibank, </em>517 U.S. 735, 740-41, 116 S.Ct. 1730, 135 L.Ed2d 25 (1996), that \u201c[w]e accord deference to agencies under <em>Chevron ... </em>because of a presumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for implementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows.\u201d Thus, even if the statutory \u201cgap for the agency to fill,\u201d and the attendant \u201cdelegation of authority\u201d for the agency to interpret the statute, are \u201cimplicit rather than explicit,\u201d \u201ca court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In this case, \u00a7 1823(e) makes clear that the inspection required by \u00a7 1824(9) is to be carried out by the Secretary of Agriculture or his representative. Thus, the inspection described in \u00a7 1824(9) is implemented by the USDA, and under <em>Chevron, </em>the USDA properly should resolve the ambiguity in \u00a7 1824(9). Thus, provided the Judicial Officer\u2019s interpretation of the statute is \u201cpermissible,\u201d the panel should defer to his interpretation. <em>Harris, </em>442 F.3d at 466; <em>see also Nat\u2019l Cable &amp; Telecomms. Ass\u2019n v. Brand X Internet Servs., </em>545 U.S. 967, 980, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (\u201cIf a statute is ambiguous, and if the implementing agency\u2019s construction is reasonable, <em>Chevron </em>requires a federal court to accept the agency\u2019s construction of the statute, even if the agency\u2019s reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The Judicial Officer determined that Bennett\u2019s \u201cbelief that Dr. Guedron was not conducting the inspection in a reasonable manner and [Bennett\u2019s] request for inspection by\u201d Dr. Bourgeois \u201care not relevant to [Bennett\u2019s] violation of ... the Horse Protection Act,\u201d which position the USDA maintains on appeal. Opinion of Secretary at 17. This interpretation is reasonable. As the USDA points out in its brief, this interpretation furthers the purposes of the Horse Protection Act. Permitting a trainer or owner to refuse inspection based on his own assertion that an inspection is unreasonable, in the absence of circumstances \u201cwell outside the norm of regularity in the inspection process\u201d to which the USDA referred at oral argument,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> would potentially allow trainers to avoid discovery of \u201csoring,\u201d the prevention of which is the purpose of the Horse Protection Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822. Because \u00a7 1824(9) does not explicitly state the consequences of the requirement than an inspection be reasonable, and because the USDA\u2019s interpretation of the reasonableness language is permissible, this court must accept the USDA\u2019s determination that an exhibitor violates the Horse Protection Act if he refuses an inspection that is not egregious, based on his subjective belief that the inspection is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">III. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">This court \u201creview[s] an administrative decision of the [Secretary] under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>[Horse Protection Act] to determine whether the proper legal standards were employed and substantial evidence supports the decision.\u201d <em>Bobo v. USDA </em>52 F.3d 1406, 1410 (6th Cir.1995) (internal quotations omitted) (second and third alterations in original) (quoting <em>Gray v. USDA </em>39 F.3d 670, 675 (6th Cir.1994)). \u201cSubstantial evidence means \u2018more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance\u2019 of the evidence,\u201d and \u201c \u2018must be based upon the record taken as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Elliott v. Administrator, Animal &amp; Plant Health Inspection Serv., </em>990 F.2d 140, 144 (4th Cir.1993); <em>Gray, </em>39 F.3d at 675).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Unlike a federal court, a Judicial Officer, \u201csitting in review of an ALJ\u2019s initial decision, is authorized by statute to substitute [his] judgment for that of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Parchman v. USDA </em>852 F.2d 858, 860 n. 1 (6th Cir.1988) (quoting <em>Farrow v. USDA </em>760 F.2d 211, 213 (8th Cir.1985)) (internal quotations omitted). However, where findings of fact are based on determinations of witness credibility, the AL J\u2019s findings are given greater weight. <em>Rowland v. USDA </em>43 F.3d 1112, 1114 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The Horse Protection Act, as noted above, prohibits the \u201crefusal to permit ... inspection\u201d of a horse in an exhibition. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1824(9). As \u00a7 1823(e) clarifies, this is an inspection by \u201cthe Secretary, or any representative of the Secretary duly designated by the Secretary,\u201d provided he \u201cpresent\u00ed ] appropriate credentials.\u201d It is not disputed here that Dr. Guedron possessed and presented the appropriate credentials, or that he was a duly designated representative of the Secretary of Agriculture. Bennett argues that he \u201cnever refused to allow Dr. Guedron to inspect the horse.... Bennett\u2019s only request was that the USDA conduct its inspection reasonably and properly under direction of the H[orse] Protection] A[ct].\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">However, this contention reflects only some of what happened. As Bennett acknowledges in his own statement of facts, he was first asked by Dr. Guedron whether he was refusing an inspection; he responded, \u201cNo, I am not. I am only asking that you inspect the horse properly.\u201d Tr. at 316, <em>quoted in </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 10. When Dr. Bourgeois, the show vet, then \u201casked Bennett whether he would allow Dr. Guedron to complete his inspection of the horse[,] Bennett replied, \u2018Not Dr. Gue-dron.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, Bennett himself admits that he expressly refused to allow Dr. Guedron to inspect The Duck. The true focus of his argument is that he \u201cnever refused Dr. Guedron the opportunity to <em>reasonably </em>inspect the horse.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">As discussed above, the Judicial Officer permissibly concluded that the exhibitor\u2019s belief regarding the reasonableness of an inspection under such circumstances as existed here is not relevant to the question of whether a trainer has refused the inspection. Thus, by stating that Dr. Guedron was not permitted to inspect The Duck, even though he invited Dr. Bourgeois to inspect him, Bennett refused to allow a duly appointed representative of the Secretary to inspect a horse, in violation of the Horse Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Even if Bennett had not conceded that he would not allow Dr. Guedron to inspect The Duck, \u201cupon the record taken as a whole,\u201d there was substantial evidence that he refused inspection. Dr. Bourgeois, the show vet, testified that Bennett would not allow Dr. Guedron to inspect The Duck. Mark Thomas, the designated qualified person who initially inspected (and passed) The Duck, testified, \u201cI just saw that Dr. Guedron started his inspection and things didn\u2019t go to suit Mr. Bennett.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Tr. at 55. When asked whether Bennett allowed Dr. Guedron to inspect The Duck, Thomas responded, \u201cNot while I was there.\u201d Tr. at 58. Lonnie Messick, an official of the National Horse Show Commission who was videotaping inspections on August 26, 2002, testified that Bennett would not allow Dr. Guedron to finish inspecting The Duck. Additionally, Leigh Bennett (Kim Bennett\u2019s wife) testified that Bennett told Dr. Guedron that \u201cif he could not inspect him properly, that he [Bennett] didn\u2019t want him [Dr. Guedron] to inspect him [The Duck].\u201d Tr. at 370. Similarly, Bennett testified that \u201cI refused him [Dr. Guedron] to inspect him [The Duck] improperly.\u201d Tr. at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Thus, the record indicates that substantial evidence supported the Judicial Officer\u2019s conclusion that Bennett refused to allow Dr. Guedron to complete his inspection of The Duck. Substantial evidence need not even be a \u201cpreponderance\u201d of the evidence. <em>Bobo, </em>52 F.3d at 1410. Here, five eyewitnesses agree that Bennett would not allow Dr. Guedron to inspect The Duck. Bennett and his wife were both careful to say that Bennett would not allow the inspection <em>unless </em>Dr. Guedron would conduct it \u201cproperly.\u201d Clearly, Bennett\u2019s position is that he objected to Dr. Guedron\u2019s inspection only because it was being conducted improperly. However, even Bennett and his wife do not claim that Bennett allowed Dr. Guedron to inspect the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Bennett also argues that the ALJ\u2019s determinations should be given particular weight because they are based on credibility determinations. Bennett is correct that the factfindings of an ALJ are given greater weight when they are based on credibility determinations. In this case, the ALJ\u2019s opinion states in so many words that \u201cI found Kim Bennett to be a credible witness.\u201d ALJ Opinion at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">However, the Judicial Officer\u2019s reversal was not based on his disagreement with the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact. Both the ALJ\u2019s and Judicial Officer\u2019s opinions found that Bennett was willing to have The Duck inspected as long as Dr. Guedron did not perform the inspection. ALJ Opinion at 8; Opinion of Secretary at 15. Thus, the fact that credibility-based factfindings of ALJs are given greater weight does not undermine the decision of the Judicial Officer in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Bennett also argues that the USDA\u2019s decision not to offer evidence from Dr. Guedron himself leads to an adverse inference regarding what such evidence would have shown. This adverse inference arises in the Sixth Circuit under the so-called \u201cmissing witness rule\u201d when a party fails to call a witness \u201cpeculiarly within [his] power to produce\u201d and whose testimony would \u201celucidate the transaction.\u201d <em>United States v. Blakemore, </em>489 F.2d 193, 195 (6th Cir.1973) (quoting <em>Wynn v. United States, </em>397 F.2d 621, 625 (D.C.Cir.1967)) (internal quotations omitted) (alteration in original).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">At the time of the proceedings below, Dr. Guedron had left the USDA. Even assuming that he was a witness peculiarly within the USDA\u2019s power to produce, the adverse inference is not helpful to Bennett. Bennett\u2019s principal contention throughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>has been that Dr. Guedron was inspecting The Duck in an unreasonable manner. The ALJ found that the inspection was unreasonable; the USDA maintains that reasonableness was irrelevant in this case. Thus, had Dr. Guedron admitted on the stand that his inspection was unreasonable, the case would not be altered. Bennett\u2019s case does not fail for lack of evidence regarding Dr. Guedron\u2019s method of inspection, but because the USDA interprets \u00a7 1824(9) as requiring an exhibitor to permit inspection, even if he believes it to be unreasonable, under such circumstances as existed here. Even granting Bennett every inference in his favor, the Judicial Officer\u2019s determination that Bennett violated the inspection requirement of the Horse Protection Act is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">For these reasons, the Judicial Officer\u2019s decision that Bennett violated the Horse Protection Act is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">. Both the USDA here and the Tenth Circuit in <em>McNamar v. Apfel, </em>172 F.3d 764, 766 (10th Cir. 1999), which the USDA quotes, inaccurately claim that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Thomas Jefferson University </em>holds that courts defer to agency interpretations of <em>both </em>the statutes <em>and </em>regulations they administer. <em>Thomas Jefferson University </em>refers only to the interpretations of regulations.
