This petition for review involves the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA) denial of the petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen their case based on ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-21\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, we may not review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioners failed to demonstrate \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to a qualifying relative, which would have made them eligible for cancellation of removal. Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s jurisdictional bar does not, as petitioners argue, violate the separation of powers. <em>See Kalaw v. I.N.S., </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1152 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-22\">Nor does this jurisdictional bar violate Bryan Romero\u2019s constitutional rights. Citizen family members \u2014 including citizen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>children \u2014 cannot challenge the removal of an otherwise removable alien based on their own constitutional rights as citizens. <em>See Urbano de Malaluan v. I.N.S., </em>577 F.2d 589, 594 (9th Cir.1978). A contrary rule \u201cwould permit a wholesale avoidance of immigration laws if an alien were to be able to enter the country, have a child shortly thereafter, and prevent deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) does not, as petitioners argue, unconstitutionally deprive Bryan Romero of judicial review of a decision affecting his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The BIA did not err in denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Assuming without deciding that the BIA erred in its application of the <em>Lozada </em>requirements and the standard used to determine whether the petitioners suffered prejudice due to the ineffective assistance of their first counsel, petitioners have not demonstrated \u201cplausible grounds for relief\u2019 as is required to support a due process claim for ineffective assistance of counsel in an immigration proceeding. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 794 (9th Cir.2005). Petitioners\u2019 eligibility for cancellation of removal hinges on demonstrating that a qualifying relative would suffer \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d were petitioners removed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). The only types of hardship petitioners have asserted Bryan Romero would suffer were he to return to Mexico with the petitioners are cultural alienation, lower standards of living and disparities in educational opportunities, all of which are insufficient to meet the high standard set out in \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). <em>Cf. Matter of Andazola-Rivas, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 319 (BIA 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In the absence of any plausible ground upon which the plaintiffs could prevail were they granted a new hearing, we cannot conclude that there is any chance the petitioners\u2019 lawyer\u2019s \u201cdeficient performance <em>may </em>have affected the proceedings.\u201d <em>Maravilla v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 855, 859 (9th Cir.2004) (emphasis added). The petition to review the BIA\u2019s denial of the petition to reopen is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
