It is</p>\n<p id=\"b28-28\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the District Court be affirmed. Long claims that the Department of Transportation discriminated against her on the basis of her race in denying her a career ladder promotion. The Department submitted evidence that it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>promote Long because she was not qualified for a promotion. J.A. 14-15. Long did not offer sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute that the Department\u2019s nondiscriminatory explanation was pretextual. <em>Id. </em>at 18. Therefore, the District Court properly granted the Department\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). <em>Cf. Barnette v. Chertoff, </em>453 F.3d 513, 519 (D.C.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published.
