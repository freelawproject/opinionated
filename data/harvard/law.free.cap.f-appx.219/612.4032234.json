Hunt, Pekin, IL, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b638-21\">Before MELLOY, SMITH, and BENTON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b638-22\">[UNPUBLISHED]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b638-23\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b638-24\">Mark Hunt was previously convicted of the felony offense of possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime and sentenced to sixty months of incarceration and a five-year term of supervised release. The terms of Hunt\u2019s supervised release included a requirement that Hunt refrain from committing additional crimes. While on supervised release, Hunt was indicted and pleaded guilty to the felony offenses of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin; distribution of heroin; and possession with intent to distribute heroin. Hunt was sentenced to a total of ninety-six months of incarceration for these new convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-25\">At a supervised release revocation hearing, Hunt admitted he violated the terms of his supervised release by, among other things, committing the felony offenses listed above. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Hunt to fifty-eight months of imprisonment, to be served consecutively to the term of incarceration for his new convictions. Hunt appeals, arguing that his revocation sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Hunt\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Tyson, </em>413 F.3d 824, 825 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (stating that, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), revocation sentences are reviewed for unreasonableness). The sentence is within authorized limits. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The court considered appropriate factors in imposing the revocation sentence, including the nature of the violations, the need for general deterrence, and the pertinent policy statements in Chapter 7 of the United State Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e)(3); 3553(a). Notably, the same judge who imposed Hunt\u2019s original sentence presided over his revocation. Thus, the district court was familiar with Hunt\u2019s history and characteristics. <em>See United States v. Franklin, </em>397 F.3d 604, 607 (8th Cir.2005) (considering, among other things, the district court\u2019s familiarity with the defendant from imposing the original sentence in finding no abuse of discretion in the revocation sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">We further conclude that requiring the sentence to be served consecutively did not render it unreasonable. It was well within the district court\u2019s discretion to impose a consecutive sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a); <em>United States v. Cotroneo, </em>89 F.3d 510, 512-13 (8th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-18\">. The Honorable Donald J. Stohr, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
