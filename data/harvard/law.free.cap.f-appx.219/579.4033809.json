The district court denied Guillen\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-18\">Sergeant Truax, a guard at the Wabash Valley Correctional Center, filed a conduct report charging Guillen with \u201cthreatening\u201d him. According to the report, the officer took Guillen \u2014 who was scheduled to be drug tested along with several other inmates \u2014 out of his cell. Guillen, walking behind the officer, loudly asked him, \u201cSo what did you come here wanting from me, an ass whippin?\u201d The officer responded, \u2018What did you just say?\u201d Guillen answered, \u2018You look like a young guy, and you\u2019re pretty stout. It won\u2019t be an easy ass whippin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-19\">Guillen pleaded not guilty to the threatening charge and asked for a lay advocate. He said at his screening interview that he did not wish to call any witnesses, but he requested Truax\u2019s medical and \u201cgym use\u201d records, which, according to Guillen, would show that it was physically impossible for Guillen to \u201ckick [Truax\u2019s] ass.\u201d Guillen was assigned a lay advocate, and at his hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing Board (DHB) Guillen argued that in fact it was Truax who threatened him. Guillen further argued that he did not commit the offense of \u201cthreatening\u201d Truax because Truax was never actually afraid. The DHB denied Guillen\u2019s request for the guard\u2019s medical and gym records as irrelevant, credited the guard\u2019s statement, found Guillen guilty, and revoked 90 days of good time. Guillen\u2019s initial administrative appeal was denied. In denying his subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>quent appeal, the prison approved the DHB\u2019s decision to deny the medical and gym records to Guillen as indeed irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Guillen turned to the district court, filing a \u00a7 2254 petition in which he challenged his conviction on three grounds: the evidence did not prove that he threatened Sergeant Truax, his request to present Truax\u2019s medical and gym records was wrongfully denied, and Truax\u2019s conduct report was retaliatory. The district court held that Guillen received all of the procedural protection required under <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), and his conviction was valid because it was supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d <em>Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). The district court did not specifically discuss the denial of the request for Truax\u2019s records or the retaliation allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny Guillen\u2019s petition de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Simpson v. Battaglia, </em>458 F.3d 585, 592 (7th Cir. 2006). Guillen has a protected liberty interest in his earned good-time credits and may not be deprived of them without due process. <em>See Cochran v. Buss, </em>381 F.3d 637, 639 (7th Cir.2004) (per curiam); <em>Montgomery v. Anderson, </em>262 F.3d 641, 645 (7th Cir.2001). Among the procedural safeguards afforded inmates at disciplinary hearings is a limited right to call witnesses and present other evidence. <em>Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 566, 94 S.Ct. 2963; <em>Parnell v. McBride, </em>306 F.3d 499, 502-03 (7th Cir. 2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Section B-213 of Indiana\u2019s Disciplinary Code for Adult Offenders prohibits \u201c[i] ntimidation or threatening another with bodily harm or with an offense against the person or property.\u201d Guillen\u2019s conviction of this offense must be supported by at least \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>Superintendent, </em>472 U.S. at 455, 105 S.Ct. 2768. An officer\u2019s conduct report alone can satisfy this lenient standard. <em>See McPherson v. McBride, </em>188 F.3d 784, 786 (7th Cir.1999). Here, Sergeant Truax\u2019s report stating that Guillen threatened to attack him is sufficient evidence that Guillen committed the offense. Guillen admits that he made the statements Truax reported, but argues that Truax misconstrued them. Guillen claims he meant to suggest that Truax was going to deliver a beating <em>to </em>Guillen, not receive one <em>from </em>him. But the DHB was not required to credit this explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Guillen\u2019s principal challenge to his conviction concerns his mistaken belief that the evidence must establish that Sergeant Truax was in fear as a result of Guillen\u2019s statements. The code contains no such requirement of subjective fear on the part of the person threatened, and we know of no case that imposes one for threats made by prisoners. Without a requirement of subjective fear, Guillen\u2019s next argument\u2014 that the DHB wrongfully denied him access to Truax\u2019s medical and gym records\u2014 also fails.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Guillen does have a conditional due process right to present documentary evidence, but only if that evidence is relevant. <em>See Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 566, 94 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>2963. Even if these records showed that Truax had no reason to be afraid of Guil-len, because the question of Truax\u2019s subjective fear is irrelevant to the validity of Guillen\u2019s conviction, we uphold the DHB\u2019s denial of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Finally, Guillen maintains here, as he did during his administrative appeals and before the district court, that Sergeant Truax\u2019s filing of the disciplinary report was retaliatory. Inmates have a right to be free from arbitrary actions of correctional officers, <em>McPherson, </em>188 F.3d at 787, but the protection against such actions are provided by adequate procedural safeguards, including that the disciplinary decisions be supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>See id.; McKinney v. Meese, </em>831 F.2d 728, 733 (7th Cir.1987) (per curiam). Guillen\u2019s assertion of retaliation fails because he fails to establish that the proper procedures were ignored, or that the evidence relied upon was not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Guillen\u2019s remaining claims \u2014 his allegedly thwarted attempt to call Sergeant Truax as a witness at the hearing and his challenge to the prison\u2019s policy of randomly subjecting inmates to drug testing \u2014 we re not raised in his habeas petition. Thus they are not properly before us. <em>See, e.g., Estremera v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 580, 587 (7th Cir.2006) (\u201cIt is well settled that \u2018arguments not raised in the district court are waived on appeal.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Belom v. National Futures Ass\u2019n, </em>284 F.3d 795, 799 (7th Cir.2002))).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\">. The government argues that this issue was procedurally defaulted, but its contention that Guillen \"never complained of a denial of [Truax\u2019s] records during his administrative appeal\u2019\u2019 is erroneous. Guillen <em>did </em>raise this issue in his second administrative appeal, and the final reviewing authority \u2014 which is equivalent, in this context, to the state's highest court, <em>see Moffat v. Broyles, </em>288 F.3d 978, 982 (7th Cir.2002) \u2014 denied his claim on the merits. We do as well. <em>See Jenkins v. Nelson, </em>157 F.3d 485, 497-98 (7th Cir.1998) (\"[W]hen the last state court to address the issue reaches its merits without invoking forfeiture, the question is open on collateral review under \u00a7 2254.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
