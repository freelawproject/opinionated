Sept. 30, 2004), <em>aff'g </em>No. A. 96 265 099 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 8, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as the final agency determination. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, the Court will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). Even though a different finder of fact might have weighed the evidence in this case and reached the opposite result, because there is no evidence that compels a contrary conclusion, and because we find the IJ neither overlooked evidence of ethnic slurs in making his finding nor unreasonably applied the law to his finding, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u201cPersecution\u201d is defined as \u201cthe infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ on the basis of a protected statutory ground.\u201d <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 340-41 (2d Cir.2006). Throughout his decision, the IJ made clear that he understood and considered all of Mr. Candra\u2019s testimony regarding the anti-Chinese remarks made to him while he was being harassed at school and victimized by robbers. The IJ ultimately concluded that Mr. Candra did not suffer persecution because Mr. Candra\u2019s Chinese ethnicity was not what motivated the attacks upon him. We conclude that no evidence in the record compels a contrary finding. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (stating that \u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d); <em>see also Boroviko-va v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>435 F.3d 151, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Mr. Candra suggests his attackers\u2019 use of ethnic slurs establishes the harassers\u2019 motivation. The logical extension of that argument is that any time evidence is presented that a racial epithet was used during a hazing or criminal episode, that infliction of harm must have been on account of the victim\u2019s ethnicity. Because we cannot accept that any use of an ethnic slur perforce renders ethnicity the motivation for any concomitant infliction of harm, <em>see, e.g, Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 536 (3d Cir.2005), we must allow the IJ to make a finding regarding the attackers\u2019 motivation, and uphold that finding where it is supported and absent compelling evidence to the contrary. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">We observe that the IJ stated \u201cthere is no evidence in the record to suggest that [Mr. Candra] was robbed because he was Chinese.\u201d Because the IJ had already comprehensively identified such evidence in his opinion, however, in the context of the IJ\u2019s decision, that statement can faithfully be interpreted on review to mean that no evidence <em>persuaded </em>the IJ to so conclude. \u201c[T]he IJ need not engage in robotic incantations.... \u201d <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 336 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is not a case in which such evidence was in the record but was obviously overlooked by the IJ. Rather, leading up to the conclusion recited, the IJ set out in detail virtually every incident involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ing an ethnic slur that Mr. Candra had described in his testimony, belying any implication that the IJ missed or ignored any such evidence in reaching his conclusion. <em>Cf. Tian-Yong Chen, </em>359 F.3d at 127. Accordingly, we have no basis to vacate the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Candra did not suffer past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The considerable time interval between the episodes to which Mr. Candra refers and his ultimate departure from Indonesia, the fact that his sister attends university in Indonesia and his parents still reside there, support the IJ\u2019s decision that Mr. Candra failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution. Although to mitigate these facts and support his claim, Mr. Candra submitted evidence that his parents\u2019 store in Jakarta was ransacked in 2002 and his parents have moved to a rural area, the IJ was permitted to weigh the evidence on the issue of future persecution and reach the conclusion he did. <em>Borovikova, </em>435 F.3d at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">For the foregoing reasons the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
