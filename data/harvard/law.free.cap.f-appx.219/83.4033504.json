Acosta v. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., </em>No. 05 Civ. 977, 2006 WL 229196 (S.D.N.Y. Jan.30, 2006). Defendants-appellees are JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (\u201cJPMC\u201d), William B. Harrison, Jr., Brian D. O\u2019Neill, Joseph M. Martin, Ambassador David C. Mulford, and George B. Weiksner (collectively, \u201cdefendants\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts of the case, its procedural history, and the arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">The district court is endowed with substantial discretion in deciding a motion for dismissal on grounds of <em>forum non conve-niens. Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, </em>454 U.S. 235, 257, 102 S.Ct. 252, 70 L.Ed.2d 419 (1981). This Court reviews a district court\u2019s <em>forum non conveniens </em>dismissal for clear abuse of discretion. <em>Pollux Holding Ltd. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>329 F.3d 64, 70 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">As an initial matter, plaintiffs incorrectly contend that the district court erred in making \u201cfindings of fact on the motion to dismiss adverse to plaintiffs, when all facts pled in the complaint should, on such a motion, be accepted as true.\u201d It has long been the law of this Circuit that \u201cin the determination of a motion to dismiss for <em>forum non conveniens, </em>the court may consider affidavits submitted by the moving and opposing parties,\u201d <em>Vanity Fair Mills, Inc. v. T. Eaton Co., </em>234 F.2d 633, 645 (2d Cir.1956), and make findings of fact, <em>Pollux, </em>329 F.3d at 70, 76-77 (identifying \u201cclearly erroneous finding[s] of fact\u201d as grounds for reversing a <em>forum non conveniens </em>decision, and rejecting appellants\u2019 challenges to the district court\u2019s factual findings). Regardless of the standard the district court enunciated, to the extent it made findings of fact based on the parties\u2019 affidavits, it was appropriate for it to have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">In evaluating a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for <em>forum non conveniens, </em>a district court must: (1) evaluate the level of deference to which plaintiffs choice of forum is entitled, (2) determine the availability of an \u201cadequate alternative forum,\u201d and (3) if such forum exists, balance relevant public and private interests, and conclude, based on that balance, whether plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum may stand. <em>Pollux, </em>329 F.3d at 70 (citing <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. 501, 507-09, 67 S.Ct. 839, 91 L.Ed. 1055 (1947)).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">Plaintiffs claim their choice of forum should be accorded \u201csignificant deference.\u201d Deference is strongest \u201cwhen a plaintiff sues in his home forum,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 71, but \u201ca foreign plaintiff\u2019s choice [of forum] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>deserves less deference,\u201d <em>Piper, </em>454 U.S. at 256, 102 S.Ct. 252. All plaintiffs in the current action are foreign nationals. As the district court noted, while not dispositive, this fact is \u201crelevant ... in assessing relative convenience.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Moreover, any degree of deference to plaintiffs\u2019 choice to sue in defendants\u2019 home forum (as opposed to plaintiffs\u2019 home forum) is available only to the extent that plaintiffs or the case possess a <em>\u201cbona fide </em>connection[ ]\u201d to this forum. <em>Pollux, </em>329 F.3d at 74. The connections to the United States alleged by plaintiffs, however, are insubstantial in light of the fact that the vast majority of the activities alleged in the complaint were committed by foreign nationals on foreign soil. Plaintiffs thus fail to allege a <em>bona fide </em>connection that justifies granting substantial deference to their choice of forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Plaintiffs also allege that the district court erred in concluding that the courts of Uruguay are an adequate and available alternative forum. We disagree. An alternative forum is generally adequate and available when defendants are amenable to jurisdiction in that forum, unless \u201c \u2018the remedy offered by the other forum is clearly unsatisfactory.\u2019\u201d <em>Aguinda v. Texaco, Inc., </em>303 F.3d 470, 476-77 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Piper, </em>454 U.S. at 255 n. 22, 102 S.Ct. 252). Because defendants stipulate that they consent to jurisdiction for claims raised in the original complaint, plaintiffs\u2019 only remaining claim is that the courts of Uruguay are too biased and corrupt to provide an adequate remedy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The district court found plaintiffs\u2019 claims of corruption \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and \u201cnot compelling.\u201d The courts of Uruguay have and are exercising subject matter jurisdiction over these matters, as is evidenced by the pending civil and criminal litigation in Uruguay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Piper, </em>454 U.S. at 255 n. 22, 102 S.Ct. 252 (\u201c[Djismissal [for <em>forum non conveniens </em>] would not be appropriate where the alternative forum does not permit litigation of the subject matter of the dispute.\u201d). While plaintiffs\u2019 expert testified that it was unlikely that Uruguayan courts would hand down a judgment adverse to the economically powerful defendants, defendants\u2019 expert noted the Uruguayan government\u2019s ongoing, aggressive litigation against defendants. In light of the evidence before it, it was not error for the district court to credit defendants\u2019 argument that the Uruguayan courts were not biased. <em>See Monegasque De Reassurances S.A.M. v. Nak Naftogaz of Ukr., </em>311 F.3d 488, 499 (2d Cir.2002) (refusing to find foreign courts corrupt or biased where plaintiff advanced conclusory and sweeping generalizations).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Plaintiffs claim further that the district court improperly weighed the private and public interest factors and that those factors dictated New York as a more con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>venient forum. Plaintiffs did not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that the alleged fraudulent acts occurred in Uruguay and Argentina. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that the district court\u2019s determination that the majority of the relevant documents are in Uruguay and Argentina is \u201cirrelevant to the extent that it is true,\u201d and that contrary to the district court\u2019s determination witnesses are found in Argentina, Uruguay <em>and </em>the United States. We find nothing unreasonable in the district court\u2019s conclusion, based on defendants\u2019 evidence, that \u201cnearly all of the relevant non-party witnesses\u201d are in Argentina and Uruguay, and that the inconvenience of transporting witnesses and translating documents from Spanish to English weighed in favor of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In considering the public factors specified in <em>Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. at 508-09, 67 S.Ct. 839 the district court reasonably found that the resolution of this case \u201cwill require extensive applications of both Uruguayan and Argentine law,\u201d and that the interest of the United States pales compared to the \u201cimmense interest\u201d of Uruguay. This analysis of the public interests did not \u201cfail[ ] to consider all the relevant factors or unreasonably balanee[] those factors.\u201d <em>Pollux, </em>329 F.3d at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">. Plaintiffs also argue that a forum selection clause in a 1990 Shareholder Agreement, to which JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s alleged predecessor-in-interest was a party, but to which no current defendants were parties and no plaintiff is either party or beneficiary, proves that New York is a convenient forum for the current defendants. As the district court noted, even if the parties had been signatories, the agreement to which plaintiffs refer applies only to contract and tort claims arising under that agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b112-12\">. Plaintiffs do not renew their argument regarding the delay of relief in the Uruguayan courts, and thus that argument is waived. <em>LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b112-13\">. As defendants note, the adequacy of remedy available in Uruguayan courts is supported by the choice of over one hundred of the plaintiffs in the district court action to pursue their claim in Uruguayan court rather than join in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
