Because the sentence was reasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-26\">On August 17, 2005, a grand jury indicted Kerrent with two counts of being a felon-in-possession. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u00a7 922(g)(1). Kerrent pleaded guilty to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In sentencing Kerrent, the district court used the 2004 version of the guidelines and grouped his offenses under \u00a7 3D1.2(d). The felon-in-possession guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), instructed the district court to start with a base level of 24. After adding 2 levels because one of the offenses involved a stolen handgun and subtracting 3 levels because he accepted responsibility for the crimes, the district court set Ker-rent\u2019s offense level at 23. The district court calculated Kerrent\u2019s criminal history, which included four controlled-substance convictions, as a category IV. Once combined, his offense level and criminal history gave him a guidelines range of 70-87 months. The district court imposed an 84-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">We review criminal sentences after <em>Booker </em>for \u201cprocedural\u201d and \u201csubstantive\u201d reasonableness. <em>United States v. Davis, 458 F.3d 491, 495 </em>(6th Cir.2006). In this instance Kerrent challenges his sentence only for procedural reasonableness, which gauges whether the district court appreciated the advisory nature of the guidelines, calculated the guidelines range correctly and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in exercising its independent judgment about what sentence to impose. <em>United States v. McBride, </em>434 F.3d 470, 476 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The district court satisfied these requirements. Kerrent does not claim that the district court failed to appreciate the advisory nature of the guidelines range, as indeed he could not on this record. <em>See </em>Sentencing Tr. at 13 (observing that \u201cthe guidelines are only advisory, the court\u2019s not required to follow them\u201d). Kerrent conceded below, and does not argue otherwise on appeal, that the district court correctly calculated his guidelines range. <em>See </em>Sentencing Tr. at 6 (Kerrent\u2019s counsel conceding that \u201c[w]e understand what [the guidelines range] is ... [a]nd it\u2019s correctly calculated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Nor has Kerrent identified any \u00a7 3553(a) factor that the district court failed to consider or failed to give appropriate weight. In point of fact, the record shows that the district court thoroughly considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Contemplating the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), the district court noted that Kerrent was \u201cat the top of [his] criminal history category,\u201d Sentencing Tr. at 14, expressed concern over \u201cthe fact that [Kerrent had] three prior convictions for controlled substances,\u201d <em>id., </em>and observed that \u201cpeople with multiple drug felonies\u201d who possess firearms pose even greater danger than, say, an \u201cembezzler or a white-collar criminal\u201d who possesses firearms, <em>id. </em>at 15. Considering the need \u201cto promote respect for the law,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), the district court stated that it wanted to show \u201cother felons who possess firearms\u201d that \u201cit\u2019s against the law, and you get punished if you do it,\u201d Sentencing Tr. at 15. Seeking \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C), and \u201cto provide the defendant with needed ... medical care in the most effective manner,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D), the district court recommended that Kerrent serve his time \u201cat an institution where [he] [could] get long-term drug treatment\u201d to correct his \u201csubstance abuse problem,\u201d Sentencing Tr. at 17. Weighing the various \u201ckinds of sentences available,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3), the district court concluded that a defendant \u201cwith a record as long as [Kerrent\u2019s] require[d] a sentence of imprisonment\u201d and pointed out that \u201cthe option of probation is really not an option in this case,\u201d Sentencing Tr. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>In the end, the district court considered all of the factors \u2014 save for \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (unwarranted sentencing disparities), which did not apply because Kerrent never argued that his within-guidelines sentence would create sentencing disparities, and save for \u00a7 3553(a)(7) (restitution), which did not apply to this sentence. Kerrent thus cannot show that the district court failed adequately to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Christopher, </em>415 F.3d 590, 594 (6th Cir.2005) (\u201cNor has [defendant] offered any explanation on appeal as to what factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) the district court should have considered, or how these factors would have made a difference in the sentence he received.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Even if all of this is true, Kerrent maintains that the district court committed reversible error because it misapprehended its role and thought its job was to impose a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence. While we agree with the legal premise of Kerrent\u2019s argument, we do not agree with the factual premise of it or with its conclusion. \u201cReasonableness,\u201d it is by now well established, is the <em>appellate </em>standard of review, not the standard by which district courts impose sentences, the latter of which requires district courts to apply the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and impose a sentence \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing in section 3553(a)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Foreman, </em>436 F.3d 638, 644 n. 1 (6th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Yet there are at least two problems with Kerrent pressing this argument here. In the first place, the factual predicate for making the argument does not exist. The district court never employed the term \u201creasonable\u201d in describing the sentence it imposed. <em>Cf. United States v. Jackson, </em>466 F.3d 537, 539 (6th Cir.2006). To the contrary, the only mention of the term at sentencing came from Kerrent\u2019s counsel. <em>See, e.g., </em>Sentencing Tr. at 11 (\u201cAnd so it\u2019s our position that Your Honor, obviously, is required to fashion a reasonable sentence .... \u201d); <em>id. </em>(opining that a sentence between 46-48 months \u201ccertainly is a reasonable sentence\u201d); <em>id. </em>(asking the district court \u201cto consider [46^48 months] as a more reasonable sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">In the second place, Kerrent has not shown how any such error, even if it had occurred, would establish reversible error here. We have considered several cases in which the district court mistook its job as imposing a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence rather than a sentence consistent with the parsimony provision, and as a general rule we have held such errors to be harmless. <em>See United States v. Gaskin, </em>217 Fed.Appx. 511, 516 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201cWe have never held, however, that the district court must incant or cite ... 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Cruz, </em>461 F.3d 752, 755-56 (6th Cir.2006) (acknowledging that the district court erred when it stated that the selected sentence was reasonable, but finding such error to be harmless); <em>United States v. Gale, </em>468 F.3d 929, 933-34 (6th Cir.2006) (same); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>458 F.3d 505, 509-11 (6th Cir.2006) (same); <em>see also, e.g., United States v. Robinson, </em>217 Fed.Appx. 503, 509-10 (6th Cir.2007) (same); <em>United States v. Pennington, </em>216 Fed.Appx. 479, 483-84 (6th Cir.2007) (same); <em>United States v. Merrell, </em>213 Fed.Appx. 402, 408-10 (6th Cir.2007) (same). Because Kerrent offers no explanation why we should decline to follow this path here, he must accept the ruling on this argument that we generally have made with respect to other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
