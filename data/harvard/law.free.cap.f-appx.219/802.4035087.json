On November 17, 2005, Mr. Castillo pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). However, he refused to \u201ctruthfully provide[] to the Government all information and evidence [he] has concerning the offense\u201d so that he could qualify for a safety valve reduction in his sentencing range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6C1.2(5). The district court sentenced Mr. Castillo to 120 months of imprisonment followed by 24 months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-21\">Mr. Castillo timely moved to reopen his sentencing hearing so that he could provide information and qualify for the safety valve. Thereafter, he again chose not to provide information. Defense counsel informed the district court of his client\u2019s decision, and the court entered a final judgment on January 26, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-22\">Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>(1967), Mr. Castillo\u2019s counsel informs us that Mr. Castillo did not qualify for the safety valve because of his refusal to \u201ctruthfully provide[] to the Government all information and evidence [he] has concerning the offense.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(5). This, as counsel notes, is a prerequisite that a defendant must satisfy before he can be eligible for the safety valve. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Mr. Castillo did not respond to his attorney\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief; the government likewise determined that no response was necessary. Having reviewed the record, we detect no non-frivolous grounds for appeal. Accordingly, we will allow Mr. Castillo\u2019s counsel to withdraw and DISMISS this appeal. <em>See United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 929-30 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b828-23\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
