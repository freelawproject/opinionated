We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">A grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. Beth Israel Med. Ctr. v. Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey, Inc., </em>448 F.3d 573, 579 (2d Cir.2006). \u201c[Sjummary judgment is appropriate where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and, based on the undisputed facts, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\"><em>First Amendment claim. </em>Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Smith engaged in protected speech, he has failed to create a triable issue as to whether there was a \u201ccausal connection between the protected speech and the adverse action.\u201d <em>See Gill v. Pidlypchak, </em>389 F.3d 379, 380 (2d Cir. 2004). This claim was therefore appropriately dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\"><em>Fourth Amendment claims. </em>Because Smith had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his prison cell, his claim that it was searched unreasonably must fail. <em>See Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 525-26, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). His claim regarding a search of his outgoing and incoming mail fails as conclusory. <em>See Schwapp v. Town of Avon, </em>118 F.3d 106, 111 (2d Cir.1997). And we do not reach his claim regarding a strip-search, because it was not raised below. <em>See Gulino v. N.Y. State Educ. Dep\u2019t, </em>460 F.3d 361, 380 n. 22 (2d Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-15\"><em>Eighth Amendment claim. </em>Because Smith failed to utilize the Department of Correction\u2019s internal procedures before bringing his Eighth Amendment claim to federal court, the district court correctly dismissed it for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 910, 923, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007) (\u201c[I]t is the prison\u2019s requirements ... that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-18\"><em>Fourteenth Amendment claim. </em>Because Smith\u2019s disciplinary conviction has not been reversed, expunged, or otherwise invalidated, his claim that his due process rights were violated at the disciplinary hearing must fail. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 647, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-19\"><em>Conspiracy claim. </em>Smith\u2019s claim that Woods conspired with other prison officials against him is without any factual foundation, and therefore also fails. <em>See Webb v. Goord, </em>340 F.3d 105, 110-11 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-20\">We have considered all of Smith\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>without merit. The judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
