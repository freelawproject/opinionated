The defendants were convicted on seven counts and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment on each count to run concurrently, given supervised release for a term of five years on each count to run concurrently, and fined a $700 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-16\">The defendants present the following issues for appellate review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-17\">1. Whether the district court committed reversible error in excusing for cause a prospective juror who admitted her inability to set aside her personal experiences and bias and judge solely on the evidence and the court\u2019s instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-18\">2. Whether the district court excluded critical evidence in violation of the defendants\u2019 constitutional rights to a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-19\">3. Whether the district court abused its discretion by denying defendant Walker\u2019s motion for severance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-20\">4. Whether there was sufficient evidence that defendant Walker participated in Brown\u2019s murder in consideration for \u201canything of pecuniary value.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-21\">5. Whether the district court applied the appropriate interstate nexus under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958; and if so, whether federal jurisdiction based on such a nexus violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-22\">6. Whether the district court improperly charged the jury with respect to the jurisdictional element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-23\">7. Whether the defendants\u2019 prosecution in federal court for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958 violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>After reviewing the record, reading the parties\u2019 briefs and having the benefit of oral argument, we conclude that there is no merit to any of the arguments defendants make concerning issues 1-4 and 6-7. Accordingly, we summarily affirm as to those issues without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Concerning issue 5, we find that the district court applied the appropriate interstate nexus, and the defendants\u2019 constitutional argument is foreclosed by our recent decision of <em>United States v. Evans, </em>476 F.3d 1176 (11th Cir.2007), which held that cellular telephones are instrumentalities of interstate commerce, even when used to make intrastate calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the defendants\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
