HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b844-25\">When Gilberto Rodriguez violated the terms of his supervised release, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>court imposed a sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment followed by a new term of supervised release. He appeals, contending that because the probation office, the government, and defense counsel all agreed that no new supervised-release term should be imposed, the court\u2019s imposition of the term was unreasonable. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">In 1995 Mr. Rodriguez pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado to conspiracy to possess and distribute ephedrine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(d)(2) and 846. The district court sentenced him to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. It ordered that while on supervised release he must participate in a drug-treatment program and refrain from using controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Mr. Rodriguez began his term of supervised release on September 11, 2000. Because of an intervening term of imprisonment on a new state conviction during which his federal supervised-release term was inactive, he was still on supervised release in September 2005 when he violated its terms by using methamphetamine. On October 27, 2005, the district court modified the conditions of his release by requiring that he spend up to six months in a community corrections center. In February 2006 he again violated the terms of his release by possessing and using a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">The district court held a revocation hearing on June 7, 2006. At the hearing Mr. Rodriguez admitted that he had (1) possessed and used marijuana in 2001; (2) committed various misdemeanors; (3) possessed and used methamphetamine on September 6, 2005; (4) possessed and used methamphetamine on September 19, 2005; and (5) possessed and used methamphetamine on February 21, 2006. The court accepted his admissions and proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">The government suggested a seven-month term of imprisonment, stating that although Mr. Rodriguez had a serious drug problem, he did not steal to support his habit and had tried treatment programs. The district court noted that his repeated failed efforts at treatment were cause for concern, stating, \u201c[H]e just doesn\u2019t seem to get it. Either that, or the treatment isn\u2019t taking.\u201d R. Vol. II at 10. The government said that the only things that had not yet been tried were Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous, but that \u201cat some point, your Honor, we all have to face the realities of ... limited resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Counsel for Mr. Rodriguez argued that there would \u201cbe no real utility to further supervision,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, so he should simply be punished for his drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">The district court responded that it was inclined to give Mr. Rodriguez a sentence lower than the maximum allowed and \u201cgive him another shot at supervision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. Explaining its reasoning, the court said: \u201cI know probation officers are overworked ... but I believe that\u2019s what we have them there for is to help people like this. And it\u2019s almost too easy to let these folks go ... free and say ... okay, you\u2019re free to go now. No more supervision, nobody looking over your shoulder, no chance for treatment. [But][h]e\u2019s not going to go out and get treatment on his own.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Defense counsel continued to argue against a term of supervised release, saying that Mr. Rodriguez would \u201crather do the year [in prison] and be done with this.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. The district court explained that it was considering what was in the best interests of Mr. Rodriguez and society, not simply his wants. The court continued: \u201cI\u2019m just a very, very strong believer in supervision for as long as possible, and hopefully somewhere along the line maybe he might just get the hint that what he\u2019s doing isn\u2019t real smart.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. When counsel argued that the court should just \u201clet go\u201d of Mr. Rodriguez, it responded that \u201cI never have operated that way, and I have no intention of starting today.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. After speaking with Mr. Rodriguez, the court said \u201cI never lose hope ... When you go to hell, then you lose all hope. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s there, so I don\u2019t lose hope.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The district court found that Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s supervised-release violations were Grade C, that his criminal history was level TV, and that the sentencing range recommended by the United States Sentencing Guidelines policy statements was therefore 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 7B1.4. It further found that Mr. Rodriguez was in need of additional counseling, treatment, and supervision. It sentenced him to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by two-and-a-half years of supervised release. Mr. Rodriguez timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">\u201cIn imposing a sentence following revocation of supervised release, a district court is required to consider both [Guidelines] Chapter 7\u2019s policy statements, as well as a number of the factors provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Cordova, </em>461 F.3d 1184, 1188 (10th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). Among the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that the court must consider are the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need to deter the defendant from further criminal behavior and to protect the public, and the defendant\u2019s need for correctional treatment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court \u201cis not required to consider individually each factor listed in \u00a7 3553(a) nor is it required to recite any magic words to show us that it fulfilled its responsibility to be mindful of the factors that Congress has instructed it to consider before issuing a sentence.\u201d <em>Cordova, </em>461 F.3d at 1189 (internal quotation marks omitted). We will uphold a sentence \u201cif it can be determined from the record to have been reasoned and reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Tedford, </em>405 F.3d 1159, 1161 (10th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Mr. Rodriguez does not argue that his sentence and term of supervised release were incorrectly calculated, or that the district court disregarded the Sentencing Guidelines. Rather, he argues that the supervised-release term is unreasonable because the government, the probation office, and defense counsel urged the court not to impose it, and the court chose not to follow this advice. But the court\u2019s sentence was both thoughtful and reasoned. The record shows that in deciding whether to impose a supervised-release term the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, focusing on the need to deter Mr. Rodriguez from further drug use, his need for drug-abuse treatment, and protecting society. It stated that probation officers were there to help people like Mr. Rodriguez, that having someone \u201clooking over [his] shoulder\u201d upon his release from jail might make him get treatment, R. Vol. II at 16, and that it was a strong believer in supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>The district court adequately considered the sentencing factors; and the sentence it imposed, including the term of supervised release, was not unreasonable. The court was not required to give up on Mr. Rodriguez simply because the probation office, the government, and defense counsel had.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">We AFFIRM the judgment below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b844-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
