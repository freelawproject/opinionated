Selna, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b676-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-21\">Petitioner-Appellant Thomas Michael Trollope appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition challenging his conviction on two counts of child molestation and one count of attempted sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-22\">1. The state failed to assert procedural default as a defense to Trollope\u2019s petition before the district court, and the district court erred when it <em>sua sponte </em>found procedural default and barred Trollope\u2019s <em>pro se </em>claim of newly discovered evidence. <em>See Vang v. Nevada, </em>329 F.3d 1069, 1073 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[W]e hold the state to its waiver and thus reverse the district court\u2019s decision that [Trollope\u2019s claim alleging newly discovered evidence was] procedurally defaulted.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-23\">2. Trollope failed to show that either trial counsel\u2019s or post-trial counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>dard of reasonableness, or that he suffered prejudice. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Accordingly, the district court properly concluded that Trollope\u2019s claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel did not merit an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Totten v. Merkle, </em>137 F.3d 1172, 1176 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">3. Trollope\u2019s claim that it was fundamental error for the Arizona trial court to allow the admission of expert testimony regarding Trollope\u2019s emotional propensity to commit sex crimes is unpersuasive. Because Trollope entered a \u201cno contest\u201d guilty plea, the expert\u2019s testimony was never actually admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">4. Trollope failed to make a sub- \u25a0 stantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right with respect to the claims that the district court did not certify for review. We therefore deny Trollope\u2019s motion to expand the Certificate of Appealability. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED and REMANDED in part for the sole purpose of conducting further proceedings on Trollope\u2019s claim of newly discovered evidence. Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
