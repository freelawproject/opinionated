We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-17\">The report and recommendation of the magistrate judge (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b) concluded that Porter had failed to exhaust administrative remedies as to each of his three discrimination claims, and recommended that summary judgment be granted. The docket sheet indicates that objections by Porter (if any) were due on September 12, 2005. The district court granted an extension to September 23, 2005. Porter did not file any objections before the extended deadline; on September 28 the district court adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the R <em>&amp; </em>R in its entirety and dismissed Porter\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u201c[Fjailure to object timely to a magistrate\u2019s report operates as a waiver of any further judicial review of the magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Small v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>892 F.2d 15, 16 (2d Cir.1989) <em>(per curiam); see also Marcella v. Capital Dist. Physicians\u2019 Health Plan, Inc., </em>293 F.3d 42, 46 (2d Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Male Juvenile, </em>121 F.3d 34, 38-39 (2d Cir.1997). We may excuse this waiver in the interest of justice, <em>see Male Juvenile, </em>121 F.3d at 39, but we decline to exercise our discretion to do so here, as the record reflects no injustice that would be remedied by reaching the merits of Porter\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgement of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
