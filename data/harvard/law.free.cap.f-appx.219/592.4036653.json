After his case was referred to federal authorities, he pleaded guilty to being in the United States without permission after his removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). Twice before this conviction Quintana-Castro had been removed after committing felonies, the first time in 1998 following a conviction for burglary and the second time in 2002 after a conviction for delivering cocaine. The district court calculated a guidelines imprisonment range of 70 to 87 months and sentenced Quintana-Castro to 70 months. The district court explicitly rejected a sentence below the range citing Quintana-Castro\u2019s criminal history and recidivism, including that \u201cjust as of a year ago he was selling drugs to children, to high school students.\u201d Quintana-Castro filed a timely notice of appeal, but his appointed counsel now seeks to withdraw because he cannot discern a nonfrivolous basis for the appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Quinta-na-Castro has not accepted our invitation to comment on counsel\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b). Our review of the record is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>limited to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Counsel identifies only one potential issue: whether Quintana-Castro might argue that his prison sentence is unreasonable because the Northern District of Illinois does not have a \u201cfast-track\u201d program for immigration offenders. <em>See </em>Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, Pub.L. No. 108-21, \u00a7 401, 117 Stat. 650, 675; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1. As counsel correctly notes, however, we have held that the absence of a fast-track program in the sentencing district is not an acceptable reason for imposing a sentence below the guidelines range. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>453 F.3d 458, 462-63 (7th Cir. 2006); <em>see United States v. Martinez-Martinez, </em>442 F.3d 539, 542 (7th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Galicia-Carde-nas, </em>443 F.3d 553, 555 (7th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Thus, we agree with counsel that this potential argument would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
