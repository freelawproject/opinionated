Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b538-22\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b538-23\">Larry White was convicted of participating in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine that began in 1980 and ended in September 1988. Because the offense ended after the Sentencing Reform Act became effective on November 1, 1987, he was sentenced pursuant to that act, which abolished parole. In a habeas corpus petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, White argues that he is nonetheless entitled to parole. The district court denied relief, and White appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-24\">White first maintains that the Sentencing Reform Act is inapplicable to him since the conspiracy he joined began before that act became effective. This argument is without merit. White\u2019s conspiracy ended in 1988, well after the effective date of the Sentencing Reform Act, and we have repeatedly held that a conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>that straddles the effective date of this Act is subject to it. <em>See United States v. Osborne, </em>931 F.2d 1139, 1144 (7th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Fazio, </em>914 F.2d 950, 958-59 (7th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">White also seems to contend that he is eligible for parole since, as he understands it, Congress did not abolish parole for conspiracy offenses until it amended 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 on November 18, 1988. <em>See </em>National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-690, \u00a7 6470. 102 Stat. 4377. This contention is incorrect. It was the Sentencing Reform Act itself that abolished parole, not the unrelated amendment to \u00a7 846. <em>See </em>Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, \u00a7 218(a)(5), 98 Stat.2027; <em>Skowronek v. Brennan, </em>896 F.2d 264, 266 (7th Cir.1990), <em>see also Osborne, </em>931 F.2d at 1145 (applying Sentencing Reform Act to conspiracy that ended after Act\u2019s effective date but before November 1998 amendment to \u00a7 846).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
