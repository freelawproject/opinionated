The government filed a response noting that the district court has now entered a final order denying relief on Marshall\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. In light of the district court\u2019s action, we deny Marshall\u2019s mandamus petition, as well as his motion to expedite, as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
