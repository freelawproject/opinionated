He targeted Feng Bin Ho (\u201cHo\u201d), a construction worker from New York, an illegal immigrant, and a compulsive gambler, eventually kidnaping him and giving rise to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Ho and his girlfriend, Hsin Lan Lin (\u201cHsin\u201d), met Lin and Lin\u2019s girlfriend, Ying Li (\u2018Ying\u201d), in February of 2001, during a gambling trip in Atlantic City. Ho borrowed $10,000 from Lin at a 10 percent per day interest rate. Ho lost the money gambling, but was able to repay the loan by taking out a $15,000 bank loan. Ho and Hsin returned to Atlantic City in February of 2002 for another gambling trip. Ho promptly lost all the money he had brought with him, as well as all that Hsin was willing to give him. Ho saw Lin at the Hilton Casino on February 18, 2002. By the end of the trip on February 23, 2002, Ho owed Lin and his business associate, Kui Lin (\u201cKui\u201d), approximately $23,000. Lin and Kui visited Ho\u2019s home a few days later and forcibly took up residence there, demanding repayment of the loan. On March 12, 2002, Hsin provided $4,000 and was informed by Lin that Ho still owed $15,000. Lin took Ho back to Atlantic City the following day, where Ho lost more money. Kui then drove Ho back to New York City, continued to stay with him and encourage him to pay back his loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">On March 14, 2003, Ho telephoned Hsin and asked her to collect $3,500 from a restaurant owner who owed him money for construction work. Hsin succeeded and gave the money to Ho. Kui took Ho back to Atlantic City. On March 16, 2002, Hsin learned that Ho was in Atlantic City. She drove there and found Ho gambling while Lin watched. Hsin offered to help Ho repay the loans if Lin and Kui would leave Ho alone and stop lending him money. They agreed and allowed Ho and Hsin to return to New York City. Hsin began receiving threatening phone calls from Lin. Lin informed Hsin that Ho owed him $38,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">On March 25, 2002, Lin and Ying came to Ho\u2019s home. They demanded that Ho get into their car, telling him that they were returning to Atlantic City so that Ho could win back some of the money. Ho complied and was taken to a house in Atlantic City where Lin and Ying rented several rooms. Lin and Ying took Ho to a third floor bedroom. Kui joined them, grabbed Ho by the collar, threw him on the bed, and instructed him to call family members to raise money. Ho was unsuccessful. The following day, Lin told Ho that if he was unable to raise the money that day, he would be handed over to a Chinese gang. Lin also threatened Ho\u2019s family in China and claimed that he would sell Hsin to a brothel.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">Ho was locked in the bedroom for 29 hours without food or water. At approximately 10:00 pm on the second night, Ho escaped through the bedroom window <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>while Lin, Ying, and Kui were out getting food. Ho ran two blocks down the road until he found a house with the lights on. He informed the owner that he had been kidnaped and asked the owner to call the police. The owner did so. The police arrived shortly. Ho informed them that he had been kidnaped and took them to the house. The police searched the house with the landlord\u2019s consent. The police apprehended Lin later that evening, using Ho\u2019s description of Lin\u2019s white Lexus. Ho identified Lin at the scene. The police arrested Lin, searched his person, and found four I.O.U.s in his wallet, including one from Ho.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">On April 16, 2002, a federal grand jury charged Lin, Ying, and Kui with conspiracy to kidnap, kidnaping, making extortionate extensions of credit, and collection of credit by extortionate means. A jury convicted Lin on all counts. The District Court sentenced Lin to 109 months\u2019 imprisonment, in the middle of the applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines range of 97 to 121 months. Lin challenged his sentence after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This Court granted Lin\u2019s request, but affirmed his conviction. At Lin\u2019s re-sentencing, the District Court particularly noted Lin\u2019s progress in prison in the intervening three years and sentenced him to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment. Lin timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">On appeal Lin makes two arguments. First, he contends that the District Court erred by treating the Guidelines as a \u201cstarting point,\u201d rather than considering them as one factor among many under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Second, he argues that the District Court acted unreasonably by concluding that a 100 month sentence was the lowest sentence sufficient to accomplish the purposes of punishment. Both these arguments are without merit. We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">The Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>rendered the federal sentencing guidelines advisory. 543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005). The Court stated that appellate courts should review sentences for \u201creasonableness\u201d in reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but declined to specify what form this review would take. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court recently explained its approach in <em>United States v. (Lydia) Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324 (3d Cir.2006). <em>Cooper </em>dictates that we first inquire whether the District Court gave \u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and then \u201cascertain whether those factors were reasonably applied to the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329-30. The party chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>lenging the sentence bears the burden of showing unreasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 332. <em>Cooper </em>mandates that \u201c[t]o determine if the court acted reasonably in imposing the resulting sentence, we must first be satisfied the court exercised its discretion by considering the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329 (citing <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>429 F.3d 673, 679 (7th Cir.2005)). However, \u201ca rote statement of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors should not suffice if at sentencing either [litigant] properly raises a ground of recognized legal merit (provided it has a factual basis) and the court fails to address it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Cooper instructs that the second step in the reasonableness inquiry is to \u201capply a deferential standard\u201d to determine if the sentencing court reasonably applied the factors to the circumstances of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 330. The focus on review is not how the appellate court would have applied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Rather, the emphasis is on \u201cwhether the district judge imposed the sentence he or she did for reasons that are logical and consistent with the factors set forth\u201d in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>This deferential standard recognizes that \u201cthe trial court [is] in the best position to determine the appropriate sentence in light of the particular' circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The District Court committed no error by treating the Guidelines as a logical \u201cstarting point.\u201d Indeed, this Court has often described the Guidelines\u2019 correct role in our sentencing jurisprudence with just such language. <em>See id. </em>at 331 (stating that the Guidelines \u201cprovide a natural starting point for the determination of the appropriate level of punishment for criminal conduct\u201d); <em>King, </em>454 F.3d at 196 (\u201c[W]e emphasize that the sentencing courts in this Circuit should continue to follow the requirement to \u2018consider\u2019 the Guidelines by calculating a Guidelines sentence as they would have before <em>Booker____\u201d); United States v. Vampire Nation, </em>451 F.3d 189, 196 (3d Cir.2006) (\u201c[District courts, post-<em>Booker, </em>exercise broad discretion in imposing sentences, so long as they begin with a properly calculated Guidelines range....\u201d). We have rejected formulations that we believe would accord an inappropriate weight to the Guidelines range, such as presuming that a sentencing court considered the factors or that the resulting sentence was reasonable solely because the sentence fell within the Guidelines range. <em>See Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329-31. The District Court committed no error by beginning with a proper calculation of the Guidelines range-indeed, to do otherwise could constitute a wholesale rejection of the Guidelines, which we have held \u201cis <em>verboten.\u201d United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 249 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Second, Lin argues that the District Court acted unreasonably by concluding that a 100 month sentence was the lowest sentence sufficient to accomplish the purposes of punishment. This Court laid out the contours of this deferential portion of our review in <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 330 (\u201c[W]e must also ascertain whether those factors were reasonably applied to the circumstances of the case. In doing so, we apply a deferential standard, the trial court being in the best position to determine the appropriate sentence in light of the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d). We emphasized in <em>Cooper </em>that we should not ourselves weigh the sentencing factors, but inquire simply \u201cwhether the district judge imposed the sentence he or she did for reasons that are logical and consistent with the factors set forth in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>We repeatedly noted in <em>Cooper </em>that a \u201csentence that falls within the guidelines range is more likely to be reasonable than one outside the guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331; <em>see also id. </em>at 332. The District Court noted that Lin\u2019s back<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>ground and the circumstances of his crime were not meaningfully different from most who were convicted of his offenses. The Court walked through each of the sentencing factors, noting both the acute mental suffering of the victim and Lin\u2019s apparent failure to contribute to society. The Court noted that, although specific deterrence was not at issue as Lin is almost certain to be deported, the sentence must be adequate to serve the purpose of general deterrence. The Court exercised admirable thoroughness in its discussion of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in explaining their application to the facts of the case. We can perceive no reason in the briefs or the record that we should hold the District Court\u2019s sentence unreasonable. Lin asks us to re-balance the facts of his record\u2014 the very task that <em>Cooper </em>admonishes us to avoid. We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-5\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231.
