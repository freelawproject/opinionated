This court\u2019s review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether the Commissioner used proper legal standards to evaluate the evidence and whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir. 2000). We find that the ALJ\u2019s decision comports with the legal standards for disability determination set forth by this Court under the Act and relevant regulations. The ALJ\u2019s decision reflects that he properly considered all of the evidence of record concerning Truitt\u2019s condition, including the objective findings in her treatment records, her treatment history, the findings of consultative examiners Dr. Tad-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>lock, Dr. Hirsch, Dr. Dubin, and Dr. Harrell, the assessments of the non-examining state agency physicians, testimony of a vocational expert, Truitt\u2019s testimony, and her activity level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The ALJ\u2019s decision further indicates that he recognized and applied the relevant legal standards in assessing Truitt\u2019s residual functional capacity and the credibility of her subjective allegations. The record also reflects that the ALJ properly considered all of Truitt\u2019s symptoms, including pain, and the extent to which those symptoms could reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical and other evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">2. We find there is substantial evidence of record supporting the ALJ\u2019s determination that Truitt is not disabled within the meaning of the Act. <em>See Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir.1995). The medical evidence does not indicate that Truitt was unable to ambulate effectively due to her ankle injury or that she had the requisite number of depressive symptoms or marked functional limitations as required to establish a listed or equivalent joint dysfunction or mental health impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The medical records indicate that Truitt sought very little treatment for her ankle after the fracture healed and stabilizing hardware was removed. Although subsequent x-ray and physician examinations reflect some deformity of her ankle resulting in some pain and limitation, the medical evidence does not indicate that Truitt\u2019s ankle pain was so debilitating that she could not perform any work.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Truitt\u2019s mental health records reveal that, although she was diagnosed with certain mental impairments, her symptoms were controlled, stable, and generally mild. These treatment records also indicate that Truitt was \u201csomewhat dramatic,\u201d was not consistently compliant with her medication, and, in the opinion of one examiner, exaggerated her psychological symptoms and problems in an attempt to create the impression of severe psychopathology.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Finally, testimony from a vocational expert provides substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision that Truitt was able to perform her past relevant work as an electronics assembler, given the specific limitations of her residual functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
