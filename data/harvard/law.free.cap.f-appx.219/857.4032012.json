(R. 1-16.) The district court granted summary judgment to Tatum and Meadows but denied Oderinde and Kalu (collectively, \u201cthe Doctors\u201d) summary judgment as to the Eighth Amendment claims against them. The Doctors bring this interlocutory appeal arguing that the district court erred in denying them qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-22\">After a thorough review of the parties\u2019 responses to this court\u2019s jurisdictional question and the record on appeal, we find that we have jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal. Considering the merits of the appeal, \u201c[w]e accept as true all facts the district court assumed when it denied summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.\u201d <em>See Badia v. City of Miami, </em>133 F.3d 1443, 1445 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted). The district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge, saying, \u201c[T]he Court agrees with the United States Magistrate Judge that a jury could find that the Defendant doctors failed to even try to diagnose Plaintiffs condition over a period of <em>more than two years, </em>relying instead on diagnoses that the treating doctors should have realized to be obviously incorrect. A jury then could find that taking such an avenue represents \u2018easier but less efficacious treatment\u2019 in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d (R. 2-73 at 1-2.) As stated by the magistrate judge, \u201c[i]t is clearly established that a delay in treating an inmate\u2019s pain can render defendants liable as if they had inflicted the pain themselves, thereby becoming an Eighth Amendment viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>tion.\u201d (R. 2-71 at 5.) (citing <em>Brown v. Hughes, </em>894 F.2d 1533, 1538 (11th Cir. 1990)); <em>see also McElligott v. Foley, </em>182 F.3d 1248 (11th Cir.1999). Therefore, qualified immunity does not entitle the Doctors to judgment at this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
