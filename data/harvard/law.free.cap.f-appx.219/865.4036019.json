We issued a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) limited to whether Ellis\u2019s petition was timely filed within the one-year limitations period of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Ellis argues on appeal that his habeas petition was timely because he filed state post conviction petitions under Rule 32 in Alabama that tolled the deadline for a \u00a7 2254 petition. Ellis claims that he attached his <em>in forma pauperis </em>application to his second Rule 32 petition, and submitted both to prison authorities on July 26, 2002, early enough to make the instant petition timely. Ellis argues that the district court improperly relied on the date on a substantial hardship affidavit, August 12, 2002, which he delivered to prison authorities after delivering his Rule 32 petition on July 26, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, but review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Delaney v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>246 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir.2001). This standard requires us to affirm a district court\u2019s findings of fact unless \u201cthe record lacks substantial evidence\u201d to support that determination. <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t. of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). Further, under clear error review, where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact finder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. <em>Johansen v. Combustion Eng\u2019g, </em>170 F.3d 1320, 1335 n. 30 (11th Cir.1999). Lastly, clear error is \u201ca very high standard, and one we would rarely be likely to find.\u201d <em>Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1290 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">The AEDPA imposes a one-year statute of limitations on all habeas corpus peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>tions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The limitations period begins to run on the date that the petitioner\u2019s conviction became final. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). A state prisoner\u2019s conviction becomes final when the United States Supreme Court denies <em>cer-tiorari </em>or when the 90-day period in which to file a <em>certiorari </em>petition expires, regardless of whether the defendant raised any federal issues in his direct appeal. <em>See Nix v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>393 F.3d 1235, 1236-37 (11th Cir.2004). However, the federal habeas statute tolls the limitations period for \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">A <em>pro se </em>prisoner\u2019s collateral action is deemed filed in federal court on the date it is delivered to prison authorities for mailing. <em>Adams v. United States, </em>173 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.1999). Under this \u201cmailbox rule,\u201d the burden is on prison authorities to prove the date a prisoner delivered his documents to be mailed. <em>Washington v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1299, 1301 (11th Cir.2001). Absent state-presented evidence to the contrary, such as a prison mail log, we will presume that the petition was delivered to prison authorities on the date the petitioner signed it. <em>Id. </em>Alabama appellate courts have applied the \u201cmailbox rule\u201d to the filing of state post-conviction petitions. <em>Holland v. State, </em>621 So.2d 373, 375 (Ala.Crim.App. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The district court did not clearly err in determining that Ellis delivered his second Rule 32 petition to prison authorities on August 12, 2002. Ellis only challenges the district court\u2019s determination of the filing date of his second Rule 32 petition. Ellis\u2019s second Rule 32 petition stated that it was given to prison authorities on July 26, 2002. The petition was notarized on July 23, 2002. Ellis\u2019s <em>informa pauper-is </em>declaration was dated July 22, 2002. Ellis attached an affidavit of substantial hardship to the <em>informa pauperis </em>declaration dated August 12, 2002. The Circuit Court of Alabama received all of these documents on August 14, 2002. The state presented the district court with Ellis\u2019s substantial hardship affidavit, dated August 12, 2002. The magistrate relied on this document and the fact that the Circuit Court received all documents related to Ellis\u2019s second Rule 32 petition on August 14, 2002, to conclude that August 12, 2002, was the date Ellis delivered the petition to prison authorities. The substantial hardship affidavit qualifies as substantial evidence that Ellis delivered his second Rule 32 petition to prison authorities on August 12, 2002. Further, Ellis admitted in two pleadings to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals that he filed his second Rule 32 petition on August 15, 2002. The magistrate\u2019s choice of the August 12, 2002, date over the petition\u2019s stated delivery date of July 26, 2002, was not clearly erroneous, and the district court did not err in adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that Ellis\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was time-barred. Ellis\u2019s conviction became final on November 16, 2000, because he did not petition the Supreme Court for <em>certiorari </em>within 90 days of his state conviction becoming final on August 18, 2000. Two hundred eight days elapsed before he filed his first Rule 32 petition on June 13, 2001, which tolled the limitations period until the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals denied his appeal and entered final judgment on May 7, 2002. The limitations period ran another 96 days from May 8, 2002, until Ellis filed his second Rule 32 petition on August 12, 2002. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals denied this second petition and entered final judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>ment on November 7, 2003. As of November 8, 2003, Ellis had 61 days to file a \u00a7 2254 petition before the limitations period expired on January 7, 2004. Ellis did not file his \u00a7 2254 petition until January 19, 2004, twelve days past the expiration of the limitations period. Therefore, Ellis\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely and the district court did not err. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
