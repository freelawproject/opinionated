Shepherd was first sentenced, in October 2004, to 210 months in prison under the then-mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines, and he appealed. After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we remanded Shepherd\u2019s sentence to the District Court for reconsideration in light of that ease. On resentencing, the District Court again sentenced Shepherd to a 210-month term, and he again appeals \u2014 this time contesting the reasonableness of his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-21\">Shepherd makes two arguments as to why his sentence is unreasonable. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>he claims that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that between 50 and 100 kilograms of cocaine were properly attributable to him is not supported with evidence bearing \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, he asserts that the District Court, when determining his sentence, did not adequately consider the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329-32 (3d Cir.2006). We reject both arguments, setting out only those facts necessary to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u201cGiven the dramatic effect ... estimates [of drug weight] have on the defendant\u2019s sentence, the sentencing court must carefully review the [Government's submissions to ensure that its estimates are proven by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Collado, </em>975 F.2d 985, 998 (3d Cir.1992). And though \u201c[w]e recognize that in calculating the amounts involved in drug transactions, some degree of estimation must be permitted,\u201d such calculations may not be \u201cbased on mere speculation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]his standard should be applied rigorously.\u201d <em>United States v. Miele, </em>989 F.2d 659, 664 (3d Cir.1993). This remains true even though the Guidelines are now only advisory, as they are still \u201cthe \u2018strong force\u2019 that defines the starting point for all that follows[,] ... necessarily [affecting] \u2014 and often defining] \u2014 the ending point.\u201d <em>Grier, </em>475 F.3d at 608 (McKee, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">In this case, however, the District Court\u2019s finding that Shepherd was responsible for 50-100 kilograms of cocaine was based on testimony and information received from no fewer than twelve people who were intimately involved in this cocaine distribution conspiracy, were customers of Shepherd, or had observed various aspects of the operation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is true, as Shepherd argues, that one of these persons \u2014 Roy Mercer, the conspiracy\u2019s kingpin \u2014 may be of questionable credibility, given that his testimony vacillated on how much cocaine Shepherd handled. The District Court, however, did not adopt Mercer\u2019s highest estimations, which ranged from 100 to 150 kilograms. Moreover\u2014 and unlike the facts in <em>Miele, </em>cited by Shepherd for support \u2014 Mercer was not the only source relied on in calculating the relevant amount of cocaine. <em>See </em>989 F.2d at 665. Given the number of witnesses who testified about multiple trips to Shepherd\u2019s supplier (each involving 10-17 kilograms) or about the kilogram-size cocaine supply seen when buying cocaine from him, as well as the amount of restitution ordered by the jury ($1.28 million) \u2014 which can only correspond to a substantial quantity of <em>drugs </em>\u2014 we have little trouble concluding that the District Court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Our reasonableness review pursuant to <em>Booker </em>requires that the record \u201cdemonstrate [that] the trial court gave meaningful consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>also United States v. Jackson, </em>467 F.3d 834, 840-42 (3d Cir.2006). Shepherd contends that the District Court here failed to do so. This argument, however, is unpersuasive. Contrary to Shepherd\u2019s protestations, the District Court \u2014 on four pages of record transcript \u2014 painstakingly went through the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, commenting on each and how it informed the Court\u2019s decision. In addition, though the Court imposed a within-Guideline sentence, nothing in the record indicates that it treated the Guidelines as mandatory or accorded them undue weight. <em>See United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 248-49 (ruling it error so to proceed). Given the record here, we do not believe that Shepherd\u2019s 210-month sentence is unreasonable. \u00edj\u00ed ^ ^ ^ ^</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the sentence imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-11\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1). <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 561 (3d Cir.2007) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">. In finding the facts underlying the calculation of the Guidelines base offense level, a district court must use the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. <em>Grier, </em>475 F.3d at 561-66. We review those findings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 568-70.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\">. Because the District Court did not specifically comment on which evidence led to its findings on this issue, but did adopt the Pre-sentence Investigation Report and sentenced accordingly, we examine the analysis of the evidence set forth therein. <em>See Miele, </em>989 F.2d at 663.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b188-13\">.
