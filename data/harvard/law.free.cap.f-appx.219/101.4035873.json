We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review. Santiago\u2019s initial appeal argued [i] that the district court improperly applied a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in connection with a drug conspiracy pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and [ii] that the district court\u2019s three-level upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.6 was unwarranted. In <em>United States v. Santiago (Santiago I), </em>384 F.3d 31 (2d Cir.2004), we rejected Santiago\u2019s first argument, and affirmed the district court\u2019s application of the two-level enhancement; but we did not reach Santiago\u2019s challenge to the upward departure. On the parties\u2019 consent, we remanded to the district court \u201cfor the very limited purpose of amending the written judgment and conviction order to set forth in writing its reasons for granting the section 5K2.6 upward departure.\u201d 384 F.3d at 37. We retained jurisdiction pursuant to <em>United States v. Jacobson, </em>15 F.3d 19 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The district court issued its amended judgment on December 13, 2004, and subsequently reconsidered and affirmed Santiago\u2019s sentence (on June 8, 2006) under the procedures set forth in <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005). We reinstated jurisdiction over the appeal on October 5, 2006. Santiago raises three challenges to the district court\u2019s \u00a7 5K2.6 upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">First, Santiago argues that there was an insufficient relationship between his use of the firearm and his drug conviction. This argument is foreclosed by our determination in <em>Santiago I </em>(in connection with the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement) that Santiago\u2019s use of a firearm was \u201cin the course of and in connection with his participation in the narcotics conspiracy.\u201d 384 F.3d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Second, Santiago argues that the \u00a7 5K2.6 \u201cuse\u201d departure double-counts the use of a firearm when imposed in addition to the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) \u201cpossession\u201d enhancement. But the application of separate \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cpossession\u201d guidelines is appropriate where, as here, the defendant both possessed <em>and </em>fired a gun; each guideline targets a separate aspect of Santiago\u2019s conduct. <em>See United States v. Franklyn, </em>157 F.3d 90, 98-99 (2d Cir.1998) (approving of both [i] enhancement for <em>possession </em>of a firearm under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6) and [ii] departure for <em>firing </em>the firearm under \u00a7 5K2.6); <em>see also id. </em>at 99 n. 7 (rejecting \u201cdouble-counting\u201d argument by noting that possession is distinct from firing and observing that \u201c[a]ny person hit by a bullet would immediately appreciate the distinction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Third, relying on <em>United States v. Kim, </em>896 F.2d 678 (2d Cir.1990), Santiago argues that the three-level extent of the departure was excessive. We review the extent of a departure for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Fuller, </em>426 F.3d 556, 562 (2d Cir.2005). <em>Kim </em>stated that prior to imposing an upward departure, a district court should \u201cconsider the next higher levels in sequence to determine if they adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d 896 F.2d at 685. But \u201cto the extent <em>Kim ... </em>can be interpreted to require such explicit consideration, this Court has retreated from such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>mechanistic view. Instead, we have indicated that District Courts must only \u2018make clear on the record how the court determined the magnitude of the departure\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mora, </em>22 F.3d 409, 413 (2d Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>967 F.2d 20, 27 (2d Cir.1992)). Here, the district court imposed a three-level departure based on the following factors: [a] \u201cthe firearm was discharged twice,\u201d [b] \u201cthere was injury and there was potential for even more serious injury because ... the gun was held at Mr. Arroyo\u2019s head,\u201d and [c] Santiago was \u201cwilling to consider killing Mr. Arroyo.\u201d The district court also considered certain mitigating factors \u2014 Santiago\u2019s desire to protect his family and other evidence that \u201csp[oke] in a positive way about his character.\u201d The district court elucidated these appropriate bases for the three-level departure; the extent of the departure was therefore not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
