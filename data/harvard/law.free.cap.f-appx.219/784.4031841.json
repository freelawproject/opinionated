R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Based on his association with the Oliva drug group,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> John Spencer Hurt was convicted by a jury of managing a building for purpose of drug storage or distribution in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2) and was sentenced to seventy-seven months imprisonment. He appealed his conviction and sentence. We affirmed his conviction but remanded the case \u201cfor re-sentencing consistent with <em>United States v. Booker </em>[, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ].\u201d <em>United States v. Hurt, </em>137 Fed. Appx. 192, 197 (10th Cir.2005) (unpublished) <em>(Hurt I). </em>On remand, the district court imposed a fifty-seven month sentence after consulting the guidelines as advisory only.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hurt again appeals. We exercise jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court applied <em>Blakely v. </em>Washington<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the federal sentencing guidelines and held the Sixth Amendment required that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. The seeming remedy to this problem would have been to invalidate judicial fact-finding. <em>See United States v. Montgomery, </em>439 F.3d 1260, 1262 (10th Cir.2006). \u201cDespite the straightforward appeal of this approach, however, the Supreme Court did not adopt it in <em>Booker.\u201d Id. </em>Rather, \u201cthe Supreme Court ... imposed a global remedy for the Sixth Amendment difficulties with the Sentencing Guidelines, invalidating their mandatory application and instead requiring district courts to consult them in an advisory fashion.\u201d <em>United States v. Labastida-Segura, </em>396 F.3d 1140, 1142 (10th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738). Thus, \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Booker </em>\u201d does not prohibit \u201cthe district court from making the same factual findings and applying the same enhancements and adjustments to [the defendant\u2019s] sentence\u201d that it could before <em>Booker, </em>\u201cas long as it [does] not apply the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion.\u201d <em>United States v.

If \u201cthe district court errs in applying the Guidelines\u201d post-Soo/cer, \u201cwe must remand-without reaching the question of reasonableness-unless the error is harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Kristi, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1054-55 (10th Cir.2006). We still review legal questions de novo, factual findings for clear error, and give due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts. <em>United States v. Wolfe, </em>435 F.3d 1289, 1295 (10th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">At the outset, we note it is not entirely clear what the district court did at Hurt\u2019s re-sentencing. At his initial sentencing, the district court determined the offense level to be 26. The guideline for a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2) is located in USSG \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(l). Section 2D1.8(a)(l) directs the district court to employ the applicable offense level from USSG \u00a7 2D1.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 2Dl.l(c)(7) provides an offense level of 26 for offenses involving at least fifty grams but less than 200 grams of methamphetamine. This level was predicated on a finding by the district court that Hurt\u2019s offense involved 113 grams of methamphetamine. Coupled with a criminal history category of II, the sentencing range was seventy to eighty-seven months imprisonment. The district court initially sentenced Hurt to seventy-seven months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">At re-sentencing, the district court recounted the basis for the drug finding in the initial proceeding. The district court later stated that at recess it had asked the probation officer \u201cto review the findings that were made at the [original] sentencing proceedings, noting that I agreed with the findings that were suggested by the probation officer and recommended under 2D1.8(a)(l) as to drug quantity, but further noted that the entire conspiracy of the Olivas group was clearly in the area of five kilograms.\u201d (R. Vol. Ill at 22.) The district court, however, read <em>Hurt I </em>as instructing \u201cthat in the absence of a jury finding of a specific amount of methamphetamine,\u201d the court could not sentence under \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(l), but rather was \u201cleft with sentencing this defendant under [\u00a7 ]2D1.8(a)(2) and that the capped guideline level in that case would be level 26.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 25.) Section 2D1.8(a)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"apv-dedup-0\">If the defendant had no participation in the underlying controlled substance offense other than allowing use of the premises, the offense level shall be 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>levels less than the offense level from \u00a7 2D1.1 applicable to the underlying controlled substance offense, but not greater than level 26.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">After further considering the facts of the case, the district court found that a \u201creasonable sentence ... would be in the area of level 24, ... Criminal History II, which places him in a category of a guideline range of 57 to 71 months. I will sentence this defendant at the low end of that guideline, that is, 57 months.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at 26-27).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">After the district court pronounced the sentence, the government asked the district court: \u201cIs your reduction to level 24 to reflect a specific finding of relevant conduct, a lower finding of relevant conduct? Is the Court making a finding of relevant conduct for this sentencing?\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at 28.) The district court replied: \u201cNo. I\u2019m just attempting to achieve a reasonable sentence under the statute.... And if you mean by relevant conduct a drug quantity[,][n]o, I\u2019m not. The guideline I\u2019m using is level \u2014 if there was a guideline, it\u2019s level 26. And I find that under either [\u00a7 2D1.8](a)(l) or (a)(2), but I am imposing the sentence under (a)(2) given the defendant\u2019s conduct.... And then I\u2019m, in an effort to achieve a reasonable sentence in</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">this case, sentencing him with reference to the guidelines to two offense levels lower.... \u201d(M at 28-29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">Relying on language in <em>Hurt I, </em>Hurt first argues the district court erred by engaging in judicial fact-finding as to the amount of drugs involved in the case. Hurt\u2019s argument is misplaced. In <em>Hurt I, </em>we read <em>Booker </em>to hold judicial fact-finding <em>under a mandatory application of the guidelines </em>violated a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As our subsequent case law makes clear, judicial fact-finding under an advisory guideline system is perfectly permissible so long as supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Hall, </em>473 F.3d 1295, 1312 (10th Cir.2007); <em>Magallanez, </em>408 F.3d at 685. Hurt does not challenge the evidentiary basis for the initial finding of drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">The parties also argue about whether the district court correctly applied USSG \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2). The sentencing transcript is less than clear on the district court\u2019s methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">Hurt argues the district court misapplied \u00a7 2D1.1. Hurt contends, under \u00a7 2D1.1, his offense level would have been 26 if based upon the finding of 113 grams <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>of methamphetamine used at the initial sentencing. Applying \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2) to an offense level of 26, Hurt\u2019s offense level should have been reduced by four levels to level 22, rather than only a two level reduction to 24, subject to any final adjustments made by the district court in its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The government, however, argues Hurt misreads the district court\u2019s explanation of its actions at re-sentencing. According to the government, the district court found Hurt responsible for a larger amount of drugs at re-sentencing based on its statement at re-sentencing that \u201cthe entire conspiracy of the Olivas group was clearly in the area of five kilograms.\u201d (R. Vol. III at 22.) Under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) or (8), Hurt\u2019s offense level would have been either 34 or 36, depending on the precise amount of the drugs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Applying the four level reduction under \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2), Hurt\u2019s adjusted offense level would be either 30 or 32, in which case the level 26 cap imposed by \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2) would operate. The government argues the district court thus found a capped offense level of 26 then, in its discretion, decided to depart downward from the guideline range to a level 24 in order to achieve a reasonable sentence. In support, the government relies on the district court\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he guideline I\u2019m using is level \u2014 if there was a guideline, it\u2019s level 26. And I find that under either [\u00a7 2D1.8](a)(l) or (a)(2), but I am imposing the sentence under (a)(2) given the defendant\u2019s conduct.... <em>And then I\u2019m, in an effort to achieve a reasonable sentence in this case, sentencing him with reference to the guidelines to two offense levels lower. </em>...\u201d (R. Vol. III at 28-29 (emphasis added).) Thus, under the government\u2019s reading of the re-sentencing proceedings, the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2), but merely granted a discretionary downward adjustment after correctly calculating the applicable guideline range.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">We do not need to determine the exact character of the district court\u2019s action here because any misapplication of \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2) was harmless. <em>Kristi, </em>437 F.3d at 1054-55 (\u201c[WJhen the district court errs in applying the Guidelines^] ... we must remand \u2014 without reaching the question of reasonableness \u2014 unless the error is harmless.\u201d). Any error is harmless because, by reading our opinion in <em>Hurt I </em>to forbid it from applying \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(l) in the absence of a jury finding on the amount of methamphetamine, the district court misread our first opinion. As we have explained, the district court could have re-sentenced Hurt under \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(l) and reimposed the same seventy-seven month sentence on remand, so long as it treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>the guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory and made its findings of fact by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In doing so, the district court could have relied on its prior fact finding (which was not contested as to accuracy)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to again apply a base offense level of 26 based on 113 grams of methamphetamine under \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(l). Thus any error in the district court\u2019s reading of our opinion in <em>Hurt I </em>was to Hurt\u2019s potential benefit, and so was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Hurt has filed a Motion to Supplement Briefing calling to our attention <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007).
