June 13, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A76 505 810 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 23, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-25\">Where, as here, the BIA issues a brief decision dismissing the alien\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the reasoning of both the IJ and BIA. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>Yu Yin Yang v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>84, 85 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), this Court \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d Zheng did not appeal the IJ\u2019s denial of his withholding of removal or CAT claims in his brief to the BIA, as the statute requires, and those claims are therefore dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119\u2014 20 &amp; n. 3 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">With regard to his asylum claim, the only issue Zheng raised in his one-page brief to the BIA was whether the IJ \u201cimproperly weighed the evidence and testimony adduced at trial,\u201d but he failed to state the relevant law or identify any error in the IJ\u2019s analysis. His failure to make any meaningful argument to the BIA in support of his asylum claim bars our own consideration of that claim. <em>See id. </em>at 119 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Moreover, even assuming, hypothetically, that we could address the challenges that Zheng now raises to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, we would deny those challenges on the merits. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 338 n. 2 (2d Cir.2006). The IJ appropriately based her decision on material testimonial inconsistencies, Zheng\u2019s evasive demeanor, and his failure to lay a foundation for the documents he submitted or adequately explain the absence of more probative corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
