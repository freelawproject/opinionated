As the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we do not separately recount them here. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-24\">Thomas argues that the district court incorrectly sentenced him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Specifically, Thomas asserts that the district court erred in (1) refusing to treat his two prior robbery convictions as related under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 and (2) classifying one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>his prior robbery convictions as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s determination that a defendant qualifies as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>422 F.3d 889, 891-92 (9th Cir.2005). However, we review \u201cwith due deference a district court\u2019s determination that two crimes were not related or consolidated for sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Asberry, </em>394 F.3d 712, 718 n. 8 (9th Cir.2005). We also review de novo a district court\u2019s determination that a prior conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4Bl.l(a) and 4B1.2. <em>Id. </em>at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Under Comment Note 3 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, prior sentences are \u201crelated\u201d for sentencing purposes if they \u201cwere consolidated for trial or sentencing.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n. 3. In order to determine whether prior convictions were \u201cconsolidated for trial or sentencing,\u201d the district court must consider \u201cwhether sentencing occurred 1) on the same day, 2) in the same court, 3) for the same or similar offenses, 4) pursuant to a single plea agreement, 5) under the same docket number, 6) after a formal consolidation order, and 7) under circumstances that resulted in concurrent sentences.\u201d <em>Asberry, </em>394 F.3d at 719. The district court properly applied these factors to Thomas\u2019s two pri- or robbery convictions. Although Thomas was sentenced on the same day before the same court for two robberies committed one month apart, there was no evidence that this was pursuant to a plea agreement, each robbery was given a separate docket number, there was no formal consolidation order, and Thomas received different sentences for each conviction. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying the <em>Asberry </em>factors to find that Thomas\u2019s prior convictions were not \u201crelated.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">Thomas contends that our decisions in <em>United States v. Chapnick, </em>963 F.2d 224 (9th Cir.1992) and <em>United States v. Bachiero, </em>969 F.2d 733 (9th Cir.1992), require us to find that his prior convictions were consolidated for sentencing. We reach a different conclusion. Thomas, unlike the defendants in <em>Chapnick </em>and <em>Bachiero, </em>did not receive identical sentences for his two prior robbery convictions. Because the two robberies were committed one month apart and Thomas did not receive identical sentences for both convictions, we conclude that the district court did not err in concluding that these two offenses were not consolidated for sentencing within the meaning of Comment Note 3 of the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 and therefore were unrelated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">Thomas also argues that one of his prior robbery convictions should not have been considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because the state court expressly stated that it \u201cwas not a violent felony pursuant to 667.5(c) [California] P[enal] C[ode].\u201d The state court\u2019s finding has no impact on the district court\u2019s determination that his rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>bery conviction qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d We have concluded that robbery, under California law, is by definition a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and meets the requirements of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See United States v. McDougherty, </em>920 F.2d 569, 573-74 (9th Cir.1990). Thus, the district court properly determined that Thomas\u2019s prior robbery conviction was a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Thomas was properly sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">We do not have jurisdiction to consider Thomas\u2019s claim that the 96-month term imposed on him was unreasonable. As part of his plea agreement, Thomas reserved the right to appeal the district court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history score, but expressly waived the right to appeal all other aspects of his sentence. We reject Thomas\u2019s claim that his waiver is unenforceable because the district court informed him of his right to appeal. Our decision in <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d 914 (9th Cir.1995) is readily distinguishable from this case. In <em>Buchanan, </em>we held that the defendant\u2019s plea agreement waiver of his right to appeal his sentence was unenforceable because the prosecution failed to object when the district court incorrectly advised the defendant that he had the right to appeal. <em>Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d at 917-18. Here, when the district court erroneously advised Thomas that he had the right to appeal his sentence, the government objected and directed the district court\u2019s attention to Thomas\u2019s plea agreement waiver. The district court then made it clear that Thomas\u2019s right to appeal was limited to the issue of the district court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history score. Given the government\u2019s objection and the district court\u2019s clarifying statements, the reasoning applied in <em>Buchanan </em>is not applicable and there is no reasonable basis for Thomas to be confused about his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">In conclusion, because Thomas\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal his sentence is enforceable, the panel must dismiss Thomas\u2019s claim that his 96-month sentence was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Mich-lin, </em>34 F.3d 896, 898 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">For all of the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.

United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 64-66, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
