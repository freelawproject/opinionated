Koresko, et al. (\u201cKoresko\u201d), appeals the denial of a motion for reconsideration of an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to STEP Plan Services, Inc. (\u201cSTEP\u201d) for the expenses STEP incurred in remanding a case to state court. We now affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">District courts may award \u201cjust costs and any actual expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees\u201d incurred as a result of a defective removal to federal court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). Koresko failed to obtain the unanimous consent of all defendants before seeking to remove the case to federal court. Therefore, his removal was procedurally defective. <em>See Lewis v. Rego, </em>757 F.2d 66, 68 (3d Cir.1985) (\u201c[W]hen there is more than one defendant, all must join in the removal petition.\u201d) Moreover, STEP\u2019S complaint alleged state law causes of action exclusively; ERISA was inapplicable. <em>See Mints v. Educational Testing Service, </em>99 F.3d 1253 (3d Cir.1996). The district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding STEP attorney\u2019s fees and costs as a result of Koresko\u2019s improper removal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. 1447(c); <em>Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., </em>546 U.S. 132, 126 S.Ct. 704, 711, 163 L.Ed.2d 547 (2005) (\u201ccourts may award attorney\u2019s fees under 1447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">No violation of Koresko\u2019s due process rights occurred. The district court considered a detailed breakdown of hours and costs, as well as a form charting reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Koresko had an opportunity to respond in both its Opposition to Plaintiffs Request for Fees and in its Sur-Reply to Plaintiffs Request for Fees. <em>See Federal Communications Comm\u2019n v. WJR, </em>337 U.S. 265, 276, 69 S.Ct. 1097, 93 L.Ed. 1353 (1949). (Due process does not require oral argument, and written submissions may be sufficient.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
