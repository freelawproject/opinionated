Specifically, Rivera argues that her previous counsel failed to file proper and timely motions, and he \u201cmisled\u201d her until she later confronted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gba-ya v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). One way to show an abuse of discretion is to highlight the application of an incorrect or improper legal standard. <em>See In re Ford, Motor Co., </em>471 F.3d 1233, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">\u201cMotions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Abd% </em>430 F.3d at 1149 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). An alien may file one motion to reopen, and that motion \u201c \u2018shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(A), (B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B)). \u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (quoted in <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1149).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-15\">\u201cA motion to reopen immigration proceedings \u2018must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abdi </em>430 F.3d at 1149 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2)). \u201c[T]he statutory 90-day period for filing a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional, and, therefore, it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1150. This is true, even though counsel\u2019s deficient performance may have caused the appeal to be untimely filed. <em>Id. </em>at 1148-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-16\">In <em>Abdi, </em>an attorney appealed the BIA\u2019s order denying a petitioner\u2019s claims for relief, but failed to file a timely supporting brief, and so the BIA dismissed the appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1149. Over one year later, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>petitioner, represented by different counsel, filed a motion to reopen on the ground that the first attorney was ineffective for failing to file the required supporting brief. <em>Id. </em>The BIA denied the motion to reopen, and we affirmed on appeal because the motion was not timely filed. <em>Id. </em>at 1149-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">\u201cUnder the well-established prior panel precedent rule of this Circuit, the holding of the first panel to address an issue is the law of this Circuit, thereby binding all subsequent panels unless and until the first panel\u2019s holding is overruled by the Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1300 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Given our controlling precedent in <em>Abdi, </em>we conclude that the BIA here did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen as untimely. Rivera did not file her motion to reopen until May 12, 2006, indisputably more than ninety days after the BIA denied her motion for reconsideration on December 6, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-10\">. We refer to the petitioners as \"Rivera,\u201d because she is the lead petitioner in this case, and Mejia-Vela was only included in the original asylum proceeding as a derivative applicant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
