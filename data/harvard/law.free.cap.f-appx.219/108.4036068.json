At trial, it was established that immediately following a robbery at the Chase Bank at 225 Park Avenue South in Manhattan, Stevens was apprehended outside the Union Square subway station carrying a sack of money equal to the amount taken from the bank. His fingerprints matched those on the note passed to the teller, which read \u201cI have A Bomb in the Bag. All the money.\u201d Following additional investigation, Stevens was linked to three prior bank robberies through, <em>inter alia, </em>witness identification and fingerprint evidence. In each robbery, the perpetrator threatened the teller by claiming to have a bomb in a bag. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to conduct a hearing pursuant to <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), on the reliability of fingerprint evidence. Such a hearing is not required \u201cin ordinary cases where the reliability of an expert\u2019s methods is properly taken for granted.\u201d <em>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). Stevens points to no evidence that would compel the conclusion that the testimony of a fingerprint expert is a \u201cless usual or more complex case[ ] where cause for questioning the expert\u2019s reliability arises.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Salameh, </em>152 F.3d 88, 128-29 (2d Cir.1998) (approving of admission of fingerprint evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Nor was it error for the district court to sentence Stevens on the basis of his prior convictions, despite the fact that the convictions were not alleged in the indictment or found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Stevens invites us to ignore (or tacitly overrule) the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); we lack the power to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
