Chew denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Hou Shen Zhang, </em>No. A78 840 630 (B.I.A. July 2, 2004), <em>aff'g </em>No. A78 840 630 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 11, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Where, as here, the BIA issues a brief decision adopting and affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding in this case. The IJ reasonably classified Zhang\u2019s claim as one of well-founded fear of future persecution only, when Zhang never indicated that he was arrested, detained, or otherwise targeted by the authorities when he was in China. Moreover, the IJ reasonably found that Zhang failed to establish a well-founded fear, having found his underlying claim that he was a practicing Christian, in both China and the United States, not credible. This conclusion was appropriately based on (1) the discrepancy between Zhang\u2019s statement at his airport interview that he became a Christian in 1988, and his subsequent statements that he became a Christian in 1998; (2) his admission that he had deliberately provided the 1988 date in his initial asylum application, despite knowing it was incorrect, for purposes of consistency; (3) a strong correlation between the date he filed his asylum application and the date he began attending church services; and (4) his apparent inability to name the pastors at his church. Considering these factors cumulatively, a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to conclude, contrary to the IJ, that Zhang was a practicing Christian, or demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution on that basis. <em>See id. </em>at 73-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">Substantial evidence likewise supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding and CAT relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the extent those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>claims were based on Zhang\u2019s assertion that he was a Christian, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding in the asylum context necessarily precluded success on those claims. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 155-56 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005). To the extent Zhang alleged he would be subjected to future persecution or torture because of his illegal departure from China, the agency reasonably rejected that claim when he failed to demonstrate that someone in his \u201cparticular alleged circumstances\u201d was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to face such consequences. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2005). As Zhang has not asserted any other basis on which he might be persecuted or tortured, his withholding and CAT claims were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motions for a stay of removal and for an extension of time in this petition are DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-11\">. We have jurisdiction to address these claims, notwithstanding Zhang's failure to ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>gue them meaningfully in his brief to the BIA as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), <em>see Ka-raj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119-20 (2d Cir.2006), because the BIA chose to address those claims, thereby mooting any exhaustion concerns. <em>See Xian Tuan Ye v. DHS, </em>446 F.3d 289, 296-97 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
