Section 2255 bars any petition filed, on behalf of a federal prisoner more than one year after the final judgment of conviction, but it does not define when a judgment becomes final. Following decisions of this Court and other circuits, we hold that the conviction becomes final, and the one-year period begins to run, upon expiration of the time for seeking certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, even where, as here, the appellant has not actually filed such a petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-23\">Gamble\u2019s direct appeal to this court of his conviction for crack cocaine possession was dismissed on September 10, 1996, for failure to pay the docketing fee or to seek <em>in forma pauperis </em>status. His <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion was filed in the district court on December 4, 1997. The district court dismissed the petition, rejecting Gamble\u2019s argument that his conviction was not \u201cfinal\u201d for AEDPA limitations purposes until the time for filing a petition for certiorari expired. Gamble has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-24\">The district court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2255 finds support in a Seventh Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court, however, recently distanced itself from the reasoning of that circuit, holding that when a federal criminal defendant files a timely certiorari petition on direct appeal, and the Supreme Court denies the petition, the federal judgment of conviction becomes \u201cfinal\u201d under \u00a7 2255 on the date of the Supreme Court\u2019s denial. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>203 F.3d 350, 354-55 (5th Cir.2000). <em>Thomas </em>carefully avoids the precise issue in this case\u2014 the \u201cfinality\u201d date of a conviction when no petition for certiorari has been filed \u2014 but its disagreement with <em>Gendron </em>is unmistakable. <em>Thomas </em>also cites approvingly decisions of the Third and Tenth Circuits that \u201ca conviction becomes final when a defendant\u2019s options for further direct review are foreclosed,\u201d whether or not those options have been pursued. <em>Id. </em>at 352; <em>see, e.g., Kapral v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 565, 571 (3d Cir.1999); <em>Rhine v. Boone, </em>182 F.3d 1153, 1155 (10th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 120 S.Ct. 808, 145 L.Ed.2d 681 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Fidelity to the reasoning of <em>Thomas </em>and to the developing majority rule compel us to conclude that Gamble\u2019s petition was timely. It was filed within a year after the ninety-day period for seeking certiorari review of his conviction as finalized in this court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The judgment of dismissal is therefore REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for evaluation on the merits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-10\">. <em>See Gendron v. United States, </em>154 F.3d 672, 674 (7th <em>Cir.1998), cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 119 S.Ct. 1758, 143 L.Ed.2d 790 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-13\">. The United States contends that Gamble\u2019s time limit should have elapsed because he could not seek certiorari from a dismissal for want of prosecution by this court. Altema-tively, the government asserts that Gamble's petition fails on the merits. We have no jurisdiction to review the latter argument, <em>Sonnier v. Johnson, </em>161 F.3d 941, 945-46 (5lh Cir.1998), and we are unpersuaded by the former.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
