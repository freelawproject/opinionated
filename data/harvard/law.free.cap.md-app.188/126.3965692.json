As a result of the alleged assault, Courtney suffered a collapsed lung and three fractured ribs. Following a trial in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, appellant moved for judgment of acquittal; the circuit court reserved ruling and submitted the case to the jury. When the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the court declared a mistrial. Thereafter, appellant filed a post-trial \u201cMotion for Judgment of Acquittal\u201d and a \u201cSupplemental Motion to Dismiss on the Basis of Violation of Principles of Double Jeopardy and Due Process,\u201d which the circuit court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">Prior to his re-trial, appellant noted this appeal. He presents three issues for our review, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>I. Whether re-trial of appellant is barred by the principles of double jeopardy and due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">II. Whether the state failed to present a legally sufficient case and is barred from retrying the appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">III. Whether <em>State v. Sirbaugh, </em>[27 Md.App. 290, 339 A.2d 697 (1975),] if still of any precedential value, should be overruled or, in the alternative, is not constitutionally valid as applied to the instant case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The State has moved to dismiss the appeal, claiming it is premature because no final judgment has been entered. For the reasons that follow, we shall dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">On January 8, 2006, appellant was off-duty, working the night shift as a security officer at Popeye\u2019s Restaurant in Takoma Park. While Malarkey was at work, Sergeant Daniel Frishkorn issued a broadcast concerning a fleeing suspect, which Malarkey heard. The suspect was later identified as Courtney.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Officer Derrick Fields, Sr., a patrol officer for the Takoma Park Police, testified that at around 1:58 a.m. on January 8, 2006, \u201cCorporal Malarkey came over the radio that he saw the person we were looking for [earlier] and that he had him running behind the Red Top gas station.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Fields, appellant \u201cseemed kind of hyped, like it was, I don\u2019t know, like he had just caught a known terrorist or something.\u201d Fields proceeded to the scene, and exited his car with his \u201cgun drawn.\u201d He saw \u201cMr. Courtney standing in a frozen position because it was like he didn\u2019t have anywhere else to run.\u201d Fields explained that he handcuffed Courtney because \u201che may have ... done something heinous.... So that\u2019s why we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>cuff him, for his safety and my safety.\u201d Nevertheless, Fields indicated that he did not \u201cfeel threatened,\u201d nor was he in fear. He said: \u201cIt was just a person that, you know, was running and now we caught him.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Fields told Courtney \u201cto get down ... on the ground,\u201d and Courtney \u201cnever resisted. He just complied totally....\u201d Fields continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">... I had him lay down on his stomach and spread his arms out to the side.... I walked over to cuff him. I had one cuff on him and that\u2019s when Corporal Malarkey came from my left side, took me by surprise. And all I heard was this thud and Mr. Courtney was like, he had just been deflated, just a big gasp of air just came out of him. So he immediately started complaining that his back and side was hurting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">At that time, I stepped away. Corporal Malarkey had the right hand and then took his left hand and put it in the cuffs. When he cuffed him, he told him, mother fucker, you\u2019ll never run from me again. So he yanked him over onto his side, got him sitting on his butt and he lifted his arms up behind him so that Mr. Courtney could be standing on his feet. He never gave Mr. Courtney a chance to help assist him get himself up off the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">At that time, Courtney still wasn\u2019t fighting he was totally compliant. [Appellant] walked him over to the car and slammed him onto the car.... <footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>In describing Malarkey\u2019s conduct, Fields said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t gentle. Nothing about it was gentle.\u201d Fields denied that Malarkey appeared to be injured when Malarkey dropped his knee onto Courtney\u2019s back. Nor did he believe that Malarkey \u201ctripped on Mr. Courtney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">As Courtney had an open warrant for violation of parole, he was arrested. On the way to the police station, Courtney complained \u201cthat he was in pain\u201d and wanted \u201cmedical attention.\u201d Fields stated: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t injured prior to our contact because if he was, he wouldn\u2019t have been running like that. If his ribs had been broken, he wouldn\u2019t have been running like that. He wouldn\u2019t breathe that well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Officer Paula Gaskin testified that she heard Malarkey\u2019s call over the radio, indicating that he was chasing a man spotted earlier in the evening by Sergeant Frishkorn. According to Gaskin, when Malarkey approached the scene, Courtney \u201cwas already detained ... and the situation was already under control.... \u201d Malarkey was \u201creally excited and irate, [and] was cussing.\u201d Gaskin claimed that Malarkey \u201clifted his knee and came down with all his weight and hit Mr. Courtney in his back.\u201d Malarkey turned Courtney over and \u201cslightly kneed him again into like his stomach area.\u201d Then, appellant \u201cyanked [Courtney] up in-between the cuffs up off the ground, dragged him to the cruiser and slammed him into the trunk.\u201d According to Gaskin, \u201cMr. Courtney did not resist. He complied with everything Officer Fields told him to do. He was already face down on the ground. He was no threat.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Jerome Irwin, a corporal with the Takoma Park Police Department, responded to Sergeant Frishkorn\u2019s call about a man running from him. He also heard Malarkey\u2019s call on the radio, indicating that he spotted the man Frishkorn had been chasing. Irwin proceeded to the location identified by Malarkey. As he approached, he saw Officer Fields handcuffing Courtney. When Malarkey arrived, \u201c[h]e exited his car very fast.\u201d Irwin continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">[Malarkey] ran over to Officer Fields, and the guy was on the ground, and he paused for a second and dropped down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>on the guy with knees, with both knees. He completed the handcuffing process. Officer Fields kind of backed away at that point, and Officer Malarkey was pretty excited. He was cursing at the guy. He called him bitch, mother fucker.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVo\">Further, Irwin claimed that Malarkey lifted Courtney off the ground and \u201cslammed him up against the cruiser.\u201d Courtney was \u201cgrunting and groaning\u201d when Malarkey picked him up.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">On cross-examination, Irwin recalled that Officer Fields had Courtney \u201cprone on the ground\u201d and \u201cin a high risk position.\u201d When Malarkey \u201ccame on the scene,\u201d he (Malarkey) saw that Fields \u201chad engaged in a high risk cuffing procedure____\u201d Irwin agreed \u201cthat in that high risk situation, it was important to have Mr. Courtney cuffed and to cuff quiekly[.]\u201d Nevertheless, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t think this guy posed a threat at this particular time.\u201d He added: \u201c[I]f you have someone compliant, the risk is not as great as if someone is flailing arms or trying to resist you or refusing to be handcuffed. It\u2019s different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">On January 8, 2006, Iraj Almas was employed as a Takoma Park patrol officer. She recalled the radio transmission from Frishkorn about a man running from him. After Malarkey called, stating that he had spotted the man Frishkorn had described, she \u201cwent to back him up.\u201d At the scene, she saw Frishkorn, Gaskin, Fields, and Irwin; Courtney was on the ground. Almas stated: \u201cHe was on his knees crunched over and his hands were handcuffed behind his back, and Corporal Malarkey was standing next to him.... And Mr. Courtney was not resisting arrest.\u201d She continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">And then Corporal Malarkey grabbed Mr. Courtney by his handcuffs and snatched him up off the ground pulling his arms all the way up against the rotation of his shoulders. And then Corporal Malarkey walked him about six feet to the cruiser and slammed<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> him on the trunk of the cruiser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>face down first. Mr. Courtney was still complying, not resisting arrest. Mr. Courtney ... was hurt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Sergeant Frishkorn instructed Almas \u201cto take Mr. Courtney to the station for processing.\u201d While in the cruiser, Courtney complained of \u201creally bad chest pains.\u201d Accordingly, at the instruction of Officer Gaskin, Almas took Courtney to Washington Adventist Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The parties stipulated as follows: On January 8, 2006, Courtney was admitted to Washington Adventist Hospital (the \u201cHospital\u201d) \u201cwith complaints of wheezing, chest and back pain, coughing sputum and trouble breathing. He reported the police injured him.\u201d Dr. Frank Shin, a radiologist at the Hospital, reviewed Courtney\u2019s x-rays, diagnosed a \u201cpunctured lung cavity with air between the lung and chest wall,\u201d and opined that this condition \u201cis usually caused by trauma to the body.\u201d Courtney was treated at the University of Maryland Medical Center on January 13, 2006, for \u201ccomplaints of trouble breathing, chest, back and rib pain.\u201d At that time, Dr. Jeffrey Johnson discovered fractures of Courtney\u2019s \u201c9th, 10th, and 11th posterior ribs and a left hemopheumothorax,\u201d which \u201cis blood and air in between the lungs and chest wall. It is usually caused by some type of trauma to the body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Dr. Jeffrey Johnson, who worked at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, testified for the State as an expert in the field of trauma surgery. He stated that Courtney was transferred to the Shock Trauma Center on January 13, 2006. Johnson testified that Courtney initially reported that \u201che had been kicked several times,\u201d although there were \u201cno visual clues\u201d as to his injuries. Courtney was hospitalized for five days with a collapsed lung and three fractured ribs. Johnson opined that such \u201crib fractures\u201d are caused by \u201cblunt force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s attorney moved for judgment of acquittal. He argued, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">As Your Honor knows, the analysis of the evidence in this case cannot be done in the way that the Court would do a normal second degree assault case. Normal second degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>assault, a citizen does not have the same right to use force as a police officer does____[A]n officer has the right to use a certain amount of force in the performance of his duties. In this case, all of the witnesses are consistent that the force that Officer Malarkey used began and ended within the scope of a very short period of time and while he was performing his official duties. There\u2019s no allegation that anything happened here that wasn\u2019t consistent with in [sic] the first instance, and part of his effort to handcuff and secure Mr. Courtney and then take him over to the vehicle where he was ultimately searched and immediately then turned over to others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">So the analysis of his conduct must be done in the context of his performance of his duties which means that, again, he has in a civil context what would be called qualified or discretionary immunity. I think in a criminal context what it means is the analysis of his conduct as whether or not it is excessive must be something well beyond what would be protected by qualified or discretionary immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">We have also argued in other parts of this case that there is a difference between what an officer may view as unnecessary in the context of the performance of one\u2019s duties and what was excessive. Whether Officer Malarkey\u2019s conduct was excessive has to be viewed on an objective police officer standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">... Officer Irwin made the distinction between unnecessary and excessive and as the State\u2019s witness, basically, if believed, would support a motion for judgment of acquittal in this case because unnecessary force does not, as a matter of law, constitute excessive force and would not permit the State to carry its burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">As the Court knows, <em>Graham v. Connor </em>[490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) ] sets sort of the general standard for what we do and how we analyze these cases. And it says, for example, that police officers are not liable for every push or shove they make nor for every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>serious injury that may be inflicted during the course of their duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\">They\u2019re forced to make split second decisions under tense and dangerous and rapidly moving circumstances. And the ultimate issue of excessive force and the quest of excessive force involves an analysis of the reasonableness of that force from the perspective of a reasonable police officer on the scene rather than the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. It must be analyzed from the moment when the decision to use force was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">I\u2019ve got to tell you, Your Honor, everybody on the scene didn\u2019t think Mr. Courtney was seriously injured. The doctors at the hospital didn\u2019t think he was seriously injured. There was nothing in the context of what happened to make anybody think he was seriously injured. And I suspect that this ball got rolling because somebody with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight looked back and said, this guy\u2019s got cracked ribs, how did that happen, and it distorted the analysis of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">Defense counsel continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">But if we look at what Officer Malarkey knew at the moment when he did these things, we have State\u2019s witnesses saying that this situation required the drawing of a weapon.... Yet when you look through it, what [the witnesses] really said at the end of the day is we had a guy who represented a potential danger. Even Officer Fields who was the hands-on officer said, I didn\u2019t know if he was a murderer, and Officer Irwin who said he was a known, not known, a suspected drug user. Somebody who had fled from the police on numerous occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">So when Officer Malarkey arrives on the scene and you put yourself in his position on an objective basis, any police officer coming up in that situation, knowing what he knew, seeing what he saw, seeing Officer Fields in an unsafe position with one handcuff on, with all of the information he knew about, with an erratic suspected drug user, what is he to think? Is this a safe or potentially dangerous situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Does he have time to go up there and to ask a question? No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">Appellant\u2019s attorney concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">This case should not go any further. This case shows an officer who used force clearly in the performance of his duties at a time when the information that he possessed would cause an objectively reasonable police officer to believe that immediate and firm action was necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Noting that the court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the State, the prosecutor responded: \u201cCorporal Malarkey is charged with second degree assault. And the elements are, for second degree assault, that he caused offensive physical contact or physical harm to Mr. Courtney.... And by reading my stipulation, you can see that it was definitely offensive ... Three fractured ribs is offensive, and I think that\u2019s simply stated.\u201d The prosecutor continued: \u201cQualified immunity doesn\u2019t even apply here. This is a criminal case____So to say this is not a normal second degree assault case, that an officer is allowed to use force, that\u2019s actually a misstatement of the law. An officer is not allowed to use force in every circumstance. It depends.\u201d In her view, the question of excessive force was one for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The court reserved on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Sergeant Daniel Frishkorn testified for the defense. By the time of trial, he had worked as a patrol sergeant for eight years with the Takoma Park Police Department. Frishkorn recounted that he \u201creceived information that there was a suspicious person that was hanging out near the Sunoco ... and that this individual, every time they saw the police, they would run.\u201d He saw Courtney in the parking lot of the Sunoco on January 8, 2006; Courtney began to run, and Frishkorn chased him on foot, but could not catch him. At 1:16 a.m., Frishkorn broadcast a description of Courtney as a \u201csuspicious person.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After Frishkorn lost track of Courtney, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>he went to the Popeye\u2019s Restaurant, where Malarkey was working, talked to him about the incident, and \u201cexplained to him what I saw and everything and that this guy had gotten away from me a couple of times.\u201d After he left Popeye\u2019s, he heard Malarkey\u2019s call that he had spotted the man again and was chasing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">At the scene, Frishkorn saw that \u201cOfficer Malarkey had Courtney on the back of the vehicle.... \u201d After Frishkorn searched Courtney, \u201cCourtney said that he couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201d Frishkorn explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">Initially, I thought that was a ploy for him trying to escape again ... I didn\u2019t see any injuries. He didn\u2019t say anything happened to him. All he said was that he couldn\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m thinking, okay, this guy is going to try to escape, one, and two, he\u2019s probably out of breath because he\u2019s been running all over the place....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">Frishkorn continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">[Malarkey] said that he was making the arrest, that he came down on Mr. Courtney and he had told me that he was taking medication for his back. Flexeril I think is what it is. It\u2019s like a muscle relaxer. So when he came down, he had to come straight down instead of having some flexibility. And I took that along with the fact that there was no visible injuries, there was no purported claim of injury. Our policy says if there\u2019s a visible injury, no matter what it is, a person could have a little cut from handcuffs, you have to do a use of force report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">When I talked to Officer Malarkey, he explained this about his back and explained he came down on the guy. Courtney never told me he was injured. There was no physical injury. There was no need for me to do a use of force report because, according to our policy, there was no use of force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">According to Frishkorn, the handcuffing of Courtney presented a high risk situation. He stated that if he saw someone handcuffing someone who was face down with their arms out, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>as Courtney was, he \u201cwould take action. If I saw that the person didn\u2019t have them handcuffed within two seconds, I would move in and help them with the handcuffing....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">As of the time of trial, Fred Roush had worked for the Takoma Park Police Department for twenty-four years, mostly as a patrol officer. He testified that when he arrived at the scene on January 8, 2006, Courtney was already handcuffed and \u201cwas sitting on his rear end.... \u201d Roush recalled: \u201cOfficer Malarkey was having a conversation with Mr. Courtney. \u2018Why are you running from the police? When the police tell you to stop, you should stop.\u2019 Then at one point he picked him up and walked him over to a cruiser and bent him over the trunk of the cruiser to search him.\u201d According to Roush, \u201cThe suspect\u2019s hands were handcuffed behind his back [and appellant] picked him up by his right elbow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Roush denied that there was anything \u201cout of the ordinary or improper in the manner in which [appellant] placed\u201d Courtney on the trunk. He also claimed that it did not appear that Malarkey injured Courtney. Roush recalled, however, that Courtney asked Malarkey why he was being detained, and Malarkey \u201cwas being distracted.\u201d Roush stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">And I was afraid this distraction, if he wasn\u2019t paying close enough attention, that and the fact that he had already foot chased this guy which gives you that adrenaline run and makes you stronger than you would normally be because you\u2019re chasing after him, I was afraid that as he was talking to this suspect, he wouldn\u2019t be paying enough attention to searching him and to how he was holding his arms up in the air. I felt with that distraction he might go a little too far which is only four or five inches before you can really put someone in a lot more pain.<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Appellant testified that he is 6 feet tall and, on January 8, 2006, he weighed between 215-220 pounds. His equipment weighed approximately 41 pounds. According to appellant, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>August 2005 he suffered an injury to his back, but he did not take medication at the time of the incident because it \u201cmade him mentally cloudy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Malarkey recalled that Sergeant Frishkorn came to Popeye\u2019s Restaurant, where Malarkey was working as a security officer, and spoke with him. He recounted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">[Frishkorn] told me that he had been involved with a chase with [Courtney] prior. Sergeant Collington had chased him on a prior incident and lost him. He told me that while off-duty he had kind of\u2014like, sort of impeded his path of travel while he was trying to get gas asking for money in an aggressive manner, and also that he observed him in what he thought was a drug transaction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">When Malarkey first observed Courtney, he radioed that he saw the suspect. Appellant \u201cexited [his] patrol vehicle\u201d and said to Courtney: \u201cRead the side of my car. I have a dog. Don\u2019t even think about running. I\u2019ve got to talk to you.\u201d Nevertheless, Courtney started to run westbound in the eastbound lane of East West Highway. Malarkey \u201cdidn\u2019t know if [Courtney] was trying to ambush [him] with what he was doing.\u201d Malarkey recalled what occurred when he arrived at the scene:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">I observed Mr. Courtney laying in what we call a prone position, laying face down, arms out to the side, legs spread, facing\u2014his head facing this way to the right. I was approaching from the left. Officer Fields was in a crouching position straddling Mr. Courtney. And out of the corner of my eye, I saw Officer Gaskin back here in what appeared to be a contact cover position. (Indicating on photograph throughout.) ... I ran up and I stopped. It appeared that Mr. Courtney was handcuffed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">I looked down and I realized that Mr. Courtney was not handcuffed.... I immediately dropped down and assisted with handcuffing and secured the left handcuff\u2014of the left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>arm between my thighs and knees, and handcuffed his left arm to his right arm.<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">The following testimony is also pertinent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: When you arrived on the scene and you saw Mr. Courtney lying on the ground, initially when you thought he was cuffed and later when you saw one cuff, what did the positioning of Mr. Courtney the way Officer Fields had Mr. Courtney positioned mean to you at that moment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">[MALARKEY]: We have a high-risk felony takedown taking place ... When I come up on a scene like that, that, to me, means we are taking down a robbery suspect, someone who\u2019s produced a weapon, someone who\u2019s exhibited some sort of violence towards the Police Officers, a carjacking suspect, something of an immediate danger. You can\u2019t just take down a regular citizen that you want to identify onto the ground prone out. It\u2019s completely inappropriate. At that point in time I thought when I had lost sight of him, I thought something had transpired. All those red flags that were going up were just like, something happened, because this guy is now in a contact cover, felony high-risk take-down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">According to Malarkey, \u201cIt was a very dangerous situation. The way Officer Fields was standing was extremely unusual and dangerous, and my intention was to render that situation safe immediately.\u201d Malarkey maintained that his knee \u201cwent in [Courtney\u2019s] back,\u201d but, after about two seconds, he removed his knee. Claiming that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have full mobility in [his] back,\u201d Malarkey said: \u201cAs I was going down, I realized that my back wasn\u2019t flexing. If anyone can picture like trying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>to kneel down, but not bending your back, it\u2019s kind of\u2014you\u2019re almost leaning backwards as you are trying to keep your back straight. As I was going down, my back didn\u2019t give. I went straight down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Malarkey recalled that Courtney complained several times that he could not breathe. Appellant stated: \u201cI\u2019m not in the best shape. I don\u2019t believe he was in the best shape. We were both out of breath. We were in a foot chase. I couldn\u2019t breathe either.\u201d Malarkey did not learn that Courtney was injured until January 28, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">After the defense rested,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> appellant\u2019s counsel renewed his motion for judgment, incorporating his prior arguments. Again, the court reserved. Thereafter, the State recalled Officer Gaskin and Officer Fields as rebuttal witnesses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Following the State\u2019s rebuttal, defense counsel again renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal, \u201cadopting and incorporating each and all of the arguments that had been made on each of the occasions when I have previously made this motion.\u201d He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">The standard, Your Honor, at this point is different. At the end of the State\u2019s case ... the standard was that the State is entitled to all reasonable inferences in their favor. That\u2019s not the standard now. The standard is a legal sufficiency standard, which is whether a reasonable jury considering this evidence could conclude beyond a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>able doubt that the Defendant is guilty of the offense charged in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">It\u2019s a different standard. The State is not entitled to any inferences at this stage. It is an objective reasonableness standard and whether the evidence here would permit that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">Now, as I spoke about before without repeating everything, that analysis has got to be done with the overlay that a Police Officer has a qualified or limited amount of immunity to use force under these circumstances.... Could a reasonable jury, under these facts, conclude that every reasonable Police Officer would have not acted in this fashion? And we have, within this evidence, clearly proved that there are reasonable Police Officers who believe that this was not excessive on both sides of the order of presentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">... In this case everything that Officer Malarkey did was in the course of his duties. It was quick. It was done for a specific purpose. And it does not, we submit under these facts, permit a reasonable jury to conclude that it was excessive even if another Police Officer might have done it in a different way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">It is a single event. It\u2019s over almost before it began. And it was done for the purpose of effecting what even Officer Fields acknowledged was a potentially dangerous situation such that he was justified in pulling his gun and ordering this guy down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">The court again reserved, without objection from the defense or the State. As noted, the case was submitted to the jury. Because the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the court declared a mistrial on May 23, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">On July 18, 2007, appellant filed a post-trial \u201cMotion for Judgment of Acquittal.\u201d He claimed that \u201cthe conduct of Officer Malarkey was reasonable and appropriate when reviewed through the eyes of a reasonable police officer similarly situated\u201d and \u201cthe evidence was insufficient to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that the force used by [Malarkey] was excessive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Seven months later, on February 20, 2008, the State filed a \u201cResponse to Motion for Judgment of Acquittal,\u201d requesting that the court find that appellant\u2019s motion for judgment was \u201ca nullity for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It explained that, pursuant to <em>State v. Sirbaugh, </em>27 Md.App. 290, 339 A.2d 697 (1975), the decision to allow appellant\u2019s case to go to the jury \u201ceffectively denied the motions for judgment of acquittal\u201d and that the mistrial \u201cended any dispute before the Court as to whether there was sufficient evidence.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Appellant responded on February 21, 2008, and also filed a \u201cSupplemental Motion to Dismiss on the Basis of Violation of Principles of Double Jeopardy and Due Process.\u201d He asked the court to \u201cgrant his motion for judgment of acquittal, but also, in the alternative, dismiss the indictment on the grounds that any re-trial would subject the Defendant to twice being placed in jeopardy....\u201d Appellant asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">Not only was the evidence insufficient to support any reasonable jury finding of guilty in this matter, but the fact that the Defendant has been placed in jeopardy, that the State presented a legally insufficient case and the fact that the State now seeks to re-prosecute the Defendant violates his constitutional and common law protection of due process and his constitutional and common law protection against twice being placed in jeopardy for the same offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">At a hearing on February 21, 2008,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> appellant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cIf the Court concludes that there was legally insufficient evidence at the first trial for the Defendant to have been convicted by a reasonable jury, then the State has had its one shot.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel asked the court to \u201cmake a factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>determination that the State legally did not meet its case.\u201d He also asked the court to dismiss the indictment based upon double jeopardy grounds, asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">We believe ... that, because the Defendant was brought to trial in a case where there was legally insufficient evidence, that the State cannot go forward and we\u2019re asking the Court to make a ruling as to whether or not it would grant a Motion to Dismiss with respect to the double jeopardy argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The prosecutor insisted that double jeopardy did not apply, asserting: \u201cThe case law is clear that, when there is a mistrial, the State has every right to retry.\u201d He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">This whole double jeopardy claim is just off base and it doesn\u2019t follow the law at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">All the cases cited by the Defendant are cases where there are verdicts. Every case. And that is a key distinction. There is no verdict in this case. It is a mistrial and the Court\u2019s jurisdiction ends at that point when the jury is dismissed ... No trier of fact left at that point, so the jurisdiction ends and that is what Serbaw [sic] <em>[State v. Sirbaugh, </em>27 Md.App. 290, 339 A.2d 697 (1975) ] says.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The prosecutor continued: \u201cYour Honor reserved and <em>Ser-baw </em>[sic] says that, by presenting and giving it to the jury, is an effective denial of the motion. [The court] submitted it to the trier of fact, and by making that decision, it has effectively said that the jury has evidence by which it can conclude\u2014 legally sufficient evidence by which they can conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The court denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal and his motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">Frankly, I had operated under the assumption that a trial Court could, in fact, reserve on a Motion for Judgment following the presentation of the State\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence and did that in this instance under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the mistaken assumption that I had the authority to do that. And, later, as happens in this case, the jury was unable to reach a verdict and [the court] declared the mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\"><em>Serbaw </em>[sic] has not been reversed. I believe it is still good law ... whatever I would or could have done is now totally speculative. As the Court says, it is clear that such action was a nullity since, once [the court] had declared a mistrial and dismissed the jury, [the court] lost all authority to take action in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">So, having done that, I think, by operation of the law, I am without the authority to do this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In regard to double jeopardy, the court also stated: \u201cWell, on the double jeopardy\u2014I don\u2019t think\u2014if there was a mistrial, then there was no trial to verdict ... I don\u2019t think jeopardy is attached if you declared a mistrial. I appreciate the argument that says, if there is legally insufficient evidence, I should have ruled on the motion. And, trust me, I would have today had it not been for the <em>Serbaw </em>[sic] case.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">On February 27, 2008, appellant noted an appeal and filed a \u201cMotion For Stay of Proceedings Pending Appellate Review of Denial of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment on Grounds of Double Jeopardy.\u201d The circuit court granted the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Appellant contends that the State \u201cfailed to present a legally sufficient case\u201d and \u201cretrial of Appellant is barred by principles of double jeopardy and due process.\u201d He maintains that he \u201chad a constitutional right to have the trial court rule on the legal sufficiency of the evidence presented by the State during the trial.\u201d By repeatedly failing to rule on his motion for judgment of acquittal, asserts appellant, the court \u201cviolated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>constitutional principles of double jeopardy that prohibit affording the prosecution a second opportunity to prosecute an accused where the prosecution has failed in the initial trial to produced [sic] legally sufficient evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Moreover, appellant argues: \u201cBy reserving and submitting the evidence to the jury, the judge certainly did not intend for that act to signify or rise to the level of constitutional scrutiny that the trial court was denying the motion after a finding that the evidence was sufficient.\u201d He posits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">To permit the trial court, either by inadvertence, neglect or negligence, to deprive the Appellant of his right to a ruling that could bar further prosecution in this matter could only mean that in the context of this prosecution, that the Appellant has no constitutional double jeopardy protection against twice being put in jeopardy where the State has failed to present legally sufficient evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">According to appellant, his interlocutory appeal \u201cis properly before this Court,\u201d because of the \u201cunique factual circumstances\u201d of this case. In his view, he was \u201cplaced in jeopardy during a week-long trial,\u201d and insists that if the court had ruled on his repeated motions for judgment of acquittal during trial, and had ruled in his favor, the prosecution would have terminated. Further, he argues: \u201cThe Appellant had a right to a ruling to protect him from twice being placed in jeopardy. The trial court cannot deprive him of that right.\u201d He adds that the \u201cprotections of double jeopardy overrule any suggestion ... that the trial court\u2019s decision to reserve can eviscerate the Appellant\u2019s right to a ruling on the sufficiency of the prosecution\u2019s evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Claiming that the appeal is \u201cpremature and not allowed by law,\u201d the State has moved to dismiss. According to the State, \u201can appealable final judgment exists only after conviction and imposition of sentence.\u201d <em>See Langworthy v. State, </em>284 Md. 588, 596, 399 A.2d 578 (1979) (stating that usually, for final judgment purposes, \u201ca criminal case is complete and disposed of when a sentence has been pronounced\u201d); <em>State v. Lee, </em>178 Md.App. 478, 484, 943 A.2d 14 (2008) (stating that State\u2019s right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>of appeal was \u201cripe upon final judgment, which occurred when the trial court sentenced appellee for his convictions\u201d). In its view, \u201c[t]he interlocutory appeal lodged by Malarkey is not specifically allowed by statute\u201d or under the collateral order doctrine, \u201c[njotwithstanding that Malarkey has couched his claim in terms of double jeopardy----\u201d The State explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">Resolution of the appeal in this case rests, at bottom, on a review of Malarkey\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence presented in a trial that ended in a hung jury; therefore, it does not fall within the scope of the collateral order doctrine. To be sure, generally speaking, a criminal defendant may file an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy grounds. But, as the trial court observed, Malarkey\u2019s double jeopardy claim is in essence \u201cjust a rewrapping\u201d of his evidentiary sufficiency claim. Couching it as a double jeopardy issue \u201cdoesn\u2019t alter the fact[.]\u201d What Malarkey terms a \u201cdouble jeopardy issue\u201d is a claim that cannot be resolved without a review of the sufficiency of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Moreover, the State posits: \u201cWhere a mistrial is declared because a jury has been unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the[r]e is no successive prosecution, but rather a continuation of the initial prosecution.... \u201d Thus, argues the State, \u201c|t]here is self-evidently no issue of multiple punishments for the same offense in the case at bar.\u201d It contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">This case should be treated no differently than cases in which the trial court denied a motion for judgment of acquittal and then declared a mistrial, without objection, because the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The case should then have proceeded to a second trial. If that trial results in a conviction and a final judgment, Malarkey can then properly challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction on direct appeal from that judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">In reply, appellant asserts: \u201cThe trial court\u2019s reservation, without an express denial ... cannot be considered \u2018tantamount\u2019 to denial based upon sufficient consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>evidence.\u201d By repeatedly reserving its ruling on his motion, argues appellant, the court \u201cabrogated its responsibility to decide\u201d his motions. Malarkey argues: \u201cSubmission to the jury under the mistaken belief that the trial court could later rule was not a proper basis for a denial of the motion [for judgment of acquittal].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In order to determine whether the State\u2019s motion to dismiss has merit, we must explore the double jeopardy contentions in the context of the particular circumstances attendant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 787, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969), provides, in part: \u201cnor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb----\u201d In a jury trial, jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn. <em>Caldwell v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 612, 647, 884 A.2d 199 (2005). <em>See Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 467, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973); <em>Taylor v. State, </em>381 Md. 602, 611, 851 A.2d 551 (2004); <em>State v. Woodson, </em>338 Md. 322, 329, 658 A.2d 272 (1995). A long line of cases makes plain that the denial of a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine. In <em>Nicholson v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 304, 309, 850 A.2d 1204 (2004), we said: \u201cAlthough the denial of a motion to dismiss is not ordinarily a final judgment that entitles a defendant to appeal, when the motion to dismiss is on double jeopardy grounds, defendants may appeal before trial.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Anderson v. State, </em>385 Md. 123, 128, 867 A.2d 1040 (2005) (recognizing \u201cthe right under the collateral order doctrine to take an immediate appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss a criminal charge on double jeopardy grounds\u201d); <em>Parrott v. State, </em>301 Md. 411, 418, 483 A.2d 68 (1984) (stating that the collateral order doctrine \u201c \u2018permit\u00eds] appeals from certain interlocutory decisions which conclusively determine an important question, are separate from the merits of the case, and are effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Warne v. State, </em>166 Md.App. 135, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>139 n. 3, 887 A.2d 657 (2005) (\u201cDenial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977), provides guidance. There, five defendants were charged in a single-count indictment with conspiracy and attempt to obstruct interstate commerce by means of extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. Id. at 653, 97 S.Ct. 2034. Prior to and during trial, the defendants challenged the indictment \u201con grounds of duplicity of offenses, claiming that its single count improperly charged both a conspiracy and an attempt to violate the Hobbs Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654, 97 S.Ct. 2034. The federal district court required the government to establish both offenses, and instructed the jury to that effect. <em>Id. </em>The jury returned a guilty verdict against three of the defendants, who then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the convictions and ordered a new trial \u201con the ground that the key tape recording had been admitted into evidence without proper authentication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655, 97 S.Ct. 2034.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court directed the government \u201cto elect between the conspiracy and attempt charges on remand in order to avoid any similar problems at the next trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The government chose to proceed with the conspiracy charge. The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, based on double jeopardy. After the district court denied the motion, the defendants filed an immediate appeal. The government challenged the appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the interlocutory appeal. Nevertheless, the court entertained the appeal and affirmed the district court by a \u201cjudgment order\u201d that rejected the defendants\u2019 challenge to the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 656, 97 S.Ct. 2034.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>The Supreme Court reversed the Third Circuit and remanded for a new trial. We quote at length from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, <em>id. </em>at 659-63, 97 S.Ct. 2034:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">Although it is true that a pretrial order denying a motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds lacks the finality traditionally considered indispensable to appellate review, we conclude that such orders fall within the \u201csmall class of cases\u201d that <em>Cohen [v. Benefit Indus Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949) ] has placed beyond the confines of the final-judgment rule. In the first place there can be no doubt that such orders constitute a complete, formal and, in the trial court, final rejection of a criminal defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim. There ar\u00e9 simply no further steps that can be taken in the District Court to avoid the trial the defendant maintains is barred by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">Moreover, the very nature of a double jeopardy claim is such that it is collateral to, and separable from, the principal issue at the accused\u2019s impending criminal trial, <em>i.e., </em>whether or not the accused is guilty of the offense charged. In arguing that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment bars his prosecution, the defendant makes no challenge whatsoever to the merits of the charge against him. Nor does he seek suppression of evidence which the Government plans to use in obtaining a conviction. <em>See DiBella v. United States, </em>[369 U.S. 121, 82 S.Ct. 654, 7 L.Ed.2d 614 (1962) ]; ... <em>Cogen v. United States, </em>278 U.S. 221, 49 S.Ct. 118, 73 L.Ed. 275 (1929). Rather, he is contesting the very authority of the Government to hale him into court to face trial on the charge against him. <em>Menna v. New York, </em>423 U.S. 61, 96 S.Ct. 241, 46 L.Ed.2d 195 (1975); <em>Blackledge v. Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 30, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974); <em>Robinson v. Neil, </em>409 U.S. 505, 509, 93 S.Ct. 876, 35 L.Ed.2d 29 (1973). The elements of that claim are completely independent of his guilt or innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">... [T]he matters embraced in the trial court\u2019s pretrial order here are truly collateral to the criminal prosecution itself in the sense that they will not \u201caffect, or ... be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>affected by, decision of the merits of this case.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>337 U.S., at 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">Our conclusion that a defendant may seek immediate appellate review of a district court\u2019s rejection of his double jeopardy claim is based on the special considerations permeating claims of that nature which justify a departure from the normal rule of finality. Quite obviously, such considerations do not extend beyond the claim of former jeopardy and encompass other claims presented to, and rejected by, the district court in passing on the accused\u2019s motion to dismiss. Rather, such claims are appealable if, and only if, they too fall within Cohen\u2019s collateral-order exception to the final-judgment rule. Any other rule would encourage criminal defendants to seek review of, or assert, frivolous double jeopardy claims in order to bring more serious, but otherwise nonappealable questions to the attention of the courts of appeals prior to conviction and sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Nevertheless, the Supreme Court concluded that, under the facts of <em>Abney, </em>the denial of appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss was not immediately appealable. It reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 663, 97 S.Ct. 2034:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">Here, we think it clear that the District Court\u2019s rejection of petitioners\u2019 challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment does not come within the <em>Cohen </em>exception. First, an order denying a motion to dismiss an indictment for failure to state an offense is plainly not \u201ccollateral\u201d in any sense of that term; rather it goes to the very heart of the issues to be resolved at the upcoming trial. Secondly, the issue resolved adversely to petitioners is such that it may be reviewed effectively, and, if necessary, corrected if and when a final judgment results. We therefore conclude that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction ... to pass on the merits of petitioners\u2019 challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment at this juncture in the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The question, then, is whether Malarkey is entitled to immediate review of the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The court below relied upon <em>State v. Sirbaugh, </em>27 Md.App. 290, 339 A.2d 697 (1975), to conclude that its reservations amounted to a denial of appellant\u2019s motions for acquittal. On this basis, it rejected appellant\u2019s claims that the court did not resolve the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Urging this Court to overrule <em>Sirbaugh, </em>appellant contends that it is constitutionally invalid as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">As noted, appellant argues that the court \u201cabrogated its responsibility to decide\u201d his motions when it reserved. He insists that the \u201cgranting of the mistrial,\u201d and the trial court\u2019s subsequent conclusion that the mistrial \u201cdeprived [the Court] of its authority to rule on Appellant\u2019s motion, placed Appellant in a no-win position.\u201d In his view, there is a \u201cneed to protect double jeopardy principles where there has been a gross violation of an accused\u2019s right to have the trial court rule on a motion challenging the legal sufficiency of the prosecution\u2019s evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">According to appellant, <em>Sirbaugh, </em>\u201cdecided over 30 years ago, does not undertake any analysis of the principles set forth\u201d in \u201ccases discussing the application of double jeopardy protections in circumstances where the State has failed to adduce legally sufficient evidence at trial.\u201d Moreover, appellant points out that Rule 4-324, governing motions for judgment of acquittal, does not specifically prohibit a trial court from reserving its ruling on such a motion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cIn the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>of a specific prohibition against reserving its ruling,\u201d argues appellant, \u201cany statement in <em>Sirbaugh </em>that the trial court could not reserve its ruling is simply wrong and without authority.\u201d He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">It is wrong to read into <em>Sirbaugh </em>an expansion and addition to [Rule 4-324] to hold that where a trial court reserves on ruling and submits evidence to the jury, the trial court is deemed to have denied the motion ... The rules as applied in Appellant\u2019s case did not afford the Appellant his constitutional right to have the Court assess the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence. No other vehicle was or is available to effect Appellant\u2019s constitutional protections against twice being put in jeopardy by twice being brought to trial where, in the first trial, the State has failed to adduce sufficient evidence to support a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The State counters that Malarkey\u2019s position is \u201cfundamentally flawed; the trial court did effectively rule on the motion.\u201d It relies on <em>Sirbaugh </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s decision to reserve on the motion for judgment of acquittal and present the case to the jury was tantamount to a denial of the motion....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Alternatively, the State contends that Malarkey \u201chas waived any complaint that he had a constitutional right to have the trial court rule on his motion for judgment of acquittal.\u201d Noting that the trial court explicitly stated three times that it would reserve ruling on the various motions for judgment of acquittal, the State observes: \u201cDefense counsel never raised any objection to the trial court\u2019s decision to reserve its ruling.\u201d Rather, claims the State, Malarkey \u201cstood mute in the face of the trial court\u2019s repeated announcement that it was reserving on the motions.... \u201d Even when the case was about to be presented to the jury for deliberations, appellant did not object or request a ruling. According to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>State, appellant\u2019s argument \u201cis appellate afterthought in its purest form.\u201d It posits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">Had defense counsel stated that he had a right to a ruling on the motion at trial, before the case was submitted to the jury, the court no doubt would have ruled on the motion. Counsel did not do so, and Malarkey should not be heard to argue on appeal that the court erred or that he had a \u201cright\u201d to a ruling at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Appellant replies that the State is \u201cflatly wrong\u201d in claiming that he \u201cwaived any constitutional right to have review of the motion for judgment of acquittal.\u201d In his view, the trial court reserved because of \u201cits own serious doubt about the legal sufficiency of the prosecutor\u2019s evidence.\u201d Moreover, he avers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">Appellant can not be deemed to have waived a constitutional right when neither he, the State, nor the court realized a constitutional right was going by the wayside. This is because both parties and the court were under the assumption the court could [reserve]. Appellant raised constitutional concerns at the first opportunity he learned that they were being put at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">We agree with the State\u2019s waiver claim. To be sure, the defense repeatedly moved for acquittal, and the court repeatedly reserved. But, appellant never made known to the court that he was entitled to a ruling before submission to the jury. Had he done so, the court might well have been willing to rule. A party cannot complain about the court\u2019s failure to rule on a pending motion unless it has \u201cbrought [it] to the attention of the trial court.\u201d <em>White v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 151, 156, 326 A.2d 219 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>273 Md. 723 (1975).

The court below was not afforded that opportunity. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v.

The trial court cannot correct errors of which it is not informed. Considerations of fairness and judicial efficiency generally require that all challenges that a party wishes to make to a trial court\u2019s action or conduct \u201cbe presented in the first instance to the trial court so that (1) a proper record can be made with respect to the challenge, and (2) the other parties and the trial judge are given an opportunity to consider and respond to the challenge.\u201d <em>Chaney v.

We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">We begin with a review of <em>Sirbaugh. </em>John Sirbaugh was charged with manslaughter by automobile and other motor vehicle offenses. 27 Md.App. at 291, 339 A.2d 697. The trial court reserved ruling on the defense\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence, and the case was submitted to the jury. Thereafter, the court declared a mistrial due to the illness of a juror. <em>Id. </em>It then granted the motion for judgment of acquittal on which it had reserved, and dismissed the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 339 A.2d 697. The State subsequently filed a one-count criminal information, again charging Sirbaugh with manslaughter by automobile. <em>Id. </em>Sirbaugh moved to dismiss based on double jeopardy. After the court granted Sirbaugh\u2019s motion, the State appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">On appeal, we considered whether the trial judge had \u201cthe power to grant the Appellee\u2019s Motion for a Judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Acquittal after declaring a mistrial, where the trial judge had [previously] taken the Motion under advisement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 339 A.2d 697. The Court said, <em>id. </em>at 294, 339 A.2d 697:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Q\">[I]n a criminal jury case, the trial judge has two options: (1) grant a motion for judgment of acquittal, or (2) deny the motion and submit the case to the jury. <em>He has no authority to reserve his ruling on the motion for judgment of acquittal and at the same time submit the case to the jury. If he follows such a course, it is tantamount to denying the motion.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">We think, however, the simple answer to the factual situation presented in this appeal is found in the action of the trial judge <em>in declaring a mistrial and then endeavoring to make a ruling on the motion for judgment of acquittal, which ruling he had previously purported to reserve. It is clear that such action was a nullity since once he had declared a mistrial and dismissed the jury, he lost all authority to take any action in the case. </em>The declaration of the mistrial and the dismissal of the jury ended the trial and ended the judge\u2019s participation therein. Thus, <em>his purported ruling on the motion was completely ineffectual and meaningless.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">With the concession of [Sirbaugh] that the trial judge acted properly in granting the mistrial it, thus, effectively dissipated the jeopardy to which appellee had been subjected. We have no alternative than to find that it was error to grant the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the second criminal information on the ground that the trial thereon would place appellee twice in jeopardy thereby violating his Fifth Amendment right under the federal constitution. (Emphasis added) (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In reaching its decision, the <em>Sirbaugh </em>Court considered Maryland Rule 563(a)(2), the predecessor to Rule 2-532(b). Applicable to civil cases, Rule 563(a)(2) stated, in part: \u201cWhere the court reserves decision on a motion for a directed verdict, and submits the case to the jury, that action by the court operates as a motion for judgment [N.O.V.] under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Rule.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But, the Court recognized that Rule 563 \u201cdoes not apply to criminal cases.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 296, 339 A.2d 697. <em>See also Hudson v.

Rule 4-324 does not authorize a court to reserve its ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal, in contrast to the civil context. <em>See </em>Rule 2-5 32. The Court of Appeals and the General Assembly are obviously aware of F.R.Crim. P. 29. Neither has seen fit to conform Rule 4-324 to F.R.Crim. P. 29. It is not our province to do so. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Simpson v. Moore, </em>323 Md. 215, 226, 592 A.2d 1090 (1991), a court \u201c \u2018is not at liberty to add to the language of the law; and the court must hold that the Legislature intended to omit the provision however improbable that may appear____(citation omitted). <em>See also Nelson v.

Therefore, we shall grant the State\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-11\">. The case was tried to a jury beginning on May 14, 2007. The alleged victim of the assault, John Courtney, was served with a subpoena but failed to appear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\">. Malarkey\u2019s radio broadcast regarding Courtney was played for the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\">. Fields also said: \"I didn't feel any fear when I went to him. He wasn\u2019t moving. He wasn't fighting. As I approached him, there was no suspicious movements from him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b154-10\">4. Fields conceded that ''the straddling handcuffing technique\u201d he used \"may not be the safest.\u201d He explained: \"Because the person could get up and you\u2019re off balance. If their body is in-between your legs, they can roll over and knock you down or they can get up and knock you back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">In a recorded pre-trial statement that Fields gave to Sergeant Tyrone Collington, Fields stated that Malarkey had \"leaned\u201d Courtney over the trunk. Appellant\u2019s attorney also established that Fields did not use the word \"slammed\u201d in his description of the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[5]\">\n<p id=\"b156-10\">5. On cross-examination, appellant\u2019s attorney pointed out that Almas did not mention in her police report that Malarkey \"slammed\u201d Courtney on the trunk of the car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b160-11\">.

On cross-examination, Roush conceded that he told Malarkey that he \"should have eased back on that guy....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[8]\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\">8. Later, appellant added: \"I was full speed. I stopped. I thought he was handcuffed. I then looked\u2014instantaneously, I looked down. His hand is not handcuffed. His hand is moving back and forth. Fields is trying to get him handcuffed.\u201d Malarkey continued: \"I had a second to react, and that\u2019s what I did. I did the best thing to my training, my ability to keep Officer Fields, who is in an unsafe position, to make it a safe situation, and get Mr. Courtney handcuffed. That\u2019s all I wanted to do.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\">. Appellant also called several character witnesses. Their testimony is not pertinent to the issues on appeal. In addition, the defense introduced Courtney\u2019s criminal record, which consisted of numerous convictions from 1983 to 2002. These included possession of controlled substances; three felony theft convictions; two misdemeanor theft convictions; robbery; breaking and entering a storehouse; and third degree burglary of a dwelling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\">. Officer Gaskin explained the training she received at the Police Academy on handcuffing techniques, and stated that she did not regard as dangerous the way that Officer Fields had handcuffed Courtney. She explained that Fields \u201calready had the situation under control.\u201d Officer Fields located on a photograph where Malarkey's cruiser was parked and where he parked his cruiser when he arrived at the scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\">. The State did not suggest that appellant\u2019s motion was untimely. Nor did appellant complain about the State\u2019s delay in responding to his motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\">. The judge commented that he received appellant\u2019s reply to the State\u2019s \"Response to Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\u201d and appellant\u2019s supplemental motion to dismiss on the morning of the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b168-12\">.

A defendant may move for judgment of acquittal on one or more counts, or on one or more degrees of an offense which by law is divided into degrees, at the close of the evidence offered by the State and, in a jury trial, at the close of all the evidence. The defendant shall state with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted. No objection to the motion for judgment of acquittal shall be necessary. A defendant does not waive the right to make the motion by introducing evidence during the presentation of the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">(b) Action by the court. If the court grants a motion for judgment of acquittal or determines on its own motion that a judgment of acquittal should be granted, it shall enter the judgment or direct the clerk to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>enter the judgment and to note that it has been entered by direction of the court.

Rule 2-532(b) currently states, in part: \"If the court reserves ruling on a motion for judgment made at the close of all the evidence, that motion becomes a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict if the verdict is against the moving party or if no verdict is returned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b181-7\">.

Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">(b) Reserving Decision. The court may reserve decision on the motion, proceed with the trial (where the motion is made before the close of all the evidence), submit the case to the jury, and decide the motion either before the jury returns a verdict or after it returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged without having returned a verdict. If the court reserves decision, it must decide the motion on the basis of the evidence at the time the ruling was reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">(c) After Jury Verdict or Discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">(1) <em>Time for a Motion. </em>A defendant may move for a judgment of acquittal, or renew such a motion, within 7 days after a guilty verdict or after the court discharges the jury, whichever is later.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">(2) <em>Ruling on the Motion. </em>If the jury has returned a guilty verdict, the court may set aside the verdict and enter an acquittal.
