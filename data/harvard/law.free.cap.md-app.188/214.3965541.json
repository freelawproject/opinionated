The genesis of these proceedings was a mechanic\u2019s lien action filed by appellant, a subcontractor to appellee, in the Circuit Court for Frederick County, in conjunction with a construction project. Trial proceeded in the circuit court on appellee\u2019s breach of contract counter-claim based on the alleged failure of appellant to perform in accordance with its construction subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">In 2000, at the conclusion of the trial, the court entered judgment against appellant in the amount of $78,222.20, including an award of $48,222 for appellee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>provided for under the subcontract between the parties governing attorney\u2019s fees. In an appeal to this Court filed by appellant from the trial court\u2019s decision, in an unreported opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we disallowed \u201cinterest carry charges,\u201d thereby partially vacating and, in effect, reducing the money judgment entered against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">On remand, pursuant to appellee\u2019s Petition for Additional Attorney\u2019s Fees, filed September 24, 2002, the circuit court entered judgment on June 8, 2004, awarding appellee $14,700 in additional attorney\u2019s fees. Appellant appealed the court\u2019s award of these additional attorney\u2019s fees to this Court and we vacated the award of additional fees in its entirety and remanded the case to the trial court with direction for the circuit court to revise its judgment in accordance with our unreported opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">On March 30, 2006, the trial court entered a revised judgment, pursuant to our mandate, which was recorded on April 3, 2006. On April 10, 2006, the clerk issued the Notice of Modification of Judgment, the judgment becoming enrolled as a final judgment on May 3, 2006. On May 16, 2006, appellant filed a Plea of Tender requesting that appellee be required to accept post-judgment interest running from the June 8, 2004. Appellee filed its opposition thereto on May 31, 2006 and requested post-judgment interest dating back to the court\u2019s first entry of judgment in June 2000, as opposed to the intermediate June 8, 2004 judgment or the March 30, 2006 final judgment. Appellee\u2019s opposition to the Plea of Tender also requested additional attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the provision for attorney\u2019s fees in the contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">After a hearing on appellee\u2019s request for interest, the circuit court ruled that post-judgment interest would accrue as of June 27, 2000, the date of the first judgment. Appellant, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the third time, appealed to this Court; we dismissed the appeal as premature. On remand, appellant filed a Motion to Dismiss, Alternatively, Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to appellee\u2019s request for additional attorney\u2019s fees on December 22, 2006. Subsequent to appellee\u2019s opposition to the Motion, the circuit court, on May 6, 2008, conducted a hearing and denied appellant\u2019s Motion. On June 3, 2008, the court held an evidentiary hearing to consider the amount, if any, of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded to appellee. Appellee\u2019s counsel cited the subcontract between the parties as the basis of his request for attorney\u2019s fees. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court \u201cclarified\u201d that the award was \u201cfor attorney\u2019s fees incurred basically after April 3, 2006,\u201d which was the date the clerk recorded the final judgment. In response to further requests for clarification from appellant\u2019s counsel, the court stated that its attorney\u2019s fee award was not a revision to the April 3rd final judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">I don\u2019t think it can be.... Because what the Court of Special Appeals did was said that [sic] that [Judge Dwyer\u2019s August 16,2006 oral order awarding post-judgment interest and reserving on attorney\u2019s fees] is a non final order because I reserved on attorney\u2019s fees. That order did not touch that [April 3, 2006 final] judgment I don\u2019t think.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The court opined, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have any authority to award attorney [sic] fees in this, other than pursuant to the subcontract, how\u2019s that?\u201d The court added that, \u201cif that subcontract [between the parties] did not, um, survive that April 3rd order then Mr. Miller\u2019s [attorney\u2019s fee request is] in trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">As noted, in a written order filed June 12, 2008, the trial judge awarded appellee $41,296.16 in additional attorney\u2019s fees, in addition to the award of $48,222 that was included in the final judgment against appellant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Appellant filed this timely appeal, presenting the following questions, which we rephrase slightly, for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">I. Did the trial court err when it awarded additional contract-based attorney\u2019s fee damages requested after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>entry of a non-appealable and enrolled final judgment on the contract in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">II. Did the trial court err in granting post judgment interest to accrue from the date of the first judgment entered in this case, even though that judgment amount has since been subject to multiple reductions due to appeals taken to this Court?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">For the reasons that follow, we answer appellant\u2019s first question in the affirmative and the second question in the negative and accordingly affirm, in part, and vacate, in part, the judgments of the Circuit Court for Frederick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">On November 15,1996, appellee entered into a contract with the owner and developer of the New Market Food Lion Shopping Center, Lionheart, to construct a grocery store for its principal tenant, Food Lion, at that location. According to that contract, appellee was to serve as general contractor for the Project. The contract provided that time was \u201cof the essence,\u201d and that appellee had to \u201cachieve Substantial Completion\u201d of its work \u201cnot later than 210 days from the date of commencement.\u201d The contract defined the \u201cdate of commencement\u201d as \u201cten days after the issuance of all required building permits or a Notice to Proceed from the Owner, whichever occurs last.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Three and a half months later, on February 26, 1997, appellee entered into a \u201clump sum\u201d subcontract with appellant, in which the latter agreed, <em>inter alia, </em>to widen Route 144 and complete on-site paving and water and sewer utility work. Appellant also agreed to furnish all labor materials, tools, fees, taxes, insurance, permits, licenses and all miscellaneous costs to achieve Site Work requirements in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by Lionheart\u2019s engineering consulting firm, Loiderman Associates. Inc. (Loiderman). Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>lant then entered into a contract with Frederick County for on and off-site utility installation on the Food Lion Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Appellant obtained the subcontract with appellee through a competitive bidding process, which required appellee to provide potential bidders with documents (bid documents), prepared by Loiderman. Based on the bid documents, appellant submitted a bid, which was accepted by appellee and the parties then entered into the subcontract, in which appellant stated that it had \u201cvisited the site and [was] familiar with the existing conditions.\u201d It also represented that it had \u201creviewed the plans and specifications and that said plans and specifications [were] complete <em>and/or </em>sufficient to provide a complete operating system.\u201d It further stated that, \u201cwith exception of design changes,\u201d it could \u201ccomplete the project with no additional cost to Contractor.\u201d And it agreed that it would not \u201cbe entitled to any extras or change orders resulting from \u2018insufficient information\u2019 to complete its portion of the work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">On October 16, 1997, eight months after appellant began work on the Project on March 13,1997, according to appellant, the location of the \u201cedge of existing paving\u201d was exposed when \u201cexcavation for the subgrade of the road widening was initiated.\u201d It was at this time, appellant claims, that the true \u201csubsurface condition\u201d of the road was revealed and it was discovered that those conditions were different from what was depicted in the bid documents provided by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The next day, a Frederick County inspector noted in his \u201cDaily Log\u201d that the \u201c[ejxisting shoulder [of Route 144] has approx [sic] 2 to 5. [inches] of tar <em>&amp; </em>chip surface.\u201d The inspector, having observed that \u201c[t]here appears to be a discrepancy in the plans as to what surface is to be removed,\u201d wrote that \u201cFrederick County will not accept tar &amp; chip shoulder as main line travel area.\u201d Appellant, accordingly, requested a \u201cchange order\u201d from appellee for additional compensation for what it claimed was an increase in the amount of paving necessary to complete the project over what was set forth in the bid documents. In a letter dated October 28, 1997, Keith Flannagan, appellee\u2019s project manager, denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>request, stating that, after consulting with its engineer, appel-lee believed that \u201cthe plans adequately cover[ed][the] area and that no additional cost [was] justified.\u201d Flannagan further wrote: \u201cIt is my understanding that your firm has left this site until this question has been answered. Please continue on this work as per our contract to avoid impacting our schedule.\u201d The letter concluded that it was to be considered as \u201cnotification to [appellant] to continue this work as required by our contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Rather than resume working, appellant wrote a letter to appellee, dated November 7, 1997, advising appellee that it was \u201cwilling to perform any additional work as long as we are provided drawings which illustrate what is to be done\u201d and that it \u201cnever agreed to do additional work outside of the scope outlined in the contract documents and drawings to satisfy County Requirements.\u201d The letter continued, \u201cUntil [it was] provided with a red line revision to the plan,\u201d it would \u201cproceed with the\u201d plans as drawn, which, as indicated in the Frederick County inspector\u2019s report, would not meet Frederick County standards. Additionally, delays, the result of rainy weather which required appellee to apply \u201csoil cement\u201d to the ground to facilitate paving in wet conditions, were a further source of conflict between appellee and appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Apparently responding to a letter appellee had received from appellant on November 17, 1997, appellee, on the same day, sent a letter stating that, because appellant had implied in its letter that it was \u201cnot going to install the right of way work on the\u201d Project \u201cin accordance with the directives issued ... by Frederick County\u201d and had \u201crefused to mobilize on the right of way work after being given the required notice to do so,\u201d it was terminating its subcontract with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Thereafter, appellee entered into a subcontract with a different excavating company, which in turn, subcontracted the work to a third excavating company. All of the excavation work for the Food Lion Project, including the widening of Route 144, was approved by a Frederick County inspector on February 5, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>On January 2,1998, appellant filed a complaint for breach of contract and a petition to establish and enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien in the Circuit Court for Frederick County. In its complaint and petition to establish mechanic\u2019s lien, appellant contended that appellee wrongfully terminated it, and that appel-lee\u2019s \u201crefusal to render payment to appellant\u201d constituted a \u201cbreach of the agreement between the parties.\u201d As a result, appellant claimed that it was entitled to \u201cdamages for wrongful termination, lost profits and consequential damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In response, on April 8, 1998, appellee filed a counter-claim against appellant for breach of contract and negligence. In its counter-claim, appellee maintained, among other things, that pursuant to its subcontract with appellant, \u201cappellant was to undertake any and all work to supply any all [sic] materials necessary to widen and overlay a portion of Maryland Route 144.\u201d Appellee further asserted that, after it requested that appellant \u201cperform the widening and overlay work as required by the Contract,\u201d appellant \u201crepudiated the contract\u201d and refused \u201cto proceed with the road widening ... thereby anticipatorily breaching its contract with appellee.\u201d As a result, appellee claimed $160,000 in damages plus, pursuant to the terms of its contract with appellee, \u201creasonable attorneys [sic] fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Following a bench trial, in rendering its findings, the circuit court stated that it did \u201cnot find the contract has any hidden conditions, any ambiguous terms, anything that would justify a change order as was requested by [appellant] in this case.\u201d The court also stated that it was \u201cconvinced\u201d that appellant was responsible for any delays in completing the Food Lion Store, that appellant had refused to proceed with the subcontract and that, consequently, appellant had anticipatorily breached its subcontract with appellant. Having found appellant in breach of the subcontract, the court granted judgment against appellant in the amount of $80,000. The court also found that the parties had previously stipulated to the fairness and reasonableness of attorney fees and, accordingly, awarded appellee $48,222 in attorney\u2019s fees, resulting in a total judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ment in favor of appellee and against appellant in the amount of $78,222.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Appellant filed an appeal to this court and we affirmed in part, but reversed the court\u2019s award of \u201cinterest carry\u201d damages and remanded the case, directing that damages be adjusted in a manner consistent with our opinion. Upon remand, on June 8, 2004, the court awarded appellee $14,700 in additional attorney\u2019s fees. The June 8, 2004 award was appealed and, in an unreported opinion dated November 16, 2005, we vacated the award, reversing that portion of the order dated June 4, 2004, which had awarded attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $14,700 and remanded for revision of the judgment in accordance with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">On November 30, 2005, Thomas Pank, President of appellant, forwarded a check in the amount of $53,746.86 to counsel for appellee. The letter accompanying the check stated: \u201cBelow is full payment for the judgment based on the Opinion recently received by me from the Maryland Court of Special Appeals.\u201d Appellant\u2019s check in the amount of $53,746.86 did not include post-judgment interest that appellee asserted that it was owed. Appellant\u2019s explanation for remitting its check in the amount of $53,746.86 was that, by doing so prior to the December 15, 2005 Mandate, the tender of its check prevented post-judgment interest from accruing. Appellee refused to accept the $53,746.86 check as payment in full and thereafter made written and verbal requests that appellant withdraw its conditional tender and provide confirmation that the $53,746.86 check was not tendered as \u201cpayment in full.\u201d When appellant failed to comply with appellee\u2019s request, the latter advised appellant that it would not accept appellant\u2019s tender of payment because, in its view, post-judgment interest automatically applies to all judgments regardless of whether post-judgment interest is specifically mentioned in the judgment and, under Maryland law, the post-judgment interest, <em>sub judice, </em>began to accrue on June 27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">On March 30, 2006, the trial court entered a final judgment in favor of appellee and against appellant in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>$53,746.86, in accordance with the mandate issued by this Court. That judgment included an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $48,222, which were presented in appellee\u2019s case-in-chief and awarded in the first judgment in June 2000. The March 30, 2006 judgment was entered on the court docket by the clerk on April 3, 2006. No amended complaint or post-judgment motions were filed by appellee pursuant to Maryland Rules 2-534 and 2-535 (Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment; The Trial Court\u2019s Revisory Power). On March 30, 2006, the trial judge, in accordance with our Mandate, entered a revised judgment in the amount of $53,746.86.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">On May 16, 2006, appellant filed a Plea of Tender requesting that appellee be required to accept the sum of $53,746.36 plus accrued interest of $8,010.42, which amount represented interest at the rate of ten percent per annum from June 4, 2004 until the date of appellant\u2019s tender of payment dated November 30, 2005. In response, appellee filed its Response to Plea of Tender and Motion for Award of Post-Judgment interest to collect the full amount of the judgment plus post-judgment interest from the original date of judgment. Additionally, in its Response to Plea of Tender and Motion for Award of Post-Judgment Interest, appellee sought attorney\u2019s fees in connection with appellee\u2019s attempts to collect the total amount due on the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Accordingly, the judgment became final and enrolled thirty days thereafter, on May 3, 2006. On May 31, 2006, appellee filed its Response to Plea of Tender and Motion for Award of Post-Judgment Interest, in which it opposed appellant\u2019s Plea of Tender, sought post-judgment interest dating back to the original June 2000 judgment and requested additional post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees. On December 22, 2006, appellee filed a Motion to Dismiss, Alternatively, for Summary Judgment with respect to its request for attorney fees, arguing that, contractually-based attorney\u2019s fees form part of the prevailing party\u2019s damages claim, which then merge into a final judgment, unlike attorney\u2019s fees awarded pursuant to statute, which are collateral in nature. After appellee opposed appellant\u2019s Motion, the parties, on May 6, 2008, appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>before the trial judge, who heard oral arguments and denied appellant\u2019s Motion. The court\u2019s verbal order was subsequently reduced to writing and filed on May 19,2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">On August 16, 2006, during a motions hearing on appellant\u2019s Plea of Tender and appellee\u2019s Response to Plea of Tender and Motion for Post-Judgment Interest, the trial judge, agreeing with appellee\u2019s position as to the accrual date for post-judgment interest, denied appellant\u2019s Plea of Tender and granted appellee\u2019s Motion for Post Judgment Interest, but reserved on the issue of appellee\u2019s request for additional attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with appellee\u2019s attempts to collect the full amount of the judgment plus post-judgment interest. On September 14, 2006, the court entered an Order reflecting the trial judge\u2019s ruling that appellant pay appellee the principal amount of $53,746.36 plus post-judgment interest at the rate of ten percent per annum from June 27, 2000, the original date of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Appellant appealed the post-judgment interest award to this Court; we dismissed the appeal as premature in an unreported opinion issued June 14, 2007, in light of the fact that the court had not ruled on appellee\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>AccuBid Excavation Inc. v. Kennedy Contractors, Inc., </em>No. 1573, September Term, 2006 (filed June 14, 2007) <em>(AccuBid III). </em>On June 3, 2008, the circuit court elicited testimony and heard oral argument on appellee\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. At the hearing, appellee\u2019s counsel identified the parties\u2019 subcontract as the legal basis in support of its request for attorney\u2019s fees. The following transpired at the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI1\">THE COURT: First as to the contract entered today as Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 6, there was no need for a witness on the stand, and actually Article 14, we\u2019re not going to take, we wouldn\u2019t take parole evidence on it or anything of that nature. It says what it says, and I read it to say that the contractor in this case, uh, [appellee] is entitled to reasonable attorneys [sic] fees as may be expended with respect to basically enforcing and collecting the judgment or anything for any breech [sic] of the contract and, therefore, I don\u2019t find any need for any person on the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>I do find that based upon both Mr. Clapp and Ms. McBride\u2019s testimony that the bills introduced are fair, reasonable and necessary for the prosecution of this case, particularly the, uh, part about post judgment interests, and that the fees incurred and the hourly rates expended by Mr. Miller and Ms. Peeples are fair and reasonable even when they increased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">The amount I find is proven for purposes of this is the 42,667.98 as found on Defendant\u2019s Exhibit Number 3, however, from that as conceded by the moving party here, uh, [appellee], you have to deduct the 127.82 and also from Defense Exhibit Number 1, the January 6 building [sic], billing, which I have of 916.50, the February billing, which I have as 133.50, the March 6 billing, which I have as 87.50, and the April 6 billing, which I have as 306.50 noting that there\u2019s a separate thing for a triple seal of order and that\u2019s completely different, and I\u2019m not even sure where that goes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">I have, therefore, if my math is correct, correct added those four numbers together, came up with attorneys [sic] fees of 1444 during that period, which I find are not appropriate to be awarded in this case. Not that the work wasn\u2019t done, not that it was not fair and reasonable, but I have trouble with that concept that those were fees incurred between the mandate and this Court, um, following the mandate entering the revised judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">Therefore today and, Mr. Miller, you\u2019re going to have to prepare the judgment on this or the order on this, because I don\u2019t really have it, I come up with a judgment for attorneys [sic] fees in favor of [appellee] and against [appellant] in the amount of the 41,296.16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">And, Mr. Miller, how long will it take you to have an order on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">MR. MILLER: Your Honor, I\u2019ll certainly with a courtesy, run that order by, uh, Counsel here, but certainly today or tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">THE COURT: Okay, and if not you\u2019ll be both back here Friday at 2:00, which is just a status conference and I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>it, I know you\u2019re going to want to appeal, and that\u2019s f\u00edne, I just say please don\u2019t appeal until it\u2019s final. Yes, sir, Mr. Stevens?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">MR. STEVENS: For clarity, Your Honor, um, are you directing Mr. Miller to prepare a new judgment or are you revising the judgment for attorney\u2019s fees that\u2019s already in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think there is any judgment for attorney\u2019s fees in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">MR. STEVENS: The, the underlying judgment in this case includes an award of 48,222.50?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">THE COURT: And you have the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">MR. MILLER: That\u2019s close enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">MR. STEVENS: For, for attorneys [sic] fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">THE COURT: I\u2019m confused, because I thought that underlying judgment in this case is only the 53,000, and that\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-12\">MR. MILLER: It is, which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-13\">MR. STEVENS: There\u2019s 48,000 of that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-14\">THE COURT: Is there 48,000 of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-15\">MR. STEVENS:\u2014for fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-16\">THE COURT: I didn\u2019t even\u201448.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-17\">MR.

The court\u2019s oral ruling was reduced to a written order dated June 4, 2008 and recorded on June 12, 2008. The court\u2019s ruling had previously been reserved by Order signed September 12, 2006 and docketed September 14, 2006, in the amount of $41,296.16. Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal was filed on June 27, 2008. The attorney\u2019s fees sought by appellee and awarded by the trial court were only those attorney\u2019s fees incurred from December, 2005 through June, 2008. Thus, the court awarded appellee $41,296.16 in additional attorney\u2019s fees, in a separate judgment. On June 27, 2008, appellant timely appealed the circuit court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Appellant initially contends that this Court\u2019s March 30, 2006 Order constituted a final judgment, adjudicating all controversies between the parties arising out of the subcontract. Because appellee failed to appeal or otherwise challenge this final judgment, maintains appellant, the March 30, 2006 Order \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d established the amount of the final judgment, \u201cwhich included $48,222 for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Summarizing its version of the procedural background, appellant relates in its brief to this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>There is no dispute that Judge Stepler\u2019s original June 2000 judgment awarded [appellee] damages under the subcontract for attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $48,222. Judge Dwyer later awarded, more expressly under the same subcontract, another $41,296.16. The later award is barred by this Court\u2019s March 30, 2006 Order of final judgment, which resolved all claims arising from the Subcontract, including attorney\u2019s fees. [Appellee\u2019s] subcontract damages merged into the Judgment. This Court, on any remand, did not provide for additional attorney\u2019s fees within its mandate governing any remand and no party sought to modify or amend this Court\u2019s March 30, 2006 Order of final judgment. Therefore, all claims arising out of the Subcontract were merged into the March 30,2006 Order of final judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Appellee, for its part, counters that appellant\u2019s failure to satisfy its obligations under the original judgment is the <em>sole </em>reason it continued to incur attorney\u2019s fees subsequent to the date of the original judgment. It was appellant that prolonged the final resolution of this case, insists appellee, by failing and refusing to pay the full amount of the judgment plus post-judgment interest at the legal rate from the date of the original judgment. Because appellant attempted to pay appellee less than what appellee was rightfully owed, appellee continues, it was forced to incur additional attorney\u2019s fees in its attempt to collect the full amount owed by appellant. In addition to appellant\u2019s refusal to pay post-judgment interest, according to appellee, these attorney\u2019s fees were incurred as a result of appellant\u2019s subsequent premature appeal of the circuit court\u2019s ruling on post-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In summarizing its position, appellee asserts that the award of attorney\u2019s fees is proper because it was forced by appellant to incur those fees when appellant refused to pay the full amount of the judgment owed. Because the attorney\u2019s fees incurred by it in conjunction with the collection of its judgment in no way relate to its damage claim on the merits and were not incurred as a part of prosecuting the merits of the underlying breach of contract action between appellee and appellant, posits appellee, the doctrine of merger does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>apply. But for appellant\u2019s challenge to appellee\u2019s claim for the post-judgment interest, which it believes it was rightfully owed from the date of the original judgment dated June 27, 2000, appellee never would have incurred the additional attorney\u2019s fees to enforce the terms of the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Finally, citing the \u201cexpress terms\u201d of the subcontract between the parties, appellee maintains that the subject fees clearly fall within the definition of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cas may be expended.\u201d The pertinent language of Article XIV of the subcontract provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">In the event of default by the Subcontractor under any of the terms and provisions hereof and should the Contractor employ an attorney <em>to enforce any provision hereof </em>or <em>to collect damages for breach of this Subcontract </em>or to recover on the bond referenced above, the Subcontractor and his surety shall pay to the Contractor such reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as may be expended with respect thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aq-dedup-0\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Like most jurisdictions in the United States, Maryland follows the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d on attorney\u2019s fees, according to which a party in a compensatory damages action may recover attorney\u2019s fees only if (1) permitted by statute or (2) provided for in a contract between the parties. <em>Hess Constr. Co. v. Bd. of Education of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>341 Md. 155, 160, 669 A.2d 1352 (1996); <em>Long v. Burson, </em>182 Md.App. 1, 25-26, 957 A.2d 173 (2008); <em>Chang v. Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>168 Md.App. 534, 551-52, 897 A.2d 854 (2006). If an exception to the rule does not apply, then \u201ceach party to a case is responsible for the fees of its own attorneys, regardless of the outcome.\u201d <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>403 Md. 443, 456, 942 A.2d 1242 (2008). Appellee\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees is based solely on the contractual provision excerpted <em>supra. </em>Appellee makes no claim that its request for attorney\u2019s fees is authorized by statute or other exception to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">As appellant points out, we have previously held in cases involving the recovery of <em>statutorily-permitted </em>or <em>rules-based </em>attorney\u2019s fees that the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees presents a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>matter collateral to or independent from the merits of the action. <em>See, e.g., Mullaney v. Aude, </em>126 Md.App. 639, 649-53, 730 A.2d 759 (1999); <em>Dent v. Simmons, </em>61 Md.App. 122, 129-30, 485 A.2d 270 (1985); <em>Maryland Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Crawford, </em>59 Md.App. 276, 303, 475 A.2d 494 (1984). On the other hand, attorney\u2019s fees recoverable pursuant to a <em>contract </em>are \u201c \u2018part of the damage\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>G-C P\u2019ship v. Schaefer, </em>358 Md. 485, 488, 749 A.2d 823 (2000) (quoting <em>Mattvidi Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. NationsBank of Virginia, </em>100 Md.App. 71, 78 n. 1, 639 A.2d 228 (1994)). In <em>G-C P\u2019ship, </em>a case involving issues of appealability, the Court of Appeals dismissed an appeal from a trial court\u2019s judgments as to contract damages filed <em>before </em>the court ruled on a claim for contractually-based attorney\u2019s fees, <em>id. </em>at 487-89, 749 A.2d 823, where the merits of the case involved a breach of a guaranty agreement and the request for fees was based on a provision for attorney\u2019s fees in that agreement obligating the guarantors to pay for \u201c \u2018all legal and other expenses paid or incurred in enforcing the Guaranty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 749 A.2d 823. In so holding, the Court of Appeals reversed our decision in that case, where we (1) cited to <em>Mattvidi Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, supra, </em>for the proposition that \u201c \u2018attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to a contractual provision are part of [the prevailing party\u2019s] damage claim,\u2019 \u201d but (2) nonetheless concluded that such fees could be awarded because the court could exercise discretion under Maryland Rule 8-602(e)(l)(C) to enter a final judgment on its own initiative. <em>G-C P\u2019ship, </em>385 Md. at 487-88, 869 A.2d 837. This holding, stated the Court of Appeals, was erroneous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">Rule 8-602(e)(l)(C) is not applicable to the circumstances of the instant matter. The circuit court did not have discretion to direct the entry of a final judgment pursuant to Rule 2-602(b) based on the summary judgment rulings made on June 19, 1998. This is because <em>the counsel fees that were awardable pursuant to the contract form part of the claim for breach of contract, </em>but they had not been determined when the 1998 appeal was noted. Rule 2-602(b) may not be used to certify as final only part of a claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 488, 869 A.2d 837 (citations omitted and emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Appellant asserts that, because appellee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees claim was contract-based, the doctrine of merger prevented appellee from seeking additional contract-based attorney\u2019s fees once final judgment was entered on appellee\u2019s breach of contract claim, which, according to appellant, occurred when the circuit court\u2019s March 30, 2006 order, following three successive appeals to this Court, was entered on April 3, 2006. This, according to appellant, distinguishes the case <em>sub judice </em>from those involving claims for attorney\u2019s fees authorized by statute, which are generally considered \u201ccollateral\u201d to the merits of the action. We agree with appellant\u2019s argument. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The rule of merger is defined by the Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 18 (1982) as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">When a valid and final personal judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">(1) The plaintiff cannot thereafter maintain an action on the original claim or any part thereof, although he [or she] may be able to maintain an action upon the judgment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">(2) In an action upon the judgment, the defendant cannot avail himself [or herself] of defenses he [or she] might have interposed, or did interpose, in the first action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Although we are unaware of any Maryland case addressing the specific factual and procedural scenario presented here, <em>i.e., </em>an entry of judgment on the merits of a breach of contract claim followed by a post-judgment request for attorney\u2019s fees based on provisions of the same contract,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Maryland\u2019s appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>late courts have recognized that, under the rule of merger, \u201ca simple contract is merged in a judgment or decree rendered upon it, and that all its powers to sustain rights and enforce liabilities terminated in the judgment or decree.... \u201d <em>Jackson v. Wilson, 76 </em>Md. 567, 571, 25 A. 980 (1893) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See also United Book Press v. Md.

In <em>Production Credit Assoc, of Madison v. Laufenberg, </em>143 Wis.2d 200, 420 N.W.2d 778, 779 (1988), a creditor claimed that it was entitled to post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees based on the provisions of its loan agreement with the debtors, which provided, in pertinent part, that the creditor was authorized to pay for certain expenses from the debtors\u2019 account, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">Except where and to the extent prohibited by applicable law, promptly pay or reimburse [the creditor] for all ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>penses, fees, and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred either before or after any default in connection with: this Agreement and the documents related to it, the perfection of [the creditor\u2019s] security interest or other lien in collateral, or incurred in connection with protecting or enforcing its rights with respect to collateral or foreclosing against the same as more fully detailed in any security agreements, mortgages, or other collateral documents given in accordance with Section 5.0 of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 779. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals observed that attorney\u2019s fees are only recoverable if \u201csuch liability arises from a specific statute or the contract of the parties,\u201d and, that, under the doctrine of merger, \u201cupon entry of judgment, the contract sued upon loses all of its vitality and ceases to bind the parties to its execution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The Court cited to Restatement (Second) Judgments \u00a7 18 and concluded that the creditor could not recover attorney\u2019s fees incurred after the entry of judgment on the loan agreement because, at that point, the creditor no longer had a contractual right to those fees. <em>Id. </em>at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Similarly, in <em>Caine &amp; Weiner v. Barker, </em>42 Wash.App. 835, 713 P.2d 1133, 1134 (1986), an action involving a suit on a promissory note to recover a money debt, the Washington Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">Claim preclusion, or res judicata, has two aspects. The first applies to a judgment for a defendant, barring the plaintiff from bringing another action on the same claim. Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 19 (1982). The second aspect is the rule of merger, which applies generally to a judgment for a plaintiff in an action to recover money. <em>Carothers v. Carothers, </em>260 Or. 99, 488 P.2d 1185 (1971). As a general rule, when a valid final judgment for the payment of money is rendered, the original claim is extinguished, and a new cause of action on the judgment is substituted for it. <em>Yergensen v. Ford, </em>16 Utah 2d 397, 402 P.2d 696, 697 (1965); 6 A. Corbin, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 1318 (1962); 15 S. Williston, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 1874 (3d ed.1972). Thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the plaintiff cannot maintain an action on the original claim or any part thereof. Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Thus, the <em>Caine &amp; Weiner </em>Court held that the plaintiff, suing to collect on a judgment entered upon a debtor\u2019s default on a promissory note, could not seek post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees where the defendant\u2019s liability as to such fees originated in the note. <em>Id. </em>at 1134, 1135. The obligation of the defendant under the note became an obligation on the judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 1135-36. <em>Accord Hatch v. T &amp; L Assocs., </em>319 N.J.Super. 644, 726 A.2d 308, 310 (1999)(\u201cWe are persuaded that there are sound policy reasons consistent with the philosophy of the American rule for not construing the typical attorney-fees provision as including post-judgment services. We think it plain that a contrary construction would have a substantial potential for abuse, for unduly burdening consumer and other commercial transactions, for indefinitely delaying finality, and for spawning a host of ancillary litigation. Consequently, unless the agreement is express as to the post-judgment obligation, we decline to construe it as imposing that obligation.\u201d); <em>see Chelios v. Kaye, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 75, 268 Cal.Rptr. 38, 40 (1990)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u201cWhen, as here, a lawsuit on a contractual claim has been reduced to a final, nonappealable judgment, all of the prior contractual rights are merged into and extinguished by the monetary judgment, and thereafter the prevailing party has only those rights as are set forth in the judgment itself. [\u00b6]... ] In short, the judgment extinguished all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>further contractual rights of the Chelioses, including the contractual attorneys [sic] fees clause.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Here, the March 30, 2006 order of the trial court, which was entered on April 3, 2006, ordered <em>total judgment </em>in the amount of $53,746.36\u2014an amount that reflected appellee\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees up through April 3, 2006. Appel-lee\u2019s request for additional, contract-based attorney\u2019s fees subsequent to this order was made only when it opposed appellant\u2019s Plea of Tender. Appellee did not request that the trial court revise its March 30, 2006 order; nor did appellee appeal that order. Appellee, rather, wishes us to resurrect its contractual right to attorney\u2019s fees, notwithstanding the entry of judgment on the merits of its breach of contract claim. We, however, decline to do so. We explain further.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Appellee asserts that the fees about which appellant complains are solely attributable to appellant\u2019s \u201cfailure to satisfy its obligations under the original judgment\u201d and were \u201conly incurred by [appellee] as a result of [appellant\u2019s] refusal to pay post-judgment interest and as a result of [appellant\u2019s] subsequent premature appeal of the [trial court\u2019s] ruling on post-judgment interest.\u201d Appellee, thus, concedes that the award of attorney\u2019s fees that is the subject of the instant appeal was, in essence, to cover what appellee deemed to be <em>post-judgment </em>fees. Nonetheless, appellee argues that the provision for attorney\u2019s fees in its subcontract is plain and unambiguous and \u201cdoes not limit the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees only to those attorney\u2019s fees incurred at trial.\u201d Rather, according to appel-lee, the provision contemplates appellant\u2019s liability for attorney\u2019s fees related to appellee\u2019s collection of post-judgment interest. Appellee stresses that this particular fact distinguishes this case from the merger scenarios addressed in <em>G.C. P\u2019ship </em>and <em>Mattvidi, supra. </em>According to appellee, \u201cthe attorney\u2019s fees incurred by [appellee] from December 2005 through June 2008 did not pertain to the merits of the underlying case between [appellee] and [appellant] but instead were collateral to that litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>To be sure, some of the cases to which we have cited recognize that, where expressly provided for in the agreement, the rights of a party to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to a contract incurred in a claim originating from a breach of that contract may extend beyond judgment, despite merger of the contract. <em>See Caine &amp; Weiner, </em>713 P.2d at 1135 (\u201c[W]here the original obligation provides for special rights or exemptions, in some circumstances these may be preserved and recognized despite merger.\u201d) (citing <em>Nelson v. Nelson, </em>91 Ariz. 215, 370 P.2d 952 (1962)); <em>see also Production Credit Assn. of Madison v. Laufenberg, </em>420 N.W.2d at 779 (\u201cIn the absence of an express agreement otherwise, the obligation of a debtor to pay the creditor\u2019s costs and fees of collection or foreclosure is merged in a judgment in favor of the creditor.\u201d). In construing the language of a contract, however, we rely on the objective law of contracts. Accordingly, we look, in the first instance, to the language of the contract which, if plain and unambiguous, leaves no room for construction. <em>See General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Daniels, </em>303 Md. 254, 261, 492 A.2d 1306 (1985). The plain language of the contract provision at issue held appellant liable should there be default <em>under any terms of the contract, </em>requiring appellee to hire an attorney to (1) enforce any provision <em>of the contract </em>or (2) collect damages for breach <em>of the contract. </em>The instrument giving life to appellee\u2019s ability to request attorney\u2019s fees, as an exception to the American rule establishing that parties normally incur the costs of litigation, was, by its express terms, the <em>contract, </em>which merged into the judgment. <em>See Hatch, </em>726 A.2d at 309 (\u201cThus, while we recognize that parties may include fee-shifting provisions in their agreements, a corollary of our commitment to the so-called American rule of litigants paying their own fees is that such agreements will be strictly construed.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The views of our sister jurisdictions in this regard are persuasive. On the other hand, the United Supreme Court case to which appellee cites, <em>Budinich v. Becton Dickinson and Co., </em>486 U.S. 196, 199, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 100 L.Ed.2d 178 (1988), is inapposite, for it dealt only with the narrow issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u201cwhether a decision on the merits [a case of a compensation claim of an employee removed to a federal district court based on diversity of citizenship] is a \u2018final decision\u2019 as a matter of federal law under [28 U.S.C] \u00a7 1291 when the recoverability or amount of attorney\u2019s fees for the litigation remains to be determined.\u201d <em>Budinich </em>did not involve a request for attorney\u2019s fees based on contractual provisions between the parties under the circumstances here present. <em>Cf. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Dynegy Marketing &amp; Trade, </em>415 F.3d 354 (4th Cir.2005) (holding, in a case involving the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that, notwithstanding <em>Budinich, </em>a party\u2019s claim for legal costs \u201cbased on a contractual provision that is not limited to expenses incurred during the underlying litigation is an element of damages to be proved at trial,\u201d such that a judgment leaving open a claim for such fees is not final under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We shall not further address the federal cases cited by appellant on the issue of the finality of a judgment, for purposes of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, where there are outstanding claims for attorney\u2019s fees based on a contract between the parties; they are legally and factually inapposite. <em>See Gleason v. Norwest Mortg., Inc., </em>243 F.3d 130, 137-38 (3rd Cir.2001); <em>Deus v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>15 F.3d 506, 520-23 (5th Cir.1994). We also find <em>Moorhead v. Dodd, </em>265 S.W.3d 201, 204 (Ky.2008), to be unpersuasive. There, the Supreme Court of Kentucky construed the language of a contractual provision for attorney\u2019s fees as substantively entitling a litigant to post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees. Here, as we have explained, we construe the language of the relevant contractual provision otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">We decline to announce a holding in this case that would be at odds with the American rule as to attorney\u2019s fees, our prior decisions establishing that a request for attorney\u2019s fees based on a contract provision is part of the damages claim under the contract and the well-settled principle that, absent express contractual language stating otherwise, the claims set forth in a contract merge at the time of judgment. Because the contract between the parties merged into the April 3, 2006 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>judgment, there is no basis for the June 12, 2008 award to appellee of attorney\u2019s fees incurred from April 3, 2006 through June 3, 2008 in the amount of $41,296.16. Accordingly, that order must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Appellant next assigns error to the trial court\u2019s award of post-judgment interest from the initial judgment date of June 27, 2000 because \u201cthe subsequent pleadings by [appellee] and rulings by the trial court on remand expressly considered additional evidence on the merits of [appellee\u2019s] breach of contract claims, and it was only through the trial court\u2019s March 30, 2006 entry of final judgment that all claims and disputes among all parties were finally and conclusively adjudicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Appellant posits that \u201c[appellee\u2019s] overt efforts to increase its damages against [appellant], coupled with approximately nine years of appeals, reversals, modifications, and remands all worked to prevent the first June 27, 2000 judgment from having the finality required for post-judgment interest to begin to accrue.\u201d Appellant further asserts that the gravamen of its appeal is \u201cthe fact that, after this Court\u2019s first remand in which it partially vacated the trial court\u2019s award, [appellee] filed a new pleading whereby it sought to present new evidence to increase its contractual claim for an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Appellant offers the following summary of its position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">When the history of [appellee\u2019s] repeated efforts to increase its judgment is viewed in light of the current posture of the case, it is clear that it was not until the trial court entered the March 30, 2006 final judgment, which was not appealed by any party, that all claims with respect to all parties arising out of the [appellee]/[appellant] Subcontract were finally and completely adjudicated. In fact, in the absence of any action by the trial court during the proceedings where a written order partially adjudicating the parties\u2019 claims was issued pursuant to Md. Rule 2-602(b), the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>existence of the March 30, 2006 final judgment is a necessary condition precedent to the trial court being able to rule on the question of when it contends post-judgment interest should be deemed to accrue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Appellee, rejoining that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding appellee\u2019s post-judgment interest from the original judgment date of June 27, 2000, refutes appellant\u2019s assertion that the finality of the original judgment obtained by appellee evaporated when, subsequent to this Court\u2019s first remand, appellee filed its request for additional attorney\u2019s fees. Appellee points out that Judge Woodward, in this Court\u2019s most recent opinion issued in this case (filed June 14, 2007), observed that neither of the two previous appeals and remands \u201caltered the original judicial determination of [appellant\u2019s] liability to [appellee] for breach of contract and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>AccuBid III, supra, </em>slip. op. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Appellee summarizes its position as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">This issue is not complicated. The original judgment as to liability obtained by [appellee] on June 27, 2000 has never been reversed, modified or vacated. Accordingly, since June 27, 2000 one thing in this case has been a constant: [appellant] breached its contract with [appellee], and as a result has been liable to [appellee] for damages suffered as a result thereof. The only modification made to the trial court\u2019s original judgment was a reduction of a portion of interest carry damages originally awarded by the trial court. A reduction of damages is not tantamount to a reversal or vacation of the original judgment. More importantly, [appellant] continues to ignore the fact that, at no time throughout the nine (9) year history of this case, [appellant\u2019s] liability to [appellee] has never been extinguished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Maryland Rule 2-604(b) provides that a money judgment shall \u201cbear interest at the rate prescribed by law from the date of entry.\u201d Thereafter, post-judgment interest continues to accrue at the legal rate of ten percent per annum until the money judgment and accrued interest are satisfied. <em>See </em>Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Code (2006 Repl.Vol., 2008 Supp.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. (C.J.), \u00a7 11-107(a). Maryland Rule 2-601(b) provides that the date of judgment is the date on which the clerk of the court prepares a written record of the judgment. <em>See Carpenter Realty Corp. v. Imbesi, </em>369 Md. 549, 558-59, 801 A.2d 1018 (2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u201c[W]hen determining the date of entry of judgment for purposes of postjudgment interest, we must evaluate the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, keeping the objective of the postjudgment interest rules in mind.\u201d <em>Mona v.

In <em>Carpenter, </em>369 Md. at 560, 801 A.2d 1018, the Court of Appeals assessed \u201cwhat constitutes the date of entry of a judgment where the first judgment in the action was reversed and remanded by the Court of Special Appeals, and subsequent judgments were entered on the record.\u201d The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">Both this Court and the Court of Special Appeals have the ability to dispose of an appeal by dismissing the action, affirming the judgment, vacating or reversing the judgment, modifying the judgment, remanding the action to a lower court for further consideration, or any combination thereof. See Md. Rule 8-604(a). Furthermore, Maryland Rule 8-604(e) states, \u201cin reversing or modifying a judgment in whole or in part, the Court may enter an appropriate judgment directly or may order the lower court to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>We have held that where our mandate specifically directs the entry of a judgment after remand, post-judgment interest on the award runs from the date of the issuance of the mandate. In the absence of a specific instruction from this Court to the trial court that the court must award post-judgment interest dating back to the entry of the original judgment, such an award should rest with the sound discretion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><em>Carpenter, </em>369 Md. at 560-61, 801 A.2d 1018 (internal citation and footnote omitted). <em>See also Cohn v. Freeman, </em>169 Md. App. 255, 270, 900 A.2d 283 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Thus, as in <em>Carpenter, </em>our first task is to determine the dates on which judgments were entered in this case. The trial court first entered a judgment against appellant on June 27, 2000, ordering that (1) judgment be entered in favor of appellee and Lionheart Limited Partnership on the complaint filed by appellant; (2) appellant\u2019s petition for a mechanic\u2019s lien be denied and (3) judgment be entered in favor of appellee on appellee\u2019s counterclaim against appellant in the amount of $30,000, plus $48,222 in attorney\u2019s fees, for a total amount of $78,222. Appellant appealed from the June 27, 2000 judgment and this Court, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and the $30,000 damages award, with the exception of one element of damages, identified as \u201cinterest carry\u201d damages, in the amount of $12,257.39. The mandate, issued on August 5, 2002, directed that the judgment of the circuit court be vacated in part and remanded \u201cfor damages to be <em>adjusted </em>in a manner consistent with this opinion.\u201d <em>See AccuBid I </em>(emphasis added). Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion in its reply brief, our decision had no bearing on the substance of the judgment that appellant was liable, generally, to appellee for breach of contract and contractually-based attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s general liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>in this case, thus, was conclusively determined as of the June 27, 2000 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">The trial court\u2019s June 4, 2004 order (entered on June 8, 2004), revised the judgment, as directed by our unreported opinion and added $14,700 in attorney\u2019s fees in favor of appellee, rendering total judgment in the amount of $74,132.46. Subsequent to this order, appellant appealed the award of additional attorney\u2019s fees on the grounds that (1) the circuit court lacked the authority to award such fees following remand and (2) the evidence was insufficient to support the award. We reversed the award of attorney\u2019s fees on November 16, 2005 on the grounds of insufficient evidence and did not address appellant\u2019s first argument. <em>See AccuBid II. </em>The remainder of the circuit court\u2019s June 8 Order remained intact. We remanded to the trial court \u201cfor revision of judgment in accordance with this opinion\u201d and ordered appellee to pay costs. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The Mandate in <em>AccuBid II </em>was issued on December 16, 2005. It did not alter the original judgment entered on June 27, 2000, with regard to appellant\u2019s liability for breach of contract damages and attorney\u2019s fees. Rather, it disallowed the award of <em>additional </em>attorney\u2019s fees based on evidence arising after the initial judgment. Thus, on March 30, 2006, the circuit court issued another order (entered on the docket on April 3, 2006), reducing the judgment amount by $14,700 and an additional $5,686.10 for costs, leaving a judgment in the amount of $53,746.36. That judgment was filed on April 3, 2006. On September 12, 2006, the circuit court issued an order establishing that post-judgment interest accrue from June 27, 2000, \u201cthe original date of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Under the circumstances of this case, we perceive no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision to award post-judgment interest dating back to the entry of the initial judgment. That June 27, 2000 judgment was a final judgment for purposes of appellate review. To be sure, post-judgment interest does not, by necessity, always begin to accrue \u201cwhenever a money judgment is entered and is final at the time of entry.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>365 Md. at 484, 781 A.2d 781. We recognize that \u201cRule 2\u2014604(b) must be applied to various situations in accordance with the purpose of post-judgment interest and the considerable case-law governing the running of post-judgment interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, as we have explained, the preceding appeals in this case did not alter the essence of that original judgment, which conclusively established appellant\u2019s liability for breach of contract damages and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We agree with appellee that the cases upon which appellant relies to argue otherwise are inapposite. <em>Cohn, </em>169 Md.App. at 257-58, 900 A.2d 283, involved a suit for a share of partnership profits. The trial court issued a money judgment in favor of the plaintiff and, upon the defendants\u2019 subsequent appeal, we remanded for purposes of rendering factual findings that could alter the trial court\u2019s conclusion as to the core liabilities in the case. <em>Id. </em>at 258, 900 A.2d 283. In other words, the trial court is allowed, upon making those findings, to determine that the defendants were not liable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>On remand, the circuit court rendered the required factual findings and resolved liabilities in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 258-59, 900 A.2d 283. That judgment was rendered on November 13, 2003. <em>Id. </em>at 259, 900 A.2d 283. The defendants appealed once again and we affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment, observing that the purpose of the remand was \u201cto give the defendants an opportunity to persuade the finder of fact\u201d on certain matters, which they failed to do. <em>Id. </em>at 259-60, 900 A.2d 283. After our affirmance, a dispute arose between the parties as to the date from which post-judgment interest should accrue. According to the defendants, November 14, 2003, represented the appropriate accrual date. <em>Id. </em>at 261, 900 A.2d 283. The plaintiff argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>that post-judgment interest should be calculated from January 14, 2000, the date of the court\u2019s original decision. <em>Id. </em>at 261, 900 A.2d 283. The circuit court, citing to <em>Carpenter Realty Corp., supra, </em>agreed with the defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 261, 900 A.2d 283. On appeal of that judgment, we affirmed, reviewing the mandates issued in that case and holding that the mandate issued after the first appeal vacated the initial judgment as to core liabilities. We also remanded for factual findings that could have an impact on the ultimate outcome of the case, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">In other words, the trial court\u2019s initial decision did not settle the dispute conclusively in appellant\u2019s favor because the decision was rendered on less than a complete factual analysis. To develop that factual basis, the findings of fact, on remand, were essential. Therefore, by vacating the judgment, it became void and appellee was not liable on the initial judgment entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 274, 900 A.2d 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Our affirmance in the second appeal left the court\u2019s November 13, 2003 judgment intact. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we concluded that post-judgment interest should accrue from the date of the circuit court\u2019s second judgment, or November 13, 2003. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, in this case, as this Court stated in the unreported opinion issued in <em>AccuBid III, supra, </em>slip op. at 1, the original judicial determination of appellant\u2019s liability to appel-lee for breach of contract and attorney\u2019s fees remained unaltered, notwithstanding two subsequent appeals and remands. Our decisions did not remand for purposes of reassessing liability; the outcome of the case, notwithstanding adjustments to the damages award, was established as of June 27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Similarly, in <em>Carpenter Realty Carp., </em>369 Md. at 553, 801 A.2d 1018, the circuit court, on April 10, 1995, (1) entered judgment for the personal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate for debt owed under a stock redemption agreement, in the amount of $57,447.67, and (2) concluded that the defendant/eounter-plaintiff had not established its right to set-off its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>liability. On appeal, we reversed that judgment as to the issue of a set-off and remanded for a rehearing, <em>id. </em>at 554, 801 A.2d 1018, after which the circuit court found against the estate and extinguished its complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 554-55, 801 A.2d 1018. On appeal from that second judgment, we affirmed this ruling by the circuit court. The Court of Appeals, however, reversed our affirmance, <em>id. </em>at 555-56, 801 A.2d 1018, and the case was remanded a second time for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 555-56, 801 A.2d 1018. The circuit court\u2019s judgment, issued subsequent to the second remand, did not include, <em>inter alia, </em>post-judgment interest, despite the estate\u2019s request for such. <em>Id. </em>at 556-57, 801 A.2d 1018. The estate appealed and we held that the estate was entitled to post-judgment interest from April 2005, the date of the original verdict in its favor. <em>Id. </em>at 558, 801 A.2d 1018. The Court of Appeals concluded that post-judgment interest should accrue from October 19, 2000, or the date on which the circuit court, upon second remand, issued its judgment, because the first judgment was nullified by our reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 801 A.2d 1018. The Court reviewed the mandates issued for each appeal in the case and concluded that our mandate after the first appeal \u201cdid not contain any language restricting the effect of the reversal so as to leave the original judgment in place,\u201d adding that \u201c[njeither [the Court of Appeals] mandate disposing of the appeal, nor the text of the opinion as a secondary source specified any intention to have post-judgment interest accrue from the date of the original judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562-63, 801 A.2d 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Appellant attempts to analogize <em>Carpenter Realty </em>to the facts of this case by arguing that, \u201c[a]s was the case in <em>Carpenter Realty, </em>additional factfinding occurred on remand and separate and distinct determinations of liability occurred, namely, the court entertained new evidence of [appellant\u2019s] liability for additional attorney\u2019s fees arising out of the contract.\u201d We disagree with appellant\u2019s argument. In <em>Carpenter Realty, </em>the court assessed the language of the relevant mandates and observed that, where ambiguous, one may look to the opinion and surrounding circumstances to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>intent of the court. <em>Id. </em>at 561-62, 801 A.2d 1018 (citing <em>Balducci v. Eberly, </em>304 Md. 664, 670, 500 A.2d 1042 (1985)). The <em>Carpenter </em>Court also observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">It has been held that the effect of a general and unqualified reversal of a judgment, order or decree is to nullify it completely and to leave the case standing as if such judgment, order or decree had never been rendered, except as restricted by the opinion of the appellate court.\u201d <em>Balducci, </em>304 Md. at 671 n. 8, 500 A.2d at 1046 n. 8. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion and mandate of August 6, 1996 which reversed the original judgment and remanded the case to the Circuit Court did not contain any language restricting the effect of the reversal so as to leave the original judgment in place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 562, 801 A.2d 1018 (quoting <em>Balducci, </em>304 Md. at 671 n. 8, 500 A.2d 1042).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">By contrast, here, the language of our December 16, 2005 Mandate indicated that the original judgment as to liability on the breach of contract and attorney\u2019s fees claim was to remain unaltered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">PORTION OF ORDER DATED JUNE 4, 2004 AWARDING ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES IN THE AMOUNT OF $14,700 REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY FOR REVISION OF JUDGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">As we have explained, this mandate did not extinguish the original judgment; rather, it disallowed a specific determination as to additional attorney\u2019s fees made subsequent to that original judgment that was not supported by additional evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Appellant also asserts that the fact that appellee filed a new pleading after the March 30, 2006 order requesting additional attorney\u2019s fees is \u201ccritical\u201d to resolving this issue, because it was \u201ctantamount to the filing of an amended complaint well after the conclusion of the original trial on all matters.\u201d The purpose of the statutory provisions for post-judgment interest, however, is to compensate the prevailing party for the loss of the use of monies represented by a judgment in its favor. Since June 27, 2000, appellee has been without the use of monies awarded as a result of appellant\u2019s liability for breach of contract\u2014liability that was never determined to be unsustained in successive appeals, notwithstanding adjustments to the amounts owed on that liability. That we determined appellee\u2019s attempt to seek <em>additional </em>attorney\u2019s fees to be unsuccessful for lack of sufficient evidence does not alter or extinguish that original judicial determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In light of the foregoing discussion, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment establishing the date of accrual for post-judgment interest as June 27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">ORDER OF CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY ESTABLISHING DATE OF ACCRUAL FOR</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>POST-JUDGMENT INTEREST AS JUNE 27, 2000 AFFIRMED; ORDER OF THAT COURT AWARDING ADDITIONAL ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES IN FAVOR OF APPEL-LEE IN THE AMOUNT OF $41,296.16 REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID ONE-HALF BY APPELLANT AND ONE-HALF BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\">. <em>See Accubid Excavation, Inc. v.

No such remedial statute is implicated here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\">. The <em>Jackson </em>Court added that \"... it is also recognized as one of the limitations of this doctrine of merger, that the original contract is not in all cases to be entirely ignored subsequent to the rendition of a judgment or decree.\" 76 Md. at 571, 25 A. 980 (citation omitted). <em>Jackson </em>dealt specifically with the authority of the trial court to look to the contract or note, notwithstanding its merger into the judgment, to determine the amounts owed on a contract or note, when a creditor sought review of the trial court\u2019s order distributing the proceeds of a sale of property. <em>Id. </em>at 570-71, 573-74, 25 A. 980. The matter we discuss here is distinguishable, as it involves a contract-based claim for attorney\u2019s fees, which, as we shall explain, merges with the contract into the judgment. Thus, having cited to the general principle announced therein to merger, we need not discuss the remainder of the <em>Jackson </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b257-6\">. In response to the <em>Chelios </em>decision, the California legislature later provided, by statute, a means by which judgment creditors could recover post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees under circumstances specified in the statute. <em>See Chinese Yellow Pages Co. v. Chinese Overseas Marketing Serv. Corp., </em>88 Cal.Rptr.3d 250, 261, 169 Cal.App.4th 1025 (2008). We are aware of no such statutory authorization in Maryland. It remains the case in California that, absent a statutory provision stating otherwise, post-judgment attorney's fees cannot be recovered where the basis for those fees is a contractual provision that has merged into the judgment. <em>See Jaffe v.

Appellant states in both its brief and reply brief that the basis for our reversal on the \"interest carry\u201d damages was our conclusion that appellant was not liable to Lionheart Limited Partnership for those damages. Thus, according to appellant, it was only at that point that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>final judgment could be rendered in this case, as it was only at that point, argues appellant, that all the claims by all of the parties were adjudicated. Appellant\u2019s argument may, to one unfamiliar with the proceedings in this case, obscure the nature of our holding in that opinion. We determined that the award to appellee (not Lionheart) of \"interest carry\u201d damages was improper because the damages claimed (1) related to a loan between Lionheart and a construction lender and (2) were never actually suffered by appellee. <em>See AccuBid I.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b269-10\">.

Group, Inc., </em>176 Md.App. 672, 934 A.2d 450 (2007), upon which appellee relies, is distinguishable from this case, in that it addressed determining the accrual date of post-judgment interest where a trial court enters a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and revises the judgment after the original jury verdict by reducing the amount of damages owed to the prevailing party. <em>See Mona, </em>176 Md.App. at 683-84, 727-28, 730, 934 A.2d 450. <em>Aronson &amp; Co. v. Fetridge, </em>181 Md.App. 650, 957 A.2d 125 (2008), cited to by appellee, similarly does not address the factual and procedural particularities of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AI2\">While general principles regarding the awarding of post-judgment interest discussed in those cases are applicable here, we view odr decision in <em>Great Coastal Express, Inc. v. Schruefer, </em>39 Md.App. 88, 93, 383 A.2d 74 (1978), to be more on point. On a second appeal in that case, we held that post-judgment interest accrued from the verdict that preceded the first appeal, because \"the verdicts in favor of plaintiffs below remained wholly undisturbed and unaffected by the technical requirement of our mandate [issued during the first appeal] that the judgments be \u2018vacated and [case] remanded for modification and entry of proper judgments in accordance with this opinion.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
