Appellant appealed his convictions, and he presents two issues for our review, which we have rephrased:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>1. Did the circuit court err in declining to give appellant\u2019s proposed jury instruction regarding the definition of \u201cabuse\u201d as it pertains to a fourth degree sexual assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">2. Was the evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions for sexual abuse of a minor and fourth degree sexual offense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">On January 30, 2007, the victim, age 14, and her 16-year-old brother, Christopher, visited their grandfather at his home. Appellant, the victim\u2019s 46-year-old uncle, was also present in the home, as was the victim\u2019s 20-year-old sister, Jessica, and another uncle, Daniel Watson.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The victim testified that, while she was in the kitchen with appellant and her sister Jessica, appellant \u201crepeatedly touched [her] chest.\u201d She told appellant to stop, but he did not stop. The victim was upset and scared, so she hit appellant on his chest, telling him again to stop and stating: \u201c \u2018How do you like it?\u2019 \u201d Appellant responded: \u201c \u2018Oooh, baby.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The victim left the kitchen and went to the computer room to use the computer. Appellant was there, using the computer and \u201clooking at porn on a My Space page.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>viewing \u201ca girl in a leather suit that was half naked, and he said, Tm going to whip you with a whip and put you in this suit.\u2019 \u201d That comment made the victim uncomfortable, so she left the computer room and went outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Appellant came outside, and he \u201cunexpectedly ... grabbed my private area.\u201d He touched her \u201cvagina area\u201d on the outside of her clothing. The victim testified that she did not want appellant to touch her there or on her breast. The victim told her sister what happened. Jessica instructed her to \u201c[g]o tell Danny.\u201d Danny directed the victim to \u201cstay away from [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The victim testified that, the weekend before, appellant stated to her: \u201c \u2018I\u2019m going to cut your breasts off and mount them on the wall.\u2019 \u201d She did not know why appellant said that.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Robert Lawrence LaPin, the victim\u2019s father and appellant\u2019s younger brother, testified that, on January 30, 2007, while at work, he spoke to his daughter on the phone, and she informed him that she was \u201ctouched inappropriately\u201d by appellant, who \u201cfondl[ed] her breasts and private parts.\u201d Robert informed his daughter that he would handle the situation once he arrived at the house. Robert \u201cwanted to hear both sides of the story\u201d because \u201cat that time [the victim] had a way of blowing things way out of proportion.\u201d Robert arrived at the house at approximately 6:00 p.m., and he was in the kitchen with the victim and appellant when appellant grabbed his daughter\u2019s breast and stated: \u201c \u2018Oooh, these are nice, I need to mount these on the wall.\u2019 \u201d Robert rebuked appellant, and appellant responded by threatening that Robert \u201ccould be put down\u201d if he \u201csaid or did anything about it.\u201d Robert removed the victim and his son from the house, and he called the police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Officer Steven Durity, a police officer with the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, responded to a call for an alleged assault. The victim stated that appellant \u201cgrabbed her breast and twisted it, twisting the nipple.\u201d After speaking with appellant and other family members, Officer Durity questioned the victim again to get all the details. At that time, the victim stated that they \u201cwere actually playing.\u201d The Officer summarized her statement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">She grabbed him, he grabbed her back. She grabbed him a second time, he grabbed her back the second time. At that point she stated that she didn\u2019t want to play, to stop, and then that\u2019s when he grabbed her following after that, and I suppose that\u2019s when she called the Police.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Officer Durity did not arrest appellant at the house \u201c[b]ased on the fact that the suspect [was] a known family member, and the discrepancies in the victim\u2019s statement.\u201d He forwarded the incident report to the Sex Crimes Unit to conduct an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Detective John Greever, the investigating officer, testified that he interviewed several people at the police station the night of the incident, including the victim, her father, her sister, and appellant. The victim\u2019s \u201ceyes were puffy, she was crying, she was very upset.\u201d She informed Detective Greever that appellant \u201cgrabbed her on the breast and twisted her breast area on the nipple area, and he grabbed her on her private part between her legs.\u201d The victim stated that her sister was in the kitchen when appellant grabbed her breasts. The victim\u2019s brother, Christopher, did not give a statement, maintaining that \u201che did not see anything.\u201d A couple of days later, however, Christopher came to the police station to make a statement regarding the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Appellant\u2019s step-brother, Daniel, testified that on the day of the incident, he was living at his father\u2019s house with appellant and Jessica LaPin, the victim\u2019s sister. He did not see any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u201cexchange\u201d between appellant and the victim, but he heard appellant tell the victim to \u201cleave him alone\u201d as she followed him from the kitchen into the computer room. Daniel also testified that both the victim\u2019s father and appellant called the police, and Daniel drove appellant to the police station later that night to give a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Jessica, the victim\u2019s older sister, testified that she was in the kitchen with the victim and appellant on the date in question. She testified that, while appellant was making soup, the victim grabbed his \u201cballs and breasts.\u201d Appellant told the victim to stop, but the victim refused. Appellant responded by stating: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to cut your titties off and mount them on the wall.\u201d The victim \u201crepeatedly kept doing it over and over again.\u201d Appellant left the kitchen and went to the computer room to use the computer. The victim followed him into the room. While appellant was on the phone with a woman named Karen, he commented on pictures that she had posted on the website MySpace and stated: \u201cI would like to put that in leather and use whips, chains on her.\u201d The victim mistakenly believed that appellant directed those comments at her, when \u201che was really talking to Karen.\u201d Jessica testified that appellant \u201cnever touched [the victim] at all.\u201d Jessica acknowledged that she does not get along with her sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Christopher, the victim\u2019s older brother, testified that he did not make a statement to the police on January 30, 2007, because the Detective did not ask him if he wanted to make a statement. Christopher testified that the appellant and the victim were \u201cplaying around\u201d in the kitchen, \u201cpinching each other and laughing about it.\u201d After the victim followed appellant into the computer room, she \u201cstarted touching him and grabbing him,\u201d and she ignored appellant\u2019s requests to stop. Christopher testified that appellant\u2019s statement regarding cutting off the victim\u2019s breasts and mounting them on the wall came after the victim refused to stop pinching appellant. The victim responded to this statement by laughing. Christopher told the police that he saw appellant grab the 'victim\u2019s breast, but when the victim told him, Jessica, and Danny that appellant touched her, he said that \u201cit didn\u2019t happen,\u201d advising that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>he was \u201cright there following her the whole time so she would leave [appellant] alone.\u201d Christopher acknowledged feeling sorry for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Appellant testified in his own defense. He acknowledged that he touched the victim\u2019s breast and that he \u201cmay have\u201d touched the victim between her legs on the outside of her clothing. He denied, however, that he touched the victim for purposes of sexual gratification, sexual arousal, or to physically harm her. He testified that it was \u201cfun and games at first,\u201d which began when he was in the kitchen making soup, the victim pinched him, and he responded by pinching her back. According to appellant, the victim continued to pinch him, and she refused to leave him alone. Appellant smoked a cigarette outside and then went into the computer room and closed the door behind him. He logged onto MySpace and received a phone call from \u201ca girl [he] met online on My Space.\u201d The victim entered the room and placed an old shoe in his face. Appellant became angry and the victim \u201cproceeded to pinch [appellant] again and punch [appellant] in [his] private areas.\u201d Appellant then left the house and took his dog for a walk. Upon returning, the victim informed appellant that \u201c[m]y dad is going to whip your ass when he comes here.\u201d Appellant attempted to go to his bedroom, but the victim pinched him again, and he responded by stating: \u201c[I]f you\u2019re not going to stop, I\u2019m going to take your boobs and mount them [ ] on the wall and see ... how you like other people to pinch you.... \u201d According to appellant, the victim then grabbed his \u201cprivate area.\u201d He testified that when her father subsequently called 9-1-1, he also called 9-1-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">At the end of the State\u2019s case, appellant moved for judgment of acquittal on the charge of third degree sexual offense. The State agreed to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>with respect to that count. The circuit court then denied appellant\u2019s motion with respect to the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">At the close of all the evidence, appellant again moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing that the motion should be granted with respect to the charges of sexual abuse of a minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>and fourth degree sex offense because \u201c[t]here hasn\u2019t been a sufficient showing that the touching or grabbing ... was for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.\u201d Appellant further argued that there was \u201cnot a sufficient showing that [appellant] intended any physical harm to\u201d the victim. The circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Prior to the court instructing the jury, defense counsel requested that the court include in its instructions a definition of the term \u201cabuse\u201d with respect to the charge of fourth degree sexual offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defense counsel requested that the court define \u201cabuse\u201d as a \u201cphysical attack intended to inflict sexual injury.\u201d Appellant argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">[T]he Dillsworth case<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> is the case that defines what constitutes abuse for purposes of sexual contact. The point is this. If a person commits an act for sexual gratification or arousal, sexual arousal, you have that element. That element is met. However, if the intention isn\u2019t for sexual arousal, this is in the disjunctive, if it\u2019s not for sexual arousal or for gratification, then you turn to abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">Now, if you want to have some generic big all encompassing term of abuse, which the State is advocating for, it is completely contrary to the case law. I cited Dillsworth. If it\u2019s going to be\u2014if the intention was not for sexual arousal, if it was not for sexual gratification, then it has to be for abuse. And in fact, yes, the abuse has to be with the intent to cause physical injury.... In other words, if it isn\u2019t for sexual gratification or for sexual arousal, there has to be an intent to cause physical injury. And that\u2019s what the case law says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>What the State wants you to do is to go contrary to the case law that limits the definition of abuse. And that\u2019s what I ask the Court to do today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The State objected to this instruction on the ground that it was misleading in that it suggested that physical injury was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">After considering counsels\u2019 arguments, the circuit court rejected appellant\u2019s proposed definition of abuse, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">Well, I guess my problem with it is that the <em>[Dillsworth] </em>case is so closely tied to the specific facts of that case that this statement, while I agree that it can be a means of defining abuse, it doesn\u2019t have to be. And, so, I could say that abuse can mean that if the jury were to define it that way, but they\u2019re not required to. I don\u2019t think that the facts of this case control in the same manner in which the <em>Dillsworth </em>case. In that case, the Defendant specifically pulled at the woman\u2019s vaginal area causing lacerations, and so there was no intent to have sexual arousal or gratification, but the intent which he clearly stated to the victim at that time was to pull her vagina out, or some words to that effect. And the Court in that case said that the sexual injury, even though there was no sexual arousal or gratification, was sufficient to find, and in that case it was a third degree sex offense not a fourth degree sex offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">Well, I\u2019m going to not include it because I really believe the facts in this case have not really brought to bear the need for an instruction relating to sexual injury. As I said, the <em>Dillsworth </em>case was so specifically tied to the defendant\u2019s statements as to what he was going to do, and then his actual actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">The circuit court instructed the jury on the charges of sexual abuse of a minor and fourth degree sex offense as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>[T]he Defendant is charged with sexual child abuse. Child abuse is sexual molestation or exploitation of a child under 18, in this case caused by a family member. In order to convict the Defendant of child abuse, the State must prove: One, that the Defendant was a family member; two, that the victim was, at the time, under 18 years of age; and, three, that the Defendant sexually molested or exploited the victim by a fourth degree sex offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">Now, okay, so let me tell you what fourth degree sex offense means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">The Defendant is charged with the crime of fourth degree sex offense. In order to convict the Defendant of fourth degree sex offense, the State must prove: That the Defendant had sexual contact with the victim; and that the sexual contact was made against the will and without the consent of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">Now, sexual contact means the intentional touching of the victim\u2019s genital, anal or other intimate parts for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or for the abuse of either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">At the conclusion of the instructions, defense counsel objected to the instruction on the fourth degree sex offense. Counsel took exception to the court\u2019s failure to include the language he requested regarding the definition of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The jury convicted appellant of one count of sexual abuse of a minor, one count of second degree assault, and one count of fourth degree sexual offense. On November 9, 2007, the circuit court imposed sentence. On the conviction for sexual abuse of a minor, the court imposed a sentence of ten years, with all but three years suspended. On the conviction for fourth degree sexual offense, the court imposed a one year concurrent sentence. The second degree assault count conviction merged into the fourth degree sexual offense conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that the circuit court erred in its instructions to the jury on the charge of fourth degree sexual offense. Maryland Code (2002), \u00a7 3-308 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d), defines a sexual offense in the fourth degree as, among other things, \u201csexual contact with another without the consent of the other.\u201d Section 3\u2014301(f) defines \u201c[sjexual contact\u201d as \u201can intentional touching of the victim\u2019s or actor\u2019s genital, anal, or other intimate area for sexual arousal or gratification, <em>or for the abuse of either party.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Appellant argues that the court erred in denying his requested jury instruction, which defined \u201cabuse\u201d as \u201ca physical attack intended to inflict sexual injury.\u201d Appellant argues that this definition of abuse is consistent with this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Dillsworth v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 263, 269, 503 A.2d 734 (1986), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>308 Md. 354, 519 A.2d 1269 (1987), and that the meaning of the term abuse \u201cwas critical to [his] theory of the case.\u201d Appellant contends that the instructions deprived him of a fair trial because the term \u201cabuse\u201d for purposes of a fourth degree sex offense is narrower than sexual abuse for purposes of the offense of sexual abuse of a minor, and the failure to clarify the terms was misleading and confusing to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">The State argues that the circuit court properly denied appellant\u2019s requested jury instruction because appellant\u2019s proposed instruction was an incorrect statement of the law. It argues that the term abuse, as contemplated by the statute, is not limited to the sole definition proposed by appellant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides that \u201c[t]he court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding.\u201d As the Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">Rule 4-325(c) has been interpreted consistently as requiring the giving of a requested instruction when the following three-part test has been met: (1) the instruction is a correct statement of law; (2) the instruction is applicable to the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aoe-dedup-0\"><em>Dickey v. State, </em>404 Md. 187, 197-98, 946 A.2d 444 (2008). <em>Accord Tucker v. State, </em>407 Md. 368, 379-80, 965 A.2d 900 (2009). \u201cIn general, a party is entitled to have his theory of the case presented to the jury through a requested instruction provided that theory is a correct exposition of the law and it is supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Martin v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 510, 521-22, 922 A.2d 598 (2007) (citing <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 512, 495 A.2d 1 (1985)). As the State points out, however, the court \u201cis under no obligation to give an instruction containing an incorrect statement of the law to the jury.\u201d <em>Riggins v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 181, 223, 843 A.2d 115, <em>cert. denied, </em>381 Md. 676, 851 A.2d 595 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Thus, we must determine whether appellant\u2019s proposed instruction was a correct statement of the law. As indicated, appellant contends that it is, citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dillsworth. </em>The State, however, argues that the statutory term \u201cabuse\u201d should be given its \u201cordinary and usual meaning.\u201d Citing to several dictionary definitions, the State argues that \u201cabuse\u201d is not limited to physical injury, but rather, it \u201ccan be psychological, social, or physical in nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In determining the meaning of the term \u201cfor the abuse of a party,\u201d we turn to well settled principles of statutory interpretation. \u201c \u2018The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>tory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tribbitt v. State, </em>403 Md. 638, 645-46, 943 A.2d 1260 (quoting <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 613, 937 A.2d 242 (2007)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 132, 172 L.Ed.2d 38 (2008). \u201cIf the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends.\u201d <em>Ray v. State, </em>410 Md. 384, 405, 978 A.2d 736 (2009) (filed Aug. 27, 2009) (citing <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 173, 935 A.2d 699 (2007)). \u201cIf, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we endeav- or to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405, 978 A.2d 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">This Court addressed the meaning of the term \u201cabuse\u201d in <em>Dillsworth, </em>66 Md.App. at 269, 503 A.2d 734. In that case, Dillsworth attacked his girlfriend, saying that he would \u201crip [her vagina] out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 503 A.2d 734. Dillsworth \u201cput his hand inside [her] and started to pull and tear,\u201d resulting in a \u201csix centimeter-long, one centimeter-deep laceration inside [the victim\u2019s] vagina.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dillsworth argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for third degree sex offense. Specifically, he argued that there was insufficient evidence that his actions constituted \u201csexual contact\u201d because there was no evidence that the act was for the purpose of \u201csexual arousal or gratification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268, 503 A.2d 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">This Court held that the term \u201csexual contact\u201d included a wrongful touching for three purposes: sexual arousal, sexual gratification, or \u201cfor abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 503 A.2d 734. The Court noted that the three purposes were listed in the disjunctive, and therefore, it rejected the argument that a conviction could not be upheld if the touching was not for sexual arousal or gratification. <em>Id. </em>at 270-71, 503 A.2d 734. Rather, pursuant to the statute, a touching \u201cfor the abuse\u201d of a party would constitute sexual contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>In addressing the meaning of the term \u201cabuse,\u201d this Court noted that other courts had construed the term \u201cabuse,\u201d as it related to sex offenses, as \u201ca wrongful or defiling sexual touching.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 503 A.2d 734. The Court characterized these other jurisdictions as rejecting a definition of \u201cabuse\u201d to include a mere physical injury. <em>Id. </em>The Court declined to adopt that definition, and it held that the term \u201cabuse,\u201d in the context of a sexual offense, encompassed a physical attack intended to inflict sexual injury. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 503 A.2d 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><em>Dillsworth </em>did not hold, as appellant argues, that the term \u201cabuse\u201d was limited to a touching intended to cause physical injury. Rather, it addressed the term as it applied to the facts of that case. This Court, in <em>Dillsworth, </em>did not attempt to define the scope of the term \u201cabuse.\u201d We will do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In determining the meaning of the word \u201cabuse\u201d for a fourth degree sex offense, we look first at the dictionary definition of the word for \u201cinsight as to the legislative intent.\u201d <em>See Stachowski v. Sysco Food Servs. of Balt., Inc., </em>402 Md. 506, 525, 937 A.2d 195 (2007). Although \u201c[dictionary definitions are not dispositive as to the meaning of statutory terms,\u201d \u201csuch definitions provide a useful starting point for discerning what the legislature could have meant in using a particular term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 2A Norman I. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.28 (7th ed.2007)); <em>Marriott Empls Fed. Cr. Union v. MVA, </em>346 Md. 437, 447, 697 A.2d 455 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Dictionary definitions of abuse are not limited to abuse involving physical injury. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 10 (8th ed.2004) (defining \u201cabuse\u201d as \u201c[pjhysical or mental maltreatment, often resulting in mental, emotional, sexual, or physical injury.\u201d); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged 8 (2002) (defining \u201cabuse\u201d as \u201cto use or treat so as to injure, hurt, or damage\u201d); I The Oxford English Dictionary 59 (2nd ed.1989) (defining \u201cabuse\u201d as \u201c[t]o ill-use or maltreat; to injure, wrong, or hurt\u201d or \u201cviolate, ravish, defile\u201d); The Random House Dictionary OF The English Language, Unabridged 9 (2nd ed.1987) (defining \u201cabuse\u201d as \u201cto treat in a harmful, injurious, or offensive way\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>The plain language of the words used by the General Assembly do not support appellant\u2019s argument that the term \u201cabuse\u201d in the statute is limited to physical injury. Rather, the plain language of the statute supports the conclusion that the term \u201cabuse\u201d includes a touching for the purpose of physical, mental, emotional, or sexual injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Because there is some ambiguity in the term, however, we look to the legislative history regarding the definition of \u201csexual contact.\u201d In 1976, the General Assembly enacted a \u201ccomprehensive legislative package\u201d \u201cto reform and codify this State\u2019s rape and sexual offense laws.\u201d <em>State v. Boozer, </em>304 Md. 98, 102, 497 A.2d 1129 (1985). This legislation resulted in a range of sexual crimes: two degrees of rape and four degrees of sexual offenses. <em>Lane v. State, </em>348 Md. 272, 286, 703 A.2d 180 (1997). One purpose of the legislation was \u201cto provide viable criminal sanctions for those transgressions falling within the gap ... existing between the common law misdemeanor of assault and the felony of rape which is punishable by life imprisonment.\u201d Sen. Rep. on S.B. 358, at 1, Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (Undated); 1976 Md. Laws, Chap. 573; <em>see generally </em>J. William Pitcher, <em>Rape and Other Sexual Offense Law Reform in Maryland, 1976-1977, </em>7 U. Balt. L.Rev. 151-70 (1977). The legislation was intended to delineate \u201cdegrees of sexual offenses according to factors which logically reflect the probable severity of traumatic impact of the experience on the victim,\u201d and equates the \u201clikely psychic injury of a victim\u201d with the punishment of the aggressor. Sen. Rep. on S.B. 358, at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">As part of this 1976 legislation, the General Assembly added the definition of \u201csexual contact\u201d for the new offenses of third and fourth degree sexual offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201cSexual contact\u201d as used in [the third degree sexual offense statute] and [the fourth degree sexual offense statute], means the intentional touching of any part of the victim\u2019s or actor\u2019s anal or genital areas or other intimate parts for the purposes of sexual arousal or gratification or for abuse of either party____It does not include acts commonly expres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>sive of familial or friendly affection, or acts for accepted medical purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Maryland Code (1976 Repl.Vol., 1977 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27 \u00a7 461(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The parties have not cited to any legislative history relating to the definition of the term \u201cabuse,\u201d and we did not find any. We did find some discussion regarding the purpose of adding sexual offenses in a January 1976 report from the Governor\u2019s Commission to Study Implementation of the Equal Right\u2019s Amendment, which discussed issues in rape legislation. This report presented the question: \u201cWhy create Third Degree Sexual Offense when unpermitted touchings of the anal or oral area of another person are presently prosecuted as the common law crimes of assault and battery.\u201d <em>Rape Law Reform in Maryland, </em>at 6 (January 1976), <em>in </em>Governor\u2019s Commission to Study Implementation of the Era: Issues In Rape Legislation 1975-1976. The Committee explained that, although assault, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cany placing of another in fear of injury with the actor\u2019s apparent ability to inflict injury,\u201d and battery, <em>ie., </em>\u201cunpermit-ted touching,\u201d were already criminalized in Maryland, this legislation would recognize a distinction between \u201csexually oriented acts\u201d and \u201cnon-sexually oriented acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">[S]ome sex offenders will have arrest and conviction records for assault and battery and the police will overlook them as suspects in sex offense cases. The Boston Strangler, for instance, was convicted in Connecticut for numerous unper-mitted touchings of women where his modus operandi was similar to that which he used in Boston; but in Boston he raped and murdered his victims whereas in Connecticut he only fondled them after gaining access to their apartments. Had the police kept records which indicated the sexual aspects of his crime, the Boston Strangler would have been checked out as a suspect in the multi-state alarm sent out by the Boston police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, the legislation criminalizing sexual offenses was interpreted as criminalizing an unpermitted touching that was sexually based.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>There is nothing to suggest that the General Assembly intended that the term \u201cabuse,\u201d as used in the definition of \u201csexual contact,\u201d be limited to circumstances involving \u201ca physical attack intended to inflict sexual injury.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We hold that, in light of the plain language of the statute and the legislative history, a touching for the purpose of \u201cabuse\u201d refers to a wrongful touching, a touching of another person\u2019s intimate area for a purpose that is harmful, injurious or offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Appellant argues that the term abuse should not be so construed for two reasons. Initially he argues that a broad construction of the term \u201cabuse\u201d renders the term superfluous; it \u201cequate[s] abuse with any contact of a sexual organ or part of the body.\u201d That argument is without merit. The definition of abuse adopted today does not criminalize any touching; it requires a sexually oriented touching committed for the purpose of inflicting harm on another, physical or otherwise. Indeed, the statute makes clear that not all touchings constitute \u201csexual contact\u201d; the statute specifically excludes \u201ca common expression of familial or friendly affection\u201d or \u201can act for an accepted medical purpose.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3-301(f)(3)(i)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Appellant further contends that a broad construction of the term abuse, in the context of sexual contact, conflicts with prior decisions holding that the crime of sexual child abuse is broader than a sexual offense. <em>See Cooksey v. State, </em>359 Md. 1, 24, 752 A.2d 606 (2000) (\u201ca charge of sexual child abuse may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>be sustained on evidence that would not support a conviction under the sexual offense ... laws\u201d); <em>Tate v. State, </em>182 Md. App. 114, 124, 957 A.2d 640 (\u201cSexual child abuse is a broader crime than a fourth degree sexual offense.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 Md. 747, 962 A.2d 373 (2008). Our decision today does not conflict with those cases. As Judge Moylan explained in <em>Tate, </em>182 Md.App. at 126, 128, 957 A.2d 640, a fourth degree sexual offense requires a \u201ctouching,\u201d of an \u201cintimate area,\u201d \u201cwithout the consent of the other,\u201d and with \u201ca very particularized specific intent.\u201d <em>See </em>C.L. \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014301(1*), 308. Sexual abuse of a minor, by contrast, involves \u201csexual molestation or exploitation of a minor,\u201d statutory language that encompasses a wider variety of conduct, with \u201cno comparable mental requisite.\u201d <em>Tate, </em>182 Md.App. at 126, 128, 957 A.2d 640. <em>See Brackins v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 157, 162, 578 A.2d 300 (1990) (evidence sufficient to support conviction of sexual child abuse when Brackins \u201c \u2018exploited\u2019 \u201d twelve-year-old victim by partially disrobing her for his own gratification or interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Thus, even with our interpretation of the term \u201cabuse,\u201d in the context of sexual contact, sexual child abuse remains a broader crime than a fourth degree sexual offense, and our decision is not inconsistent with the above cases. It is consistent, however, with the plain language of the statute and the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Appellant\u2019s proposed jury instruction, that \u201cabuse\u201d means a physical attack with the intent to inflict sexual injury, was not a correct statement of law. His proposed definition of \u201cabuse\u201d was too narrow. Accordingly, the circuit court properly declined to give the requested instruction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Appellant next argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. With respect to his conviction of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>fourth degree sexual offense, we previously have explained that C.L. \u00a7 3-308 prohibits \u201csexual contact with another without consent of the other.\u201d \u201cSexual contact\u201d is defined as \u201can intentional touching of the victim\u2019s or actor\u2019s genital, anal, or other intimate area for sexual arousal or gratification, or for the abuse of either party.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3\u2014301(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Appellant does not contest that, pursuant to the statute, he touched the victim in an intimate area. Rather, he contends that there was insufficient evidence to show that he touched the victim for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, or \u201c \u2018for the abuse of either party' or to inflict sexual injury.\u201d Accordingly, he argues, the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for fourth degree sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Appellant further argues that, although conviction of a fourth degree sexual offense is not, as a general rule, a prerequisite to a conviction for the crime of sexual abuse of a minor, <em>see Tribbitt v. State, </em>403 Md. 638, 652, 943 A.2d 1260, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 132, 172 L.Ed.2d 38 (2008), it was a prerequisite in this case because the judge instructed the jury that it could find him guilty of the crime of sexual abuse of a minor only if it found that he \u201csexually molested or exploited the victim by a fourth degree sex offense.\u201d Thus, appellant argues, if the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for a fourth degree sexual offense, his conviction for sexual abuse of a minor should also be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The State, on the other hand, argues that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for a fourth degree sexual offense. Accordingly, it argues that all of appellant\u2019s convictions should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">We review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). <em>Accord McKenzie v. State, </em>407 Md. 120, 136, 962 A.2d 998 (2008). In conducting this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>review, \u201c[w]e give due regard to the jury\u2019s finding of facts and its responsibility to weigh and resolve conflicting evidence, draw reasonable inferences from the evidence, and determine witness credibility.\u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 138, 156, 957 A.2d 654 (2008). \u201cWe do not measure the weight of the evidence; rather, our concern is only whether the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence, direct or circumstantial, which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Taylor v. State, </em>346 Md. 452, 457, 697 A.2d 462 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Here, there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction for fourth degree sexual offense. Although appellant testified that he did not touch the victim for sexual arousal or gratification, or to harm her, the jury was free to disbelieve his testimony. <em>See Walker v. Grow, </em>170 Md.App. 255, 275, 907 A.2d 255 (2006) (\u201c \u2018The trier of fact may believe or disbelieve, accredit or disregard, any evidence introduced.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Great Coastal Express, Inc. v. Schruefer, </em>34 Md.App. 706, 725, 369 A.2d 118 (1977)), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 Md. 13, 912 A.2d 649 (2006). \u201c \u2018[Sjince intent is subjective and, without the cooperation of the accused, cannot be directly and objectively proven, its presence must be shown by established facts which permit a proper inference of its existence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ford v. State, </em>330 Md. 682, 703, 625 A.2d 984 (1993) (quoting <em>Davis v. State, </em>204 Md. 44, 51, 102 A.2d 816 (1954)). In <em>Holloway v. State, </em>312 Ark. 306, 849 S.W.2d 473, 476 (1993), the Supreme Court of Arkansas held that a jury properly could infer that the touching of a girl\u2019s breasts was for the purpose of sexual gratification without specific proof that it was so motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Here, there were sufficient facts for the jury to infer that appellant touched the victim on the breast and between her legs for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse. In addition to appellant\u2019s actions in repeatedly touching the victim\u2019s breasts and \u201ctwist[ing] her breast area on the nipple area,\u201d despite her requests to stop, appellant made several statements indicating that the touching was made for a purpose proscribed by the statute. When the victim hit appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>after he would not stop touching her chest and asked how he liked it, appellant responded: \u201cOoooh baby.\u201d At another point, appellant stated: \u201c \u2018Oooh, these [the victim\u2019s breasts] are nice, I need to mount these on the wall.\u2019 \u201d And when appellant was in the computer room looking at what the victim testified was a half-naked woman in a leather suit, he said: \u201c \u2018I\u2019m going to whip you with a whip and put you in this suit.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">These statements, in conjunction with appellant\u2019s repeated touching of the victim, were sufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant touched the victim for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, or for abuse. There was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-13\">.
