FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AGx\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Appellant moved to suppress the narcotics recovered from him on February 25, 2007. The court held an evidentiary hearing prior to trial, at which the following evidence was adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Baltimore City Police Detective Eric L. Green was on duty shortly after midnight on February 25, 2007. A seven-year veteran of the Western District Operations Unit, he focused \u201cmainly ... on weapons and narcotics.\u201d Detective Green had received specialized training in the packaging of street-level distribution of controlled dangerous substances (\u201cCDS\u201d), including 40 hours at the police academy and another 110 hours through the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Agency, as well as yearly in-service training. In addition, he had observed \u201cthousands and thousands of street level distribution methods,\u201d and had made over 5,000 arrests of people suspected of illegal drug activity. On this basis, he was accepted as an expert regarding the sale, identification, and distribution of illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Green testified that, on the night in question, he monitored a closed circuit, split-screen television from a room at the Western District precinct. The television produced images from two pole cameras mounted for such purpose. One camera produced images of the 2300 block of Druid Hill Avenue, and the other produced images of the 1100 block of Whitelock Avenue. According to Green, \u201cWhitelock runs east and westbound. Druid Hill runs north and southbound with a southbound flow of traffic.\u201d Green described the area as \u201can open-air drug market,\u201d noting that \u201cdrugs are often sold in that area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">At approximately 12:30 a.m., via the pole camera located at the 2300 block of Druid Hill Avenue, Detective Green observed \u201ca black male who was wearing a dark hat and a dark jacket at the time.\u201d Although it was dark outside, the street was \u201cwell lit with street lights,\u201d and there was nothing obstructing Detective Green\u2019s view. The male was later identified as appellant; Detective Green referred to him as Mr. Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Detective Green testified that he initially observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">... Mr. Williams was reaching around into his front area of his body. He had his back turned towards me. Mr. Williams then turned around, had a conversation with another unknown black man who was wearing a dark coat. At this time, the unknown black male that he had just conver-sated [sic] with placed both of his hands behind his back at which time Mr. Williams handed the unknown black male a small object. Mr. Williams then again reached into his front and retrieved another object from the unknown black male which I believe[d] to be U.S. currency at that time. Demonstrating to the trial court, Detective Green continued: Okay. If I\u2019m\u2014this is myself and this is my monitor. Mr. Williams had his back towards me like this. He then looked to his right where the unknown black male walked here. Had a brief conversation. The unknown black male then backed up with his hands like this. Mr. Williams then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>handed him an object, a small object at which time I believe [sic] to be CDS. Mr. Williams then returned his hand and retri[ev]ed an object from the unknown black male. It was kind of a grip. So, I believed it was U.S. currency that the unknown black male was handing Mr. Williams and then he went back into his front area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">As noted, appellant\u2019s back was turned toward Detective Green. Consequently, the detective could not see where, at his front, appellant was reaching. However, Detective Green believed that the drugs came from \u201csomewhere between [appellant\u2019s] waist and the rest of his upper torso because [appellant] didn\u2019t bend down\u201d and both of appellant\u2019s \u201carms were tucked\u2014like he was reaching towards the middle for something.\u201d Green testified that appellant used his right hand to deliver the object believed to be drugs to the other male.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Based on the interaction between appellant and the unknown male, Detective Green opined: \u201cI believe I observed a CDS transaction.\u201d Further, Detective Green stated that, based on his experience and training, he believed that appellant was the dealer and the other man was the buyer, because \u201cthe purchaser left the area which buyers do once they retrieve the drugs.\u201d The trial court asked Green how he knew that appellant handed drugs to the unknown black male, and not something else. Detective Green responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">From the Defendant concealing what he was passing along to the unknown person. Also, the unknown person, his actions, where he held his hands behind his back trying to conceal what he was doing....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">If it was candy, Your Honor, there wouldn\u2019t be a need to conceal what you\u2019re passing along. I observed thousands and thousands of street distribution methods, and the most common distribution method is for a dealer to try to conceal the actual drugs and also, when he passes it along, it\u2019s not\u2014 let\u2019s say if you\u2019re giving somebody change on the street. You\u2019re not going to try to conceal it. Drug distributions are usually with a closed hand. They drop the drugs, take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>money. If you\u2019re passing something that\u2019s not contraband, it\u2019s usually not concealed. If I\u2019m giving somebody change for $5.00, I\u2019m going to hand him a bill. I\u2019ll hand him other $1.00 bills like this. It\u2019s not concealed. It\u2019s no need to conceal it if it\u2019s not contraband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">After witnessing what he regarded as a CDS transaction, Green \u201cnotified an arrest team to stop\u201d appellant. But, appellant exited the area \u201cprior to the arrest team responding.\u201d Less than one hour later, at approximately 1:20 a.m., Detective Green again identified appellant, via closed circuit cameras, at the intersection of Druid Hill and Whitelock, wearing the same clothing and cap, \u201cjust walking in the area.\u201d Detective Green communicated this information to the arrest team.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Detective Green told the arrest team that appellant \u201cwas fiddling with his sleeves.\u201d Based on this observation, Detective Green believed that \u201cdrugs [were] possibly hidden in [appellant\u2019s] sleeves,\u201d and he relayed this information to the arresting officers. He also told the team that \u201cthe drugs are probably from anywhere from his waistband, maybe in his jacket, or somewhere on his upper person.\u201d Defense counsel asked Detective Green which sleeve appellant was \u201cfiddling with.\u201d He responded that \u201cit was kind of both sleeves. He was doing this and reaching into both sleeves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The arrest team \u201cstopped [appellant] at the intersection of Whitelock and Druid Hill. They removed his jacket.\u201d According to Green, the police \u201crecovered a zip lock baggy from [appellant\u2019s] left sleeve containing 35 smaller blue zip lock baggies with a white rock substance, suspected crack cocaine. He was placed under arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Through radio communication, Detective Green positively identified appellant as the man he had observed earlier. The following testimony is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He had been gone for an hour. How did you know he had drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">[DETECTIVE GREEN]: He had them earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Well, he had what you believed to be drugs, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">[DETECTIVE GREEN]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: When was Mr. Williams placed under arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">[DETECTIVE GREEN]: Approximately 1:20 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, after the\u2014after the arrest team responded, how long after that was he placed under arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">[DETECTIVE GREEN]: Once Officer John recovered the CDS from his left sleeve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Why wasn\u2019t he placed under arrest when they responded if you\u2019re saying he was conducting a CDS transaction with you viewing him, why didn\u2019t you place him under arrest immediately upon stopping him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">[DETECTIVE GREEN]: Because the buyer wasn\u2019t arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, you don\u2019t know what exactly happened during that time, correct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">Relying on \u00a7 2-202(b) of the Criminal Procedure Article of the Md.Code (\u201cC.P.\u201d), the trial court found that the police had probable cause to arrest appellant based on Detective Green\u2019s observation of appellant engaging in what he (Detective Green) believed to be the sale of illegal narcotics. In making its ruling, the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-13\">[B]ased on the officer\u2019s training and experience in the field, he clearly testified that [appellant\u2019s] actions were consistent with prior drug sales in that area. The mere fact that [appellant] alluded [sic] him after the sale isn\u2019t significant. May be significant if when he was arrested, he didn\u2019t have any drugs, then it would be nothing to\u2014since the buyer had left, there would have been nothing really to charge him with because, you\u2019re right, based on the observation, even though it would constitute probable cause, it was not a prima facie case because there was nothing to analyze.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Part of the crime of possession with distribution is possession with intent to distribute and an element of possession is, possession with intent to distribute is possession. That requires a knowing possession of the specific drug and that wouldn\u2019t be present if he didn\u2019t have any drugs on him since the buyer alluded [sic] him, but that has nothing to do with probable cause. I believe he had probable cause at that point to arrest him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">... [According to 2-202 in the Criminal Procedure Article sub-part (b)<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> police officer without a warrant may arrest a person if the police officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed or attempted and the person has committed or attempted to commit the felony whether or not in the presence or within the view of the police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">In this case, since the same officer observed [appellant] back in that area, general area, it was essentially him directing the arrest and the other officers were acting in concert based on the collective knowledge of the police, and acting at his direction. The mere fact that he saw him or may have seen him also fumbling with his coat jacket, I agree with you, it\u2019s not important with regard to probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>cause to arrest because what he was being arrested for was the distribution of drugs for probable cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">Now granted, without the buyer, if he was just fumbling with his coat and didn\u2019t have any drugs on him, they wouldn\u2019t be able to successfully prosecute the case. Although, the arrest and the search incident to arrest, in my opinion, was [sic] good. Once they arrested him, they had a right to search him. So, regardless of the order, it is clear that the officer directed them to stop and arrest him for that earlier sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">No matter how you cut it, that\u2019s what they did. The mere fact that they went for the coat first is really insignificant cause he was directing them to arrest, and search incident to arrest is lawful, and is an exclusion from a warrantless arrest, I\u2019m sorry, a warrantless search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">So, under both of those arguments, the fact that you could arrest him without a warrant for the earlier sale based on what I find to be probable cause and the search incident to arrest would have naturally followed. So, it\u2019s almost like the actual search is almost an inevitable discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">B. Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">At trial, Detective Green provided testimony similar to his motion testimony. This included the observations he made from the surveillance camera and the evidence surrounding appellant\u2019s stop and arrest. The parties also stipulated that the substance seized from appellant was analyzed and tested positive for crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">Appellant does not contest the manner of arrest. Rather, he disputes the court\u2019s finding of probable cause for the arrest, because Detective Green could not identify the objects that were passed between Williams and the unknown man. According to Williams, \u201c[t]he record shows little more than the observation by Detective Green of an exchange of an unidenti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>fied object in exchange for what might have been currency, in an area described as an open air drug market.\u201d He maintains that \u201can exchange of an unidentified object for money in a high-drug area simply does not constitute probable cause to arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Further, appellant complains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">The item was never identified; there was no evidence that it was a glassine envelope, vial, or other object commonly used for storing illicit drugs. Additionally, there was no evidence of a \u201cstash\u201d and no evidence that appellant or the second male looked up and down the street or engaged in any other furtive behavior. Indeed, Detective Green testified that after the exchange appellant did not engage in any furtive behavior, but rather casually walked from the area. As discussed above, an exchange of an unidentified object for money in a high-drug area simply does not constitute probable cause to arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The State counters that, based on the totality of circumstances, Detective Green had probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed. Therefore, in accordance with C.P. \u00a7 2-202(b), the police officer was justified in ordering the arrest of appellant without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\u201cIn reviewing the ruling on a motion to suppress evidence, we consider only the evidence contained in the record of the suppression hearing.\u201d <em>Bost v. State, </em>406 Md. 341, 349, 958 A.2d 356 (2008); <em>see Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 82-83, 939 A.2d 689 (2008). \u201cWe do not consider information from the trial record when ruling on a pre-trial motion to suppress evidence.\u201d <em>Padilla v. State, </em>180 Md.App. 210, 218, 949 A.2d 68 (citing <em>Paulino v.

State, </em>398 Md. 106, 131, 919 A.2d 1200 (2007). \u201cInstead, we \u2018extend great deference to the findings of the motions court as to first-level findings of fact and as to the credibility of witnesses, unless those findings are clearly erro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>neous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Padilla, </em>180 Md.App. at 218, 949 A.2d 68 <em>(quoting Brown v.

But, \u201cwe make our own independent appraisal as to whether a constitutional right has been violated by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Crosby v.

However, the Fourth Amendment does not protect against all seizures. Rather, it protects \u201conly against <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>409 Md. 415, 427, 975 A.2d 877 (2009) (emphasis in original); <em>see Whren v.

C.P. \u00a7 2-202(b) and (c) pertain to probable cause to believe a crime was committed. It is well settled that \u201c[a] finding of probable cause requires less evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>dence than is necessary to sustain a conviction, but more evidence than would merely arouse suspicion.\u201d <em>Haley, </em>398 Md. at 133, 919 A.2d 1200; <em>see State v. Lemmon, </em>318 Md. 365, 379, 568 A.2d 48 (1990) (recognizing that determination of probable cause is based on probabilities, not certainties).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Maryland courts have repeatedly recognized that probable cause is a \u201cnon-technical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt, requiring less evidence for such belief than would justify conviction but more evidence than that which would arouse a mere suspicion.\u201d <em>Doering v. State, </em>313 Md. 384, 403, 545 A.2d 1281 (1988); <em>see Haley, </em>398 Md. at 132-33, 919 A.2d 1200; <em>Collins v. State, </em>322 Md. 675, 680, 589 A.2d 479 (1991). In the words of the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">The probable-cause standard is a practical, nontechnical conception that deals with the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act. Probable cause is a fluid concept\u2014turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts\u2014not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">The probable-cause standard is incapable of precise definition or quantification into percentages because it deals with probabilities and depends on the totality of the circumstances. We have stated, however, that the substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt, and that the belief of guilt must be particularized with respect to the person to be searched or seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-7\"><em>Maryland v. Pringle, </em>540 U.S. 366, 371, 124 S.Ct. 795, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003) (citations and quotations omitted). <em>See also Brinegar v.

Notably, the hand-to-hand transaction at issue occurred at 12:30 a.m. in an area described by Green as an \u201copen air drug market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Appellant maintains that \u201cwhile Detective Green\u2019s observation of an exchange of some kind between the two men may have created reasonable suspicion, it did not constitute probable cause to arrest.\u201d He notes that there is no reported Maryland decision addressing the question of whether probable cause to arrest exists \u201cwhere a police officer, working in, what is categorized as an \u2018open air drug market,\u2019 has observed some kind of exchange in which something is passed from one person to another, but the officer is unable to see either object.\u201d Appellant asks that we follow the holdings of the courts of Pennsylvania and Florida, which concluded that, \u201ceven viewing the facts and circumstances through the eyes of a trained officer,\u201d probable cause did not exist to support a warrantless arrest where the officers did not see the exact items being transferred. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Dunlap, </em>596 Pa. 147, 941 A.2d 671, 677 (2007); <em>Commonwealth v. Banks, </em>540 Pa. 453, 658 A.2d 752, 752 (1995); <em>Burnette v.

State, </em>578 So.2d 5, 7 (Fla.App.2nd Dist.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">However, we are persuaded by the many other jurisdictions that have considered the issue and concluded that probable cause may be found even if a trained, experienced police officer is not able to see whether the object transferred by one person to another was contraband. <em>See, e.g., Darling v. State, </em>768 A.2d 463, 466 (Del.2001) (stating that \u201cpersonal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>observations by an experienced police officer at a known open-air drug sale area constituted sufficient probable cause to arrest [suspect] for contraband drug dealing\u201d); <em>Prince v.

As one court has noted with respect to this particular area, \u201ctwo cases are seldom sufficiently alike for the first to be an absolute binding precedent for the second.\u201d It is thus not possible to generalize as to what firsthand information meets the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment;[] rather, the best that can be done is to examine certain situations which recur with sufficient frequency that some assessment is possible concerning what first-hand knowledge contributes toward a finding of probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Wayne R.

Ringel, Searches and Seizures, Arrests and Confessions, \u00a7 23:8 (1979) (discussing probable cause in drug cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\u201cWhen evaluating whether a police officer had probable cause to arrest without a warrant, \u2018we examine the events leading up to the arrest, and then decide \u201cwhether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to\u201d probable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stone v. State, </em>178 Md.App. 428, 440, 941 A.2d 1238 (2008) (citations omitted). As the Court of Appeals said in <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 508, 970 A.2d 894, \u201c \u2018context matters: actions that may appear innocuous at a certain time or in a certain place may very well serve as a harbinger of criminal activity under different circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>(quoting United States v. Branch, </em>537 F.3d 328, 336 (4th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Under the applicable \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis, we are satisfied that appellant\u2019s arrest was founded on probable cause. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Detective Green testified as an expert in CDS transactions. As we noted, he had \u201cobserved thousands and thousands of street distribution methods,\u201d and had made over 5,000 arrests for illegal drug transactions. In addition, when Detective Green observed the two men on closed circuit television through the police department\u2019s pole cameras, his specific purpose was to monitor a City block that was well known for its illicit drug trafficking activity. He watched appellant and the other male have a brief conversation, taking particular note of their hand gestures, their manner of gripping, and the fact that they each took particular caution to conceal the small object being passed from one to the other. Based on Detective Green\u2019s extensive experience and expertise, he believed that appellant was engaged in a CDS transaction, and that appellant was the seller. In this regard, Detective Green stated that \u201cthe purchaser left the area which buyers do once they retrieve the drugs.\u201d <em>See Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 508, 970 A.2d 894 (in making determination of reasonable suspicion, the \u201cofficer must explain how the observed conduct, when viewed in the context of all of the other circumstances known to the officer, was indicative of criminal activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">To be sure, Detective Green could not specify the objects passed between the two men. Although appellant argues that the men did not engage in furtive behavior by \u201clooking] up and down the street,\u201d he ignores other evidence of furtive behavior, by which the men sought to conceal what they were exchanging. We agree with the State, which asserts: \u201cThat Detective Green could not actually see what was passed from Williams to the other man is not surprising given the furtive efforts taken by Williams and the other man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In sum, Detective Green did not need absolute certainty in regard to the objects that were exchanged here in order to obtain probable cause. As the Court said in <em>Tobias, supra, </em>375 A.2d at 494, \u201c[e]ven though there might have been innocent explanations for appellant\u2019s conduct, it is not necessary that all innocent explanations for a person\u2019s actions be absent before those actions can provide probable cause for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>arrest.\u201d Under the totality of the circumstances, we are satisfied that Detective Green had probable cause to believe he observed appellant commit a CDS offense. Therefore, his arrest order was not illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-10\">.
