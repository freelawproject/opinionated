EYLER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">This appeal arises from a civil administrative action by the Consumer Protection Division of the Maryland Office of the Attorney General (\u201cCPD\u201d) against appellants Julia B. Passyn, Theodore B. Passyn, Theodore B. Passyn, III (\u201cthe Passyns\u201d), and Bayly Crossing, LLC. CPD charged appellants with failing to register under the Home Builder Registration Act (\u201cHBRA\u201d), Maryland Code (2004 Repl Vol., 2007 Supp.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 4.5-101 to 4.5-701 of the Business Regulation Article; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>unfair and deceptive trade practices under the Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCPA\u201d), Maryland Code (2005 Repl.Vol., 2008 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 13-101 to 13-501 of the Commercial Law Article; and failure to comply with a settlement agreement pursuant to CPA \u00a7 13-403(c)(l). The CPD, acting in its quasi-judicial role,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> delegated the matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d), <em>see </em>Maryland Code (2004 Repl.Vol., 2008 Supp.), \u00a7 10-205(a), (b) of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d), for proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and ultimately issued a Final Order ruling against appellants on all charges. Appellants filed a petition for judicial review pursuant to SG \u00a7 10-222(a) in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which affirmed the Agency\u2019s decision in its entirety. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The Passyns purchased Bayly Crossing, LLC from Talbot Bank on November 19, 2002, with each Passyn acquiring a one-third interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time of the purchase, Bayly Crossing, LLC owned thirty lots in the \u201cBayly Crossing\u201d subdivision located in Dorchester County, which consisted of nine finished lots and twenty-one unfinished lots. Bayly Crossing, LLC was not registered as a home builder with the Home Builders Registration Unit (\u201cHBRU\u201d) prior to the Passyns\u2019 acquisition of the company, nor did any of the Passyns apply to register Bayly Crossing, LLC as a home builder following their purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Over the 827 day period from October 11, 2002 to January 14, 2005, Bayly Crossing, LLC contracted with ten consumers to sell them homes in the Bayly Crossing subdivision. The form contract used by Bayly Crossing, LLC contained the following pertinent language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">PURCHASER agrees to buy and SELLER agrees to sell and construct on Lot_, Phase_, in the subdivision known as \u201cBayly Crossing,\u201d Dorchester County, in the State of Maryland (\u201cLot\u201d), with improvements thereon to be known as_(Street Address), a house substantially similar to the seller\u2019s model known as \u00ab \u00bb \u2756 * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">12.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF RECEIPT OF CONSUMER INFORMATION PAMPHLET:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">On _ (date), my home builder, T.B. Passyn <em>&amp; </em>Sons, Inc., MHBR # 455 Provided me with a copy of the consumer information pamphlet title \u201cBuying a New Home-Consumer Rights and Remedies under Maryland Law\u201d produced by the Consumer Protection Division of the Attorney General\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">The contracts were signed by Bayly Crossing, LLC, and Julia B. Passyn, Member, as \u201cSELLER[s].\u201d All payments for the sales were made to Bayly Crossing, LLC. The bottom of the contract indicated that the document was copyrighted to \u201cT.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc., August 1,1998.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The contracts also contained an addendum titled \u201cBuilder\u2019s Notice of Standards and Buyer\u2019s General Release to Landowner and Buyer\u2019s Acknowledgment of Receipt of Consumer Information Pamphlet.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The addendum provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc. MHBR 455 is the Builder for the house on Lot_Phase_located in Bayly Crossing, Cambridge, MD 21613 and hereby agrees to grant to the Buyers of said house a One-Year Limited Warranty in accord with the Standards set by the Residential Warranty Corporation, 5300 Derry Street, Harrisburg, PA----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">In exchange for said Limited Warranty, the Buyer\u2019s [sic] hereby grant a general release to Bayly Crossing, LLC (Theodore B.

Passyn, Julia Beall Passyn and Theodore Passyn III) from any and all actions or causes of action relating to the construction of the house on Lot-Phase _located at Bayly Crossing which Buyers have or may have against the said Bayly Crossing, LLC (Theodore B. Passyn, Julia Beall Passyn and Theodore Passyn III) now or in the future and also release the Builder from any and all items not covered either by said Limited Warranty or the Punch List....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Bayly Crossing was not registered as a home builder with the HBRU during the period when these sales occurred. Seven homes were constructed on lots owned by Bayly Crossing, LLC between November 19, 2002, and October 22, 2004, and they were built by T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc., an HBRU-registered home builder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On October 22, 2004, Bayly Cross<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>ing, LLC sold the remaining twenty-three lots to Gemcraft Forest Hill, LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In 2002, the CPD initiated an investigation of T.B. Passyn <em>&amp; </em>Sons, Ine.\u2019s home building practices, which led to litigation in the Circuit Court for Talbot County and a related administrative action. The dispute was settled with a Final Order by Consent (\u201cConsent Order\u201d), executed on July 17, 2003, by Theodore B. Passyn, III, President, on behalf of T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc., the Passyns individually, Jeston Harner, Jr. and Steven M. Sakamoto-Wengel, Assistant Attorneys General, and William Leibovici, \u201cAssistant Attorney General and Chief [of the CPD].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Statement of Facts contained in the Consent Order included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">7. On January 7, 2003, the [HBRU] received an application to Renew Registration as a Home Builder in the State of Maryland for T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc.<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">8. The [HBRU] determined that T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc. and its principals had a substantial history of open lawsuits, including an unsatisfied consumer judgment against its principal for a case that was pending after January 1, 2001, and liens that were not disclosed on the application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">9. Further, T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons was served with an Administrative Subpoena from the Attorney General of Maryland requiring it to produce certain documents, including contracts pertaining to its activities as a builder on or before October 7, 2002. T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>was not responsive to this request and the Division was forced to file a lawsuit against the company to obtain compliance, which also was not disclosed on the application forms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">10. Based on the failure of T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons to disclose additional lawsuits, the unsatisfied consumer judgment, and the liens on the application forms, and the existence of unsatisfied judgment liens, the [HBRU] denied the application of T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons to renew registration as a home builder in the State of Maryland on May 28, 2003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Under the terms of the Consent Order, the HBRU agreed to renew T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons registration as home builder provided they complied with certain conditions. The Consent Order specified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">12. This Final Order by Consent encompasses and pertains to new home building activities, whether individually or jointly, of Theodore B. Passyn, Sr., Theodore B. Passyn, III, Julia Beall Passyn and any entity in which they are or will be involved, and includes their agents, employees, successors and/or assigns. The Proponent and Respondents agree to the following.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">13. None of the Respondents shall act as a Home Builder in Maryland as defined in Md.Code Ann., Bus. Reg. \u00a7 4.5-101\u00ae unless the Respondent has first registered with the Home Builders Registration Unit of the Consumer Protection Division as required by Md.Code Ann. Bus. Reg. \u00a7 4.5-301, et seq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">19. Respondents agree that any violation of this Consent Order will be considered a second violation of the Home Builders Registration Act and the Consumer Protection Act for the purposes of Md.Code Ann., Com. Law II, \u00a7 13-410.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">On March 1, 2005, the Passyns and T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc. brought a declaratory judgment action against the CPD attacking the validity of the Consent Order. The Passyns and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc. subsequently amended the complaint to add the State as a defendant, and to add a charge that the CPD and the State violated their right to due process under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The circuit court granted summary judgment for the State and the CPD. This Court dismissed the appeal as to T.B. Passyn <em>&amp; </em>Sons, Inc. for lack of standing, and affirmed the judgment against the Passyns individually. <em>See T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc., et. al. v. Consumer Protection Division, et. al., </em>185 Md.App. 741, 747, Appeal No. 1042, Sept. Term, 2007 (unreported opinion filed Apr. 6, 2009) (hereinafter <em>\u201cT.B. Passyn &amp; Sons \u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">On July 12, 2005, the CPD initiated the present litigation, when it filed \"with the Agency a Statement of Charges against the Passyns and Bayly Crossing, LLC, alleging violations of HBRA \u00a7\u00a7 4.5-301 and 4.5-501 for failing to register as home builders; CPA \u00a7 13-303 for engaging in unfair and deceptive trade practices defined in CPA \u00a7\u00a7 13-301(1) and 13-301(3); and CPA \u00a7 13^02(c)(l) for failing to comply with the Consent Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">On July 14, 2005, the Agency granted the CPD\u2019s request for a hearing and delegated authority to conduct the contested case hearing and render proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the OAH. An evidentiary hearing was scheduled for September 13, 2005. The Passyns and Bayly Crossing, LLC filed a Motion for Summary Decision on August 12, 2005, which the CPD opposed. The OAH heard the opposing motions on September 13, 2005, in lieu of the scheduled evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Following the hearing, the OAH issued a Proposed Ruling on Motion recommending that the Motion for Summary Decision be granted and concluding that neither the Passyns nor Bayly Crossing, LLC violated the HBRA or CPA. The CPD filed exceptions to the Proposed Ruling, and on May 30, 2006, the Agency issued an order in which it concluded that \u201cBayly Crossing was required to have registered as home builder at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the time that it entered into the contracts in which it undertook to construct new homes for consumers.\u201d The Agency then remanded the case to the OAH \u201cfor any further proceedings required to resolve factual or legal issues that have not been resolved by the Agency\u2019s ruling on this motion\u201d and for the parties to \u201coffer evidence for the record that they will want this agency to consider in determining the appropriate relief for any proven violations of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">On July 5, 2006, while the remand hearing was pending, the CPD filed an Amended Statement of Charges adding a charge for violating CPA \u00a7 13-303 by engaging in an unfair or deceptive trade practice as defined by CPA \u00a7 13-301(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The remand hearing was held on August 22, 2006, and the OAH issued its Proposed Ruling and Decision on December 15, 2006, in which the Administrative Law Judge reached the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">Based upon the foregoing I conclude as a matter of law that the Respondents violated [HBRA] \u00a7\u00a7 4.5-301 and 4.5-501 by failing to register as a home builder under the [HBRA],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">I further conclude as a matter of law that the Respondents violated [CPA] \u00a7 13-402(c)(l) by failing to comply with the Final Order of Consent by not registering as a home builder under the [HBRA].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">I also conclude as a matter of law that the Respondents violated [CPA] \u00a7 13-301(13) by using a contract related to the sale of single family residential consumer realty that contained a clause limiting or precluding the buyer\u2019s right to obtain consequential damages as a result of the seller\u2019s breach or cancellation of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">I further conclude that the Respondents did not violate [CPA] \u00a7\u00a7 13-301(1) and 13-301(3) because they did not make misleading oral or written statements or representations that had the capacity, tendency or effect of deceiving or misleading consumers and did not omit a material fact by failing to register as home builders under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>[HBRA] or by failing to inform purchasers that they were not registered as home builders under the [HBRA].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Both parties filed exceptions to the Proposed Ruling and Decision with the Agency. On August 3, 2007, the Agency issued a Final Order, Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law, and a Ruling on Exceptions. The agency first concluded that Bayly Crossing, LLC violated HBRA \u00a7\u00a7 4.5-301 and 4.5-501 by failing to register as a home builder. The Agency reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">The [HBRA] defines a \u201ccontract purchaser\u201d as \u201ca person who has entered into a contract with a home builder to purchase a new home----\u201d \u00a7 4.5-101(c). It defines \u201chome builder\u201d as a \u201ca person that undertakes to erect or otherwise construct a new home.\u201d \u00a7 4.5-101(f)(l). And, it requires a contract for the initial sale of a new home to include the \u201cbuilder registration number of the seller of the new home.\u201d \u00a7 14\u2014117(j)(2)(i).[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">All of these sections support the proposition that the party entering into the contract with a consumer must be a registered home builder. The term \u201cundertake\u201d used in defining a home builder means to \u201cput oneself under obligation to perform.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary (1968). Bayly Crossing placed upon itself the obligation to \u201csell and construct\u201d a new home for the consumer. Even if the contract had used different words, the result would have been the same as long as the contract still provided that the consumer was purchasing a new home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">In addition to the obligations Bayly Crossing assumed in its contract with consumers, Maryland law also places on it the obligation to pay for all consequential damages caused by its breach or cancellation of the contract. Md.Code Ann., Com. Law II \u00a7 13-301(13) (2005). In other words, Bayly Crossing remains liable if a purchaser is able to establish, among other things, that a new home was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>constructed in the manner or with the quality required by the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">The exemption of a real estate developer from having to register provided by \u00a7 4.5-101(f)(3)(iv) has to be read in harmony with the [HBRA\u2019s] requirements relating to the purchasers and sellers of new homes. This exemption was intended to cover developers who do not play a direct role in the transactions with consumer [sic]. By entering into contracts undertaking to provide new homes to consumers, Bayly Crossing was acting as a home builder as that term is defined in the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">In summary, after applying the uncontested facts to the [HBRA], this Agency has concluded that Bayly Crossing was required to have registered as a home builder at the time it entered into the contract in which it undertook to construct new homes for consumers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The Agency next detailed multiple violations of the CPA by Bayly Crossing, LLC. The Agency, citing <em>Golt v. Phillips, </em>308 Md. 1, 9-10, 517 A.2d 328 (1986), concluded that Bayly Crossing violated CPA \u00a7\u00a7 13-301(1) and 13-303 by \u201cimplicitly [and falsely] representing] in their form contracts that Bayly Crossing L.L.C. was a properly registered home builder.\u201d The Agency found that the primary source of this misrepresentation was the statement in the contract that Bayly Crossing, LLC would \u201csell and construct\u201d a new home for the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Again citing <em>Golt, </em>the Agency further concluded that Bayly Crossing, LLC violated CPA \u00a7\u00a7 13-301(3) and 13-303 by failing to disclose to consumers a material fact that it was not a registered home builder. The Agency additionally concluded that the provision contained in the addendum signed by consumers that discharged Bayly Crossing, LLC from \u201cany and all actions or causes of actions relating to the construction of the house\u201d restricted consumers\u2019 right to bring actions for consequential damages resulting from the seller\u2019s breach or cancellation of the contract, and thus violated CPA \u00a7\u00a7 13-301(13) and 13-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Finally, the Agency concluded that the Passyns violated the provision of the Consent Order requiring any entity they became associated with to register as a home builder, if required. The Agency determined that the Passyns\u2019 noncompliance with the Consent Order violated CPA \u00a7 13-402(c) because \u201cthe parties agreed that [the Consent Order] would be subject to enforcement under Subtitle 4 of the [CPA] and that any such violation would be deemed a second violation of [the CPA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">For these violations, the Agency imposed penalties and costs on the Passyns and Bayly Crossing, LLC, jointly and severally, in the amount of $25,000 and $6,781.98, respectively. The Agency\u2019s determination of whether to impose a civil penalty was guided by its analysis of the five factors in CPA \u00a7 13-410(d) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">1. <em>Severity</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">The Respondents in this case failed to register as a home builder that was engaged in entering into contracts with consumers in which it agreed to sell and construct new homes for the consumers. Respondents also used a general release form that violated the [CPA]. The Respondents also violated the terms of a Final Order by Consent that they had entered into in 2003. All of the Respondents\u2019 violations are serious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">2. <em>Good Faith</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">The Respondents did not operate in good faith in their dealings with the Proponent. The Respondents entered into a Final Order by Consent with the Proponent on July 17, 2003 in which they agreed to register in the future all their entities that were operating as home builders under the HBRA. At that time the Respondents had already sold four new homes to consumers through Bayly Crossing L.L.C. and subsequent to entering into the Final Order by Consent, they sold another five new homes to consumers through this unregistered entity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>3. <em>Prior Violations</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">There is a history of prior violations as evidenced by the Final Order by Consent previously entered into by the individual Respondents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">4. <em>Deterrent Effect of Amount of Penalty</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">The civil Penalty must be sufficient to deter both the Respondents as well as other people from engaging in this or similar type of illegal conduct in the future. The Respondents were more than willing to ignore the HBRA law even after they had had a previous legal action brought against them for failing to comply with the Act. Imposing a substantial civil penalty is intended to deter them from ever doing anything like this again. A civil penalty has to convince these people that they will lose a lot of money if they get caught violating the law. Changing the monetary bottom line is the only thing that will alter their conduct in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">5. <em>Sufficiency of the Cease and Desist Order, including Restitution</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">Consumers would not be protected from the Respondents in this ease if the Respondents were simply ordered to stop violating the law in the future. That is what the Final Order by Consent did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">On August 29, 2007, Bayly Crossing and the Passyns filed a petition for judicial review of the Agency\u2019s Final Order. Following a hearing on July 14, 2008, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City issued an opinion affirming the Final Order. Bayly Crossing, LLC and the Passyns responded with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">Appellants set out the following questions for our review, which we have rephrased and consolidated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">1. Was the Agency\u2019s decision that Bayly Crossing, LLC was required to register as a home builder under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>HBRA based upon an erroneous interpretation of law or unsupported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">2. Was the Agency\u2019s decision that Bayly Crossing, LLC was required to disclose its unregistered status and that failure to disclose such status constituted a misrepresentation under the [CPA] based upon an erroneous interpretation of law or unsupported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">3. Was the Agency\u2019s decision that appellants violated CPA \u00a7 13-402(c)(l) by failing to comply with the Consent Order based upon an erroneous interpretation of law or unsupported by substantial evidence?<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">4. Was the Agency\u2019s decision that it was not required to issue a new delegation of authority to the OAH after the Amended Statement of Charges was filed based upon an erroneous interpretation of law or unsupported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\"><em>5. </em>Was the Agency\u2019s decision that Bayly Crossing, LLC violated the CPA by limiting a buyer\u2019s right to obtain consequential damages for breach or cancellation of the contract based upon an erroneous interpretation of law or unsupported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">6. Was the Agency\u2019s decision that appellants were jointly and severally liable for the actions of Bayly Crossing, LLC based upon an erroneous interpretation of law or unsupported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">7.

Appended to CPD\u2019s brief is a certificate from the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (\u201cSDAT\u201d), dated April 24, 2009, stating that Bayly Crossing, LLC\u2019s charter was forfeited by SDAT on October 5, 2007. As of the date this opinion was filed, SDAT\u2019s website continues to list Bayly Crossing, LLC\u2019s corporate charter as forfeited. Appellants\u2019 reply brief makes no mention of the status of Bayly Crossing, LLC\u2019s charter, and does not respond to the CPD\u2019s assertion that it lacks standing to pursue this appeal. Consequently, we take judicial notice pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-201 that Bayly Crossing, LLC forfeited its corporate charter on October 5, 2007, and has not thus far filed articles of revival.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">We addressed this same issue in <em>T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, </em>where we likewise took judicial notice that T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc. had forfeited its corporate charter, and dismissed its appeal for lack of standing. <em>Id. </em>at 22-27. There we explained that \u201c[o]nce a charter has been forfeited, the corporation immediately becomes a legal non-entity, a lifeless corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24 (citing <em>Dual v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>383 Md. 151, 163, 857 A.2d 1095 (2004)). We also explained \u201cthat the revival of a corporate charter d[oes] not relate back so as to permit an appeal when the notice of appeal was filed during the time that the corporate charter was forfeit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25 (citing <em>Hill Construction v. Sunrise Beach, LLC, </em>180 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>626, 952 A.2d 357 (2008)). Thus, as in <em>T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, </em>the forfeiture of Bayly Crossing, LLC\u2019s corporate charter and its failure to file articles of revival render its appeal a nullity. Accordingly, Bayly Crossing, LLC is dismissed as a party to this appeal for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\n<em>Bayly Crossiny, LLC\u2019s failure to reyister as a home builder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The linchpin of this dispute is the Agency\u2019s determination that Bayly Crossing, LLC was a \u201chome builder\u201d and, therefore, required to register as such under the HBRA. The HBRA defines a \u201chome builder\u201d as \u201ca person that undertakes to erect or otherwise construct a new home.\u201d HBRA \u00a7 4.5-101(f)(1). Subject to certain exceptions, \u201chome builder[s]\u201d must register with the HBRU. HBRA \u00a7\u00a7 4.5-301, 4.5-303(a)(1). The definition of \u201chome builder\u201d specifically excludes \u201ca real estate developer who does not construct new homes.\u201d HBRA \u00a7 4.5-101(f)(3)(iv). The Passyns argue that they fall within the exclusion because they merely contracted to sell new homes and did not, in their individual capacities or through Bayly Crossing, LLC, undertake to construct or erect new homes. The Passyns argue that the Agency\u2019s conclusion that they acted as home builders under the HBRA was \u201cbased entirely upon the boilerplate phrase \u2018sell and construct\u2019 within contracts used by Bayly Crossing\u201d and ignored the real estate developer\u2019s exemption. The Passyns further note that T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc., the entity that performed the actual construction, was plainly disclosed as the home builder in its contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The CPD\u2019s arguments in response mirror the rationale provided by the Agency in its Final Order. Specifically, the CPD argues that whether the Passyns or Bayly Crossing, LLC intended to perform the actual construction is irrelevant because by agreeing to \u201csell and construct\u201d new homes, they \u201cundertook the legal obligation to construct homes for consumers.\u201d The CPD premises this argument on the assertion that \u201c \u2018undertake,\u2019 as used in defining a home builder, means \u2018to put oneself under obligation to perform.\u2019 \u201d The CPD also suggests that, irrespective of the contract language, the seller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>of a new home must register with the HBRU. The CPD points to the requirement in Maryland Code, \u00a7 14-117(j)(2)(i), which requires the contract for an initial sale of a new home to include the \u201cbuilder registration number of the seller of the new home.\u201d Moreover, CPD argues that, if the registration requirement was determined by who performed the actual construction, there would be no need to exempt from registration lenders who hire a second registered home builder to complete the first home builder\u2019s unfinished project. <em>See </em>HBRA \u00a7 4.5-501(c). Finally, the CPD argues that the real estate developer\u2019s exemption \u201cwas intended to cover developers who do not play a direct role in the sale of new homes to consumers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">We view the use of the term \u201cundertake[ ]\u201d in the definition of \u201chome builder\u201d as dispositive on this issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. In order to ascertain the intent of the Legislature, we begin with the plain language of the statute, and if that language is clear and unambiguous, we look no further than the text of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\"><em>In re Najasha B., </em>409 Md. 20, 27, 972 A.2d 845 (2009) (citations and quotation marks omitted). The definitions of \u201cundertake\u201d listed in Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century Dictionary (1968, 2nd ed.) include \u201cto give a promise or pledge that; to contract,\u201d \u201cto promise; to guarantee,\u201d and \u201cto make oneself responsible for.\u201d Thus, by defining a home builder as one who <em>\u201cundertakes </em>to erect or otherwise construct a new home,\u201d HBRA \u00a7 4.5-101(f)(l) (emphasis added), the legislature clearly intended to capture those who incur the obligation to build a new home, rather than just those who actually build the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Bayly Crossing, LLC undertook the legal obligation to construct a home for the purchasers by agreeing to \u201csell and construct\u201d a new home. The contractual provision in which the \u201cSELLER\u201d\u2014Bayly\u2019s Crossing, LLC\u2014agreed to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the buyer with a home substantially similar \u201cto SELLER\u2019S Model House\u201d reaffirmed this obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The Passyns argue that the \u201csell and construct\u201d language is mere \u201cboilerplate,\u201d and point to the fact that T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc. is listed as the actual builder. Under the well-settled principle of objective contract interpretation we \u201cgive effect to the clear terms of the contract regardless of what the parties to the contract may have believed those terms to mean.\u201d <em>Clancy v. King, </em>405 Md. 541, 557, 954 A.2d 1092 (2008) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, the Passyns\u2019 subjective intent in agreeing to \u201csell and construct\u201d new homes is irrelevant. According to the clear and unambiguous terms of the contract, Bayly Crossing, LLC \u201cundertook] to erect or otherwise construct a new home\u201d and was therefore a \u201chome builder\u201d under HBRA \u00a7 4.5\u2014101(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Our conclusion is also supported by looking at the entirety of the statute and reading the definition of \u201chome builder\u201d in context. As stated, \u201chome builder\u201d is defined in HBRA \u00a7 4.5-101(f) as \u201ca person that undertakes to erect or otherwise construct a new home.\u201d It includes, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca custom home builder as defined in \u00a7 10-501 of the Real Property Article,\u201d id, and \u201ca new home builder subject to \u00a7 10-301 of the Real Property Article.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A \u201ccustom home builder\u201d is defined as \u201cany person who seeks, enters into, or performs custom home contracts.\u201d Maryland Code (2003 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-501(d) of the Real Property Article (\u201cRP\u201d). The requirements in RP \u00a7 10-301 apply to the sale and purchase of a new single family residential unit which is not completed at the time of contracting, and the \u201cvendor or builder\u201d required the payment of a sum of money by the purchaser prior to completion of the unit. A \u201chome builder,\u201d as defined in HBRA \u00a7 4.5-101(f), \u201cdoes not include,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>\u201csubcontractors or other vendors hired by the registrant to perform services or supply materials for the construction of a new home who do not otherwise meet the requirements of this title,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u201ca real estate developer who does not construct homes,\u201d <em>id., </em>or \u201ca financial institution that lends funds for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>construction or purchase of residential dwellings in the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As previously observed, RP \u00a7 14-117(j)(2) applies to a contract for the initial sale of a new home. The above provisions lead us to the conclusion that the HBRA is aimed at the initial sale by someone in the business of developing real estate to a consumer of (1) an unimproved lot when the seller undertakes to build or have built a home on that lot, or (2) a lot on which a new home has been built. It is not aimed at the sale of an unimproved lot by a seller who does not undertake to supply a new home, and the purchaser then undertakes to build or have built a new home. An exempt developer is one who does not undertake to sell or supply a new home.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\n<em>Violations of CPA \u00a7\u00a7 13-301(1), 13-301(3), and 13-303</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The Passyns next challenge the Agency\u2019s conclusion that they violated CPA \u00a7 \u00a7 13-301(1), 13-301(3), and 13-303 by implicitly representing in their contracts that Bayly Crossing was a registered home builder and failing to disclose the fact that Bayly Crossing was not registered. CPA \u00a7 13-303 prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices in, among other things, the sale of consumer realty. CPA \u00a7 13-301(1) defines as an unfair or deceptive trade practice as any \u201c[fjalse, falsely disparaging, or misleading oral or written statement, visual description, or other representation of any kind which has the capacity, tendency, or effect of deceiving or misleading consumers.\u201d CPA \u00a7 13-301(3) additionally includes as an unfair or deceptive trade practice \u201c[fjailure to state a material fact if the failure deceives or tends to deceive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The Passyns first argue that Bayly Crossing, LLC\u2019s agreement to \u201csell and construct\u201d homes did not amount to an unfair or deceptive practice as defined by CPA \u00a7 13-301(1) because the phrase did not amount to an implicit representation that Bayly Crossing, LLC was a registered homebuilder. The Passyns point out that the contract identified T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc. as the homebuilder. Second, the Passyns argue that the HBRA does not require disclosure of unregistered status prior to contracting with a consumer, and thus their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>failure to do so was not an omission of a material fact as specified by CPA \u00a7 13-301(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">CPD cites <em>Golt v. Phillips, </em>308 Md. 1, 517 A.2d 328 (1986), for the proposition that Bayly Crossing, LLC implicitly and falsely represented to consumers that it was a registered home builder when it agreed to construct new homes. CPD again cites <em>Golt </em>to argue that Bayly Crossing, LLC\u2019s failure to disclose its unregistered status constituted an omission of a material fact that deceived consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In <em>Golt, </em>John Golt rented an apartment in a multiple family dwelling unit in response to a print advertisement placed by Phillips Brothers and Associates (\u201cPhillips Brothers\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 5, 517 A.2d 328. Golt complained to the Baltimore City Housing Department after Phillips Brothers failed to perform several repairs, which led a housing inspector to discover that Phillips Brother lacked the necessary license to operate the building as a multiple dwelling. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals concluded that advertising and renting an unlicensed apartment violated CPA \u00a7 \u00a7 13-301(1) and (3). <em>Id. </em>at 9, 517 A.2d 328. The Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">Implicit in any advertisement and rental of an apartment is the representation that the leasing of the apartment is lawful. Baltimore City Code, Art. 13, \u00a7 1101 (1983 Repl. Vol.), expressly prohibits the operation of any multiple family dwelling without a license or temporary certificate. As Phillips Brothers had neither a license nor a temporary certificate, it violated the City Code. Phillips Brothers could not provide Golt with the unimpeded right to possession during the lease term. Consequently, Phillips Brothers!\u201d] advertisement and rental of the apartment was a \u201cmisleading ... statement ... or other representation of any kind which has the capacity, tendency, or effect of deceiving or misleading consumers.\u201d Maryland Code (1983 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 13-301(1) of the Commercial Law Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">Finally, Phillips Brothers also violated \u00a7 13-301(3) of the CPA, which states that the failure to disclose a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>fact, which deceives or tends to deceive, is an unfair or deceptive trade practice. The lack of proper licensing is a material fact that Phillips Brothers failed to state. In addition, failure to disclose this fact deceived Golt or at least had the tendency to deceive consumers. An omission is considered material if a significant number of unsophisticated consumers would attach importance to the information in determining a choice of action. <em>See, e.g., Charles of the Ritz Distributors Corp. v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>143 F.2d 676, 679-80 (2d Cir.1944); <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>150 F.2d 106, 109 (5th Cir.1945); <em>cf. </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 538 (1977) (Under common law fraud, a fact is deemed material if a reasonable person would attach importance to its existence in determining his choice of action.). In our view, the lack of proper licensing for an apartment under most circumstances is a material fact that any tenant would find important in his determination of whether to sign a lease agreement and move into the premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 517 A.2d 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The Passyns attempt to distinguish <em>Golt </em>by arguing that \u201cBayly Crossing\u2019s registration status would not be important because the actual builder was registered and disclosed to purchasers.\u201d The Passyns further argue that there is no evidence in the record that consumers would have considered Bayly Crossing, LLC\u2019s lack of registration an important factor in their decision to purchase a home. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">As in <em>Golt, </em>the CPA\u2019s objective of instituting \u201cstrong protective and preventive steps to investigate unlawful consumer practices, to assist the public in obtaining relief from these practices, and to prevent these practices from occurring in Maryland,\u201d is directly applicable to the agreements between Bayly Crossing, LLC and consumers. <em>Golt, </em>308 Md. at 8, 517 A.2d 328; <em>see </em>CPA \u00a7 13-102(a) (\u201cThe General Assembly of Maryland finds that consumer protection is one of the major issues which confront all levels of government, and that there has been mounting concern over the increase of deceptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>practices in connection with sales of merchandise, <em>real property, </em>and services and the extension of credit.\u201d) (emphasis added). The HBRA prohibits acting as a home builder in Maryland without first registering with the HBRU. HBRA \u00a7 4.5-301. Bayly Crossing, LLC acted as a homebuilder by agreeing to construct new homes for consumers despite its failure to register. By doing so, Bayly Crossing, LLC was implicitly and falsely representing to consumers that it could lawfully construct new homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Furthermore, lack of proper registration is a material fact that most unsophisticated consumers would consider important when deciding whether to purchase a new home. HBRA \u00a7 4.5-605 states that \u201c[a] contract for the performance of any act for which a home builder registration number is required is not enforceable unless the home builder was registered at the time that the contract was signed by the owner.\u201d Certainly, consumers would find important the fact that their contract to purchase a new home was rendered unenforceable by the seller\u2019s unregistered status.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Finally, the contract\u2019s indication that T.B. Passyns &amp; Sons, Inc. would perform the actual construction, presumably as subcontractor, is irrelevant. As we explained above, it was Bayly Crossing, LLC, not T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, Inc., that undertook the legal obligation to construct new homes for consumers. We, therefore, hold that the Agency properly concluded that Bayly Crossing, LLC and the Passyns violated CPA \u00a7\u00a7 13-301(1), 13-301(3) and 13-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\n<em>Violations of the Consent Order and CPA \u00a7 13-402(c)(l)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The Passyns next dispute the Agency\u2019s conclusion that they violated CPA \u00a7 13-402(c)(l) by failing to comply with the terms of the Consent Order. CPA \u00a7 13-402(c)(l) provides that \u201c[i]t is a violation of this title to fail to adhere to any provision contained in a written assurance of discontinuance or settlement agreement.\u201d Paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Consent Order state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">19. Respondents agree that any violation of this Consent Order will be considered a second violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Home Builders Registration Act and the Consumer Protection Act for the purposes of Md.Code Ann., Com. Law II, \u00a7 13-410.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">20. Pursuant to Md.Code Ann., Com. Law II \u00a7 13-403, Respondents are hereby notified that if the [CPD] determines that the Respondents have failed to comply with this Final Order by Consent within thirty (30) days following execution of the Final Order by Consent, the Consumer Protection Division shall proceed with enforcement of the Final Order by Consent pursuant to Subtitle 4 of the Consumer Protection Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The Passyns argue that the Consent Order arose out of a registration proceeding under the HBRA rather than a conciliation process under CPA \u00a7 13-402, and consequently, the Consent Order is not a settlement agreement subject to CPA \u00a7 13-402(c)(l). This argument ignores the plain language of the Consent Order notifying the Passyns that the agreement is subject to enforcement under Subtitle 4 of the CPA and that any subsequent violation would constitute a second violation of the CPA. Thus, the CPD is not acting with \u201cboundless authority\u201d to enforce all settlement agreements under CPA \u00a7 13-402(c)(1) as the Passyns claim. Rather, the CPD is simply enforcing the Consent Order in this case according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The Passyns further suggest that paragraph 19 of the Consent Order violates due process and is unenforceable, arguing that the Agency cannot \u201cforce\u201d them to agree that a violation of the CPA be treated as a second violation when the agency found no violation in the first instance. We refuse to entertain this argument, as the proverbial ship has long since sailed with respect to the validity of the Consent Order. First, Maryland courts do not ordinarily entertain appeals from a consent judgment. <em>See Franzen v. Dubinok, </em>290 Md. 65, 68-69, 427 A.2d 1002 (1981) (and cases cited therein). Second, the Passyns already sought an interpretation and clarification of the Consent Order before the Agency, which ultimately led to an unsuccessful challenge to the validity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the Consent Order in this Court. <em>See T.B. Passyn &amp; Sons, supra. </em>At no time during those proceedings did the Passyns raise the objections they now make regarding paragraph 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Finally, in an effort to avoid individual liability for violating the Consent Order, the Passyns argue that the Consent Order \u201cdoes not require the <em>individual </em>[a'jppellants to register as <em>individual </em>home builders and the only homebuilding activities that are alleged to have occurred were those of Bayly Crossing.\u201d What the Passyns appear to mean by this statement is that they can only be held individually liable if they act as home builders and fail to register in their individual capacities. The terms of the Consent Order clearly indicate otherwise. The Consent Order states that it applies \u201cto the new home building activities, whether individually or jointly, of [the Passyns] <em>and </em>any entity in which they are or will be involved.\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, when the Passyns operated Bayly Crossing, LLC as an unregistered home building entity, they subjected themselves to individual liability under the Consent Order for failure to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\n<em>The CPD\u2019s authority to file an amended statement of charges after the Agency has delegated authority to the OAH</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The Passyns next contend that the CPD failed to comply with proper procedure when it filed an Amended Statement of Charges after the Agency had delegated authority to the OAH to conduct the contested case hearing and render proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. As a consequence of this failure, the Passyns assert that the added charge for violating CPA \u00a7 13-301(13) must be thrown out.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">SG \u00a7 10-205(a)(l)(ii) provides agencies with authority to delegate contested case hearings to the OAH. In cases before the Agency, authority to delegate contested case hearings is given to the Chief of the CPD. Md.Code Regs. (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 02.01.02.04. \u201cUnless the Agency notifies the parties of a different delegation, the [scope of] authority delegated [includes] issuing] proposed findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law, but not recommend[ing] proposed relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The Passyns claim the requirement that the Agency review amendments to a statement of charges lies in COMAR 02.01.02.03.

Unless notice issued under Regulation .06 of this chapter states otherwise, the [CPD] is the party proponent.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">None of the regulations above specify a procedure for the Agency to follow if the petitioner amends the initial statement of charges. The CPD urges us to look to Maryland Rule 2-341 for guidance. That rule permits parties in civil actions before the circuit court to amend pleadings without leave of court up to 30 days before the scheduled trial date, or with leave of court thereafter. Md. Rule 2-341. It has long been the policy of Maryland courts to freely allow amendments in order to promote justice. <em>See, e.g., Jacobson v. Julian, </em>246 Md. 549, 554, 229 A.2d 108 (1967); <em>Staub v. Staub, </em>31 Md.App. 478, 480, 356 A.2d 609 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 735 (1976); <em>E.G. Rock, Inc. v. Danly, </em>98 Md.App. 411, 428, 633 A.2d 485 (1993). Amendments should not be allowed, however, if they result in prejudice to the opposing party or undue delay. <em>Robertson v. Davis, </em>271 Md. 708, 710, 319 A.2d 816 (1974); <em>Danly, </em>98 Md.App. at 428, 633 A.2d 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-15\">Though Rule 2-341 does not apply to administrative proceedings, we see no reason to depart from its guiding principles here. The Amended Statement of Charges was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>filed July 5, 2006, well before the August 22, 2006 hearing at the OAH. Moreover, the added charge for violating CPA \u00a7 13-303 by engaging in an unfair or deceptive trade practice under CPA \u00a7 13-301(13) was based on the same facts\u2014the sales contract used by Bayly Crossing, LLC\u2014and the same regulatory scheme\u2014the CPA provisions governing unfair and deceptive trade practices\u2014as the initial Statement of Charges. The Passyns place great emphasis on the fact that the CPD deprived the Agency of the opportunity to review the amendments by filing the Amended Statement of Charges after the Agency delegated the case to the OAH. As the Agency noted, however, it fully maintained its authority to review all charges brought against the Passyns because it rendered the final decision in the case. Indeed, we fail to see how the Passyns suffered any prejudice as a result of the timing of the Amended Statement of Charges and shall, therefore, decline their request to strike the added charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\n<em>Violation of CPA \u00a7\u00a7 13-301(13) and 13-303</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The Passyns next attack on the merits the Agency\u2019s finding that they violated CPA \u00a7 13-303 by engaging in an unfair or deceptive trade practice as defined in CPA \u00a7 13-301(13). CPA \u00a7 13-301(13) defines as an unfair or deceptive trade practice \u201c[u]se by a seller, who is in the business of selling consumer realty, of a contract related to the sale of a single family residential realty, precluding the buyer\u2019s right to obtain consequential damages as a result of the seller\u2019s breach or cancellation of the contract.\u201d The portion of the contract found to meet this definition discharged</p>\n<blockquote id=\"adj-dedup-0\">Bayly Crossing, LLC (Theodore B. Passyn, Julia Beall Passyn and Theodore Passyn III) from any and all actions or causes of action relating to the construction of the house on Lot__ Phase_located at Bayly Crossing which Buyer have or may have against the said Bayly Crossing, LLC (Theodore B. Passyn, Julia Beall Passyn and Theodore Passyn III) now or in the future ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The Passyns argue that the release does not run afoul of CPA \u00a7 13-301(13) because by its terms the release applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>only to construction-related causes of action, which arise only after the contract is performed and the buyer takes possession of the premises. We fail to see the distinction drawn by the Passyns between construction-related claims and claims for consequential damages resulting from the seller\u2019s breach or cancellation of the contract. As CPD points out, construction-related claims could arise well before the contract for sale is performed and the buyer takes possession of the house. CPD supports its position by citing the testimony of Alan Ritz, who described the numerous construction-related problems that arose after he contracted with Bayly Crossing, LLC for the sale and construction of a home, which ultimately led him to forgo settlement. Indeed, in cases such as this one, where the contract for sale and the construction contract are one and the same, a construction-related claim could amount to a breach of contract by the seller, and entitle the buyer to consequential damages. The release from \u201cany and all causes of action\u201d would preclude a claim for consequential damages in this situation, and thus violates CPA \u00a7 13-301(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\n<em>Joint and Several Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The Passyns next contend that the Agency erred by finding them jointly and severally liable for all of the charges. <em>Morgan </em>established the test for holding individuals jointly and severally liable when the Agency determines that a corporation has violated the CPA: The Agency must prove that \u201c(1) the individual participated directly in or had authority to control the deceptions or misrepresentations, and (2) the individual had knowledge of the practices.\u201d <em>See </em>387 Md. at 176, 874 A.2d 919 (adopting the test used by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n v. Amy Travel Serv., Inc., </em>875 F.2d 564 (7th Cir.1989)). The Passyns argue that the <em>Morgan </em>holding was limited to an award of restitution and does not apply to civil penalties. Moreover, the Passyns assert that there was no record evidence to \u201csupport a finding that any of the [violations of the HBRA and CPA by Bayly Crossing, LLC] were undertaken with the participation, control and knowledge to find individual liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>First, we disagree with the Passyns\u2019 assertion that the <em>Morgan </em>test applies only to restitution. The <em>Morgan </em>Court cited \"with approval our decision in <em>State Collection v. Kossol, </em>138 Md.App. 338, 771 A.2d 501 (2001), upholding the Agency\u2019s imposition of joint and several liability for payment of restitution <em>and </em>civil penalties. <em>Morgan, </em>387 Md. at 176, 874 A.2d 919 (citing <em>Kossol, </em>138 Md.App. at 348-49, 771 A.2d 501).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The Passyns correctly point out, however, that <em>Morgan </em>and <em>Kossol </em>addressed only violations of the CPA, and a not a failure to register under the HBRA. Nonetheless, the Consent Order, by its terms, applies \u201cto the new home building activities, whether individually or jointly, of [the Passyns] and any entity in which they are will be involved.\u201d The Passyns argue that the Consent Order did not obligate them to register individually as home builders if they conducted home building activities through an entity. The Agency did not, however, conclude that the Passyns were individually liable because they failed to register individually; rather, the Agency premised the Passyns\u2019 individual liability on their joint participation in an unregistered home building entity. The terms of the Consent Order are sufficient to support individual liability in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Second, we believe the evidence was sufficient to conclude that the Passyns possessed the control and knowledge necessary to impose joint and several liability for the violations committed by Bayly Crossing, LLC. \u201cThe degree of participation in business affairs is probative of knowledge.\u201d <em>Kossol, </em>138 Md.App. at 349, 771 A.2d 501 (quoting <em>Amy Travel, </em>875 F.2d at 574). The Passyns were the sole members of Bayly Crossing, LLC, with each holding a one-third interest; Julia Passyn executed the sales contracts on behalf of Bayly Crossing, LLC; Julia Passyn and Theodore B. Passyn, III represented Bayly Crossing, LLC at settlements with consumers; and each of the Passyns executed the Consent Order making them individually responsible for the home building activities of any entity in which they became involved. Thus, the Passyns participated directly in or had the authority to control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the illegal acts of Bayly Crossing, LLC, and either knew or should have known of its practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\n<em>The civil penalty amount</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The Passyns finally contend that the civil penalty of $25,000 imposed by the Agency was \u201cexcessive and greatly disproportionate to the [violations found].\u201d Violations of the CPA are subject to a maximum fine of $1,000 for each violation, or a maximum of $5,000 for subsequent repeat of the same violation. CPA \u00a7 13-410(a), (b). The Agency must consider the following factors in determining the amount of the penalty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">(1) The severity of the violation for which the penalty is assessed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">(2) The good faith of the violator;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">(3) Any history of prior violations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">(4) Whether the amount of the penalty will achieve the desired deterrent purpose; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">(5) Whether the issuance of a cease and desist order, including restitution, is insufficient for the protection of consumers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">CPA \u00a7 13\u2014410(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">For violations of the HBRA, the Agency is authorized to impose a maximum of $1,000 \u201cfor each day of unlawful practice.\u201d HBRA \u00a7 4.5-502(b)(2). The Passyns take issue with the Agency\u2019s findings with respect to the penalty factors specified by CPA \u00a7 13-410(d), and argue that the Agency erred as a matter of law by assessing civil penalties for the HBRA violations under this provision as opposed to the HBRA\u2019s own penalty provision. We begin with the Agency\u2019s treatment of the CPA \u00a7 13-410(d) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">The Passyns assert that the Agency\u2019s finding that the violations were serious lacks discussion or explanation, and fails to consider that no one was harmed by the violations. First, the fact that the Passyns were subject to a Consent Order requiring them to register any home building entity they became involved in yet still failed to do so is a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>basis for us to defer to the Agency\u2019s assessment that the violations were serious. Second, by passing the CPA, the legislature endeavored to \u201ctake strong protective and preventive steps to investigate unlawful consumer practices, to assist the public in obtaining relief from these practices, and to prevent these practices from occurring in Maryland.\u201d CPA \u00a7 13-102(b)(3). The prophylactic intent of the CPA could not be more plainly stated. Thus, a finding of actual harm to consumers is unnecessary for the Agency to conclude that the violations were serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The Passyns next dispute as unsupported the Agency\u2019s finding that the Passyns did not deal in good faith with the CPD. On the contrary, the Agency noted Bayly Crossing, LLC was acting as an unregistered home builder both before and after the Passyns executed the Consent Order in which they agreed to register any of their home building entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The Passyns also claim that the Agency erred in finding that they had a history of past violations. According to the Passyns, the Consent Order arose from a registration proceeding, not an enforcement action, and thus does not evidence a history of violations. Though the Consent Order does not technically find that the Passyns violated either the CPA or HBRA, it does detail a history of recalcitrance and nondisclosure in their dealings with the CPD, including failing to respond to an administrative subpoena, and failing to disclose open lawsuits and unsatisfied judgments on their registration renewal application. Moreover, the Consent Order specified that a violation of its terms would be considered a second violation of the HBRA and CPA. We view this as sufficient to characterize the Passyns as repeat offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">As to the fourth and fifth factors, the Passyns protest the Agency\u2019s imposition of a monetary penalty instead of a cease and desist order by repeating the same assertions that they are not repeat offenders and caused no actual harm to consumers. We defer to the Agency\u2019s determination that only a substantial monetary penalty will deter future violations, and that a cease and desist order would be ineffective. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Agency noted, the Consent Order demanded that the Passyns comply with the law and they failed to do so. Thus, a harsher penalty was warranted, and even the Passyns acknowledge that the monetary penalty imposed was far lower than that requested by the CPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Finally, the Passyns\u2019 argument that the Agency erroneously imposed civil penalties for HBRA violations under CPA \u00a7 13-410(d) is entirely without merit. In determining the amount of the penalty, the Final Order stated that the Passyns were subjected to fines for \u201ceach of the 827 days that Bayly Crossing, LLC operated as a homebuilder without being registered.\u201d Though not specifically cited, the Agency was clearly referencing the penalty provision in HBRA \u00a7 4.5-501(b)(2), which treats each day of non-compliance as a separate violation. Furthermore, after separately detailing each violation of the CPA, the Agency stated that \u201cthe potential civil penalty for all of these violations under the applicable sections of the [CPA] <em>and [HBRA] </em>... is very large.\u201d (emphasis added). We are satisfied that the agency was well aware of the separate penalty provisions for the CPA and HBRA, and assessed the civil penalty accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">APPEAL BY BAYLY CROSSING, LLC DISMISSED.
