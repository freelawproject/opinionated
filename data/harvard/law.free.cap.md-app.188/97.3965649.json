Scott Frison, Jr., related to his efforts to collect an unpaid legal bill owed by his former client, Jerry J. Mathis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>appellee. Mr. Frison filed suit, <em>pro se, </em>in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, to collect his legal fees. After a jury returned a verdict in Mr. Frison\u2019s favor for $85,818.13, Mr. Frison filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees, alleging \u201cwillful and intentional violations of Maryland Rule 1-341.\u201d The circuit court denied Mr. Frison\u2019s request, concluding that Mr. Frison was not eligible to recover attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Rule 1-341 because he represented himself <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Mr. Frison appealed, raising an issue of first impression: Whether a <em>pro se </em>attorney litigant may recover attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Maryland Rule 1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Mr. Mathis retained Mr. Frison, an attorney licensed in the District of Columbia, to represent him in a lawsuit filed against him by Aaron Hargrove.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury awarded judgment to Mr. Hargrove in the amount of $142,000. Mr. Mathis refused to pay Mr. Frison for the legal fees incurred during the lawsuit, claiming that Mr. Frison had committed errors in the trial that resulted in an unfavorable disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">On October 13, 2005, Mr. Frison filed suit, <em>pro se, </em>in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against Mr. Mathis, to recover the unpaid legal bill.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A two-day jury trial commenced on January 3, 2007. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury entered a verdict against Mr. Mathis in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>$35,818.13. The jury awarded Mr. Frison $30,950.61 for the legal representation that Mr. Frison provided Mr. Mathis at trial and $4,867.52 for Mr. Frison\u2019s work on appeal. On January 12, 2007, Mr. Mathis noted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">On January 29, 2007, Mr. Frison filed a motion in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Md. Rule 1-341. Mr. Frison requested attorney\u2019s fees for 253 hours of work, asserting that \u201c[t]he time spent responding to bad faith filings by Mathis interfered with cases Frison could have taken and earned fees.\u201d At the conclusion of the motion, Mr. Frison signed the following certification, requesting $57,900 in attorney\u2019s fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">I HEREBY CERTIFY AND AFFIRM UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that the entire hours expended in the case, <em>Frison v. Mathis </em>amount to 253 hours as of this filing. I claim that 193 of those hours were expended as a result of the bad faith filings of Mathis [in] <em>Frison v. Mathis. </em>Frison claims entitlement to $57,900 in reasonable attorney\u2019s fees per Maryland Rule 1-341.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The circuit court reserved ruling on Mr. Frison\u2019s motion until after resolution of the underlying case on direct appeal. On October 26, 2007, this Court affirmed the jury\u2019s verdict in an unreported opinion. <em>See Mathis v. Frison, </em>No. 2583, Sept. Term, 2006 (filed October 26, 2007). On November 19, 2007, Mr. Frison filed in this Court a motion for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 1-341, alleging that Mr. Mathis acted in bad faith in pursuing the appeal. On December 17, 2007, this Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">On February 1, 2008, the circuit court held a hearing to resolve Mr. Frison\u2019s outstanding motion for costs and attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 1-341. The circuit court did not address whether Mr. Mathis acted in bad faith; rather, it denied Mr. Frison\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees based on the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Weiner v. Swales, </em>217 Md. 123, 141 A.2d 749 (1958). The court stated that, pursuant to <em>Weiner, </em>\u201cif you\u2019re acting pro se, if you are a member of the Bar ... you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>cannot get attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d The court clarified that Mr. Mathis\u2019 status as an attorney licensed in the District of Columbia, but not licensed to practice law in Maryland, was irrelevant to its order. The court stated: \u201cWere you a Maryland attorney down here ... I [would] rule in the same way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Mr. Frison argues that the trial court erred in denying his request for attorney\u2019s fees. He acknowledges caselaw holding that, with respect to a contractual provision authorizing the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, the attorney representing himself was not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Mr. Frison contends, however, that under the circumstances of his case, <em>ie., </em>an action taken to enforce a judgment for attorney\u2019s fees against the attorney\u2019s former client, he should be allowed to collect attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Mr. Mathis counters that Mr. Frison is barred from recovering attorney\u2019s fees. He relies on Weiner <em>v. Swales, supra, </em>and <em>Greenbriar Condo., Phase I, Council of Unit Owners, Inc. v. Brooks, </em>159 Md.App. 275, 283, 316, 859 A.2d 239 (2004), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>387 Md. 683, 878 A.2d 528 (2005), for the proposition that an attorney representing himself, <em>pro se, </em>is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. Mr. Mathis further contends that the specific language of Rule 1-341 authorizes attorney\u2019s fees only for fees actually \u201cincurred,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>and that Mr. Frison, representing himself, did not incur any attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The circuit court agreed with Mr. Mathis\u2019 argument and concluded that, pursuant to Werner, Mr. Frison was not eligible to receive attorney\u2019s fees because he was representing himself <em>pro se. </em>The court\u2019s conclusion, that Mr. Frison was barred from recovering attorney\u2019s fees based on his <em>pro se </em>status, is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. See Henriquez v. Henriquez, </em>185 Md.App. 465, 476, 971 A.2d 345 (2009) (argument that \u201ccourt has no authority under the statute to award attorney\u2019s fees unless that party actually incurred expenses for legal fees\u201d is a question of law reviewed <em>de' novo), cert. granted, </em>410 Md. 165, 978 A.2d 245 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The issue whether a <em>pro se </em>lawyer litigant may receive an award for attorney\u2019s fees is one on which courts have taken different approaches. <em>See </em>C. Clifford Allen III, Annotation, <em>Right of Party Who Is an Attorney and Appears for Himself to Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees Against Opposing Party as Element of Costs, </em>78 A.L.R.3d 1119 (1977) (discussing states that allow <em>pro se </em>attorney litigants to receive attorney\u2019s fees and those that do not); <em>Connor v. Cal-Az Props., Inc., </em>137 Ariz. 53, 668 P.2d 896, 898 (1983) (same); <em>Swanson &amp; Setzke, Chtd. v. Henning, </em>116 Idaho 199, 774 P.2d 909, 911 (1989) (same). As explained below, we agree with courts from other jurisdictions that there are policy reasons for requiring the existence of an attorney-client relationship before attorney\u2019s fees may be recovered. Because there is no attorney-client relationship when an attorney represents himself, he should not be entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In this case, however, we need only decide whether a <em>pro se </em>attorney litigant is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Rule 1-341. We answer that question in the negative for two reasons. First, this Court and the Court of Appeals have held in other contexts that a <em>pro se </em>attorney litigant is not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees, and the analysis of those cases is applicable to a request for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Rule 1-341. Second, the plain language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Rule 1-341 limits the attorney\u2019s fees recoverable to those <em>incurred. </em>A <em>pro se </em>attorney litigant has not \u201cincurred\u201d any actual expenses in the nature of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">We turn first to the Maryland cases that have addressed the issue whether <em>pro se </em>lawyer litigants may receive an award for attorney\u2019s fees. Although the Maryland appellate courts have not addressed the issue pursuant to Rule 1-341, they have addressed the issue in the context of a contractual provision allowing for attorney\u2019s fees. In two cases, a contract providing for attorney\u2019s fees was construed as allowing for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees only when the party has paid for representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In <em>Weiner, </em>the appellant, an attorney, loaned several thousand dollars to appellee, and he took a confessed judgment note, payable on demand. 217 Md. at 124, 141 A.2d 749. Upon default, pursuant to the terms of the note, he attempted to recover an \u201cattorney\u2019s commission of fifteen (15%) per cent for collection (said 15% to be entered as part of the costs).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals, however, agreed with the trial court that the attorney was \u201cnot entitled to collect such additional compensation when he acts in proper person\u201d because \u201c \u2018implicit in the provisions of the note [is] that the 15% commission shall be payable only to an attorney employed in the case or to the plaintiff in reimbursement for his expenses in employing such an attorney----\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 141 A.2d 749. The Court of Appeals construed the word \u201ccharges\u201d in the note as \u201c \u2018expenses which have been <em>incurred. Id. </em>at 125-26, 141 A.2d 749 (quoting BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 295 (4th ed.1951)). Reading the terms of the note in their usual meaning, the court concluded that \u201cthe agreement of the borrowers was only to reimburse Weiner for his actual monetary expenses or disbursements incurred in the collection of the note and no authority was given him to collect and retain as his own the attorney\u2019s commissions that would have been payable if he had employed and paid counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 141 A.2d 749</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Greenbriar, </em>this Court discussed whether an attorney representing himself in foreclosure proceedings \u201ccould collect attorney\u2019s fees for work on his own behalf\u2019 pursuant to a contractual provision providing for an award of attorney\u2019s fees to \u201cthe prevailing party.\u201d 159 Md.App. at 275, 315, 859 A.2d 239. This Court found that the attorney was not the prevailing party, <em>id. </em>at 316-17, 859 A.2d 239, but it went on to discuss the <em>Weiner </em>decision allowing attorney\u2019s fees only as reimbursement for \u201c \u2018actual monetary expenses....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317-18, 859 A.2d 239 (quoting <em>Weiner, </em>217 Md. at 126, 141 A.2d 749). The Court stated that there was \u201clittle reason why the same principles would not be applicable when the attorney is the debtor and chooses to represent himself or herself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 859 A.2d 239. We noted that there was \u201cnothing in the contract language to suggest that parties representing themselves are entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees that they have not incurred.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Maryland Rule 1-341, similar to the contracts discussed in <em>Weiner </em>and <em>Greenbriar, </em>limits an award of attorney\u2019s fees to fees <em>incurred. </em>The Rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">In any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, <em>incurred </em>by the adverse party in opposing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">(Emphasis added). \u201cAn award of \u2018sanctions\u2019 under this rule is compensatory, not punitive, in nature.\u201d <em>Kilsheimer v. Dewberry &amp; Davis, </em>106 Md.App. 600, 622, 665 A.2d 723 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 Md. 406, 671 A.2d 20 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">This Court has addressed, on several occasions, the requirement of Rule 1-341 that attorney\u2019s fees actually be incurred. Recently, in <em>Worsham v. Greenfield, </em>187 Md.App. 323, 978 A.2d 839 (2009), this Court defined the term \u201cincur,\u201d pursuant to Rule 1-341, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>\u201cIncur\u201d has been defined as \u201cTo suffer or bring on oneself (a liability or expense).\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>771 (7th ed.1999). \u201cLiability\u201d has been defined in part, as \u201cA financial or pecuniary obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 925. \u201cLiable\u201d has been defined, in part, as (of a person) subject to or likely to incur (a fine, penalty, etc.). <em>Id. </em>at 927. <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>682 (1992) defines incur as \u201cto become liable for: <em>to incur debts.\u201d </em>\u201cLiable\u201d is defined as \u201clegally responsible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[at] 781.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">In holding that a party could recover attorney\u2019s fees when the fees were paid for by the party\u2019s insurance company, this Court noted that the Rule was intended to reimburse the payer for monies incurred as a result of a violation of Rule 1-341. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 11-12. Although the party did not pay the fees, there were fees incurred, and paid for, by the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In <em>United States Health, Inc. v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 116, 128, 131, 589 A.2d 485, <em>cert. denied, </em>324 Md. 69, 595 A.2d 482 (1991), this Court awarded attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 1-341 based upon a finding that the appeal was taken in \u201cbad faith.\u201d In determining the amount of attorney\u2019s fees recoverable, however, the Court noted that appellee was a governmental agency represented by in-house counsel, a salaried employee. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 589 A.2d 485. This Court rejected appellee\u2019s argument that it should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with the \u201cprevailing market rate,\u201d and explained that Rule 1-341 \u201cpermits recovery for actual expenses incurred, not for an amount that would have been incurred had the party retained outside counsel who charged an amount that the Court would accept to be a reasonable fee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 131, 589 A.2d 485. Thus, this Court granted attorney\u2019s fees based on the counsel\u2019s hourly salary and other costs paid by appellee. <em>Id. </em>at 131, 589 A.2d 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Similarly, in <em>Seney v. Seney, </em>97 Md.App. 544, 631 A.2d 139 (1993), the question was whether Mrs. Seney could recover attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Rule 1-341, even though she had a contingency fee agreement with her lawyer, she lost the case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>and therefore, she was not liable to pay for any attorney\u2019s fees. This Court answered that question in the negative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEH\">When a party takes money out of her pocket and gives it to the court or to her attorney because of the opposing party\u2019s substantially unjustified or bad faith actions, the court may order reimbursement of that money by the opposing party, or the opposing party\u2019s attorney, to the aggrieved party....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">When, however, a party does not incur any expense for attorney\u2019s fees, those fees cannot be reimbursed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 552, 631 A.2d 139. This Court reiterated that Rule 1-341 \u201conly allows the court to award attorney\u2019s fees actually incurred by the moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553, 631 A.2d 139. Because Mrs. Seney\u2019s attorney was not entitled to a fee under the contingency agreement, she had not incurred fees for which she could obtain reimbursement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">These cases make clear that, pursuant to the plain language of Rule 1-341, the attorney\u2019s fees recoverable are limited to those that reimburse the party for actual expenses incurred. When an attorney represents himself, he has not \u201cincurred\u201d any actual expenses in the nature of attorney\u2019s fees, and therefore, he cannot recover attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Rule 1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Other jurisdictions similarly have concluded that a statute or rule providing for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred does not authorize the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by <em>pro se </em>attorney litigants. <em>See, e.g., Shearer v. Mundt, </em>36 P.3d 1196, 1198 (Alaska 2001) (the purpose of the rule allowing for attorney\u2019s fees \u201cis to compensate litigants for fees they incur through legal representation, not to compensate litigants for the eco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>nomic detriment of litigating\u201d); <em>O\u2019Connell v. Zimmerman, </em>157 Cal.App.2d 330, 321 P.2d 161, 165 (1958) (\u201c[WJhen an attorney represents himself in an action he may not recover the reasonable value of his fee, for he has paid no fee nor has he incurred any liability to pay an attorney fee.\u201d); <em>Calhoun v. Calhoun, </em>339 S.C. 96, 529 S.E.2d 14, 17 (2000) (an attorney who appears on his or her behalf does not incur attorney\u2019s fees because he or she has not paid or does not owe another person money for legal services rendered).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Mr. Frison does not dispute that he has not incurred attorney\u2019s fees. Rather, he argues that public policy justifies a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the requirement that the attorney\u2019s fees be incurred. He argues that attorney\u2019s fees should be allowed for an attorney who appears <em>pro se </em>to collect unpaid attorney debts from the attorney\u2019s former client.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Mr. Frison cites no caselaw that would support a holding by this Court making such an exception to the plain language of Rule 1-341. And he makes no compelling argument why such an exception is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Indeed, there are public policy reasons weighing against adopting such an exception. In <em>Connor, </em>668 P.2d at 899, the Court of Appeals of Arizona discussed policy considerations weighing against allowing an award of attorney\u2019s fees to attorneys appearing on their own behalf. \u201c[CJourts declining to grant fees under such circumstances have found that one should not become one\u2019s own client and charge for professional services and that attorneys representing themselves might be tempted to protract litigation for their own financial betterment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 898. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">In our opinion, the presence of an attorney-client relationship is a prerequisite to the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees.... Because an attorney has no right to recover compensation in the absence of an attorney-client relationship, the corollary must necessarily be true\u2014the party who represents himself in litigation has no right to be compensated by the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees because of the absence of an attorney-client relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 899. <em>Accord Mix v. Tumanjan Dev. Corp., </em>102 Cal.App.4th 1318, 126 Cal.Rptr.2d 267, 271 (2002) (\u201cexistence of the attorney-client relationship means that the attorney is not representing the attorney\u2019s own personal interests\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The Arizona court noted that a contrary view would result in disparate treatment between <em>pro se </em>litigants based on their profession. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">We cannot, however, have one rule which provides for compensation to attorneys when acting on their own behalf and another rule for lay persons acting on their own behalf. We cannot compensate the [litigants] here, who as attorneys could not have vindicated their claim but for the fact that they appeared on their own behalf, and yet deny compensation to lay persons who litigate on their own behalf for the same reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\"><em>Connor, </em>668 P.2d at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The Court of Appeals of Idaho similarly looked to policy considerations in determining that <em>pro se </em>lawyer litigants are not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Swanson, </em>774 P.2d at 913. The court found that \u201cmaintaining public confidence in the even-handed administration of justice\u201d weighed against allowing an attorney representing himself to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 911-13.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">The system would be one-sided and be viewed by the public as unfair, if one party (a lawyer litigant) could qualify for a fee award without incurring the potential out-of-pocket obligation that the opposing party (a nonlawyer) ordinarily must bear in order to qualify for a similar award. Moreover, if both parties opt to litigate <em>pro se, </em>it would be palpably unjust for one of them (the lawyer litigant) to remain eligible for an attorney fee award, while the other becomes ineligible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 913. The court concluded that \u201cthe public perception of fairness in the legal system is of greater moment than a lawyer litigant\u2019s claim to an attorney fee award if he would elect to represent himself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>These cases illustrate that there are public policy reasons against allowing a pro se attorney litigant to recover attorney\u2019s fees. Requiring that an attorney-client relationship exist before allowing the recovery of attorney fees avoids the public perception of unfairness in the legal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">In any event, here, the plain language of Rule 1-341 permits recovery of attorney\u2019s fees <em>incurred. </em>A lawyer who represents himself or herself has not incurred legal fees, <em>i.e., </em>he or she has not paid or become liable to pay fees. Accordingly, a <em>pro se </em>attorney litigant may not recover attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Rule 1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

Although Mr. Frison is not a member of the Maryland Bar, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County admitted him <em>pro hac vice </em>to represent Mr. Mathis in the prior civil lawsuit. Mr. Mathis states in his brief, and the record reflects, that on April 2, 2004, the circuit court ordered \"that due to the frequency in which\u201d Mr. Frison had \u201cbeen admitted <em>pro hac vice </em>in the State of Maryland,\u201d he was \"not to be admitted <em>pro hac vice </em>any time within the next twenty-four (24) months....\u201d The circuit court did not base its ruling on the fact that Mr. Frison is not licensed to practice law in the State of Maryland, and neither do we.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-11\">.

Mr. Frison also argues in his brief that Mr. Mathis was his employer, and therefore, he is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees as part of his effort to collect his unpaid \u201cwages\u201d pursuant to Md.Code (2008 Repl. VoL), \u00a7\u00a7 3-427(d), 3-507.1(b) of the Labor and Employment Article. Mr. Frison did not raise this argument at the hearing on his motion for attorney\u2019s fees in the circuit court, and we decline to address it. <em>See </em>Md.
