The Lease required that the tenant, Ge-bhardt &amp; Smith, pay to the landlord, the MPA, base rent plus a proportional share of the building\u2019s operating expenses. In 2003, a dispute arose regarding the charges for operating expenses. Gebhardt &amp; Smith continued to pay its base rent, but it did not pay the invoices for operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Suit was instituted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Following a bench trial, the circuit court found that Gebhardt &amp; Smith breached the Lease, and it entered a judgment in favor of the MPA for $328,186.88, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith appealed, and it presents two questions for our review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">1. Did the Lease contain a condition precedent to Ge-bhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s obligation to pay its share of operating expenses, and if so, was this condition satisfied?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">2. Where the Lease provided that the determination of operating expenses by \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant\u201d \u201cshall constitute a final determination,\u201d was Gebhardt &amp; Smith precluded from challenging the operating expenses in court?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith, a law firm, leased office space from 1977 until 2006 in the WTC, an office building operated by the MPA and located in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1992, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>executed the Lease at issue, with Gebhardt &amp; Smith renting 30,161 square feet of office space on three floors of the WTC. Gebhardt &amp; Smith agreed to pay $49,011.63 per month in base rent, plus its proportional share of \u201cadditional rent,\u201d which was comprised of \u201creal estate taxes\u201d and \u201coperating expenses.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Article 4 of the Lease defined \u201coperating expenses\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">The term \u201coperating expenses shall mean any and all costs and expenses (except real estate taxes) paid, incurred, or charged by Lessor in connection with the operation, servicing and maintenance of the building, including, but not limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">1) Wages and salaries and costs of employee benefits of employees or independent contractors engaged in the operation and maintenance of the building, including Lessor\u2019s Social Security Taxes and any other governmental taxes which may be levied on such wages and salaries;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">2) All charges and rates connected with water supplied to the building and related sewer use charges;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">3) All charges connected with heat and air conditioning supplied to the building;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">4) The cost of labor and material for cleaning the building, surrounding areaways and windows in the building;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">5) The cost of all electric current supplied to the building;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">6) The cost of fire; casualty, liability and such other insurance customarily provided in connection with an office building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The term \u201coperating expenses\u201d shall include only reasonable and bonafide expenses actually incurred by Lessor and shall not include any of the following: depreciation, administrative overhead expenses, leasing commissions, management or rental agents fees, capital expenditures (which shall include, without limitation, the cost of renovating, decorating or otherwise preparing space in the building for tenants), or any other expenses relating to the ownership and management, as distinguished from the operation, of the building.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Article 4(c) of the Lease, which was included in an addendum, identified how operating expenses would be billed to Gebhardt &amp; Smith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">In the event that the operating expenses incurred by Lessor during any fiscal year following the base year shall exceed the operating expenses incurred by Lessor during the base year Lessee shall pay to Lessor as additional rent for such fiscal year an amount equal to The Percentage<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> of the excess. In the month of June in the base year and each fiscal year thereafter, Lessor shall furnish to Lessee a statement of the estimated operating expenses for the forthcoming fiscal year compared with the base year and shall compute Lessee\u2019s estimated additional rent for such fiscal year as provided herein. If the estimated operating expenses for said fiscal year exceed the operating expenses during the base year Lessee shall pay each month in addition to the base year specified in Article 2 hereof an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the Percentage of the excess. When the statements of the actual operating expenses for such fiscal year are issued by the State Legislative Auditor\u2019s Office or Lessor\u2019s certified public accountants, if the estimated additional rent paid by Lessee exceeds Lessee\u2019s Percentage of the excess operating expenses, Lessor shall promptly either refund the overpayment to Lessee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>or credit the amount thereof against subsequent payments of additional rent under this paragraph c. If the estimated additional rent paid by Lessee is less than Lessee\u2019s Percentage of the excess operating expenses[,] Lessee shall pay the additional rent due within ten (10) days after receipt of a statement therefor from Lessor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Article 4(d) of the Lease is the provision central to this appeal. It provided that the statements of operating expenses to be furnished by Lessor \u201cshall be as determined by Lessor\u2019s certified public accountant\u201d and that the statements furnished \u201cshall constitute a final determination\u201d of the amount of operating expenses owed by Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith to the MPA. This provision provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">The Statements of the real estate taxes and operating expenses to be furnished by Lessor as provided in subdivisions (b) [referring to Real Estate Taxes] and (c) [referring to operating expenses] above shall be as determined by Lessor\u2019s certified public accountant xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. The statements thus furnished to Lessee shall constitute a final determination as between Lessor and Lessee of the real estate taxes and operating expenses for the periods represented thereby.<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">In a letter dated November 8, 2002, the WTC Building Manager advised Gebhardt &amp; Smith that, for the fiscal years ending in 2000 or 2001, there was no increase in the operating expenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">We have received the final Auditor\u2019s report for the actual operating expenses for the World Trade Center for Fiscal Years ending June 30, 2000 and June 30, 2001. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>expenses for Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001 were audited and certified by an independent public accountant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">By this letter, we will adjust the estimated operating expenses per Article 4c of your Lease for the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2003....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The letter advised, however, that the estimated operating expenses for fiscal year 2003 increased, and Gebhardt &amp; Smith was obligated to pay its proportional share of that increase, $17,871.12.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mark Gaspar, Administrative Partner with Ge-bhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith, testified that the firm paid this bill without protest or request for additional information because \u201cit was a small amount\u201d and \u201cthe letter represented ... that the expenses had been audited and certified by an independent public accountant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In September 2003, Hurricane Isabel flooded the WTC and the building was closed from September 19, 2003, until November 10, 2003. During this time, Gebhardt &amp; Smith vacated its offices, moved its files and computers out of the building, and occupied temporary office space to continue operating its law practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">While Gebhardt &amp; Smith was displaced from the WTC, it received a letter and an invoice for actual operating expenses for fiscal year 2002 and estimated operating expenses for 2004. The letter again indicated that the MPA had received \u201cthe Auditor\u2019s report for the actual operating expenses\u201d and, similar to the previous year, stated that the expenses \u201cfor fiscal year 2002 have been audited and certified by an independent public accountant.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The letter informed Gebhardt &amp; Smith that, for fiscal year 2002, it owed an additional $22,854.38 for actual operating expenses over what Gebhardt &amp; Smith had paid for estimated operating expenses. In addition, Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith owed $33,512.28 for estimated operating expenses for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>fiscal year 2004. An invoice indicated that Gebhardt &amp; Smith owed MPA a total of $56,366.66.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Upon receipt of the invoice, Mr. Gaspar testified that he was \u201cshocked\u201d because \u201crent was supposedly being abated at that point,\u201d as a result of the firm\u2019s displacement from the WTC due to Hurricane Isabel, and \u201cthe invoice was requesting payment of $56,000 right away.\u201d Mr. Gaspar took the bill to Jim Smith and Larry Gebhardt, two of the firm\u2019s partners.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In a letter dated December 29, 2003, Gebhardt &amp; Smith responded to the WTC\u2019s building manager regarding the bill it received for actual and estimated operating expenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">We have received your letter of December 22, 2003 relating to the World Trade Center\u2019s operating expenses for fiscal 2002 and its estimated operating expenses for fiscal 2003. Your letter, together with its attachment, expresses the Maryland Port Administration\u2019s contention as to Ge-bhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith[\u2019s] responsibility for a percentage of these actual and estimated operating expenses under the terms of the Lease. Gebhardt &amp; Smith, however, has significant concerns-and potentially substantial disagreements-with the Maryland Port Administration\u2019s computation of the amounts claimed due as actual operating expenses for fiscal 2002 and the estimated operating expenses for fiscal 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">Tenants are responsible solely for operating expenses incurred in connection with \u201cthe operation, servicing, and maintenance of the building.\u201d Tenants are not responsible for expenses in connection with the management and ownership of the building. For this reason, Gebhardt &amp; Smith requests a detailed and comprehensive breakdown of all of the items comprising the categories of purported operating expenses set forth in the Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young Schedule of Actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Operating Expenses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002. Gebhardt &amp; Smith wishes to verify and satisfy itself that the operating expenses aggregated in the schedule are authorized operating expenses under the terms of the Lease, as contrasted to expense of ownership and management. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith has substantial concerns about whether the Maryland Port Administration has made an accurate, good faith estimate of the operating expenses which it legally, under the terms of the Lease, is entitled to pass on to the tenants as additional rent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In a letter dated January 30, 2004, the WTC\u2019s building manager responded to Gebhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s letter and provided Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith with documentation regarding the actual and estimated operating expenses. WTC\u2019s building manager attached two reports prepared by Ernst &amp; Young, LLP (\u201cErnst &amp; Young\u201d), an accounting firm, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The first report, which covered the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2001, stated that Ernst &amp; Young \u201caudited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the general purpose financial statements of the Maryland Department of Transportation as of and for the year ended June 30, 2001.\u201d The report explained that its \u201caudit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the general purpose financial statements of the Maryland Department of Transportation taken as a whole\u201d and \u201cto meet the reporting requirements of the World Trade Center standard lease agreement....\u201d The report then identified the following operating expenses: (1) utilities costing $1,064,288; (2) maintenance costing $752,104; (3) janitorial costing $447,172; (4) security costing $280,490; (5) insurance costing $59,718; and administration costing $73,983.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The second report, which covered the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2002, stated that Ernst &amp; Young \u201caudited, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the basic financial statements of the Maryland Department of Transportation as of and for the year ended June 30, 2002.\u201d The report continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">The information set forth in the accompanying Schedule, which is the responsibility of the Maryland Department of Transportation\u2019s management, is presented for purposes of additional analysis and to meet the reporting requirements of the World Trade Center standard lease agreement and is not a required part of the basic financial statements of the Maryland Department of Transportation. As described in Note 1, the Schedule referred to above has been prepared in accordance with the basis of accounting as defined by Article 4 of the Standard World Trade Center Lease Agreement, which Agreement requires reporting expenses \u2022 at amounts that vary materially from those which would be reported if presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> The Schedule is not intended to be a complete presentation of operating expenses in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or other comprehensive basis of accounting. The information set forth in the accompanying Schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material aspects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The report then identified the following operating expenses: (1) utilities costing $1,006,724; (2) maintenance costing $764,841; (3) janitorial costing $548,888; (4) security costing 393,372; (5) insurance costing $95,105; and (6) administration costing $76,311.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Upon reviewing the reports created by Ernst &amp; Young, Mr. Gaspar concluded that Ernst &amp; Young had not issued \u201ca standard audit opinion\u201d because \u201cit simply states that they\u2019ve audited the financial statements of the Department of Transportation without indicating that they\u2019ve done anything to review the financial statements of the Port Administration itself.\u201d Moreover, Gebhardt &amp; Smith concluded that the audit was insufficient because Ernest &amp; Young \u201chad not determined the operating expenses that they\u2019re required to under the lease.\u201d The reports did not indicate that the auditor \u201creviewed the backup information,\u201d and Gebhardt &amp; Smith believed that the auditor \u201cshould have gone back to the Maryland Port Administration\u2019s records to review their invoices\u201d and the lease \u201cto determine what categories of expenses are properly passed onto tenants.\u201d Consequently, Gebhardt &amp; Smith refused to make any further payment of operating expenses because \u201cwe wanted more information to show that they were going to calculate the amount based on what\u2019s required under the lease and we never received that [information].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The MPA continued to send statements regarding Gebhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s share of the operating expenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Gebhardt &amp; Smith did not pay any bills for operating expenses from 2004 to 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In 2006, Gebhardt &amp; Smith decided to file suit due to concerns \u201cthat if [Gebhardt &amp; Smith] actually did owe money it was building up,\u201d and Gebhardt &amp; Smith \u201cfelt that was the only way that we could force the state to actually give us some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>proper calculation of what we owed.\u201d On April 6, 2006, Gebhardt &amp; Smith filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, requesting that the court issue a declaratory judgment to determine, among other things, \u201cthe actual operating expenses\u201d for 2002 to 2006. Gebhardt &amp; Smith alleged that, as a result of deficit concerns facing the State in 2003, the State decided to sell the WTC, and it \u201cset out to increase the revenue generated by the building.\u201d Gebhardt &amp; Smith contended that \u201cthe only avenue for MPA to generate additional revenue from the building was to increase the operating expense pass throughs that were billed to tenants as additional rent.\u201d It claimed that, \u201c[b]y inflating the operating expenses passed on to the tenants, MPA could increase its profit from the leasing activity\u201d and this would \u201cdeceptively make the building appear more profitable than it actually was and potentially enable the building to command a higher price upon its sale.\u201d Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith cited costs for security and the apportionment of liability insurance as \u201cegregious example[s]\u201d of \u201cinflated, improper and unauthorized charges[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Gebhardt &amp; Smith also requested that the court declare that it \u201cis not responsible for paying its percentage of the increase in annual real property taxes that will result from MPA selling the World Trade Center to a person that is not tax exempt[,]\u201d that \u201cMPA is estopped from including the salary and benefits of MDTA Police as an operating expense[,]\u201d and that Ge-bhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith \u201cdoes not owe pre-judgment or contractual interest on the amount of any additional rent for increase in operating expenses for any fiscal year after the base year that may be its obligation under the lease[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">On June 30, 2006, MPA filed an answer and a counterclaim. The counterclaim alleged that Gebhardt &amp; Smith breached the Lease agreement when it failed to pay operating expenses from September 30, 2003, to June 2006, the MPA requested that the court enter a judgment against Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith for $302,882.45, plus fees and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In July 2006, Gebhardt &amp; Smith vacated its leased office space in the WTC. The Lease expired on September 30, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>and Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith paid all base rent owed through the termination of the Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">On July 27, 2006, Gebhardt &amp; Smith filed an amended complaint, adding a claim that the MPA engaged in \u201cconstructive fraud.\u201d It alleged that the MPA \u201cowed a limited fiduciary duty to Gebhardt &amp; Smith ... to account for the actual operating expenses ...\u201d which it \u201cfailed to fulfill\u201d \u201cby asking for operating expenses it knew were not due.\u201d Gebhardt &amp; Smith alleged that \u201cErnst &amp; Young LLP falsified the operating expense calculation to assist and to aid and abet MPA in its efforts to defraud Gebhardt &amp; Smith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">On October 10, 2006, Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith filed a motion to dismiss its Declaratory Judgment Complaint on the ground that it involved the same issues as the counter-claim, <em>ie., </em>\u201cMPA asserts that additional rent is due, and Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith denies that any additional rent is owed.\u201d Gebhardt &amp; Smith explained: \u201cBecause of the counter-claim, the case is fundamentally a collection case for an alleged breach of lease,\u201d and \u201cMPA is the natural plaintiff and Gebhardt &amp; Smith, the natural defendant.\u201d The court granted Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith\u2019s motion and dismissed Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith\u2019s complaint for a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">On April 23, 2007, MPA filed an amended counterclaim. Count I alleged that Gebhardt &amp; Smith breached its contract with the MPA when it did not pay for \u201cadditional rent\u201d under the Lease. Count II alleged that Gebhardt &amp; Smith was unjustly enriched when Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith received \u201cthe benefit of services for which other WTC tenants have paid,\u201d but it has refused \u201cto pay the operating expense increase required under its lease[.]\u201d MPA requested that the court enter judgment in its favor for $400,502.84, plus prejudgment interest at 12 percent per year, and a 17 percent fee \u201cto cover all State collection and administrative costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>On May 7, 2007, Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith filed a Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment, arguing that the Lease is \u201cvoid and unenforceable\u201d because the MPA \u201cmay not, within the limitations of the Maryland Constitution and the Maryland Port Administration\u2019s governing statute, operate a commercial office building catering to and occupied predominantly by businesses that have nothing to do with maritime trade or activities.\u201d The court denied Gebhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">On June 18, 2007, the MPA and the State of Maryland, Central Collection Unit (\u201cCCU\u201d) filed a second amended counterclaim, which added CCU as an additional plaintiff. On June 27, 2007, Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith responded and filed a Motion to Strike Second Amended Counterclaim, arguing that \u201cdelinquent accounts which are referred to the CCU for collection are subject to a 17% collection fee\u201d and \u201cit appears that the MPA\u2019s real motive for referring its claim against [Gebhardt &amp; Smith] to the CCU is simply to artificially inflate the amount of its claim by 17%.\u201d The court granted Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">On February 25, 2008, the MPA filed a motion for summary judgment, raising three arguments why judgment should be entered in its favor. First, the MPA argued that, \u201c[b]ecause G &amp; S has identified no fraudulent or bad faith conduct by MPA in compiling the operating expenses for relevant fiscal years, G &amp; S is bound by the \u2018final determination\u2019 of these expenses.\u201d Second, the MPA argued that it was entitled to summary judgment based on sovereign immunity. Third, the MPA argued that \u201cG &amp; S waived its right to rescind or avoid its obligations under the 1992 WTC Lease\u201d when it continued to occupy the office space after receiving the documentation provided by the MPA regarding operating expenses. The circuit court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">On February 26, 2008, Gebhardt &amp; Smith moved for summary judgment, arguing that the contract was unenforceable because the MPA failed to satisfy a condition precedent in the contract, that an independent, certified public accountant cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>tify the amount of operating expenses. The circuit court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">On June 23, 2008, trial commenced. Michael Miller, Director of Maritime Commercial Management with the Maryland Port Authority, testified that the MPA is part of the Maryland Department of Transportation (\u201cMDOT\u201d), and the MPA operates the WTC on behalf of MDOT. He testified that there are costs associated with operating the World Trade Center, including basic management costs, utility costs, security, insurance, operating expenses, and leasing costs, and each tenant, pursuant to its lease agreement, pays its proportional share of operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Joe Ford, the assistant comptroller with the Maryland Port Administration, testified that he was involved in the preparation of the operating expense schedules for MPA beginning in 2000. The MPA uses an electronic accounting system called Financial Management Information System (\u201cFMIS\u201d) to track invoices and payments. Mr. Ford\u2019s office made the initial determination whether an invoice should be classified as an operating expense that would be billed and paid by the WTC\u2019s tenants. After Mr. Ford compiled the numbers and accumulated all the supporting documentation, the MDOT Office of Audits reviewed the information and made adjustments to the numbers, where necessary. For example, in 2001, they recommended adjustments of $128,000. When the audit by MDOT was complete, they sent the \u201cformal audit report\u201d to the outside auditor, who was either Ernst &amp; Young or SB &amp; Company, and also provided Mr. Ford with a copy of the report.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Once Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young or SB &amp; Company completed its procedures, it provided Mr. Ford with a copy of the report that it created. When Mr. Ford received the report from Ernst &amp; Young or SB <em>&amp; </em>Company, the bill was sent to tenants for actual operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Mr. Ford testified that he understood the phrase \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant,\u201d as used in Article 4(d) of the Lease, to refer to the work performed by Ernst &amp; Young or SB &amp; Company, not the Office of Audits. Mr. Ford is not a certified public accountant, but he has an \u201cinternal auditor certification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Mark Gaspar, Administrative Partner with Gebhardt &amp; Smith, testified that he was responsible for paying the rent for the office space rented by Gebhardt &amp; Smith. Mr. Gaspar testified that, ordinarily, the operating expense bills were \u201cfairly small,\u201d and he did not spend very much time reviewing the bill before it was paid. In 2002, Mr. Gaspar paid a bill for operating expenses for approximately $4,800 \u201c[b]ecause it was a small amount\u201d and \u201cthe letter represented to me that it had been ... audited and certified by an independent public accountant.\u201d Mr. Gaspar stated that, if the letter had not included this statement, he would have asked \u201cfor further information to make sure that they were not just calculated by [the WTC\u2019s building manager] or someone with the building.\u201d Upon receiving the bill for $56,000 in operating expenses in 2003, however, Mr. Gaspar took the bill to two other partners with Gebhardt &amp; Smith. Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith initially requested additional information from the WTC building manager, but it ultimately decided not to pay the bill because, after the reviewing the documentation provided by the WTC, it did not believe that the MPA had complied with the terms of the Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">James Smith, Managing Partner with Gebhardt &amp; Smith, testified that Gebhardt &amp; Smith leased office space in the WTC beginning in 1977. Following Hurricane Isabel, while Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith was displaced from the WTC, Mr. Gaspar brought to his attention a bill for operating expenses. Mr. Smith characterized the increase from the prior year as a \u201cvery de minimus amount.\u201d Mr. Smith testified that he understood the phrase \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant\u201d to refer to \u201csomebody independent\u201d of the MPA and MDOT, and it was \u201cof great importance to us that an independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>public accountant] following audit standards verified [the operating expense] numbers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Christine Carmon, Fiscal Accounts Manager with the MPA, testified that she prepared invoices for operating expenses for each tenant of the WTC. She testified that the letter that she sent to Gebhardt &amp; Smith, indicating that WTC\u2019s operating expenses were \u201caudited and certified by an independent public accountant,\u201d was a \u201cform letter that was handed off\u2019 to her by her predecessor. She explained that, upon receiving \u201cthe report from the independent auditor,\u201d she would mail invoices for operating expenses to each tenant of the WTC. She testified, however, that the report from the accountants was not required by the Lease. She further testified that Ge-bhardt &amp; Smith paid all of its base rent, but it had not paid its share of the operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Joseph Lambdin,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Director of the Maryland Department of Transportation, Office of Audits, testified that he is a certified public accountant. He oversees the work of his office, which conducted audits on the WTC\u2019s operating expenses for fiscal years 2001-2006. Mr. Lambdin testified that he has managers that \u201cdo the first line supervision of the work,\u201d but he monitors the progress and signs the work. The Office of Audits employs three managers and six staff auditors; some of these auditors are certified public accountants.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Mr. Lambdin testified that, pursuant to government auditing standards, there was no independence issue with regard to his office performing audit procedures on the MPA. He testified that his office was free from any impairments, including personal, organizational, and external impairments.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>plained that he reports directly to the head of the agency, the Secretary of the Department of Transportation, as one method used to allow the office to remain independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Mr. Lambdin testified that his office performed auditing procedures relating to the WTC\u2019s operating expenses. The procedure involved obtaining a schedule of operating expenses from the MPA for the World Trade Center,\u201d selecting a sample for each category of expense, and looking for documentation \u201cto support the samples for the items that were selected in the sample.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Mr. Lambdin\u2019s staff reviewed the expenses to determine if they were bona fide, if they were reasonable, and if the expense related to ownership as opposed to operation of the facility.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>In 2001, after performing these procedures, the auditors from his office \u201cdetermined that there were several expenditures not allowable in accordance with the standard lease agreement.\u201d These items included: (1) \u201c$91,051 of capital renovations and administrative overhead expenses,\u201d which are specifically excluded in the lease as operating expenses; (2) \u201c$42,904 for telephone costs that were not attributable to the operation and maintenance of the WTC\u201d; (3) telephone costs of $16,690, which were allocated to WTC operation, but \u201ccould not be verified\u201d; and (4) $25,000 \u201cfor 21st floor room rental admin assistant expenses,\u201d which \u201ccould not be verified.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">For fiscal year 2002, Mr. Lambdin\u2019s office again performed audit procedures on the WTC\u2019s operating expenses. It identified two errors in the initial calculations: (1) an error in the security expenses in the amount of $1,838; and (2) \u201c[t]he calculation of liability insurance attributable to the operation of the WTC was overstated by $3,755.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Mr. Lambdin\u2019s office also audited the WTC\u2019s operating expenses for fiscal years 2003 through 2006. For each of these years, Mr. Lambdin sent a letter advising that the Office of Audits had \u201cdetermined\u201d that the MPA\u2019s operating expenses for those years were \u201cadequately documented\u201d and \u201callowable\u201d in accordance with the standard lease agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In addition to the audits performed by his office, which he identified as internal government auditors, Mr. Lambdin\u2019s office contracted with a private accounting firm to audit the WTC\u2019s operating expenses. For fiscal years 2001 through 2004, the contract was with Ernst &amp; Young, and for fiscal years 2005 and 2006, the contract was with Abrams, Foster, Nole, &amp; Williams, who subcontracted with SB &amp; Company, LLC to perform this work.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The procedures that his staff performed were auditing procedures agreed upon with these two accounting firms. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Lambdin sent the accounting firms the reports of the audits his office performed. Mr. Lambdin testified to his belief that he was not \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant,\u201d as identified in the Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The MPA next presented the testimony of Lawrence Klumpp, a certified public accountant and a former manager in Ernst &amp; Young\u2019s public sector group. Mr. Klumpp testified that he worked on the operating expense schedules for the WTC as part of the MDOT audit for most of fiscal years 2003, 2004 and 2005. Mr. Klumpp testified that independence is a key concept in auditing, and the independence requirement was satisfied when, pursuant to the applicable accounting standards, Ernst &amp; Young had the MDOT Office of Audits perform an internal audit. The MDOT auditors followed established audit procedures that were for the purpose of documenting the allowable \u201coperating expenses in accordance with the standard lease agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Mr. Klumpp explained the procedures Ernst &amp; Young performed after it received the report of the internal audit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1X\">[Ernst &amp; Young] reviewed the schedule of operating expenses prepared by the lessor, the MPA, in accordance with Article Four of the standard lease agreement in order to determine the amount of additional rent that may be due under the term of the lease. [Ernst &amp; Young] reviewed Article Four of the standard lease agreement in order to determine that the charges that were to be included or excluded in the operating expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Mr. Klumpp explained that if an expense did not fit with the Lease definition of operating expenses: \u201cWe would have brought it to the attention of management. We would have asked for clarification on those expenses and then determine[d] whether or not it met the criteria.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">In response to the court\u2019s question regarding what happened when they noticed \u201cthis gigantic jump in operating expenses,\u201d Mr. Klumpp testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">We actually performed within our procedures an analytical view to compare some of the costs. And we asked for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>explanations of those. We actually tested on a sample basis some of those expenditures to make sure they were reasonable as per the lease agreement. As well as that they made\u2014the explanations made sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">So, for instance, if something increased why did it increase and what was the quantifiable and qualifiable reason for that increase so that we really understood it, because a lot of that is our own professional judgment and if we don\u2019t get the answers that make sense we continue to dig to get the correct answers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Mr. Klumpp gave as an example expenses with respect to security. He testified that an increase in expenses was expected after the events of September 11, 2001. Mr. Klumpp subsequently testified, however, that Ernst &amp; Young did not spend time to determine whether expenses that were incurred in the operation of the WTC were reasonable expenses pursuant to the requirement in the Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Mr. Klumpp testified that Ernst &amp; Young did not do a \u201cstand alone audit\u201d of the WTC expenses. Rather, it performed an audit \u201cin relation to\u201d the MDOT financial statements. Mr. Klumpp explained that the procedures were not different for an \u201cin relation to\u201d audit, but the standards for materiality would be different. Materiality, he explained, is a \u201ccalculation that we do in determining whether a number ... is materially incorrect,\u201d which for MDOT \u201cis around $2 million,\u201d but for the WTC would be \u201cabout $30,000 to $40,000.\u201d He further testified that, given MDOT\u2019s \u201cvery large balance sheet,\u201d materiality would be different in an \u201cin relation to\u201d audit as opposed to a \u201cstand alone\u201d audit. He testified that the schedule of operating expenses for the WTC, as part of MDOT\u2019s total consolidated financial statements, \u201cis actually immaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Monique Booker, a certified public accountant with SB <em>&amp; </em>Company, testified that, in 2005 and 2006, her accounting firm contracted with Abrams, Foster, Nole, &amp; Williams to \u201cperform the procedures\u201d and determine whether the operating expenses that were provided to her firm \u201cwere in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>with the lease.\u201d She explained that an audit does not encompass a review of 100 percent of the material provided. Rather, \u201c[y]ou determine the materiality threshold and you perform testing in order to issue an opinion that those statements are not materially misstated, which would not cover 100 percent of any sample, in order to issue that opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The MDOT internal auditors selected a sample of the operating expenses compiled by the MPA, they reviewed the invoices and documentation, and they verified the propriety of the expenses. They advised SB &amp; Company that they had \u201cdetermined\u201d that the WTC operating expenses were \u201cadequately documented and allowable in accordance with the standard lease agreement.\u201d Ms. Booker testified that it was her understanding that the MDOT auditors were not engaged to perform a full audit of the operating expenses for the WTC in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">After her firm was provided the operating expenses for the WTC, she looked \u201cat the supporting documentation for that expenditure,\u201d to verify that the expenditure related to the description. Her firm then \u201cdetermined that the expenses that were provided to us were in accordance with the World Trade Center lease.\u201d She testified that they looked to whether the expenses were included as operating expenses pursuant to the lease and they verified that the expenses were supported by proper documentation, but they did not determine whether an invoice was for a reasonable amount. For example, she testified that, with respect to insurance, \u201c[w]e confirmed that it was insurance and that there was proper invoice support that that was the amount of the insurance incurred\u201d by the MPA, but her firm did not determine whether the MPA\u2019s $150,000,000 liability policy on the WTC was a reasonable amount for an office building.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Brent Solomon, a certified public accountant with the Res-nick Group, a certified public accounting and consulting firm, testified on behalf of MPA as an expert witness in \u201ccommercial leases and accounting.\u201d He testified that it is typical in a commercial lease for the tenant to share increases in operating expenses. Operating expenses \u201c[t]ypically included ... any expense required to run the building,\u201d including utilities, maintenance, security, cleaning, and insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Mr. Solomon testified regarding the Lease provision that \u201coperating expenses\u201d \u201cshall be as determined by Lessor\u2019s certified public accountant.\u201d He testified that \u201cif the intent is to require an independent audit,\u201d \u201cit is typical to be more clear to say independent.\u201d He testified that the language in this Lease did not require an audit of the schedule of operating expenses, and the reference to a \u201ccertified public accountant\u201d described \u201ca person holding a license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Mr. Solomon testified that the procedures for review of the operating expenses in this case, with internal accounting, internal auditors, and external auditors, were \u201cextensive.\u201d He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">[T]here\u2019s no rule in accounting that says that you have to have internal auditors involved or you have to have external auditors involved. In my experience, I see it all across the board. I work with many properties where there are no internal or external audits. Statements are just provided to tenants. And I\u2019ve worked with clients that have external audits of their statement of operating expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">So I think the two\u2014the two levels of independent audit, if you will, in my mind are fairly extensive based on my experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">When asked by the court whether the internal audit alone would have been sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Lease, Mr. Solomon answered in the affirmative, stating that \u201cthe [MDOT] internal auditors would qualify as the lessor\u2019s certified public accountant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">On cross-examination, Mr. Solomon characterized Ernst &amp; Young\u2019s report as a \u201csupplemental opinion.\u201d He testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\u201c[n]o completely independent certified public accountant ever issued a stand alone statement [of operating expenses].\u201d He testified, however, that there was no requirement in the Lease for such an audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The MPA called several witnesses to testify regarding the reasonableness of the operating expenses charged. Witnesses testified, among other things, regarding the basis for, and the reasonableness of, liability insurance carried by the WTC and the security at the WTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Gebhardt &amp; Smith called three expert witnesses. Paul White, a consultant on property management, testified as an expert in commercial office building management. Mr. White testified that the Lease provision for a determination of operating expenses by \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant\u201d implied that a third party, an independent accountant, would review the operating expenses. He agreed that, if that is the intent, it should say \u201cindependent,\u201d but he testified that \u201cthis is a lease out of the 70s, and they were ambiguous.\u201d He agreed that an audit by a certified public accountant would satisfy the Lease \u201c[a]s specifically written,\u201d but \u201cit would not be the spirit of the agreement.\u201d He further agreed that \u201can outside auditor like Ernst [&amp;] Young would satisfy the requirement,\u201d \u201c[i]f they did a complete audit.\u201d Mr. White testified that an audit conducted by the MPA or MDOT would not satisfy the Lease because they are not independent, they are \u201cunder the control and guidance of their bosses and their superiors.\u201d He admitted, however, that he is not an accountant, and he did not know whether \u201cgenerally accepted government accounting standards would consider\u201d an audit by MDOT auditors of the MPA to be independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Mr. White also testified that certain costs billed to Gebhardt &amp; Smith were included improperly as operating expenses under the lease, including costs related to security, janitorial services, and administration. Mr. White testified that tenants sometimes negotiate a limit, \u201cin terms of dollar amount or percentage increase,\u201d on operating expenses, but no such limit was included in this Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Paul Amoruso, an insurance consultant, testified as an expert in commercial insurance. Mr. Amoruso testified that the $150,000,000 liability policy on the WTC was an excessive amount of insurance, which he characterized as \u201chighly unusual.\u201d He also opined that MPA\u2019s method of determining the proper level of insurance on the building, <em>i.e., </em>a method based on revenue projection, bore no \u201crelationship to the exposure produced by this particular building.\u201d With respect to the amount of casualty insurance on the building, he similarly testified that the \u201camount of the insurance on the building was extremely high.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Andrew Lombardo, a certified public accountant with Sturn, Wagner, Lombardo &amp; Company, LLC, testified as an expert in financial accounting. He testified that the Lease required that \u201coutside accountants determine the expenses of the World Trade Center,\u201d which can be done in one of two ways: \u201cThey can do the bookkeeping or they can audit somebody else[\u2019]s bookkeeping, and neither was done.\u201d With respect to the determination of operating expenses, he testified that Mr. Ford, and not a certified public accountant, determined Ge-bhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s operating expenses. Mr. Lombardo testified that, although not unusual for a person such as Mr. Ford to initially compile the data, \u201cfor it to be deemed to be determined by a CPA, the CPA would have to audit it themselves.\u201d Mr. Lombardo testified that the MDOT auditors did not consult \u201coutside expertise,\u201d and they \u201csimply accepted the charge from the State and verified that thats [sic] what the State ... allocated to the Port Authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Mr. Lombardo distinguished an audit, which he contends was never performed, and the procedures that the private firms performed here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">An audit is a comprehensive approach that includes the study, analysis of internal control. It includes a study and consideration of fraud being a possible audit risk. It includes outside confirmation of certain items that would verify the expenses that, the items that they found within the books of the World Trade Center. It includes consultation with experts in areas that the auditors are not expert to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>determine the reasonableness and bona fide-ness of certain expenses. It includes confirmation with the entities!\u2019] attorney to determine that there are no other expenses or contingencies that must be considered and included and accrued into that or should the attorney advise them of such matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">And I could go on. It[\u2019]s a very comprehensive approach to that body of procedures that must be done in order for us to render an audit opinion ... it[\u2019]s the highest level of assurance that we as professionals can give the users of that report or any set of financial statements. What they did was selected procedures that were determined by the Maryland Department of Transportation, not by Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young or SB &amp; Company or anyone else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Mr. Lombardo further explained how, in his opinion, the work of the two accounting firms was deficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">They should have, on their own, planned the work. They should have, on their own, independent from the employees of the entity to which the procedures were performed, they should have determined what should have been, the scope of the work that had to be done to sign their name to that report. They should have [] had their own employees supervise and test and re-perform the work done by the internal auditors to make sure that what they said they did on their work papers they actually did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">And the way you do that is the report signing auditor, when they take responsibility for somebody else[\u2019]s work, ask to retest their work to make sure that they say this invoice agreed to this record in the books. They have to put their own eyes on that and make sure that that[\u2019]s, what they said they did, they did. And I do not see them having done any of that in the work given to me with regard to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">Moreover, he testified that based on the size of the World Trade Center in relation to the size of the Maryland Port Administration, and more importantly the size of the Department of Transportation, that the World Trade Center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>expenses are so insignificant to the overall expenses and accounts of those entities that, in my opinion, most probably [ ] never fell under ... scrutiny of an auditor because of its relative insignificance to the overall entity that was, in fact, audited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Mr. Lombardo further testified that several expenses were charged improperly to Gebhardt &amp; Smith. He specified certain invoices, some administrative costs, and charges for operating expenses while the WTC was closed following Hurricane Isabel.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The parties also submitted depositions of three certified public accountants employed by Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young. Mr. Stephen Baloga stated in his deposition that Ernst &amp; Young was the auditor for MDOT for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. He explained the in-relation-to reports that they prepared regarding the operating expenses of the WTC. Mr. Baloga stated that, under government auditing standards, the MDOT auditors could qualify as independent auditors. He stated that Ernst &amp; Young did not do an audit of the operating expenses. They did an audit of MDOT and then \u201cissued an in-relation-to report relative to the schedule of operating expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On July 15, 2008, the court issued an order entering judgment in favor of the MPA for $328,186.88, plus interest. In its written opinion, the court rejected Gebhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s argument that the Lease imposed a requirement on MPA to have its operating expenses audited by an <em>independent </em>certified public accountant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">G <em>&amp; </em>S maintains that as a condition precedent, MPA was required to have an independent certified public accountant determine the actual operating expenses at year\u2019s end. The lease does not refer to an <em>independent </em>certified public accountant. It required Lessor\u2019s certified public accountant to determine the operating expenses. The confusion may have been caused by MPA\u2019s annual form letter which stated that the expenses were \u201caudited and certified by an independent public accountant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The lease is unambiguous and the plain meaning of written words in an unambiguous lease govern the rights and obligations of the parties, not the subjective intention of one of the parties. The lease is read to have the meaning that a reasonable person in the position of the parties would understand it to have. <em>Walton v. Mariner Health of Md. </em>Inc.[,] 391 Md. 643, 660, 894 A.2d 584, 594 (2006). While Joe Ford, assistant controller [sic] for MPA, is not a certified public accountant, Joseph Lambdin, the head of the MDOT audit team, is a certified public accountant. Certified public accountants are held to professional ethical and work standards by the very nature of their training and certification. This Court found Mr. Lambdin\u2019s testimony credible. He explained that the audits performed by his office were consistent with government auditing standards and performed by certified public accountants. According to the testimony, the MDOT Office of Audits obtained a schedule of operating expenses from the MPA, selected a statistically valid random sample of entries, and verified that those entries were allowable in accordance with the lease agreement. The MDOT Office of Audits reported the results of its audit procedure to MPA, and recommended adjustments to various expense categories. This Court finds that this was a determination of the operating expenses by a certified public accountant as required by the lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">With respect to the argument that the outside certified public accountant satisfied the terms of the Lease, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">This Court does have concerns about MPA\u2019s argument that the function performed by the independent certified public accountants was an audit of WTC\u2019s operating expenses. The independent certified public accountants were hired to perform an audit of the WTC expenses \u201cin relation to\u201d the MDOT audit. While the experts disagreed about whether an \u201cin relation to\u201d audit was proper in this situation, everyone agreed that the audit of the WTC could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>stand alone and must be viewed in relationship to the MDOT data. This Court agrees with G &amp; S\u2019 financial expert that while an audit does not require a check of each entry, an auditor must evaluate the numbers in relation to the other numbers provided to determine if they are reasonable. Because the MDOT audit involved values close to $100 million dollars and the WTC only involved values of $3 million dollars, the WTC numbers would not be statistically significant at all in an audit of the entire MDOT. Without the MDOT audit attached, the WTC numbers would have been difficult to understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\">While this Court agrees that the determinations made by [Ernst &amp; Young] and [SB &amp; Company] did not comply with the terms of the lease, the audit by MDOT auditors of the operating expenses did comply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Finally, the court addressed the argument that, pursuant to the terms of the Lease, which indicated that the certified public accountant\u2019s calculations were \u201cfinal,\u201d Gebhardt &amp; Smith was precluded from challenging whether the operating expenses were calculated correctly. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">Further, because the lease specifies that any determination made by the Lessor\u2019s certified public accountant (\u201cCPA\u201d) is final, there is no need for this Court to examine whether the operating expenses were calculated correctly. The calculations of the CPA are presumed to be correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">This timely appeal followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">In a case tried without a jury, \u201cthe appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(c). \u201cUnder the clearly erroneous standard, \u2018we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and decide not whether the trial judge\u2019s conclusions of fact were correct, but only whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>they were supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Royal Inv.

It asserts two grounds of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">First, Gebhardt &amp; Smith argues that there was a condition precedent to its obligation to pay for operating expenses, that the operating expenses be determined by an outside, independent, certified public accountant. Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith argues that the MPA \u201cdid not satisfy this condition precedent,\u201d and therefore, it was not entitled to collect operating expenses from Gebhardt &amp; Smith. It contends that the circuit court erred in finding that the contract did not require that an independent certified public accountant determine the expenses, and that the internal audit by MDOT satisfied the requirement in the Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Second, Gebhardt &amp; Smith argues that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the provision in the Lease that the determination of operating expenses by the certified public accountant was \u201cfinal.\u201d The circuit court found that, pursuant to this language, the certified public accountant\u2019s determination could not be contested. Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith disputes this interpretation of the Lease, arguing that the Lease did not unequivocally state that the determination could not be contested, and that even if the Lease is so construed, it could be challenged for bad faith or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The MPA contends that the circuit court properly concluded that Gebhardt &amp; Smith breached the Lease. It argues that the determination of expenses by a certified public accountant was not a condition precedent to Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith\u2019s obligation to pay operating expenses. Even if it was a condition precedent, the Lease did not require that MPA\u2019s certified public accountant be \u201cindependent,\u201d and the circuit court properly found that the work of MDOT\u2019s internal auditors constituted a determination of the operating expenses as required by the Lease. The MPA further notes that, although not relied upon by the circuit court, private accounting firms verified the MDOT auditor\u2019s determination of the operating expenses to meet the \u201creporting requirements of the World Trade Center standard lease agreement.\u201d Finally, the MPA argues that the circuit court properly concluded that Gebhardt &amp; Smith did not have the right to dispute the statement of operating expenses it provided because the Lease stated that the statement of expenses \u201cshall constitute a <em>final determination </em>as between Lessor and Lessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">\u201cThe interpretation of a written contract is ordinarily a question of law for the court and, therefore, is subject to <em>de novo </em>review by an appellate court.\u201d <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., </em>368 Md. 232, 250, 768 A.2d 620 (2001). \u201cMaryland adheres to the principle of the objective interpretation of contracts.\u201d <em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 16, 919 A.2d 700 (2007). \u201c Tf a contract is unambiguous, the court must give effect to its plain meaning and not contemplate what the parties may have subjectively intended by certain terms at the time of formation.\u2019 \u201d <em>All State Home Mort., Inc. v.

Moreover, \u201c[i]t is a fundamental principle of contract law that it is \u2018improper for the court to rewrite the terms of a contract, or draw a new contract for the parties, when the terms thereof are clear and unambiguous, simply to avoid hardships.\u2019 \u201d <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 445, 727 A.2d 358 (1999) (quoting <em>Canoras v.

Specifically, Gebhardt &amp; Smith argues: (1) language in the Lease providing that the operating expenses \u201cshall be as determined by Lessor\u2019s certified public accountant\u201d constituted a condition precedent; (2) the condition precedent was that the expenses be \u201cdetermined\u201d by an \u201coutside, independent certified public accountant\u201d; (3) the MPA failed to fulfill this requirement; and (4) this failure excused Gebhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s contractual obligation to pay increases in operating expenses from 2002 to 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The MPA disagrees, for two reasons. First, it argues that \u201c[t]he Lease did not condition G <em>&amp; </em>S\u2019s duty to pay for operating expense increases on the \u2018determination\u2019 of the statements of actual operating expenses by MPA\u2019s certified public accountants.\u201d It argues that the Lease did not include language commonly used to indicate a condition precedent, <em>i.e., </em>it did not provide that Gebhardt &amp; Smith had to pay operating expenses \u201cif and only if\u2019 or \u201cprovided that\u201d MPA\u2019s certified public accountant determined the operating expenses. Rather, the MPA argues that \u201c[t]he Lease unqualifiedly and without condition required G <em>&amp; </em>S to pay for operating expense increases.\u201d Second, the MPA argues that, even if the Lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>contained a condition precedent, the MPA complied with the Lease when the MDOT Office of Audits determined that operating expenses compiled by MPA \u201cwere allowable in accordance with\u201d the Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\u201cA condition precedent in a contract is \u2018a fact, other than mere lapse of time, which, unless excused, must exist or occur before a duty of immediate performance of a promise arises.\u2019 \u201d <em>All State Home Mort., </em>187 Md.App. at 182, 977 A.2d 438 (quoting <em>Chirichella v.

Although no particular form of words is necessary in order to create an express condition, such words and phrases as \u2018if and \u2018provided that,\u2019 are commonly used to indicate that performance has expressly been made conditional, as have the words \u201cwhen,\u2019 \u2018after,\u2019 \u2018as soon as,\u2019 or \u2018subject to____\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-8\"><em>Aronson &amp; Co. v.

As the MPA points out, however, because of \u201cthe potentially severe implications of the imposition of a condition precedent, courts have been careful to distinguish a condition precedent from a covenant, which ordinarily requires only substantial compliance.\u201d <em>B &amp; P Enters., </em>133 Md.App. at 607, 758 A.2d 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Several cases are instructive in determining whether there was a condition precedent in the Lease. In <em>Laurel Race </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number><em>Course, Inc. v. Regal Construction Co., Inc., 274 </em>Md. 142, 150, 333 A.2d 319 (1975), the parties contracted to rebuild a race track. The Court of Appeals set forth the general rule that, \u201cwhere payments under a contract are due only when the certif\u00edcate of an architect or engineer is issued, production of the certificate becomes a condition precedent to liability of the owner for materials and labor in the absence of fraud or bad faith....\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that case, the contract provided that <em>\u201cwhen [the Engineer] finds the work acceptable ... </em>and <em>the Contract fully performed, </em>he shall promptly issue a \u2018Final Certificate,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[t]he balance due the Contractor, <em>will then be paid </em>.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151 n. 2, 333 A.2d 319. The Court of Appeals found that there was \u201cno question but that\u201d payment was \u201cexpressly conditioned upon production of the engineer\u2019s \u2018Final Certificate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 333 A.2d 319. Indeed, in that case, the contract contained one of the words typically used to indicate a condition precedent, <em>i.e., </em>payment was to be made <em>when </em>the certificate was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><em>James Julian, Inc. v. State Hwy. Admin., </em>63 Md.App. 74, 492 A.2d 308 (1985), is similarly instructive. That case involved a contract for the construction of a road. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 492 A.2d 308. The contractor sued the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore and the State Highway Administration for breach of contract, arguing that they failed to pay for work completed. <em>Id. </em>at 76-79, 492 A.2d 308. In denying relief, this Court noted the clear language in the contract that certain procedures be followed as \u201ca condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to recover----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81, 492 A.2d 308. Because the dispute had not been resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in the contract, and because the contract clearly set forth that following these procedures was a condition precedent to recovery, this Court upheld the trial court\u2019s holding that Julian failed to exhaust its contractual remedies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Here, as indicated, the contract provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">The Statements of the real estate taxes and operating expenses to be furnished by Lessor as provided in subdivisions (b) [referring to Real Estate Taxes] and (c) [referring to operating expenses] above shall be as determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Lessor\u2019s certified public accountant. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. The statements thus furnished to Lessee shall constitute a final determination as between Lessor and Lessee of the real estate taxes and operating expenses for the periods represented thereby.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">This Lease provision does not contain clear language providing that a determination of the operating expenses by \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant\u201d is a condition precedent to Gebhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s obligation to pay these expenses. Nor does the contract include language typically used to create a condition precedent. It does not state that Gebhardt &amp; Smith is obligated to pay operating expenses \u201cif,\u201d \u201cwhen,\u201d \u201cafter,\u201d or \u201cprovided that\u201d \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant\u201d determines the operating expenses. As such, it does not create a condition precedent to Gebhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s obligation to pay such expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Even if we were to agree, however, that the Lease contained a condition precedent that the statements of operating expenses be \u201cas determined\u201d by \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant,\u201d Gebhardt &amp; Smith would not prevail. As explained below, we agree with the circuit court that the MPA complied with this provision of the Lease based on the audit procedures performed by the MDOT Office of Audits.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Gebhardt &amp; Smith raises several arguments in support of its contention that the procedures performed by the MDOT Office of Audits did not satisfy the Lease requirements. Initially, it argues that the term \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant\u201d referred to an outside, independent certified public accountant, and that the MDOT Office of Auditors did not satisfy that requirement. Moreover, it argues that the MDOT auditors did not \u201cdetermine\u201d the operating expenses. Finally, it asserts that the circuit court erroneously relied on Mr. Lambdin\u2019s designation as a certified public accountant, arguing that \u201che did virtually no work on the operating expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>We begin with Gebhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s contention that the contract required that the MPA use an outside, independent, certified public accountant to determine the operating expenses. Gebhardt &amp; Smith acknowledge that the words \u201coutside\u201d and \u201cindependent\u201d are not contained in the contract next to the term \u201ccertified public accountant.\u201d It argues, however, that the terms are \u201creasonably implied to be part of the phrase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In support of its argument, Gebhardt &amp; Smith cites Willi-ston On Contracts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">It should be noted that terms are to be implied in contract, not because they are reasonable, but because they are necessarily involved in the contractual relationship, such that parties must have intended them and must have failed to express them only because of sheer inadvertence or because they are too obvious to need expression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">\u00a7 31:7, at 321 (4th ed.2000). Gebhardt &amp; Smith argues that \u201cthe failure to insert \u2018outside\u2019 or \u2018independent\u2019 next to certified public accountant in the Lease can only be ascribed to sheer inadvertence or obviousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Initially, we note that in the circuit court, Gebhardt &amp; Smith confined its argument to the word \u201cindependent\u201d as an implied term. Although it argued that the MDOT auditors were not independent because they were not \u201coutside\u201d \u201cthe MPA sphere,\u201d counsel did not argue that \u201coutside\u201d was an implied part of the phrase \u201ccertified public accountant.\u201d Accordingly, the only argument that is preserved for this Court\u2019s review is whether the term \u201cindependent\u201d should be read as an implied term into the contract. <em>See Robinson v. State, </em>404 Md. 208, 216, 946 A.2d 456 (2008) (appellate court ordinarily will not consider issue \u201cunless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court\u201d) (quoting Maryland Rule 8-131(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The trial court rejected the argument that the Lease required that the certified public accountant be \u201cindependent,\u201d noting that the Lease referred to \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant,\u201d but it did not contain the word independent. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding. Two experts at trial, Brent Solomon and Paul White, Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith\u2019s own expert, testified that if the intent is for a certified public accountant to be independent, the contract should say \u201cindependent.\u201d We agree that, if the parties to a contract intend that a certified public accountant specified in the contract be \u201cindependent,\u201d the contract would specifically state that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Even if the word \u201cindependent\u201d could be read as an implied word in the term certified public accountant, however, we believe that condition was satisfied here. Joseph Lambdin, whose testimony the trial court found credible, testified that the MDOT Office of Audits was independent. His testimony is supported by government auditing standards, which provide that a \u201cgovernment internal audit function\u201d can be independent. COMPTROLLER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS \u00a7 3.16 (2007). Moreover, as the trial court stated: \u201cCertified public accountants are held to professional ethical and work standards by the very nature of their training and certification.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Accordingly, even if the term \u201cindependent\u201d is an implied term, the MDOT Office of Audits satisfied that condition. Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith cites no case holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Gebhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s next contention, in support of its claim that the MDOT auditors did not satisfy the requirement that operating expenses be \u201cdetermined\u201d by \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant,\u201d is that Mr. Lambdin and the other auditors did not \u201cdetermine\u201d the operating expenses. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Mr. Lambdin testified that the Office of Audits followed agreed upon procedures in auditing the WTC\u2019s operating expenses for fiscal years 2001 through 2006. This involved obtaining the schedule of operating expenses from the MPA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>selecting a sample of the expenditures, and reviewing documentation to determine whether it supported the expenditures. After these procedures were completed, Mr. Lambdin sent a report to the outside certified public accountants, stating that his office had \u201cdetermined\u201d that the expenses listed were allowable pursuant to the Lease. We agree with the trial court\u2019s assessment that the MDOT auditors \u201cdetermined\u201d the operating expenses pursuant to the Lease. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s Ninth Collegiate Dictionary 346 (1987) (defining \u201cdetermine\u201d as, among other things, to \u201ccome to a decision about by investigation, reasoning or calculation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Gebhardt &amp; Smith asserts that the \u201cMDOT auditors blindly accepted MPA\u2019s judgmental decisions as being correct.\u201d That contention is belied by the record. As set forth, <em>supra, </em>on several occasions after performing its audit procedures on the figures compiled by MPA, the MDOT auditors \u201cdetermined\u201d that some expenditures were \u201cnot allowable\u201d pursuant to the Lease. MDOT did not blindly accept MPA\u2019s decisions regarding allowable operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith further argues that Mr. Lambdin testified that the MDOT auditors did not \u201cdetermine\u201d the operating expenses and that this testimony should be binding on the MPA. The transcript reflects, however, that although Mr. Lambdin testified at his deposition that his office did \u201cnot determine, we audit,\u201d he clarified at trial that, when he said this at his deposition, he was confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Gebhardt &amp; Smith next contends that MDOT\u2019s audit did not qualify as a determination by \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant\u201d because some of the MDOT auditors were not certified public accountants and, although Mr. Lambdin was a certified public accountant, he did \u201cvirtually no work\u201d on the auditing procedures. Mr. Lambdin testified, however, that he oversaw all the audits performed by his office, and he signed for the work. The trial court properly relied on Mr. Lamb-din\u2019s designation as a certified public accountant to find compliance with the Lease provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">We find no error in the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the agreed-upon procedures performed by MDOT\u2019s Office of Au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>dits regarding the WTC\u2019s operating expenses complied with the Lease requirement that the operating expenses be determined by \u201cLessor\u2019s certified public accountant.\u201d Thus, we will proceed to address the trial court\u2019s ruling that the expenses \u201cas determined\u201d were \u201cfinal\u201d and could not be challenged in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Before moving to that issue, however, we address one additional argument. Gebhardt &amp; Smith contends that, with respect to fiscal year 2007, \u201cno one ... determined the actual operating expenses from July 1, 2006 to September 30, 2006.\u201d It states that, despite \u201cthe absence of any evidence, [the circuit court] awarded MPA the full amount it demanded for the stub period.\u201d This two sentence portion of the brief contains no caselaw, no citations to the record, and it fails to even assert the amount of money it claims was improperly awarded to the MPA. The MPA does not respond to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">At trial, the circuit court asked about the expenses for fiscal year 2007, and the MPA responded that the invoices for the estimated operating expenses, in the amount of $28,557.00 were introduced into evidence. Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith does not dispute that the Lease required them to pay the estimated operating expenses, and it has not set forth any specific argument regarding what it contends was improper with respect to these particular expenses.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As such, we will not disturb the circuit court\u2019s finding that the failure to pay these expenses was a breach of the Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Final Determination of Operating Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Gebhardt &amp; Smith next contends that, even if the MPA satisfied the condition precedent to Gebhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s obligation to pay operating expenses, \u201c[t]he MPA/MDOT determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>nations of operating expenses were replete with error and included expenses not authorized by the Lease[.]\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It argues that the circuit court erred in finding that the MPA\u2019s determination of the operating expenses could not be challenged in light of the Lease provision that the statement of operating expenses \u201cfurnished to Lessee shall constitute a final determination as between Lessor and Lessee of the ... operating expenses for the periods represented thereby.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The trial court relied upon this language in the contract in ruling that, \u201cbecause the lease specifies that any determination made by the Lessor\u2019s certified public accountant (\u2018CPA\u2019) is final, there is no need for this Court to examine whether the operating expenses were calculated correctly. The calculations of the CPA are presumed to be correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Gebhardt &amp; Smith contends that the court erred in finding that \u201cthe presumption of correctness was irrebutable and could not be contested or challenged.\u201d It argues that the Lease did not unequivocally state that the determination could not be contested, and that, even if the Lease is so construed, it could be challenged for bad faith or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The MPA counters that \u201c[t]he circuit court correctly concluded that the Lease did not grant G &amp; S the right to dispute the statement of operating expenses furnished by MPA.\u201d It argues that, because the contract states that the operating expenses constituted a \u201cfinal determination,\u201d the Lease \u201cexplicitly and unequivocally conveyed the parties intent to be bound by the operating expense statements furnished by MPA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>\u201c[0]rdinarily, parties to a contract are entitled to turn to the courts to resolve disputes arising from a contract.\u201d <em>Phoenix Servs. L.P., </em>167 Md.App. at 396, 892 A.2d 1185. It is clear, however, that parties to a contract can waive that right and provide that a designated person has \u201cauthority to render a final and binding decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403, 892 A.2d 1185.

The contract included a provision permitting the hospital to terminate the contract for cause under specified circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 892 A.2d 1185. Specifically, it provided that the hospital could terminate the contract without penalty if, after a failure to perform, Phoenix failed to provide a certificate of an Independent Engineer that Phoenix had made changes sufficient to prevent the reoccurrence of the problem. <em>Id. </em>at 341-42, 892 A.2d 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Problems subsequently ensued, and the hospital sent a notice of suspension to Phoenix. <em>Id. </em>at 347-48, 892 A.2d 1185. Pursuant to the terms of the contract, in order to lift the suspension and prevent termination of the contract, Phoenix had \u201cthirty days to provide a Certificate of Reasonable Assurance from the Independent Engineer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 892 A.2d 1185. The engineer provided a certificate, but the hospital rejected the certificate and terminated the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 351-52, 892 A.2d 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The question on appeal was whether the hospital could challenge the certificate or whether, pursuant to the contract, the Independent Engineer\u2019s judgment was final. <em>Id. </em>at 371, 892 A.2d 1185. Noting that the contract did not contain language indicating that the decision by the engineer was \u201cbinding\u201d or \u201cfinal and conclusive,\u201d this Court held that the determination of the engineer \u201cwas subject to challenge through the judicial process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402-403, 892 A.2d 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith acknowledges that the court\u2019s decision in <em>Phoenix </em>does \u201cnot require an incantation of three synonyms [final, binding, and conclusive] in a contract before a determination or approval of a designated person could be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>incontestable.\u201d Rather, it requires only the use of \u201cunequivocal language that unmistakably evidences\u201d that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Here, the Lease provided that the statements of operating expenses \u201cas determined by Lessor\u2019s certified public accountant\u201d \u201cshall constitute a final determination as between Lessor and Lessee.\u201d (Emphasis added). This provision satisfied the requirement of a clear intent to waive the right to challenge the determination of the certified public accountant.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">To be sure, many of the cases cited in <em>Phoenix Services, </em>167 Md.App. at 398-402, 892 A.2d 1185, involved contracts providing that the decision of the designated person was \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d or \u201cfinal and binding.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Laurel Race Course, </em>274 Md. at 151-52 n. 3, 333 A.2d 319 (decision of engineer shall be \u201cfinal and binding\u201d); <em>Allied Contractors, </em>236 Md. at 538, 204 A.2d 546 (director\u2019s decision shall be \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d). The parties have not cited any case, however, that stands for the proposition that a contract providing for a \u201cfinal\u201d decision on a disputed issue is not a conclusive decision on the parties. The definition of the word final indicates that it means conclusive. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s New Third International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged 851 (2002) (defining \u201cfinal\u201d as \u201cnot to be altered or undone\u201d); Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 463 (1987) (defining \u201cfinal\u201d as \u201cnot to be altered or undone; of or relating to a concluding court action or proceeding ... of or relating to the ultimate purpose or result of a process.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Significantly, in <em>Phoenix, </em>167 Md.App. at 392, 892 A.2d 1185, in determining that there was no language in the portion of the contract addressing the Independent Engineer that suggested that the Engineer\u2019s decision was not subject to judicial challenge, this Court looked at another provision in the contract. The contract provided that disputes should be decided by arbitration, and the \u201caward rendered by the arbitrators) shall be final....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 402, 892 A.2d 1185. Although not a holding in the case, this Court characterized that provision as providing that the arbitration award was binding. <em>Id. </em>at 402, 892 A.2d 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Other cases support that interpretation. In <em>Wayne v. Chopivsky, </em>657 F.Supp. 788 (E.D.Pa.), <em>aff'd, </em>835 F.2d 285 (3d Cir.1987), the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania considered a contract provision similar to the one here. In that case, there was a contract between the plaintiffs, employees of a psychiatric hospital, and the defendants, the owners of the hospital. <em>Id. </em>at 789. The contract provided that, if the net earnings of the hospital exceeded $1,500,000, the plaintiffs would be paid a sum of money. <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to the contract, the company\u2019s earnings \u201cshall be the audited earnings of [the hospital] as determined by [the hospital\u2019s] outside auditors (whose determination shall be final), calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 789. The outside auditors determined that the net earnings exceeded $1,500,000, but the defendants were not satisfied that the calculation of earnings was done properly. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">When the defendants refused to pay, the plaintiffs filed suit, contending that \u201cthe auditor\u2019s calculations [were] final and binding.\u201d They claimed that \u201cthe finality language was deliberately included to avoid a future dispute as to whether the earnings target was met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790. The defense argued, similar to Gebhardt &amp; Smith\u2019s argument here, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to payment because the auditor\u2019s calculation was not in accordance with the agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The United States District Court found that the agreement was \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d and that the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the contract was that the auditor\u2019s determination was a binding determination. <em>Id. </em>at 793. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">The purpose of a provision requiring a third party\u2019s opinion to be final and binding, as in this case, is to avoid the work required by litigation. The parties choose to forego the benefits and costs of presenting arguments and evidence from their own perspective and instead rely on an impartial third party to independently evaluate the evidence and make his own determination. Once the parties have done this, as long as the third party\u2019s opinion is an objective one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>made in good faith, it is deemed to be what the parties bargained for and is binding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 792-93. Because the defendants had not alleged bad faith, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In <em>United States v. United Enters., </em>226 F.2d 359 (5th Cir.1995), the Fifth Circuit similarly construed a contract providing that the decision of an engineer regarding specifications \u201cshall be final.\u201d The Court held that the engineer\u2019s decision was binding and conclusive on the parties to the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">We find the reasoning of these cases to be persuasive. When a contract provides that a determination rendered by a designated person is \u201cfinal,\u201d that determination is binding on the parties and cannot be contested in court in the absence of fraud or bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Gebhardt &amp; Smith understandably is frustrated with its inability to challenge the sharp increase in the operating expenses. Gebhardt &amp; Smith was a sophisticated tenant, however, and it could have protected itself from such a situation in several ways. Initially, it could have negotiated, as their expert Paul White testified tenants sometimes do, a limitation \u201cin terms of dollar amount or percentage increase\u201d in operating expenses. Moreover, it could have requested a provision in the Lease that allowed the tenant to contest questionable expenses. For example, in <em>Silverstein Props., Inc. v. Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc., </em>65 N.Y.2d 785, 493 N.Y.S.2d 110, 482 N.E.2d 906, 906 (1985), the lease provided that the statement of additional rent, provided by landlord to tenant \u201cshall constitute a final determination\u201d of additional rent, \u201cunless Tenant within thirty (30) days after they are furnished shall give a written notice to Landlord that it disputes their accuracy or their appropriateness.\u201d No such provisions were included here. We have previously stated that \u201cit is not the province of the court to rewrite the terms of a contract so as to avoid hardship to a party, or because one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>party has become dissatisfied with its terms.\u201d <em>Phoenix, </em>167 Md.App. at 393, 892 A.2d 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">A case that is instructive is <em>Newmark and Co. Real Estate, Inc. v. C &amp; A Trimming Corp., </em>134 Misc.2d 371, 511 N.Y.S.2d 205 (N.Y.Civ.Ct.1987). That case involved a contract provision very similar to that involved here. The owner of commercial real estate sought to recover additional rent alleged to be due as rent escalation from its tenant. <em>Id. </em>at 206. As in this case, the lease provided for payment of fixed rent, subject to various adjustments for real estate taxes and operating expenses. <em>Id. </em>The contract provided \u201cthat a statement consisting of \u2018data prepared for the Lessor by firm of Certified Public Accountants\u2019 will be furnished to the tenant, which statement shall compute the additional rent and which \u2018shall constitute a final determination of the real estate taxes and operating expenses....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). After the landlord furnished a statement of the expenses, the tenant questioned the accuracy of the statement. <em>Id. </em>The Court stated: \u201cIn the plainest language, the lease stipulated that the statement submitted by the plaintiffs CPA would be conclusive ____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Despite this finding, however, the court held that \u201cfraud vitiates every agreement which it touches,\u201d and therefore, the conclusive language in the contract did not waive the defendant\u2019s right to prove fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 206-207. Thus, the court denied the landlord\u2019s motion for summary judgment, stating that the defendant was \u201centitled to its day in court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Here, Gebhardt &amp; Smith had its day (or days) in court. There was a two week bench trial, during which Gebhardt &amp; Smith presented evidence regarding the propriety of the operating expenses. In closing argument, Gebhardt &amp; Smith argued: (1) that the Lease did not provide that the MPA\u2019s statement of expenses was incontestible; and (2) even if the Lease was so construed, it was entitled to judicial review of the certified public accountant\u2019s determination based on \u201cfraud or bad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>With respect to a claim of fraud or bad faith, the only-evidence relied upon by Gebhardt &amp; Smith was the letter sent by Ms. Carmon advising that the statement of expenses had been \u201caudited and certified by an independent public accountant.\u201d Gebhardt &amp; Smith argues that, in sending this letter, MPA \u201cbald out, shamelessly lied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The trial court did not explicitly address Gebhardt and Smith\u2019s claim of fraud. Given the arguments of Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith, however, and the undisputed caselaw providing that a contract provision providing for a binding determination can be contested based upon fraud, the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he calculations of the CPA are presumed to be correct\u201d constituted an implicit finding that the MPA did not commit fraud. <em>See Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 206, 699 A.2d 1170 (1997) (\u201c[t]rial judges are presumed to know the law and to apply it properly\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1082, 118 S.Ct. 866, 139 L.Ed.2d 763 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The circuit court\u2019s finding that there was no fraud is supported by the record. Initially, there was no claim that there was any fraud involved in the determination of the operating expenses. It is not clear that the letter sent to Gebhardt &amp; Smith, which merely set forth the amount of the expenses, would constitute the type of fraud allowing for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In any event, there was no evidence that the letter sent to Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith was sent for the purpose of defrauding them. Ms. Carmon testified that she did not personally write the letter. Rather, it was a form letter that her predecessor gave to her. It was Ms. Carmon\u2019s understanding that the operating expenses had been audited and certified by an independent, certified public accountant, which she believed to be Ernst &amp; Young and, subsequently, Abrams, Foster, Nole <em>&amp; </em>Williams, based on the report that the accounting firms created and provided to the MPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In the absence of evidence showing that this letter was sent for the purpose of defrauding Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith, the trial court properly ruled that Gebhardt <em>&amp; </em>Smith was bound by the contract providing that the statement of operating expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\u201cas determined by Lessor\u2019s certified public accountant\u201d was a \u201cfinal determination\u201d between the parties. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s order declining to review the propriety of the operating expenses.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
