(Monarc), appeals from the grant of the Motion To Dismiss of appellees, Aris Corporation, (Aris), J. Carlos Fuentes (Fuentes) and Amalia Fernandez a/k/a Amalia Fuentes (Fernandez) by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The genesis of this appeal is appellant\u2019s claim for breach of a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (Settlement Agreement) entered into between the parties on January 31, 2005. On March 7, 2008, appellant filed suit in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to recover damages, including attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in the prosecution and collection of a judgment entered against appellees, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On May 22, 2008, appellees filed a Motion to Dismiss, alleging that the Settlement Agreement merged into prior judgments obtained by appellant and that, as such, there was no legal basis for appellant\u2019s claim to attorney\u2019s fees. After a July 10, 2008 hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the circuit court (Rubin, J.) granted appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss. Appellant filed a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment, which was denied by the circuit court on August 13, 2008. Appellant filed this timely appeal and presents the following questions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we have condensed and reworded, for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>I. Did the trial court err in dismissing appellant\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees, when that claim was based on a provision for attorney\u2019s fees contained in the Settlement Agreement that merged into a prior judgment of the court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">II. Did the trial court erroneously apply the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel to bar appellant\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees based on a judgment obtained in a Virginia state court?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">For the reasons that follow, we answer the first question in the negative and decline to address the merits of the second issue. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">For purposes of our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, we shall set forth the facts as averred in appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">On December 28, 2001, the parties entered into a subcontract agreement (the Subcontract), under which appellees agreed to perform work on the construction of the North Arcade and Spanish Ballroom at Glen Echo Park located in Montgomery County, Maryland. As a result of disputes between appellant and appellees, two suits were filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. On January 31, 2005, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement aimed at resolving their disputes. Accordingly, the parties agreed, <em>inter alia, </em>to dismiss the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The Settlement Agreement, however, did not signify the end of litigation between the parties. Appellant alleged that ap-pellees failed to perform their obligations under the Settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ment Agreement and sued appellees for breach of the Settlement Agreement. As a result, appellant obtained a default judgment against appellees on June 28, 2006, in the amount of $184,574.70. The June 28, 2006 order does not differentiate between compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees. Appellant concedes, however, that (1) the basis of the suit was appellees\u2019 breach of the Settlement Agreement, (2) the judgment included attorney\u2019s fees incurred by appellant through the date of judgment and (3) attorney\u2019s fees were recoverable under Paragraph 15 of the Settlement Agreement, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">This Agreement shall be construed according to and governed by the laws of the State of Maryland, exclusive of any provisions relating to the conflicts of laws. The Parties agree and acknowledge that if any term or condition of this Agreement is breached or requires enforcement, any party may seek an appropriate remedy in a court of law. The Parties further agree and acknowledge that the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland is the correct venue and shall have sole jurisdiction to enforce this Agreement, and the Parties agree that they each submit to the personal jurisdiction of that Court as an express term and condition of this Agreement. The Parties agree and acknowledge that any party may seek the equitable remedy of specific performance of this Agreement, including any injunctions or restraining orders necessary to effectuate the terms and conditions of this Agreement. <em>In the event that any party is required to enforce the terms or conditions of this Agreement in court, the prevailing party shall recover all costs and expenses incurred in or arising from such action, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">When satisfaction of the June 28, 2006 judgment by appel-lees was not forthcoming, appellant recorded the judgment in the Circuit Court for Fairfax County, Virginia, a county in which appellees Fuentes and Fernandez owned real property. Appellant then instituted suit against Fuentes and Fernandez in the Fairfax County Circuit Court, seeking an order from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>that court decreeing the sale of the real property owned by Fuentes and Fernandez in order to satisfy the judgment obtained in Montgomery County. Appellant also sought attorney\u2019s fees in that Fairfax County litigation. On December 20, 2007, the Fairfax County Circuit Court issued a decree ordering a judicial sale of appellees\u2019 property to satisfy appellant\u2019s judgment lien. The initial decree, which included an award of attorney\u2019s fees incurred by appellant in its effort to enforce the June 28, 2006 judgment, was later modified to remove the attorney\u2019s fees award, upon the filing of appellees\u2019 motion to vacate and/or reconsider the decree of sale in the Fairfax County Circuit Court arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) appellant had failed to provide notice in its complaint that it would seek attorney\u2019s fees and (2) that the June 28, 2006 Montgomery County judgment did not provide for attorney\u2019s fees. Appel-lees, on February 21, 2008, remitted payment in satisfaction of the judgments against them in the amount of $211,739.11, an amount which reflected the principal due on the judgment plus accrued interest, court costs and commissioners\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Thereafter, in an attempt to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and related costs incurred by appellant after the date of the original June 28, 2006 Maryland judgment, appellant filed the instant suit in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. On May 22, 2008, appellees responded by filing a Motion to Dismiss, which recited the procedural history relevant to the June 28, 2006 Montgomery County judgment and the December 20, 2007 Fairfax County judgment and asserted that, as a matter of law, the Settlement Agreement merged into the prior judgments, such that appellant\u2019s suit on the Settlement Agreement could not be brought for purposes of recovering additional attorney\u2019s fees. Appellant, in response, filed its opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. During the course of the hearing on appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss on July 10, 2008, the trial court questioned the parties as to the rule of merger and the effect of the Fairfax County Circuit Court\u2019s ruling on appellant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees claim. On July 10, 2008, by way of order entered on July 17, 2008, the circuit court granted appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Appellant subsequently filed a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-534, focusing principally on what appellant perceived to be an issue raised <em>sua sponte </em>by the trial court, pertaining to the preclusive effect of the Virginia court\u2019s ruling on appellant\u2019s subsequent endeavor to recover attorney\u2019s fees. On August 13, 2008, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment. This timely appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth, as necessary, throughout the remainder of our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Although appellant\u2019s brief is not entirely clear on this point, appellant appears to attack both the circuit court\u2019s July 10, 2008 order granting appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint and the August 13, 2008 order denying its Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a trial court\u2019s granting of a motion to dismiss. <em>Gasper v. Ruffin Hotel Corporation of Maryland, Inc., </em>183 Md.App. 211, 226, 960 A.2d 1228 (2008), <em>cert. granted, Ruffin Hotel v. Gasper, </em>408 Md. 149, 968 A.2d 1064 (2009). In that review, \u201cwe must assume the truth of the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, including the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those allegations.\u201d <em>Adamson v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc., </em>359 Md. 238, 246, 753 A.2d 501 (2000) (citations omitted). Ultimately,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\u201cdismissal is proper only if the alleged facts and permissible inferences, so viewed, would, if proven, nonetheless fail to afford relief to the plaintiff.\u201d In sum, because we must deem the facts to be true, our task is confined to determining whether the trial court was legally correct in its decision to dismiss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\"><em>Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 246, 753 A.2d 501 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">By contrast, in an appeal, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>in which a party files a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-534, we review an order denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>such motion under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Wells v. Wells, </em>168 Md.App. 382, 394, 896 A.2d 1082 (2006) (citing, <em>inter alia, Benson v. State, </em>389 Md. 615, 653, 887 A.2d 525 (2005)); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Hartley, </em>150 Md.App. 581, 586, 822 A.2d 537 (2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">an appellate court will affirm a circuit court\u2019s judgment on any ground adequately shown by the record, even one upon which the circuit court has not relied or one that the parties have not raised. <em>Faulkner v. American Cas. Co., </em>85 Md.App. 595, 629, 584 A.2d 734 (1991). Therefore, it is within our province to affirm the trial court if it reached the right result for the wrong reasons. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\"><em>Pope v. Board of Sch. Comm\u2019rs, </em>106 Md.App. 578, 591, 665 A.2d 713 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">With these standards of review in mind, we turn to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Appellant raises a multi-pronged challenge to the circuit court\u2019s judgment. We address appellant\u2019s arguments <em>seria-tim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Appellant first contends that the trial court \u201cprematurely and impermissibly dismissed [appellant\u2019s] complaint\u201d because it failed to assume the truth of the facts pleaded in appellant\u2019s complaint, specifically, (1) the existence of the Settlement Agreement between the parties that provided, in the event of a breach of the agreement, that the non-breaching party would be entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees expended in enforcing the Settlement Agreement and (2) that appellant had never been compensated for damages it sustained in the form of attorney\u2019s fees, which were incurred as a result of appellees\u2019 breach of the Settlement Agreement. Appellant further argues that contractual attorney\u2019s fees provisions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>enforceable in Maryland. Thus, according to appellant, the trial court was required to \u201cassume as true [appellant\u2019s] well-pleaded facts that the Settlement Agreement between the parties is valid and enforceable[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">As appellant points out, the \u201cgrant of a motion to dismiss is proper if the complaint does not disclose, on its face, a legally sufficient cause of action.\u201d <em>Rossaki v. NUS Corp., </em>116 Md.App. 11, 18, 695 A.2d 203 (1997) (quoting <em>Hrehorovich v. Harbor Hospital, </em>93 Md.App. 772, 785, 614 A.2d 1021 (1992)). While the trial court was required to assume the veracity of well-pleaded facts in appellant\u2019s complaint in determining whether appellant stated a sufficient cause of action against appellees, the gravamen of appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, and of their argument on appeal, is that, even under the facts as pleaded by appellant, there was no legally enforceable contract binding appellees to the attorney\u2019s fees provision, because that contract merged into the judgment appellant obtained against appellees. The transcript of the July 10, 2008 hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, relevant portions of which are excerpted <em>infra, </em>reveals that the trial court was predominantly concerned with this legal issue of merger, <em>ie., </em>whether the contractual provision regarding attorney\u2019s fees contained in the Settlement Agreement survived the judgments obtained by appellant against appellees. It was the trial court\u2019s role to determine whether the well-pleaded facts, assumed to be true, nonetheless failed legally to afford relief to appellant. There is no indication that the trial court misunderstood or misapplied the standards governing its decision as to appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Moreover, because the gravamen of appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss was the effect of the rule of merger on appellant\u2019s ability to assert a cause of action for breach of the Settlement Agreement, a fact evidenced by the degree to which the trial court focused on this issue at the July 10, 2008 hearing, we need not consider, in any detail, appellant\u2019s arguments in its appellate brief asserting that Maryland has jurisdiction over this dispute, pursuant to the \u201cforum-selection\u201d clause in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Settlement Agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellees\u2019 claim, in their Motion to Dismiss, that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over appel-lees, concerned itself not with the enforceability of the forum-selection clause, but rather, with the existence of the Settlement Agreement itself as a legally enforceable document, <em>i.e., </em>whether the Settlement Agreement had merged into the judgments obtained by appellant. This, too, is made clear by the focus of the court\u2019s discussion at the July 10 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Appellant next argues that the trial court erred when it \u201cprematurely dismissed [appellant\u2019s] complaint on the grounds that [appellant] was attempting to re-litigate an issue previously adjudicated.\u201d Appellant summarizes its position on this issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">Although the trial court did not explicitly dismiss [appellant\u2019s] Complaint on the grounds of either <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel, such a result is necessarily inferred from the trial court\u2019s statements made during the July 10, 2008 hearing that this was the trial court\u2019s rationale. Since the trial court did not elaborate on the legal basis for its July 10, 2008 ruling, [appellant] contends that the trial court\u2019s error resulted from its careless application of the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>and/or collateral estoppel in reaching its conclusion. Specifically, the trial court\u2019s error originated from its inquiry concerning the fact that at one point during the Fairfax County Litigation, [appellant] requested, but ultimately did not recover its attorneys\u2019 fees and related costs as part of the Decree of Sale. The mere fact that [appellant] requested, and was ultimately denied, the relief in a prior litigation, is by itself insufficient to warrant application of the doctrines of either <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Res judicata, or the doctrine of <em>claim </em>preclusion,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">\u201cbars the relitigation of a claim if there is a final judgment in a previous litigation where the parties, the subject matter and causes of action are identical or substantially identical as to issues actually litigated and as to those which could have or should have been raised in the previous litigation.\u201d The doctrine embodies three elements: (1) the parties in the present litigation are the same or in privity with the parties to the earlier litigation; (2) the claim presented in the current action is identical to that determined or that which could have been raised and determined in the prior litigation; and (3) there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\"><em>R &amp; D 2001, LLC v. Rice, </em>402 Md. 648, 663, 938 A.2d 839 (2008) (internal citations omitted). Claim preclusion \u201cencompasses the law of merger and bar.\u201d <em>Kent County Bd. of Educ. v. Bilbrough, </em>309 Md. 487, 490, 525 A.2d 232 (1987) (quoting <em>Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., </em>465 U.S. 75, 77 n. 1, 104 S.Ct. 892, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984)); <em>see Hughes v. Insley, </em>155 Md.App. 608, 625-26, 845 A.2d 1 (2003).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">The \u201csomewhat allied doctrine\u201d of collateral estoppel, or <em>issue </em>preclusion,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">looks to issues of fact or law that were actually decided in an earlier action, whether or not on the same claim. We have articulated the doctrine thusly: \u201cWhen an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, ... the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-9\"><em>R &amp; D 2001, </em>402 Md. at 663, 938 A.2d 839 (citations omitted). We summarized the key points distinguishing these two doctrines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">With this background, it is possible to construct a simple comparative checklist for determining which, if either, of the two doctrines is applicable. For either to apply, the second action must be between the same parties or those in privity with them. For direct estoppel to apply, it must be shown, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>in addition, that the two causes of action are the same. Collateral estoppel does not require that the causes of action be the same, but it applies only with respect to issues of fact actually determined in the earlier proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><em>John Crane, Inc. v. Puller, </em>169 Md.App. 1, 25, 899 A.2d 879 (2006) (quoting <em>Klein v. Whitehead, </em>40 Md.App. 1, 15, 389 A.2d 374 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Based on our review of the Motion to Dismiss and the July 10, 2008 hearing transcript, we discern that neither the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>nor the doctrine of collateral estoppel, as it pertains to the Virginia judgment, are to be accorded the weight that appellant assigns to them in its challenge to the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, the central issue was the availability <em>vel non </em>of a legally cognizable basis by which appellant could seek attorney\u2019s fees for its attempts to enforce a judgment it obtained on June 28, 2006, against appellees in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, in the amount of $184,574.70, for breach of the Settlement Agreement. At the hearing, appellees argued that, under the doctrine of merger, appellant\u2019s contractual claim for attorney\u2019s fees merged into the judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: We\u2019re here this afternoon, Your Honor, on [appellees\u2019] motion to dismiss this case. The Court had commented earlier in its docket on the interesting nature of <em>res judicata. </em>Well, this case involves its poor cousin, the doctrine of merger of judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">THE COURT: It\u2019s not a poor cousin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: This case, though, Your Honor, is the fifth case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">THE COURT: It\u2019s a good issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: It is a good issue. This case is the fifth case between these parties. All litigation has to come to an end, and I would suggest this is the place it should do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">The position, simply put, basing it on <em>[United Book Press, Inc. v. Maryland Composition Co., Inc., </em>141 Md.App. 460, 786 A.2d 1 (2001) ],<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> is that the claim has merged into the judgment. If we took [appellant\u2019s] logic to its conclusion in this case, [appellant] would, if they were able to obtain a judgment in this case today, okay, or whenever it comes to fruition, and then go back across the river ... and ultimately collect on that judgment, would then be able to come back into Montgomery County, file another suit seeking attorney\u2019s fees, go back across, get its judgment there, go back across the river, come back, file yet another suit. All litigation has to come to an end.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">When the trial court asked appellees\u2019 counsel if appellant was asking the court to \u201cundo\u201d the Virginia judgment, appel-lees\u2019 counsel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re asking, that isn\u2019t how they\u2019re framing the suit. They\u2019re framing the suit that they\u2019re entitled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>under the Settlement Agreement, to the attorney\u2019s fees they expended in attempting to recover the judgment that this Court entered in 267181. And the position here, simply, Your Honor, is that any rights under that Settlement Agreement, any claim they had, merged into the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Appellees\u2019 counsel stressed that there was \u201cno provision in the [Maryland Rules] providing for the collection of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts in the enforcement of a judgment....\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court asked appellant\u2019s counsel to explain the basis for maintaining the suit in light of the merger argument and the concession of appellant\u2019s counsel that he was aware of no case allowing for post-judgment collection of contractually-based attorney\u2019s fees. Appellees\u2019 counsel then argued that the plain language of the provision for attorney\u2019s fees in the Settlement Agreement restricted the scope of that provision to those fees arising from the action on the Settlement Agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">[I]f we look to the agreement, if it is the agreement and solely the agreement that [appellant] relies upon in paragraph 15, the last sentence provides, \u201cIn the event that any party is required to enforce the terms or conditions of this agreement in court, the prevailing party shall recover all costs and expenses incurred for in or arising from such action, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">Well, they were awarded their attorney\u2019s fees in that judgment that this Court had entered.

As we shall explain, we conclude that appellant\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees was not legally cognizable, in light of the merger of the Settlement Agreement into the judgment issued by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on June 28, 2006. Thus, the trial court correctly dismissed this action on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Consistent with the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d Maryland\u2019s approach to attorney\u2019s fees is that such fees are ordinarily not recoverable by the prevailing party in an action for compensatory damages. <em>Hess Construction Co. v. Board of Education of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>341 Md. 155, 160, 669 A.2d 1352 (1996); <em>Long v. Burson, </em>182 Md.App. 1, 25-26, 957 A.2d 173 (2008); <em>Chang v. Brethren Mutual Insurance Co., </em>168 Md. App. 534, 551-52, 897 A.2d 854 (2006). There are exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>to that general rule, allowing recovery of such fees if, <em>inter alia, </em>they are authorized by statute or agreed-upon by the parties to a contract. <em>See Hess Construction Co., </em>341 Md. at 160, 669 A.2d 1352 (discussing these and other exceptions to the rule). However, where no exception applies, then \u201ceach party to a case is responsible for the fees of its own attorneys, regardless of the outcome.\u201d <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>403 Md. 443, 456, 942 A.2d 1242 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In this case, the basis upon which appellant asserts a right to attorne/s fees is Paragraph 15 of the Settlement Agreement, which we have quoted in the factual background of this opinion. Appellant concedes that its claim for attorney\u2019s fees is based solely on this contractual provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Unlike cases involving the recovery of statutorily-permitted or rules-based attorney\u2019s fees, where we have determined that a claim to attorney\u2019s fees is collateral to or independent from the merits of the action,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> contractually-based attorneys fees form \u201c \u2018part of the damage\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>G-C P\u2019ship v.

In <em>Production Credit Assoc. of Madison v. Laufenberg, </em>143 Wis.2d 200, 420 N.W.2d 778 (1988), a creditor sought post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees based on the provisions of its loan agreement with the debtors, which provided, in pertinent part, that the creditor was authorized to pay for certain expenses from the debtors\u2019 account, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">Except where and to the extent prohibited by applicable law, promptly pay or reimburse [the creditor] for all expenses, fees, and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred either before or after any default in connection with: this Agreement and the documents related to it, the perfection of [the creditor\u2019s] security interest or other lien in collateral, or incurred in connection with protecting or enforcing its rights with respect to collateral or foreclosing against the same as more fully detailed in any security agreements, mortgages, or other collateral documents given in accordance with Section 5.0 of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">As in Maryland, attorney\u2019s fees in Wisconsin are only recoverable if \u201csuch liability arises from a specific statute or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the contract of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Additionally, the <em>Laufenberg </em>Court observed that, under the rule of merger, \u201cupon entry of judgment, the contract sued upon loses all of its vitality and ceases to bind the parties to its execution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The court thus cited to Restatement (Second) Judgments \u00a7 18, which we quoted <em>supra, </em>and concluded that the creditor could not recover attorney\u2019s fees incurred after the entry of judgment on the loan agreement because, post-judgment, the creditor no longer had a contractual right to those fees. <em>Id. </em>at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Also illustrative is <em>Caine &amp; Weiner v. Barker, </em>42 Wash.App. 835, 713 P.2d 1133 (1986), an action involving a suit on a promissory note to recover a money debt. There, the Washington Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">Claim preclusion, or <em>res judicata, </em>has two aspects. The first applies to a judgment for a defendant, barring the plaintiff from bringing another action on the same claim. Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 19 (1982). The second aspect is the rule of merger, which applies generally to a judgment for a plaintiff in an action to recover money. <em>Carothers v. Carothers, </em>260 Or. 99, 488 P.2d 1185 (1971). As a general rule, when a valid final judgment for the payment of money is rendered, the original claim is extinguished, and a new cause of action on the judgment is substituted for it. <em>Yergensen v. Ford, </em>16 Utah 2d 397, 402 P.2d 696, 697 (1965); 6 A. Corbin, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 1318 (1962); 15 S. Williston, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 1874 (3d ed.1972). Thereafter, the plaintiff cannot maintain an action on the original claim or any part thereof. Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1134. Thus, the <em>Caine &amp; Weiner </em>Court held that the plaintiff, suing to collect on a judgment entered upon a debtor\u2019s default on a promissory note, could not seek post-judgment, contract-based attorney\u2019s fees, because the defendant\u2019s liability as to such fees originated in the note. <em>Id. </em>at 1134, 1135. Upon merger, the obligation of the defendant under the note became an obligation on the judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 1135-36. <em>See also Hatch v.

That June 28, 2006 order established a judgment by default against appellees for $184,574.70 in damages. Appellant asserted in the circuit court, as it does in this Court, that the June 28, 2006 judgment encompassed attorney\u2019s fees incurred by appellant through the date of that judgment. Appellant now seeks additional, contract-based attorney\u2019s fees incurred subsequent to the June 28, 2006 order, characterizing those fees, in its appellate brief, as \u201cdamages\u201d that are \u201cexpressly recoverable pursuant to the parties\u2019 Settlement Agreement, Clause 15.\u201d However, we find unpersuasive appellant\u2019s argument that the provision for attorney\u2019s fees set forth in the Settlement Agreement survived merger into the June 28, 2006 order which, according to appellant, included an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Nor does appellant assert on appeal that the trial court\u2019s granting of appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss was erroneous because the provision for attorney\u2019s fees in the Settlement Agreement expressly provided for appellant\u2019s right to collect attorney\u2019s fees beyond judgment on a breach of contract claim, notwithstanding merger of the contract. <em>See Caine &amp; Weiner, </em>713 P.2d at 1135 (\u201c[Wjhere the original obligation provides for special rights or exemptions, in some circumstances these may be preserved and recognized despite merger.\u201d) (citing <em>Nelson v. Nelson, </em>91 Ariz. 215, 370 P.2d 952 (1962)); <em>Production Credit Assn. of Madison v. Laufenberg, </em>420 N.W.2d at 779 (\u201cIn the absence of an express agreement otherwise, the obligation of a debtor to pay the creditor\u2019s costs and fees of collection or foreclosure is merged in a judgment in favor of the creditor.\u201d). <em>See also Hatch, </em>726 A.2d at 309 (\u201cThus, while we recognize that parties may include fee-shifting provisions in their agreements, a corollary of our commitment to the so-called American rule of litigants paying their own fees is that such agreements will be strictly construed.\u201d). As appellant has not advanced that particular argument, we decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>engage in construction of the provision for attorney\u2019s fees to determine whether it has, in fact, such an effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">In light of the foregoing discussion, we hold that the trial court did not err by granting appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss on the grounds that the Settlement Agreement, the sole basis upon which appellant based its claim to attorney\u2019s fees, merged into a prior judgment of that court. There being no other exception to the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d applicable to this case, appellant has no legal basis for asserting its claim to attorney\u2019s fees.

The Settlement Agreement provided, in Paragraph 15, that the parties \"further agree and acknowledge that the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland is the correct venue and shall have sole jurisdiction to enforce this Agreement,\u201d requiring the parties to \"submit to the personal jurisdiction of that Court as an express condition of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\">. Appellant devotes much of its appellate brief to arguing that its action in Virginia was instituted under a statute designed solely to allow a holder of a judgment lien to enforce the lien against real property of the judgment debtor. Appellant cites, in this regard, to Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-462, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Jurisdiction to enforce the lien of a judgment shall be in equity. If it appears to the court that the rents and profits of all real estate subject to the lien will not satisfy the judgment in five years, the court may decree such real estate, or any part thereof, to be sold, and the proceeds applied to the discharge of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Appellant emphasizes that a creditor\u2019s suit is different from a breach of contract action and relies on this distinction to argue that (1) the Virginia suit did not litigate any issues or claims relevant to the instant breach of contract action and (2) the statute upon which appellant relied in the Virginia suit \u201cdid not afford [appellant] with the opportunity to amend its underlying Judgment [in Maryland] to include a claim for additional damages flowing from a breach of the Settlement Agreement that were subsequently sustained by [appellant] after obtaining the Judgment.\u201d As we shall explain, however, once a final judgment was entered in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on June 28, 2006, appellant could no longer assert a \"breach of contract\u201d claim to collect attorney\u2019s fees, because the instrument upon which appellant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees claim was based, <em>i.e., </em>the Settlement Agreement, merged into that judgment. Moreover, because we need not address this argument in any detail, we decline to address the merits of appellees\u2019 counter-argument that appellant is \u201cbound by the admission made by its counsel that it sought attorney's fees in the Virginia action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b412-13\">4.
