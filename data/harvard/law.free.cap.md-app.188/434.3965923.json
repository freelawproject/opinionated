A jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City found that appellant, Shoaib A. Hashmi, M.D., was negligent in his care and treatment of Adrian and that his negligence caused Adrian\u2019s death. On October 25, 2006, the court entered judgment on the verdict against appellant and in favor of appellees, Troy Bennett, as Personal Representative of Adrian\u2019s estate and as Adrian\u2019s father; Geraldine Bennett, as Adrian\u2019s mother; and Keion Bennett, Tyshaun Bennett, and Adam Gross, as Adrian\u2019s children, in the total amount of $2,295,000. Upon motion of appellant, the court applied the provisions of Maryland Code (1973, 2006 RepLVol.), Section 11-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d) and reduced the judgment to $1,795,000. Appellant then moved to further reduce the judgment, claiming entitlement to additional reduction under the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tori\u2014Feasors Act (\u201cUCATA\u201d), C.J. \u00a7\u00a7 3-1401 <em>et seq. </em>Because appellees had entered into two settlement agreements with other defendants, the circuit court, on March 20, 2007, reduced the judgment by two-thirds to $598,-333.333.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">On appeal, appellant presents one question for our review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">Did the trial court err by reducing the judgment against appellant by two-thirds, instead of four-fifths, under UCA-TA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">On November 16, 2005, by a First Amended Complaint and Election for Jury Trial, appellees filed a survival and wrongful death action against Stephen Holtzclaw, M.D., Roman Kos-trubiak, M.D., Emergency Physician Associates of Maryland, P.C. (\u201cE.P.A.\u201d), appellant, and The Good Samaritan Hospital of Maryland, Inc. (\u201cGood Samaritan\u201d)- Appellees alleged that the defendants negligently failed to diagnose and appropriately treat a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection that the decedent had developed before he went to the Good Samaritan emergency room on April 22, 2003. As a result of the defendants\u2019 negligence, according to appellees, Adrian went into severe septic shock and died on April 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Dr. Holtzclaw was dismissed without prejudice from the lawsuit on June 21, 2006. On October 10, 2006, Dr. Kos-trubiak, E.P.A., and Good Samaritan were dismissed with prejudice pursuant to settlement agreements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As part of settlement, the settling defendants agreed to execute joint tortfeasor releases. Appellees were paid $400,000 by E.P.A. and Dr. Kostrubiak, its employee physician, and $550,000 by Good Samaritan.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">A jury trial commenced on October 16, 2006, against appellant as the only remaining defendant. The jury found appellant negligent in his care and treatment of Adrian and that his negligence was a cause of Adrian\u2019s death. As noted, on October 25, 2006, the court granted judgment on the verdict against appellant and in favor of appellees in the total amount of $2,295,000, and reduced the judgment to $1,795,000, pursuant to the statutory cap on non-economic damages set forth in C.J. \u00a7 11-108.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Thereafter, appellant moved to farther reduce the verdict,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming entitlement to additional reduction under UCATA Appellant argued that the E.P.A. release created one joint-tortfeasor share for E.P.A. and its employee, Dr. Kostrubiak. Regarding the Good Samaritan release, appellant contended that there were three joint-tortfeasor shares, <em>i.e., </em>one share for each of Good Samaritan\u2019s three employees, Dr. Hina Sahi, Nurse Kathleen Bosse, and an unidentified emergency room nurse, \u201cNurse A.\u201d In combination with appellant\u2019s share as a joint tortfeasor, appellant calculated a total of five shares, and thus argued that he was entitled to a four-fifths <em>pro rata </em>reduction of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Appellees agreed with appellant that the E.P.A. release created one joint-tortfeasor share for E.P.A. and its employee, Dr. Kostrubiak. Appellees, however, contended that the Good Samaritan release produced only one joint-tortfeasor share, rather than three. According to appellees, a total of three joint-tortfeasor shares were present in the instant case\u2014one for appellant, one for E.P.A./Kostrubiak, and one for Good Samaritan, resulting in a two-thirds reduction of the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">On March 15, 2007, a hearing was held on appellant\u2019s post-trial motions. On March 20, 2007, the court reduced the judgment by two-thirds, instead of four-fifths. Accordingly, judgment was entered in the amount of $598,333,333 ($1,795,-000 v 3 = $598,333,333), representing the amount of appellant\u2019s one-third joint-tortfeasor share.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Appellant timely noted this appeal on April 13, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Appellant argues that the language used in the Good Samaritan release \u201cestablishes that Good Samaritan Hospital accounts for three joint-tortfeasor shares, one for each of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>three allegedly negligent employees, Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A.\u201d Appellant maintains that \u201c[t]he Good Samaritan Release, read as a whole, shows that the parties intended to release not only the corporate entity[, Good Samaritan], but the individual employee actors whose care was at issue.\u201d According to appellant, each negligent employee, along with Good Samaritan, constitutes a joint tortfeasor. Thus appellant contends that the trial court should have reduced the verdict by dividing it by five shares, rather than three shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Appellees argue that appellant is \u201cnot entitled to <em>multiple-share </em>reductions of the verdict for Good Samaritan agents unnamed in the [Good Samaritan settlement] Release.\u201d The basis of appellees\u2019 argument is that appellant is not entitled to additional share reductions of the verdict because appellant \u201cwaived the defense of release, and failed to establish multiple Good Samaritan joint-tortfeasor shares by any of the mechanisms available to him under Maryland law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">At common law, Maryland courts refused to recognize a right of contribution among joint tortfeasors. <em>Parler &amp; Wobber v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, P.C., </em>359 Md. 671, 683, 756 A.2d 526 (2000). \u201c[A] release by the injured party of one of several joint tortfeasors released all.\u201d <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. 613, 619, 133 A.2d 428 (1957). In 1941, Maryland enacted UCATA to establish \u201c \u2018a statutory right of contribution\u2019 \u201d among joint tortfeasors, <em>Parler &amp; Wobber, </em>359 Md. at 685, 756 A.2d 526 (quoting <em>Central GMC, Inc. v. Helms, </em>303 Md. 266, 276, 492 A.2d 1313 (1985)), thereby \u201cenabling an individual to settle with one joint tortfeasor and still have recourse against the remaining tortfeasors.\u201d <em>Anne Arundel Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Condon, </em>102 Md.App. 408, 415, 649 A.2d 1189 (1994); <em>see also Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 369, 749 A.2d 174 (2000) (noting that UCATA was enacted \u201cto encourage settlements by allowing a plaintiff to maintain his claim against a non-settling joint tort-feasor when he settles with another joint tort-feasor and signs a release\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">When an injured person settles with a joint tortfeasor, UCATA prescribes the effect of a settlement release on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>injured person\u2019s claims against other joint tortfeasors. UCA-TA \u00a7 3-1404 provides that a joint tortfeasor release reduces the injured person\u2019s claim against all non-settling joint tortfea-sors. <em>See Jones v. Hurst, </em>54 Md.App. 607, 608, 459 A.2d 219 (1983) (\u201cUnder the [UCATA], certain consequences ensue when an injured person releases one of several joint tort-feasors. One of those consequences may be a reduction in any judgment the injured party recovers against remaining tort-feasor(s).\u201d). Specifically, \u00a7 3-1404 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor, whether before or after judgment, does not discharge the other joint tortfeasors unless the release so provides, but it reduces the claim against the other joint tort-feasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced, if greater than the consideration paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u201cAscertaining the number of joint tort-feasors, therefore, is critical in determining the amount by which the jury award must be reduced before judgment is entered.\u201d <em>Jacobs, </em>131 Md.App. at 370, 749 A.2d 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The Number of Joint Tortfeasors</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">In the instant case, the issue before this Court is the effect of the releases given by appellees to E.P.A./Kostrubiak and to Good Samaritan on the judgment entered against appellant. <em>See Martinez v. Lopez, </em>300 Md. 91, 96, 476 A.2d 197 (1984). That effect, namely a reduction of the verdict against appellant, is determined by the number of released parties that are, in fact, joint tortfeasors. <em>See Collier v. Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc., </em>86 Md.App. 38, 56, 585 A.2d 256 (\u201c[Ojnly releases given <em>to joint tortfeasors </em>will give rise to rights of reduction and contribution.\u201d (Emphasis added)), <em>cert. denied, </em>323 Md. 33, 591 A.2d 249 (1991). <em>Jones, </em>54 Md.App. at 608, 459 A.2d 219 (stating that UCATA \u00a7 3-1404, formerly \u00a7 19, \u201cdo[es] not come into play unless the person released was a joint tort-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>feasor\u201d). Appellant, as the party moving for a reduction of the verdict in accordance with UCATA \u00a7 3-1404, bears the burden of proving the joint tortfeasor status of the settling parties. <em>See, e.g., Swigert, </em>213 Md. at 619, 133 A.2d 428 (\u201c[Ujnder Maryland law ..., in order for [a non-settling defendant] to be certain that he will obtain these reductions, it is necessary that negligence on the part of [a settling defendant] contributing to the injuries must be shown in one manner or another.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">UCATA defines \u201c[j]oint tort-feasors\u201d as \u201ctwo or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\u201d UCATA \u00a7 3-1401(c). \u201cThe fact ... that a party has been sued or threatened with suit is not enough to establish joint tort-feasor status.\u201d <em>Jacobs, </em>131 Md.App. at 374, 749 A.2d 174. Nor is one \u201cconsidered a joint tort-feasor ... merely because he or she enters a settlement and pays money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>UCATA \u201cdoes not specify the test of liability. Clearly, something short of an actual judgment will suffice.... \u201d <em>Swigert, </em>213 Md. at 619, 133 A.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In discussing the determination of joint tortfeasor status in <em>Collier, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">Where a plaintiff has, at some time, claimed that two or more persons have contributed to his injury by their respective tortious conduct, two questions may arise: (1) whether the conduct of those persons falls within the scope of the definition and (2) how that determination is to be made. Where no settlements have occurred, the liability of all such persons is ordinarily determined by the trier of fact, and so both questions are answered by the verdicts. That pertains as well in those cases where one or more settlements have occurred but the liability of the settling defendants, but for the settlements, is nonetheless submitted to and determined by the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">The problems arise, most frequently, where the actual liability of the settling defendant is not determined by the trier of fact. Resort then is made, at least initially, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>to the language of the release. In some instances, the settling parties specify in the release that the releasee is to be regarded as a joint tortfeasor, even though he may disclaim liability. In that event, the releasee\u2019s status as a joint tortfeasor is contractually determined. Conversely, the settling parties may specify in the release that the releasee shall not be regarded as a joint tortfeasor unless adjudicated as such, in which event the releasee will be regarded as a mere volunteer<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> absent a judicial determination of his liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><em>Collier, </em>86 Md.App. at 57, 585 A.2d 256 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Thus joint tortfeasor status may be established by (1) a judicial determination that a settling party is a joint tortfeasor, or (2) an admission or concession of joint tortfeasor status.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Jacobs, </em>131 Md.App. at 374-75, 749 A.2d 174 (\u201cTort-feasor status, in the absence of adjudication, generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>rests on admission by the purported tort-feasor of such status. Thus, a party will be considered a joint tort-feasor when it admits joint tort-feasor status in a settlement agreement, or if a default judgment has been entered against a party.\u201d (Citations omitted)). An example of the first category can be found in <em>Swigert. </em>There, the Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court should not have granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of Welk, a third party defendant, where, although the plaintiff executed a release of Welk pre-trial, Welk\u2019s status as a joint tortfeasor was denied in the release.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Swigert, </em>213 Md. at 615, 618, 622,133 A.2d 428. To prevent \u201ca somewhat incongruous procedural situation to have a party to a case completely dismissed and leave the question of his negligence yet to be determined,\u201d the Court decided that Welk was to remain in the case as a third party defendant, and the question of Welk\u2019s tortfeasor status was to be answered by judicial determination. <em>Id. </em>at 621-22, 133 A.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>Jones </em>presented the alternative to judicial determination of joint tortfeasor status. 54 Md.App. at 608-09, 459 A.2d 219. <em>Jones </em>arose out of an automobile accident between Jones, the appellant, and Zachary Hurst, who operated the vehicle that struck Jones. <em>Id. </em>at 609, 459 A.2d 219. Jones sued Zachary Hurst and Henry Hurst, the owner of the vehicle, and General Motors Corporation (\u201cG.M.\u201d), the manufacturer of the Hurst vehicle. <em>Id. </em>Jones settled with G.M. and executed a \u201cJoint Tortfeasor Release\u201d with G.M. <em>Id. </em>at 609, 459 A.2d 219. Following trial, a verdict of $18,000 was rendered against Zachary Hurst and in favor of Jones.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 610, 459 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>219. Upon Zachary Hurst\u2019s motion, pursuant to the G.M. release and UCATA \u00a7 3-1404 (formerly \u00a7 19), the trial judge reduced the judgment against Zachary Hurst by one-half, to $9,000. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, we rejected Jones\u2019 argument that the verdict should not have been reduced because G.M.\u2019s liability had never been judicially determined. <em>Id. </em>at 611, 459 A.2d 219. Although noting that the release also contained an express denial of G.M.\u2019s liability, we concluded that the language in the release conceding G.M.\u2019s joint tortfeasor status was sufficient to satisfy UCATA\u2019s requirement of establishing a party\u2019s joint tortfeasor status. <em>Id. </em>The release stated: \u201cfor the purpose of determining the amount of any judgments that may be recovered by me against any person, firm or corporation, except General Motors ... the said General Motors Corporation shall be considered as joint tort-feasors [sic] to the same extent and effect as if judgments had been rendered against them [sic] as joint tort-feasors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant concedes that he never sought a judicial determination of joint tortfeasor status of Good Samaritan\u2019s three employees. Instead, appellant urges that he \u201csought a reduction based upon the language of the releases.\u201d In determining joint tortfeasor status, \u201cproblems arise, most frequently, where the actual liability of the settling defendant is <em>not </em>determined by the trier of fact\u201d and the court resorts \u201cat least initially, to the language of the release.\u201d <em>Collier, </em>86 Md.App. at 57, 585 A.2d 256 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The Good Samaritan Release</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">When \u201cthe settling parties specify in the release that the releasee is to be regarded as a joint tortfeasor,\u201d then \u201cthe releasee\u2019s status as a joint tortfeasor is contractually determined.\u201d <em>Collier, </em>86 Md.App. at 57, 585 A.2d 256. \u201cMaryland follows the objective law of contract interpretation and construction.\u201d <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v.

In addition, when the language of the contract is plain and unambiguous there is no room for construction, and a court must presume that the parties meant what they expressed. In these circumstances, the true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. Consequently, the clear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give away [sic] to what the parties thought that the agreement meant or intended it to mean____As a result, when the contractual language is clear and unambiguous, and in the absence of fraud, duress, or mistake, parol evidence is not admissible to show the intention of the parties or to vary, alter, or contradict the terms of that contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 496-97, 872 A.2d 969 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Gen.

Appellant points to the use of the terms \u201cclaims,\u201d \u201cshares,\u201d and \u201cparties released\u201d in the following language of the release:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>[T]he <em>Releasing Parties </em>hereby irrevocably consent that said <em>claims </em>against any party not released by this Settlement Agreement shall be reduced to the extent of the pro rata <em>shares </em>of the <em>Released Party </em>or the amount paid for this Settlement Agreement, whichever is greater, pursuant to [UCATA], that such reduction shall occur whether or not any or all of <em>the parties released </em>under this Settlement Agreement are determined to be joint tortfeasors with the parties not so released,....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">(Emphasis added by appellant).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Use of these plural terms, appellant posits\u2014\u201cespecially the plural term \u2018shares\u2019\u2014suggests that Good Samaritan[\u2019s] <em>[pro-</em>rata] reduction can include more than the single share that [a]ppellees urge.\u201d Finally, appellant argues that the language used in the release \u201cspecifies that the reduction can be applied whether or not all the parties released are determined to be joint tortfeasors, establishing that [ajppellees were consenting to multiple reductions in the release document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Appellees counter that \u201c[t]he clear and unambiguous intent of the Release was to establish one joint tortfeasor share.\u201d (Bold added by appellees). In so arguing, appellees emphasize that the Good Samaritan release, by its terms, \u201cdeems\u201d that Good Samaritan is to be considered \u201ca Joint Tortfeasor\u201d to the same extent as if Good Samaritan had been adjudicated \u201ca Joint Tortfeasor.\u201d (Bold and underline added by appel-lees). Appellees acknowledge the \u201call-inclusive definition of Released Party,\u201d but note that \u201cnowhere in the Release is it established[ ] which specific agent was hable or that the magnitude of Good Samaritan\u2019s <em>pro rata </em>share is three.\u201d In other words, according to appellees, the release does not specify \u201chow many Good Samaritan agents are to be counted as joint tortfeasors in determining <em>pro rata </em>shares.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In the instant case, the status of Good Samaritan as a joint tortfeasor is conceded, and thus the verdict must be reduced by a <em>pro rata </em>share attributable to Good Samaritan. <em>See </em>UCATA \u00a7 3-1404. But before we reach the issue of whether a further reduction in the verdict is required for <em>pro </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>rata </em>shares attributable to certain agents or employees of Good Samaritan, appellant has the burden of establishing the joint tortfeasor status of such agents or employees, namely, Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A. <em>See Swigert, </em>213 Md. at 619, 133 A.2d 428; <em>Jones, </em>54 Md.App. at 608, 459 A.2d 219. As previously stated, appellant contends that he has satisfied this burden by virtue of the language of the Good Samaritan release. We disagree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In our view, the language of the Good Samaritan release is clear and unambiguous. The Good Samaritan release is entitled \u201cSettlement Agreement and Release\u201d and provides that \u201c[t]he Releasing Parties identified herein and Good Samaritan Hospital of Maryland, Inc. ONLY desire to enter into this Settlement Agreement....\u201d Thus the only parties to the settlement agreement are appellees and Good Samaritan. Writing for this Court in <em>Jacobs, </em>Judge Sally Adkins, now a member of the Court of Appeals, stated that \u201c[jjoint tort-feasor status is determined by application of [UCATA], and an agreement could only determine joint tort-feasor status of one who was a party thereto.\u201d 131 Md.App. at 371, 749 A.2d 174. Accordingly, Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A, as non-parties to the settlement agreement, could not attain joint tortfeasor status. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Even if they could be deemed joint tortfeasors by agreement of appellees and Good Samaritan, the Good Samaritan release never specifically identified Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, or Nurse A as a \u201cReleased Party\u201d or \u201ca Joint Tortfeasor.\u201d Indeed, the only party expressly named as a \u201cReleased Party\u201d is Good Samaritan, and the release provides that \u201cthe Released Party shall be deemed <em>a </em>Joint Tortfeasor ... to the same extent as if the Released Party had been adjudicated to be <em>a </em>Joint Tortfeasor by the final judgment of a court of record after trial on the merits.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The fact that Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A are members of a class of individuals <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cemployee,\u201d \u201cstaff,\u201d \u201cresident ... physician[ ],\u201d or \u201cnurse\u201d) who are included in the definition of a \u201cReleased Party\u201d does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>them joint tortfeasors. At the hearing before the circuit court on appellant\u2019s motion to reduce the verdict under the provisions of UCATA, appellees\u2019 counsel advised the court that Good Samaritan had 2,301 employees, which included \u201cpeople who were never involved in this case.\u201d Counsel then rhetorically asked the court: \u201cDoes that mean we get 2,301 shares for the hospital because all of the employees are now considered joint tort[f]easors?\u201d The answer is clearly \u201cno,\u201d because such construction of the language of the release would be, using appellees\u2019 term, \u201cludicrous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Appellees\u2019 counsel went on to argue to the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">In order to have a joint [tortfeasor] status, and receive the reduction under [UCATA], there is only one of two ways that can happen. You have to ... admit that you are a joint [tortfeasor] by the language of the release or you have to have judicial determination,.... There is no admission that [Dr.] Sahi, Bosse or this Nurse, I don\u2019t even know who [appellant\u2019s counsel] is talking about, were [tortfea-sors], they don\u2019t admit to being [tortfeasors] in this release, their names never appear[ ] in this release, they were never parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">We agree that there is no admission or other statement in the Good Samaritan release that Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A are deemed to be joint tortfeasors. The plain language of the release identifies no one, other than Good Samaritan, as a joint tortfeasor. Accordingly, appellant has failed to satisfy his burden of establishing that Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A were joint tortfeasors, and thus appellant was not entitled to a reduction in the jury\u2019s verdict for <em>pro rata </em>shares attributable to those individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Even assuming, as appellant claims, that, in Section IV of the Good Samaritan release quoted above, the use of the singular term \u201ca Joint Tortfeasor\u201d with the plural terms \u201cclaims,\u201d \u201cshares,\u201d and \u201cparties released\u201d renders the Good Samaritan release ambiguous, we reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Appellant insists that \u201cparol evidence can be consulted to reconcile any ambiguity.\u201d The \u201cundisputed parol evidence\u201d offered by appellant is (1) \u201cexpert designation letters prepared by [ajppellees\u2019 counsel alleging negligence on the part of\u2019 Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A, and (2) \u201csworn deposition transcripts from three of [ajppellees\u2019 own expert witnesses to the same effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">If a contract, including a release, is ambiguous, parol evidence may be consulted to show the intent of the parties at the time that the contract was created. <em>Anne Arundel County v. Crofton Corp., </em>286 Md. 666, 673-74, 410 A.2d 228 (1980). The critical time is when the contract was entered into by the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 673, 410 A.2d 228. The expert witness designation letter was prepared seven months before the creation of the Good Samaritan release, and the testimony of the expert witnesses was also taken months earlier. Such evidence failed to establish any intent by appellees or Good Samaritan to designate Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A as three joint tortfeasors <em>at the time that the release was executed. </em>Indeed, the only \u201cevidence\u201d of intent was a statement by appellees\u2019 counsel to the trial court that the \u201cintent of the parties\u201d was for Good Samaritan and its employees to be one share.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In addition, appellant\u2019s parol evidence regarding Nurse Bosse and Nurse A failed to establish that they were joint tortfeasors. For Nurse Bosse, appellees\u2019 experts testified that she breached the standard of care, but never opined that such breach was a cause of Adrian\u2019s death. Nurse A was never identified; the expert testimony was simply that the hospital <em>staff </em>delayed administering antibiotics, and \u201c[t]here really is not a lot of detail about what that time lapse was all about, <em>whether that was a nursing issue, whether that was a physician issue, </em>.... \u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Thus appellant\u2019s \u201cparol evidence\u201d failed to establish the joint tortfeasor status of Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, or Nurse A in the release. Accordingly, no <em>pro rata </em>shares can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>attributed to these individuals for the purpose of reducing the jury\u2019s verdict against appellant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\"><em>Pro Rata </em>Shares Attributable to the Good Samaritan and E.P.A. Releases</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">As noted above, UCATA \u00a7 3-1404 provides that, where a plaintiff releases a joint tortfeasor, the verdict against another joint tortfeasor shall be reduced by the amount paid or by any proportion that the settlement release provides, if greater than the amount paid. Where, as here, a release provides for a <em>pro rata </em>reduction, we determine the number of <em>pro rata </em>shares based on the number of joint tortfeasors. First, appellant was adjudicated liable and therefore constitutes one joint tortfeasor. Second, in <em>Chilcote v. Von Der Ahe Van Lines, </em>300 Md. 106, 121-22, 476 A.2d 204 (1984), the Court of Appeals held that, where a party is deemed a joint tortfeasor as a result of being vicariously liable for the negligent conduct of its agent, then the principal and agent together comprise one joint-tortfeasor share for the purpose of reduction. Consequently, both appellant and appellees agree that E.P.A. and its employee, Dr. Kostrubiak, together form one joint tortfeasor. Finally, having determined that there is one joint tortfeasor attributable to Good Samaritan, the total number of joint tortfeasors is three. Thus the number of <em>pro rata </em>shares is three. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in reducing the judgment against appellant by two-thirds.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\">. Dr. Hotzclaw was also dismissed with prejudice, but without a settlement agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\">. Although appellant\u2019s motion sought to reduce the verdict, the motion was, in reality, to reduce the judgment, as the court had already entered judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See </em>Md. Rules 2-532 to 2-535.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[3]\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\">3.

In the instant appeal, Good Samaritan filed an amicus brief, in which it contends that a non-settling defendant may prove the joint tortfeasor status of released parties in three ways. The non-settling defendant \"may submit to the court that some or all of the released parties have been (1) adjudicated to be joint tortfeasors; (2) deemed to be joint tortfeasors in accord with <em>Jones v. Hurst, </em>[54 Md.App. 607, 459 A.2d 219 (1983)]; or (3) determined to be joint tortfeasors by 'something short of an actual judgment[.]\u2019 \u201d For examples of the third category, Good Samaritan cites to <em>Owens-Illinois v. Cook, </em>386 Md. 468, 872 A.2d 969 (2005) (a default judgment establishes joint tortfeasor status of the party against whom the judgment is taken) and to <em>Collier, </em>86 Md.App. at 38, 585 A.2d 256 (post-trial proceedings can be employed by the court to determine the joint tortfeasor status of a party to an ambiguous release). Because appellant\u2019s argument in this appeal relies solely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the interpretation of the Good Samaritan release, we need not express an opinion on Good Samaritan\u2019s synthesis of the case law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">. <em>Swigert </em>involved a two-car collision, occurring while the plaintiff, Newport, was riding in the car of defendant, Swigert, at night, and Swigert allegedly failed to turn on his headlights. <em>Swigert, </em>213 Md. at 615, 133 A.2d 428.

As additional support for his contention that Good Samaritan\u2019s release encompasses more than one joint-tortfeasor share, appellant argues that, because Good Samaritan paid $550,000 for its release and E.P.A. paid $400,000 for its release, \u201d[t]his suggests that Good Samaritan Hospital had greater exposure, a logical conclusion to reach if more than one actor at Good Samaritan Hospital was potentially responsible.\u201d We do not discern, nor can we reasonably infer, from a comparison of the amount of consideration paid for the Good Samaritan and E.P.A. releases that Good Samaritan\u2019s release accounts for more than one joint-tortfeasor share, much less precisely three shares.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
