Pro. \u00a7 14, subd. 8, \u201cas a case where an attachment or any other proceeding to punish for a contempt has been usually adopted, and practiced in a court of record, to enforce a civil remedy of a parly to an action or special proceeding in that court, or to protect the right of a party;\u201d or under subdivision 2 of the same section \u201c \u00a1is a deceit or abuse of a proceeding of a court by a party to an action, provided in either case that a right or remedy of a party has thereby been defeated, impaired, or impeded, 01 prejudiced.\u201d <em>N. Y. Daily Reg. </em>Feb. 12, 1886; opinion by Hall, J., Browne, J., concurring.</p><p id=\"b156-8\"> Counsel contended :\u2014I. There was no perjury because the answer was literally true. There was no sufficient evidence to justify the adjudication that the answer was false. The judge had no power <em>after </em>judgment, upon <em>ex parte </em>affidavits, to determine the question (Wayland <em>v. </em>Tysen, 45 <em>N. Y. </em>281; Thompson <em>v. </em>Erie R. R. Co., <em>Id. </em>468). Even if defendant was guilty of perjury, his act was not punishable as a private or civil contempt of court under Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 14, subd. 2, the word deceit therein referring to the court, and a false pleading, verified or not, is not within its meaning. Perjury <em>per se </em>is not a punishable contempt though committed in presence of the court (State v. Terence, 20 <em>Reporter, </em>650). See Harrington v. Goepp (Supm. Ct. 1st Dept. April, 1881), where a judge of the city court was held liable for false imprisonment in committing plaintiff for contempt, in serving upon the trial a verified amended answer in conflict with his original verified answer, which the judge found to be false. See the language of Finch, J., in People <em>ex rel. </em>Munsel v. Oyer &amp; Terminer, 3 <em>Eastern Rep. </em>563, 567. Ho precedent can be found for defendant\u2019s punishment under Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 14, subd. 8. The city court is a court of inferior jurisdiction; and ihe fact that it has been made a court of record, does not enlarge its power to punish con-tempts (Rutherford <em>v. </em>Holmes, <em>5 Hun, </em>317; aff\u2019d 66 <em>N. Y. </em>368; Queen v. Lefroy, <em>L. R. </em>8 <em>Q. B. </em>134; 4 <em>Moak's Eng. </em>250; and see article in 23 <em>Alb. L. J. </em>145).</p><p id=\"b156-12\">II. Under Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 2284, the amount of fine is limited to the actual loss or injury, which must be ascertained by proof according to the rules of law, which would apply in an action for such damages. Sudlow <em>v. </em>Knox, 7 Abb. <em>Pr. N. S. </em>411; Dejonge v. Brenneman, 23 <em>Hun, </em>332; Clark <em>v. </em>Bininger, 75 <em>N. Y. </em>344, 352; King <em>v. </em>Flynn, 37 <em>Hun, </em>329.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
