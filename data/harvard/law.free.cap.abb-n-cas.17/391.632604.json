Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 468-470, 472, 474, 476). The statutes (3 <em>R. S. </em>[6 ed.] 167), gave power to a father to appoint a guardian by deed or will, who may maintain all proper actions, &amp;c., which a guardian in socage might, and the latter could only sue as to lands of an infant under fourteen years of age (Byrne <em>v. </em>Van Hoesen, 5 <em>Johns. </em>66). By 3 <em>R. S. </em>(6 ed.) 73l, it is clear that an infant must sue in his own name by a competent and responsible guardian <em>ad litem. </em>See also, Matter of Frits, 2 Paige, 374, 376 ; Grantman <em>v. </em>Theall, 19 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>308; Hoyt <em>v. </em>Hilton, 2 <em>Edw. Ch. </em>202 (where the chancellor would not allow the father of infants who had been, appointed their general guardian to sue, to recover legacies without being first \u00a1appointed guardian <em>ad </em>litem); Bradley <em>v. </em>Amidon, 10 Paige, 235; 2 <em>Kent's Com. </em>(12 ed.) 228, 229 ; <em>Cro. Jac. </em>4; Cro. <em>Eliz. </em>424; 1 <em>Roll. Abr. </em>287, pl. 3, 2; Mockey <em>v. </em>Grey, 2 <em>Johns. </em>192; Alderman <em>v. </em>Tirrell, 8 <em>Johns. </em>418; Bullard <em>v. </em>Spoor, 2 <em>Cow. </em>430; Bradwell <em>v. </em>Weeks, 1 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>325; Matter of Howes, 2 <em>Edw. Ch. </em>484; Hill <em>v. </em>Thatcher, 3 <em>How. Pr. </em>407; Hulburt <em>v. </em>Newell, 4 <em>Id. </em>93; Litchfield <em>v. </em>Burrell, 5 <em>Id. </em>341, 345; Hoftailing v<em>. </em>Teal, 11 <em>Id. </em>188; Croghan <em>v. </em>Livingston, 6 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>351, 352. Where real estate of the infant is concerned, the action can only be brought by the guardian in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>socage or the general guardian, and not by the infant (Chapman <em>v. </em>Tibbitts, 33 <em>N. Y. </em>289; Cagger <em>v. </em>Lansing, 64 <em>Id. </em>417); and. the objection in such case as to the party plaintiff, must be taken by demurrer (Seaton <em>v. </em>Davis, 1 <em>Supm. Ct. </em>[T. <em>&amp; </em>C.] 91; Holmes <em>v. </em>Seeley, 17 <em>Wend. </em>78; <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 1686; More <em>v. </em>Deyoo, 22 <em>Hun, </em>208).</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-5\">II. In the case of Thomas <em>v. </em>Bennett, 56 <em>Barb. </em>197, sustaining an action by a general guardian for pension money due the infant, attention of the court was not called to Hoyt <em>v. </em>Hilton, 2 <em>Edw. Ch. </em>202, and Bradley <em>v. </em>Amidon, 10 Paige, 235, where suit for share of infants in an estate of a deceased person was dismissed because the general guardian had no right to sue, and not because the shares had not been ascertained. White <em>v. </em>Parker, 8 <em>Barb. </em>48,52, was relied on, entirely ignoring 3 <em>E. S. </em>(6 ed.) 731, which expressly determined the question, and not the provisions of <em>Id. </em>167. Cases showing the power of executors, and of committees of lunatics, &amp;c., have no application because the statutes expressly authorize suit by them (1 <em>R. S. </em>446, 447; 3 <em>R. S. </em>[6 ed.] 732 [superseded by <em>Code Pro. </em>\u00a7 471]; <em>L. </em>1845, p. 91, \u00a7 2). No statute ever gave general guardians such authority. The rights and property of infants were never the rights and property of the general guardian ;\u2022 the latter is only entitled to thepossesshmand <em>care </em>of the personalty, but the personalty is the property of the' infant, and must be sued for in his name. See Segelken <em>v. </em>Meyer, 14 Hun, 593; 22 <em>Id. </em>6 ; aff\u2019d, 94 <em>N. Y. </em>473, sustaining suit by guardian <em>ad litem </em>to recover personalty of the infant. Also 1 <em>Abb. Forms, </em>ch. 5, 51, head-note; 7 <em>Abb. N. Y. Dig. </em>title Guardian <em>ad litem, </em>and Guardian and Ward; Hahn <em>v. </em>Van Doren, 1 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>411; Wood v. Wood, S <em>Wend. </em>357.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-6\">III. The provisions of 3 <em>R. S. </em>(6 ed.) 167, were not repealed by the Code of Civil Procedure. <em>L. </em>1880, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>c. 245, did not repeal \u00a7 3, which is still law. But the provisions of 3 <em>R. S. </em>(6 ed.) 731, were repealed by the act of 1880, and <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 468, 469, 472, 475, 477 took their place. It is very plain, therefore, that where an infant has a right, <em>Tie </em>is entitled to maintain an action thereon, and a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the infant plaintiff <em>mast </em>be appointed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-5\"><em>Otto Meyer </em>and <em>Frederick A. Cord, </em>for the plaintiffs, opposed.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b442-6\">O\u2019Gorman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2B\">\u2014This action is brought by the gen eral guardians of infants, to assert their claim against the New York Produce Exchange for $5,000,\u2014which became due and payable by that association to-the widow and next of kin of August Buermann, deceased, and against Eva Buermann, the widow, who demur on the ground, among others, \u201cthat the general guardians had no right or power to sue in their own names to recover this property belonging to the infants, and that suit could only be properly brought by a guardian <em>ad litem P</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The question raised by this demurrer has not been altogether free from doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">In Segelken <em>v. </em>Meyer, 94 <em>N. Y. </em>473, the court say, that it does not appear to\u2019have been ever decided by that court. It held, however, that that action was well brought in the name of the guardian <em>ad litem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The Code of Civil Procedure, which in sections 469, 470, and 476, requires that before a summons is issued in the name of an infant plaintiff, a competent person must be appointed to act as his guardian <em>ad litem, </em>and provides also that the general guardian may be appointed as guardian <em>ad litem, </em>sufficiently expresses the intent of the law as it now is, viz., that by the intervention of that officer alone, an action on behalf of an infant can be brought, at least in cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>where the assertion of the infant's claim to recover persona] property is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The case of Cagger <em>v. </em>Lansing, 64 <em>N. Y. </em>417, was decided before the adoption of the Code of Civil Procedure now in force. It was an action brought by the general guardian of infants to recover real estate/ and it was held, that their rights in such an action were enforceable by their mother as guardian in socage <em>(Id. </em>p. 426).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The case at bar is concerned with the assertion of the claim of infants, not to real estate, as <em>to </em>which alone a guardian in socage could have represented them in an action, but only to personalty, and the case last cited throws, therefore, no light on the present inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In my opinion, the necessity of clear and uniform practice under the provisions of\" the Code of Civil Procedure above referred to, requires that the rule should be recognized, that in cases such as that at bar, the action should always be brought in the name of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>propeily appointed, and that, if brought in the name of the general guardian, they are not well brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">For these reasons, this demurrer is sustained, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
