Bayer and Stephen A. Bayer, infants, with James L. Phillips.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">The plaintiff was a judicially appointed guardian of the persons and estates of these infants, and to her, as such, a bond and mortgage forming part of the personal estate of the infants had been assigned. On default in payment, she sued as general guardian and sole plaintiff, to foreclose the mortgage; and, having obtained judgment directing a sale, purchased the property as such general guardian at the sale, and a deed was executed to her in her name as general guardian, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-7\">Subsequently she contracted to sell the premises thus purchased, to Mr. Phillips ; who now objected to the title, claiming that the foreclosure should have been in the name of the infants with a guardian <em>ad litem,, </em>and that plaintiff could not sell without leave of court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-8\">The provisions of the New York statutes affecting these questions are as follows: \u201cEvery action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, except that an executor or administrator, a trustee of an express trust, or a person expressly authorized by statute, may sue, without joining with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>him the person for whose benefit the action is prosecuted. A person, with whom or in whose name, a contract is made for the benefit of another, is a trustee of an express trust, within the meaning of this section\u201d <em>(Code Civ.

The action of foreclosure was properly brought by the plaintiff in her own name, as general guardian. It was not necessary to bring the action in the name of the infants, and the infants not being parties, no guardian <em>ad litem </em>wa?s required (Thomas <em>v. </em>Bennett, 56 <em>Barb. </em>197; White <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>v. Parker, 8 <em>Id. 48, </em>52; Pardee v. Van Anken, 3 <em>Id. 534; Hauenstein </em>v. Kull, 59 <em>How. Pr. </em>24, 25; Person v. Warren, 14 <em>Barb. </em>489; Davis <em>v. </em>Carpenter, 12 <em>How. Pr. </em>287; Segelken v. Meyer, 14 <em>Hun, </em>593; Torry y. Black, 58 <em>N. Y. </em>185; Field <em>v. </em>Schieffelin, 7 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>150; Pond v. Curtiss, 7 <em>Id. 45</em>; Coakley v. Mahar, 36 <em>Hun, </em>157; Cagger <em>v. </em>Lansing, 64 <em>N. Y. </em>417; Holmes v. Seeley, 17 <em>Wend. </em>75; Seaton <em>v. </em>Davis, 1 <em>Supm. Ct. </em>[T. <em>&amp; C.] </em>91). Section 1686 of Code of Civil Procedure is permissive only. It contains no negative words, and therefore leaves the common law rule unrepealed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-5\">II. As the bond and mortgage was assigned to Minnie Bayer, as general guardian, &amp;c., she had the right to maintain the action as a trustee of an express trust (Segelken v. Meyer, 14 <em>Hun, </em>593; Thomas v. Bennett, 56 <em>Barb. </em>197, 200; Person <em>v. </em>Warren, 14 <em>Id. </em>489; Field v. Schieffelin, 7 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>150).</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-6\">III. The objection was waived by failure to raise-it in the foreclosure by demurrer (Seaton v. Davis, 1 <em>Supm. Ct. [T. &amp; C.] </em>91).</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-7\">IV. As the mortgage foreclosed was a part of the personal property of the infant, and the land in question was bought in by the guardian to protect the</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-8\">- estate of the infant, it must be considered as personal property (Horton v. McCoy, 47 <em>N. Y. </em>21; Ware v. Palhill, 11 <em>Vesey, </em>278; Chapman <em>v. </em>Tibbits, 33 <em>N. Y. </em>289, 290; Tuttle <em>v. </em>Heavy, <em>59 Barb. </em>334 Field v. Schieffelin, 7 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>150).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-9\"><em>S. M. Doscher, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\"> The question might be different if the mortgage or other contract to be enforced by the action was made to or with the infant by name, and had not been judicially or otherwise assigned to the guardian. A somewhat similar distinction is made in the case of executors, administrators, receivers and trustees, as between actions which they must bring in their official or trust capacity, and those which they should or may bring in their individual names, without alleging their qualification. In the former class fall most of the rights which, as such, belong to the estate they represent, and which have devolved upon them merely by operation of law. In the latter class are rights of action which arise in transactions had with them since their qualification; in respect of these, their action does not generally require an allegation of official character or capacity, even under the recent statute (N. Y. <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 1814), declaring that an action or special proceeding, hereafter commenced by an executor or administrator, upon a cause of action belonging to him in his representative capacity, or an action or special proceeding hereafter commenced against him, except where it is brought to charge him personally, must be brought by or against him in his representative capacity.\u201d See the next case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b473-10\"> In connection with this, it is worthy of notice that by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Revised Statutes, an express trust of real property, valid in its creation, vests the whole of the estate in the trustee in law and in equity, subject only to the execution of the trust, so that the infant, although beneficially interested, is neither in law nor in equity the owner of the property in the sense required to maintain an action respecting it against a third person, <em>1 R. </em>S. 729, \u00a7 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">For recent applications of the statute, see Crooke v. County of Kings, 97 <em>N. Y. </em>421; Moore v. Appleby, 36 <em>Hun, </em>368.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\"> The Article IV. above referred to, is that in the chapter on Parties which relates to infants, and contains section 408 above stated. Sections 1535, 1536, relate only to guardians <em>ad litem, </em>in partition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b475-10\"> The statute does not forbid the sale of an-infant's property, but is aimed at authorizing a sale as an exception to the common law incapacity of an infant to sell.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b476-10\">Per Curiam.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"Ahf\">\u2014There are two points at issue in this controversy which has sprung out of the facts agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">As to the first point,\u2014namely, whether the foreclosure action was properly brought in the name of Minnie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Bayer, general guardian, as sole plain US\u2019,\u2014we think that there can be no doubt that the action was properly brought in her name, she being a trustee of an express trust within the meaning of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">As to the second point, we entertain no doubt that under the facts and circumstances disclosed, the guardian had the right to sell the property without obtaining an order of the court therefor, and for these reasons the plaintiff is entitled to judgment, but without costs, according to the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Note on Executors, Guardians, &amp;c., Buying in.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">A guardian or other trustee who purchases in his own individual name\u2014a method which has sometimes been resorted to from the mistaken idea that its legal effect would be to facilitate resale\u2014runs the risk of involving the title in the claims of his creditors in case of insolvency before sale is effected, or in the claims of his heirs in case of death, and does not avoid the possibility of objections to title on the ground of the existence of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Such a purchase is voidable at the election of tlie <em>cestuis que trustent, </em>and relief may be given against one to whom the trustee purchasing in his own name has conveyed or mortgaged with notice of the facts. Dodge v. Stevens, 94 <em>N. Y. </em>209.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">The decision in the text indicates the proper course for a guardian, executor, or other trustee in buying in to take title in his own name, and as guardian if it be desired, to hold the property so that it can be sold without such formalities as may be required if the purchase was in the name of the ward or <em>cestui que trust; </em>but the conveyance better not merely describe the grantee by the addition \u201c guardian,\u201d but make him a party <em>as </em>guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">The embarrassment of taking title individually is often enhanced by the difficulty attending the establishment of a trust by oral evidence. For the mode of doing this, see Foote <em>v. </em>Bryant, 47 <em>N. Y. </em>544; aff\u2019g Foote v. Foote, 58 <em>Barb. </em>258; and for Note on Actions to Establish Trust, see 13 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>334.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">The following recent cases illustrate the effect of buying in.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">Where an administratrix purchased in her own name property once belonging to her testator, and sold by a receiver of his property for the benefit of his creditors, but the purchase was made under such circumstances that she did not purchase as trustee to protect the property, <em>\u2014Held, </em>that the purchase did not inure for the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>of creditors, and that the administratrix could not be compelled to account therefor. Peters v. Carr, 2 <em>Dem. </em>22.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Where an executor loans money belonging to the estate, and takes the bond and mortgage in his own name, payable to himself individually, in case of default the cause of action accrues to him individually, and can be enforced by his personal representatives only. [Distinguishing Walton <em>v. </em>Walton, 4 Abb. Ct. App. Dec. 512; Luers y. Brunges, 56 How. Pr. 282; and citing Dale v. Roosevelt, 8 Cow. 333; Patterson v. Patterson, 59 N. Y. 574; Austin v. Munro, 47 N. Y. 360; Ferrin v. Myrick, 41 N. Y. 315.] Caulkins v. Bolton, 98 <em>N. Y. </em>511.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">A trustee who holds, as such, the title to lands subject to a mortgage, cannot, upon the mortgage being foreclosed and the property bid in by the mortgagee, take an assignment of the bid and a deed from the referee. A title so acquired is defective in the hands of a purchaser with notice. [Citing Gardner v. Ogden, 22 N. Y. 327; Forbes v. Halsey, 26 Id. 53, 65; Abbott v. American Hard Rubber Co., 33 Barb. 578; Fox v. Mackreth, 1 Lead. Cas. in Eq. (H. <em>&amp; </em>W.) 188, 255; Obert v. Obert, 2 Stock.

(J. &amp; S.) </em>163.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">A deed by an executor and another deed, dated four days later, by his grantee to the executor personally, both recorded on the same day, with an interval of but five minutes <em>between,\u2014Held, </em>presumptively to constitute but a single transaction, in which the executor acted in the double capacity of vendor and purchaser of the trust property, and that the title conveyed was therefore voidable by the beneficiaries under the will. [Citing Davoue v. Fanning, 2 Johns. Ch. 252; Gardner v. Ogden, 22 N. Y. 327; Forbes v. Halsey, 26 Id. 53; Van Epps v. Van Epps, 9 Pai. 237; Duncomb v. N. Y., Housatonic, etc. R. R. Co., 84 N. Y. 199.] People v. Open Board of Stock Brokers\u2019 Bldg. Co., 92 <em>N. Y. </em>98; rev\u2019g in part 28 <em>Hun, </em>274,</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">In affirmance of a like principle, it was held, that whoever receives property, knowing that it is the subject of a trust, and has been transferred by the trustee in violation of his duty or power, takes it subject to the right, not only of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>but also of the trustee, to reclaim possession or to recover for its conversion. [Citing Briggs v. Davis, 20 N. Y. 15; Western R. R. Co. v. Nolan, 48 N. Y. 513.] Wetmore v. Porter, 92 <em>N. Y. </em>76.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Upon somewhat the same principle, executors who foreclose and buy in have power to sell the real property thus purchased, although there be no express power contained in the will, so that if the prop- \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>erty had belonged to the testator they could not have sold it. Cook v. Ryan, 29 <em>Hun, </em>249.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The insertion of the words, \u201cguardian or executor,\u201d &amp;c., after name, may operate as notice of the rights of those for whom he is trustee. Fellows v. Longyor, 91 <em>N. Y. </em>324.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">On the question of the right, as between life beneficiary and beneficiary in remainder, to a profit made by buying in at the first sale, see Roosevelt v.
