Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The district court denied his request to proceed IFP on appeal certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Ar-mendariz\u2019s IFP motion in this court is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-22\">In his IFP motion, Armendariz argues that the district court\u2019s denial of IFP status violated his right to due process. By failing to address the bases for the district court\u2019s certification decision, he has abandoned those issues in the context of this IFP motion. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-23\">The district court sua sponte determined that Armendariz\u2019s complaint was frivolous because it was filed after the applicable two-year limitations period had elapsed. The district court also concluded that Ar-mendariz\u2019s complaint was subject to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>missal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because it was barred under <em>Heck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">We need not decide' whether the two bases for the district court\u2019s dismissal of Armendariz\u2019s complaint were proper because Armendariz\u2019s claims were otherwise subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See Sojourner T. v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992) (holding that this court can typically affirm a district court\u2019s judgment in a civil suit on any ground that is apparent from the record). In the instant complaint, Armendariz is seeking damages for the wrongful seizure and loss of his property. The random and unauthorized intentional deprivation of property by a state actor does not constitute a civil-rights violation if the state provides a meaningful post-deprivation remedy. <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). In Texas, the tort of conversion fulfills that remedy requirement. <em>Murphy v. Collins, </em>26 F.3d 541, 543 (5th Cir.1994). Armen-dariz\u2019s claim based upon the seizure and conversion of his property is therefore not actionable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See id. </em>at 543-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Armendariz\u2019s motion for leave for IFP on appeal is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Armendariz\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Armendariz has at least two other strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Armendariz v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>355 Fed.Appx. 859, 859-60 (5th Cir.2009). Because Armendariz has accumulated at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may no longer proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Also, in light of Armendariz\u2019s history of filing frivolous pleadings, lawsuits, and habeas corpus petitions, we warn Armendariz that frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings will invite the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and/or restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b818-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
