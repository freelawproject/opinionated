On appeal, Smith challenges the district court\u2019s application of a dangerous weapon enhancement and contends that the district court should have applied the penalty provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) as amended by the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d). After review, we affirm Smith\u2019s dangerous weapon enhancement, but vacate and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Al6\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b688-18\">In May 2010, detectives with the Hills-borough County, Florida Sheriffs office received information that Defendant Smith was distributing crack cocaine. Later that month, on May 25, 2010, undercover detectives contacted Smith and arranged the purchase of 1.4 grams of crack cocaine from him. Smith arrived at the prearranged location and sold the detectives the agreed amount. Two days later, on May 27, 2010, after the detectives contacted him again, Smith met with the detectives and delivered an additional 14.4 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-19\">On June 2, 2010, law enforcement executed a search warrant on Smith\u2019s residence and recovered 26.8 grams of crack cocaine, 384 grams of marijuana, a box of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>baggies, a digital scale, and an unloaded Beretta USA Corp. 22 Long Rifle caliber pistol. Every item except the pistol was found in the master bedroom. The pistol was found on top of the refrigerator near the front door. Smith admitted ownership of the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">On September 9, 2010, a grand jury indicted Smith on the above three counts. Smith\u2019s May 25, 2010 and May 27, 2010 drug sales formed the basis of Counts One and Two, respectively. The crack cocaine found in Smith\u2019s residence formed the basis for Count Three. Subsequently, the government filed a notice of prior convictions, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a), outlining Smith\u2019s five previous felony drug offenses that the government planned to rely upon at sentencing. Smith pled guilty to all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">B. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Smith\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) initially calculated his base offense level as 26 based on the total amount of crack cocaine involved (42.6 grams) in Smith\u2019s three counts (1.4 grams in Count One, 14.4 grams in Count Two and 26.8 grams in Count Three). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(7). The PSI then increased Smith\u2019s offense level by two levels due to the presence of a dangerous weapon, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 28. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Because Smith qualified as a career offender due to his prior felony convictions, the PSI reset the offense level at 87 based on Smith\u2019s statutory maximum life sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After decreasing Smith\u2019s offense level by three levels for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SEl.l(a) and for timely notification of intent to plead guilty under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SEl.l(a) and (b), the PSI calculated Smith\u2019s total offense level as 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">The PSI assigned Smith a criminal history category VI based on either Smith\u2019s lengthy criminal history or, alternatively, his career offender status. With an offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of VI, the PSI recommended an advisory guidelines range of 262 to 327 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">C. Smith\u2019s Objection</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">Smith did not object to the underlying facts in the PSI. Relevant to this appeal, Smith objected to the two-level dangerous weapon enhancement. Smith also filed a motion requesting the district court to apply provisions of the Fair Sentencing Act that went into effect August 3, 2010, after he committed the charged offenses, but before he was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Prior to the FSA, if a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 841(a) offense involved 5 or more grams of crack cocaine and the defendant had a prior felony drug conviction, he was subject to a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence and a <em>statutory maximum life sentence. See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2006). The FSA, among other things, raised the amount of crack cocaine in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) to 28 grams or more. <em>See </em>Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220 \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2872 (2010). Thus, after the FSA, if a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 841(a) offense involved less than 28 grams of crack cocaine and he had a prior felony drug conviction, he was not subject to any mandatory minimum sentence and his <em>statutory maximum sentence was thirty years\u2019 imprisonment, not life. See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Further, a defendant\u2019s statutory maximum sentence for each \u00a7 841(a) count is determined based on the amount of drugs involved in only that \u00a7 841(a) violation. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). Smith was charged with three separate \u00a7 841(a) offenses occurring on three different days. Although the total drug quantity in Smith\u2019s three \u00a7 841(a) offenses was 42.6 grams of crack cocaine under the guidelines calculations, each \u00a7 841(a) offense still involved less than 28 grams for purposes of calculating the statutory maximum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Here, Smith\u2019s sentencing objection argued that, after the FSA, Smith was no longer subject to any mandatory minimum sentence on Counts Two and Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Smith also contended, based on his new thirty-year statutory maximum under the FSA, that his offense level under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1(b), was 84, not 37. Smith claimed that, after the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, his total offense level should have been 31, which would yield an advisory guidelines range of 188 to 235 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">D. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">At a March 9, 2011 sentencing hearing, Smith reiterated his objection to the two-level dangerous weapon enhancement. Neither party presented testimony. Smith argued that \u201calthough he was residing in the residence he was in a different location. The weapon was not found on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">After questioning by the district court, Smith admitted that the firearm was found at Smith\u2019s residence, which he shared with his girlfriend. Smith did not dispute that \u201cincident to the search warrant, drugs, paraphernalia, and a firearm were found inside the residence connecting the residence to the drug activity.\u201d The district court asked Smith if he had any evidence to \u201cdemonstrate that the connection between the gun and the offense was ... clearly improbable.\u201d Smith responded that he did not, and the district court overruled his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">The district court also denied Smith\u2019s motion to apply the FSA. The district court stated that, based on this Court\u2019s precedent in <em>United States v. Gomes, </em>621 F.3d 1343 (11th Cir.2010), it was \u201cbound to apply the minimum mandatory penalties that apply to the offense committed prior to enactment of the FSA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">Smith then argued that he should receive a 120-month sentence based on the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Before sentencing, the district court discussed Smith\u2019s personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>and criminal history, the seriousness of the charged offenses, the need for public protection, and Smith\u2019s potential for rehabilitation. Although the district court found the applicable guidelines range to be 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment, the court stated that \u201ceven ... the low end of the advisory range is extraordinarily severe.\u201d The district court varied downward by 58 months and sentenced Smith to 204 months for each of the three counts, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">A. Dangerous Weapon Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Smith argues that the district court erred in applying the two-level dangerous weapon enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), a defendant\u2019s offense level increases by two levels \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The two-level increase applies \u201cif the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 3(A). Once the government demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm was present at the site of the charged conduct, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a connection between the firearm and the offense is clearly improbable. <em>United States v. Stallings, </em>463 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">The PSI\u2019s undisputed facts established that officers recovered the firearm from Smith\u2019s residence along with a large quantity of crack cocaine, a scale, and small plastic baggies. Although the firearm was not in the same room as the drugs and the distribution paraphernalia, it was stored on top of the refrigerator next to the front door. These facts are sufficient to carry the government\u2019s burden to show that the firearm was present at the site of Smith\u2019s charged drug activities. <em>See United States v. Hunter, </em>172 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir.1999) (concluding firearms were present at the site of the charged drug trafficking where they were found in defendant\u2019s home along with plastic baggies, glass vials, mixing spoons, diluting agent, and transaction records); <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 847 (11th Cir.1998) (concluding firearm was present where defendant\u2019s loaded gun was found in an office adjacent to the area where the cocaine was discovered). In contrast, Smith presented no evidence to suggest that the connection between the firearm and the drug offenses was clearly improbable.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">In any event, any alleged error was harmless. The district court ultimately calculated Smith\u2019s offense level based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender provision, and not on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. On appeal, Smith does not challenge that he qualified as a career offender under the advisory guidelines.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, any alleged error in the district court\u2019s application of the dangerous weapon enhancement did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>not affect Smith\u2019s advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">B. Fair Sentencing Act</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">At sentencing, the district court declined to apply the penalty provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) as amended by the FSA because Smith committed his crack cocaine offenses in May 2010, before the FSA\u2019s August 3, 2010 effective date. The Supreme Court recently held that the FSA\u2019s \u201cmore lenient penalty provisions apply to offenders who committed a crack cocaine crime before August 3, 2010, but were not sentenced until after August 3.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). While in most cases the FSA affects whether a mandatory minimum sentence applies, the FSA here affects Smith\u2019s statutory maximum sentence and in turn what offense level in \u00a7 4B1.1 should be used due to Smith\u2019s admitted career offender status. Those calculations and the ultimate sentence should be addressed by the district court in the first instance. We therefore vacate Smith\u2019s sentences and remand for the limited purpose of resentencing in light of <em>Dorsey.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-12\">. The career offender provision assigns offense levels based on the defendant\u2019s statutory maximum sentence and instructs the sentencing court to apply that offense level if it is greater than the otherwise-applicable offense level, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AZs\">Except as provided in subsection (c), if the offense level for a career offender from the table in this subsection is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in this subsection shall apply. A career offender\u2019s criminal history category in every case under this subsection shall be Category VI.</p>\n<p id=\"AtFX\">\n<em>Offense Statutory Maximum Offense Level</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AI6\">(1) Life 37</p>\n<p id=\"AX3\">(2) 25 years or more 34</p>\n<p id=\"Ab5\">(3) 20 years or more, but less than 25 years 32</p>\n<p id=\"ACh\">(4) 15 years or more, but less than 20 years 29</p>\n<p id=\"A2x\">(5) 10 years or more, but less than 15 years 24</p>\n<p id=\"AWjF\">(6) 5 years or more, but less than 10 years 17</p>\n<p id=\"AOB\">(7) More than 1 year, but less than 5 years 12.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahx\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\">. The Sentencing Guidelines group multiple \u00a7 841(a) counts together and calculate the defendant's base offense level based on the total drug quantity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1, 3D 1.2(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b691-9\">. We review for clear error the district court's findings of fact under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(b)(1), and we review <em>de novo </em>the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b691-10\">. As discussed herein, Smith does challenge his statutory maximum sentence under the FSA and what offense level should apply due to his career offender status, but he does not challenge his status as a career offender. And, even with a reduced statutory maximum of thirty years, Smith\u2019s career offender offense level of 34 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b) will still exceed his adjusted offense level of 28 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Again, this is why the alleged error is harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b692-10\">. Because we vacate Smith's 204-month sentence, we do not address his argument that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
