Martinez argues that her sentence is unreasonable and greater than necessary as measured by the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). She asserts that the career offender Sentencing Guideline, U.S.S.G. 4B1.1, conflicts with \u00a7 3553(a)(1), which requires the sentencing court to consider the particular nature and circumstances of the offense and the defendant\u2019s personal history and characteristics and that her guidelines range overstated the seriousness of her offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">The record reflects that the district court made an individualized determination at sentencing based on the facts presented and considered Martinez\u2019s arguments supporting a variance. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The record reflects that the district court implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Martinez\u2019s 77-month sentence, which is at the bottom of the advisory guidelines range, is presumed to be reasonable, and she has not shown sufficient reason for this court to disturb that presumption. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Martinez has not shown error, plain or otherwise, and her \u201cdisagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b878-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
