On November 20, 2006, during the course and scope of his employment, decedent appeared to pass out and was unresponsive for a period of time. The decedent subsequently complained of difficulty breathing and was taken by ambulance to the hospital where he remained until November 28, 2006. On December 12, 2006, the decedent was taken to a hospital emergency room where he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-25\">Decedent\u2019s wife, Shannon Frederick (the \u201cclaimant\u201d), filed a claim for benefits pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>suant to the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>An administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), in a lengthy and detailed 17-page order, awarded benefits to the claimant, and the Benefits Review Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d), in an unanimous three-judge five-page order, affirmed the award. M-I appeals the Board\u2019s decision, arguing that insufficient evidence supports ALJ\u2019s award determination. M-I argues that the evidence demonstrates that decedent\u2019s cause of death was unrelated to his work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">This court reviews decisions of the Board under the same standard the Board uses to review the ALJ: whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law. <em>SGS Control Servs. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>86 F.3d 438, 440 (5th Cir.1996). \u201cWe may not substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ, nor may we reweigh or reappraise the evidence, instead we inquire whether there was evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>Port Cooper/T. Smith Stevedoring Co. v. Hunter, </em>227 F.3d 285, 287 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cAs for findings of fact, we have repeatedly acknowledged that the ALJ, as sole factfinder, is entitled to consider all credibility inferences and his selection among inferences is conclusive if supported by the evidence and the law.\u201d <em>Bollinger Shipyards, Inc. v. Dir., Office of Worker\u2019s Comp. Programs, </em>604 F.3d 864, 871 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">There is a presumption that a claim comes within the provisions of the Act in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a); <em>Port Cooper, </em>227 F.3d at 287 (\u201c[Ijnherent in [\u00a7 920(a) ] is the presumption that an injury is causally related to a worker\u2019s employment.\u201d). To trigger this presumption, the claimant must make a prima facie showing of causation. <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo invoke the Section 920(a) presumption, a claimant must prove (1) that he or she suffered harm, and (2) that conditions existed at work, or an accident occurred at work, that could have caused, aggravated, or accelerated the condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). If a plaintiff establishes this prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption by pointing to \u201csubstantial evidence establishing the absence of a connection between the injury and the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288. \u201cIf the employer rebuts the presumption, then the issue of causation must be decided by looking at all the evidence of record,\u201d <em>Gooden v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>135 F.3d 1066, 1068 (5th Cir.1998), with claimant maintaining the ultimate burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Dir. Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, </em>512 U.S. 267, 277-78, 114 S.Ct. 2251, 129 L.Ed.2d 221 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">In this case, the ALJ made several determinations in accordance with the aforementioned law. The record supports the ALJ\u2019s first determination that the claimant made a prima facie showing of causation. The ALJ credited the testimony of the claimant\u2019s witnesses in finding that the decedent was exposed to lime dust and diesel fuel while at work, and that those exposures constituted working conditions that caused or could have caused the damage to the decedent\u2019s pulmonary artery, which ultimately led to his demise. The record also supports the ALJ\u2019s second determination that M-I rebutted the triggered presumption by presenting contrary doctors\u2019 opinions that denied an association between inhalation injuries and pulmonary blood clots.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Resolving this appeal, finally, the record also supports the ALJ\u2019s third determination, affirmed unanimously by the three-judge Board, that decedent\u2019s work condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>tions caused his death. The ALJ heard live testimony from Dr. Emil Laga, who opined that decedent\u2019s exposure to lime dust and diesel fumes caused damage to the pulmonary artery, which, because of a systematic inflammatory response syndrome (\u201cSIRS\u201d) response in the decedent, created the blood clot that led to his death. The ALJ explicitly found Dr. Laga\u2019s testimony \u201cclear and credible,\u201d noting preliminarily that Dr. Laga was \u201ca board certified forensic pathologist and toxicologist who has performed over 5000 autopsies and testified in about 500 proceedings.... \u201d The ALJ also highlighted and explained that Dr. Laga\u2019s trial testimony was \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and \u201csupported by medical records\u201d as well as by medical records which had been unavailable to him at the time of the original autopsy reports. Further, the ALJ stated that, \u201c[t]o the extent that other physicians are not aware or deny any connection between clotting and chemical exposure, I do not credit such testimony finding rather the more informed and credible testimony of Dr. Laga to be more persuasive and in line with the medical records and requirements of SIRS.\u201d We accord deference to the ALJ\u2019s firsthand credibility and evidence weighing determinations. <em>See Mendoza v. Marine Personnel Co., Inc., </em>46 F.3d 498, 500-01 (5th Cir.1995) (citation omitted) (\u201cThe ALJ determines the weight to be accorded to evidence and makes credibility determinations. Moreover, where the testimony of medical experts is at issue, the ALJ is entitled to accept any part of an expert\u2019s testimony or reject it completely.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Accordingly, since the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by'substantial evidence in the record and is in accordance with the law, the decision of the Benefits Review Board is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b875-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
