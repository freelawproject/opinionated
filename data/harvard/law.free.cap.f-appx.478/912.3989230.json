Sentences are reviewed first for procedural error and then for substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-21\">Given that Sanchez pleaded guilty to burglary of a habitation in Texas, he fails to show that the district court plainly erred procedurally when, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), it computed his base offense level based on his having a prior conviction for a crime of violence. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584, 585-86 (5th Cir.2008). Sanchez\u2019s assertion that the district court articulated insufficient reasons for the variance from the guidelines range of imprisonment also fails. Although Sanchez makes this assertion in arguing that his sentence was substantively unreasonable, it goes to the procedural reasonableness of the sentence. See <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51. Further, Sanchez\u2019s objection <em>in </em>the district court to the \u201creasonableness of the sentence\u201d was insufficient to preserve this argument for appellate review, and this court reviews it for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s oral and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>written pronouncements adequately explained its reasons for its sentence. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Sanchez cannot show plain error regarding the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Sanchez\u2019s argument that his sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) is unavailing. Although at sentencing, Sanchez argued against a variance, he did not argue, as he does on appeal, that his sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or that his guidelines range of imprisonment accounted for his criminal history. Moreover, as noted above, after the district court imposed its sentence, Sanchez objected only to its \u201creasonableness.\u201d Thus, the substantive reasonableness of his sentence is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 506 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). Given that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance, <em>see Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, and that the extent of the variance from the guidelines range was not unreasonable, <em>see United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492 (5th Cir.2005), Sanchez fails to show plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b938-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
