Kendrick, </em>No. 2:03-CR-00070-LDD-2 (E.D.Pa. May 20, 2004). He appeals the denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition attacking his sentence on the ground that it was based on two un-counseled juvenile convictions that did not carry prison sentences. He also raises for the first time a claim that the Eastern District of Pennsylvania lacked jurisdiction to sentence him above the properly-calculated guidelines range. Joseph has not filed a motion challenging his conviction or sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-20\">Joseph may challenge his sentence under \u00a7 2241 only if he establishes that \u201cthe remedy [under \u00a7 2255] is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). Joseph does not rely upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision that establishes that he is actually innocent. <em>See Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830-31. Instead, he claims that he does not need to satisfy the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) because he has a right to a meaningful opportunity to show that he is imprisoned due to an erroneous application of the law and that his detention violates the Constitution. Such an argument fails under the clear language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u00a7 2255(e) and our precedent. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(e); <em>Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The judgment of the district court dismissing the petition for want of jurisdiction is AFFIRMED. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b200-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-21\">. The caption erroneously identifies Latch-man Joseph as Joseph Latchman.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
