On appeal, Jones argues that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) did not properly assess his residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">\u201cWe review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Cannon v. Bowen, </em>858 F.2d 1541, 1544 (11th Cir.1988) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Like the district court, \u201c[w]e may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 n. 8 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">Under the Social Security Act, a person is disabled if he is unable \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). The Commissioner uses a familiar, five-step process to determine whether a claimant meets this definition. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). First, the Commissioner considers the work activity of the claimant. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i). If the claimant is performing substantial gainful activity, then he is not disabled. <em>Id. </em>If he is not performing such activity, then the Commissioner moves to the second step, where he considers the medical severity of the claimant\u2019s alleged impairments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(h). If the claimant does not have an impairment, or a combination of impairments, that is severe, then the claimant is not disabled. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">At the third step, the Commissioner determines whether the claimant\u2019s impairment or combination of impairments meets or equals a listed impairment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii). If so, then the claimant is considered disabled. <em>Id. </em>If not, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Commissioner proceeds to the fourth step of the process, which entails an assessment of the claimant\u2019s RFC. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv). The question is whether the claimant\u2019s RFC renders him capable of performing \u201cpast relevant work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If so, then the claimant is not disabled. <em>Id. </em>If not, the Commissioner goes to the last step of the evaluation process, which focuses on whether the claimant \u201ccan make an adjustment to other work,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v) \u2014 that is, whether the claimant can perform \u201cany other work that exists in the national economy,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1545(a)(5)(ii). If so, then the claimant is not disabled. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">On appeal, Jones argues that the ALJ erred at the fourth step of the evaluation process \u2014 the assessment of his RFC. The ALJ found that Jones \u201cis capable of performing and carrying out simple and repetitive instructions and tasks on a sustained basis.\u201d According to Jones, this finding is \u201cinsufficient\u201d as a matter of law because \u201cthe ability to do simple [and] repetitive things on a sustained basis does not make a person capable of competitive employment.\u201d This argument is not persuasive, however. Indeed, at the fourth step of the process, the claimant\u2019s RFC is judged in relation to the work that the claimant has done in the past, and not to an abstract notion of \u201ccompetitive employment.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv). Here, Jones has not argued that his past work as a construction laborer required more than the capacity to \u201cperform simple and repetitive tasks on a sustained basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Jones also attempts to suggest that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s factual finding that his RFC allows him to do so. He emphasizes that, on the RFC assessment forms, two of the doctors who evaluated him \u2014 Dr. Michael Zelenka and Dr. Val Bee \u2014 checked the box \u201cModerately Limited\u201d with regard to his \u201cability to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms and to perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods.\u201d He notes that the third doctor who evaluated him, Dr. Louis Legum, also indicated that there was a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation as to his ability in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">This argument is also unavailing because it does not consider <em>\u201call </em>of the relevant medical and other evidence\u201d that was before the ALJ. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(3) (emphasis added). The Social Security Administration\u2019s Programs Operations Manual System (POMS) clarifies that the boxes checked by Dr. Zelenka and Dr. Bee are only part of a worksheet that \u201cdoes not constitute the [doctors\u2019 actual] RFC assessment.\u201d POMS DI \u00a7 24510.060(B)(2). Checking the box \u201cModerately Limited\u201d means only that the claimant\u2019s capacity is impaired; it does not indicate the degree and extent of the limitation. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 24510.063(B)(2). After checking the boxes as an \u201caid,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 24510.060(B)(2), a doctor is then required to detail his actual RFC assessment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 24510.060(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Consistent with these directives, both Dr. Zelenka and Dr. Bee, after checking the various boxes, elaborated on their opinions regarding Jones\u2019s ability to concentrate. Dr. Zelenka explained that Jones has \u201coccasional\u201d problems with his attention span, but that he otherwise \u201cretains adequate mental ability to carry out simple instructions] and to relate adequately to others in a routine work setting.\u201d Similarly, Dr. Bee stated that Jones \u201cmay\u201d have \u201coccasional lapses in concentration and efficiency,\u201d but that he otherwise \u201cappears mentally capable of well structured task activity.\u201d These opinions tend to support the ALJ\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Meanwhile, the ALJ gave \u201clittle weight\u201d to Dr. Legum\u2019s assessment that there is a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation to Jones\u2019s ability to concentrate. The ALJ noted that Dr. Le-gum made that determination almost two years after he first evaluated Jones. The ALJ also found Dr. Legum\u2019s assessment to be questionable in part because, earlier, Dr. Legum had found that Jones \u201ctended to amplify his symptoms.\u201d <em>Cf. Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240-41 (holding that a doctor\u2019s opinion can be discounted if it is inconsistent with his own notes). Finally, the ALJ had the opportunity to observe Jones\u2019s demeanor at the hearing, and he did not detect \u201cany evidence of a memory or concentration problem.\u201d <em>Cf. Macia v. Bowen, </em>829 F.2d 1009, 1011 (11th Cir.1987) (holding that an ALJ may consider the demeanor of an applicant during a hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">At this juncture, it bears repeating that \u201c[w]e may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240 n. 8 (quotation marks omitted). Rather, the question that we must answer is whether there is \u201cmore than a scintilla\u201d of evidence such that \u201ca reasonable person would accept [it] as adequate to support [the ALJ\u2019s] conclusion.\u201d <em>Cannon, </em>858 F.2d at 1544. Because the answer is yes, the Commissioner\u2019s decision must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
