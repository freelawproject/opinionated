For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-27\">Miller filed a complaint in the district court, alleging that the defendants, Bartow County, Georgia, and Bartow County Sheriff, Clarke Millsap, violated his constitutional and state rights by requesting Florida authorities to arrest him and extradite him to Georgia on an unfounded charge of aggravated stalking. Miller emphasized that the defendants failed to comply with applicable state and federal statutes in requesting his extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-28\">The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Miller\u2019s complaint as frivolous under 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. The court found that his complaint failed to present a viable \u00a7 1983 claim against either Bartow County or Millsap because the defendants were not \u201cpolicymakers\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983 liability, and Miller\u2019s eonclusory allegations that he was injured by Bartow County\u2019s custom or policy failed to satisfy the pleading standards set out by the Supreme Court. As to Miller\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against Millsap in his individual capacity, the complaint did not allege that Millsap personally participated in the events giving rise to the instant lawsuit and contained only eonclusory allegations regarding Mill-sap\u2019s liability as a supervisor. The court further found that Miller\u2019s state law claims against Bartow County and Millsap (in his official capacity) were barred by Georgia\u2019s sovereign immunity. Moreover, \u201cofficial immunity\u201d barred Miller\u2019s state claim against Millsap in his personal capacity, as Millsap\u2019s alleged actions were discretionary, rather than ministerial, and Miller did not allege that Millsap acted with ill will or actual malice. Finding Miller\u2019s complaint to be frivolous, the district court dismissed it without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003). A lawsuit is frivolous if it is \u201cwithout arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Napier v. Preslicka, </em>314 F.3d 528, 531 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In his brief to this Court, Miller does not challenge any of the district court\u2019s actual findings as to why his complaint was frivolous. Therefore, he has abandoned all arguments in this regard. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that, although this Court construes <em>pro se </em>briefs liberally, \u201cissues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned\u201d). Miller\u2019s only claim on appeal is that the district court erroneously failed to address the defendants\u2019 alleged violation of various extradition laws, and he also notes that the court failed to address the application of Florida\u2019s long-arm statute. These contentions are meritless. The district court found Miller\u2019s complaint to be frivolous essentially because neither Bartow County nor Millsap was a viable defendant and because Miller\u2019s eonclusory allegations did not sufficiently establish liability. The questions of whether the defendants violated any extradition laws or whether Florida\u2019s long-arm statute applied were irrelevant to the district court\u2019s findings. Because the court had no reason to address these matters, it could not have abused its discretion by failing to do so. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
