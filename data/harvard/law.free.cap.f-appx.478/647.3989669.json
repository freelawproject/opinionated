Nelson appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim against the United States brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). Nelson alleged medical malpractice in connection with a surgical procedure that he had undergone at the St. Louis Veterans Association Medical Center (\u201cVAMC\u201d) in Missouri. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss based on Nelson\u2019s failure to identify an expert witness and failure to provide an affidavit in support of his claims, both of which were required by applicable Missouri law. The court also found that any claims of assault and battery that Nelson may have asserted were outside the ambit of the FTCA, and therefore the court lacked jurisdiction over those claims. On appeal, Nelson argues that Missouri law should not have been applied to his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, as well as the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutory provisions. <em>Ochran v. United States, </em>117 F.3d 495, 499 (11th Cir.1997). The FTCA provides a limited waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States for tort claims. <em>Dalrymple v. United States, </em>460 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir.2006). It authorizes \u201cprivate tort actions against the United States \u2018under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Olson, </em>546 U.S. 43, 44, 126 S.Ct. 510, 163 L.Ed.2d 306 (2005) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1)). The \u201claw of the place\u201d does not mean federal law; the FTCA \u201cwas not intended as a mechanism for enforcing federal statutory duties.\u201d <em>Ochran v. United States, </em>273 F.3d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir.2001). Rather, the FTCA \u201cwas designed to provide redress for ordinary torts recognized by state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Therefore, \u201cunless the facts support liability under state law, the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to decide an FTCA claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-19\">Nelson\u2019s medical malpractice claims arose in Missouri, where VAMC is located. A <em>prima facie </em>case of medical malpractice in Missouri \u201cconsists of three general elements: (1) an act or omission of the defendant failed to meet the requisite medical standard of care; (2) the act or omission was performed negligently; and (3) the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>or omission caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d <em>Edgerton v. Morrison, </em>280 S.W.3d 62, 68 (Mo.2009) <em>(en banc). </em>Except in limited circumstances not present here, \u201callegations of negligence in a medical malpractice action are such that expert testimony is required to prove the acceptable standard of professional care; and without expert opinion, the issue of breach of that standard of care cannot be made.\u201d <em>Morrison v. St. Luke\u2019s Health Corp. </em>929 S.W.2d 898, 905 (Mo.Ct.App.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Nelson never disclosed a medical expert. Therefore, Nelson did not support his medical malpractice claim with evidence of the applicable medical standard of care, and his claim was due to be dismissed on this basis. Additionally, Nelson had until April 16, 2010 with the Court\u2019s permission to file an affidavit of a healthcare provider to support his claim, as required by Mo. Ann. Stat. \u00a7 538.225. Nelson never provided the required affidavit; thus, dismissal without prejudice was permissible on this basis as well. <em>See </em>Mo. Ann. Stat. \u00a7 538.225(6). Finally, to the extent that Nelson\u2019s complaint may be read to characterize the surgical procedure as actionable assault and battery, such a claim would not be cognizable under the FTCA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
