Hinckley, Eric F. Whynot, and Taylor &amp; Carls, P.A. (the \u201cTaylor Firm Defendants\u201d) to recover delinquent homeowner association maintenance assessments from David Acosta. The Taylor Firm Defendants first mailed Acosta a letter demanding payment of the assessments, interest, and other charges. But, the debt remained unpaid so the Taylor Firm Defendants sued Acosta on behalf of Alaqua in Florida state court to foreclose a lien on Acosta\u2019s property or recover a money judgment (the \u201cState Action\u201d). Alaqua later replaced the Taylor Firm Defendants with James A. Gustino and his law firm (the \u201cGustino Defendants\u201d) to litigate the State Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-22\">While the State Action was pending against him, Acosta filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. His amended complaint alleges that the Taylor Firm Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>dants and Gustino Defendants violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.204(1). The amended complaint asserts additional claims against the Gustino Defendants for violating the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e-1692g, and the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 559.72(9). The Taylor Firm Defendants responded to the amended complaint by filing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the counts of the amended complaint asserted against them. In the alternative, the motion asked the court to stay the action pursuant to the <em>Colorado River </em>abstention doctrine pending the outcome of the State Action. The Gustino Defendants also filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, which adopted the arguments in the Taylor Firm Defendants\u2019 motion and asserted independent arguments for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The district court granted the Taylor Firm Defendants\u2019 motion insofar as it sought dismissal pursuant to the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine and dismissed the case without prejudice. The court denied all other pending motions as moot. Acosta appeals, challenging this order. He presents only one issue that warrants our attention. We must decide whether the federal and state proceedings are parallel for purposes of the <em>Colorado River </em>abstention doctrine. Because we conclude they are not, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\u201cWe review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s dismissal on <em>Colorado River </em>abstention grounds.\u201d <em>TranSouth Fin. Corp. v. Bell, </em>149 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla. v. First State Ins. Co., </em>891 F.2d 882, 884 (11th Cir.1990)). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it misapplies the law....\u201d <em>Ambrosia Coal &amp; Constr. Co. v. Pages Morales, </em>368 F.3d 1320, 1332 (11th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, </em>238 F.3d 1300, 1308 (11th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">First, we emphasize \u201cthe virtually unflagging obligation of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them.\u201d <em>Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 817, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 1246, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976) (citations omitted). \u201cThe doctrine of abstention ... is an extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a District Court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.\u201d <em>Ambrosia Coal &amp; Constr. Co., </em>368 F.3d at 1331 (quoting <em>Colorado River, </em>424 U.S. at 813, 96 S.Ct. at 1244). Furthermore, <em>\u201cColorado River </em>abstention is permissible in fewer circumstances than are the other abstention doctrines....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">A threshold requirement for application of the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine is that the federal and state cases be sufficiently parallel. We ask whether the cases \u201cinvolve substantially the same parties and substantially the same issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. If the federal and state proceedings are not parallel, then the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine does not apply. <em>See TruServ Corp. v. Flegles, Inc., </em>419 F.3d 584, 592 (7th Cir.2005) (citing <em>AAR Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Nimelias Enters. S.A., </em>250 F.3d 510, 518 (7th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">Acosta argues that the district court erred by applying the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine because the State Action and his federal suit are not parallel. He asserts that the two actions involve different parties because the federal action is against Alaqua\u2019s attorneys, not Alaqua. And, he maintains that the two cases present different legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">The district court decided that although the parties are not identical in the State Action and this one, they are substantially similar. The court acknowledged that Ala-qua is not a party to the federal action and Alaqua\u2019s attorneys are not party to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>State Action. Nonetheless, it found the parties in the two actions are substantially similar because the defendants in the federal action acted as agents for Alaqua in the state action. When considering the similarity of issues between the cases, the court said that the state court would decide whether Acosta\u2019s alleged debt to Ala-qua could be lawfully collected. The district court thought it would decide whether the alleged inability to collect the debt \u201crendered the Defendants\u2019 collection efforts on behalf of Alaqua unlawful.\u201d (R.l-46 at 5.) According to the court, the enforceability of the debt underlies the claims in both actions. Like the district court, the defendants admit that the federal and state cases contain different claims, but they believe that the overarching issues are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">There is no clear test for deciding whether two cases contain substantially similar parties and issues. But, as we noted at the outset, the balance in these situations begins tilted heavily in favor of the exercise of the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Thus, if there is any substantial doubt about whether two cases are parallel the court should not abstain. <em>See Huon v. Johnson &amp; Bell, Ltd., </em>657 F.3d 641, 646 (7th Cir.2011) (citing <em>AAR Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>250 F.3d at 520). Furthermore, \u201cthe decision to invoke <em>Colorado River </em>necessarily contemplates that the federal court will have nothing further to do in resolving any substantive part of the case.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 28, 103 S.Ct. 927, 943, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Here, the district court\u2019s decision depends on its conclusion that if the State Action were decided against Acosta, he would have no viable claims in federal court. However, the key to the federal case is not only whether the debt was enforceable but also whether the Gustino Defendants\u2019 conduct when collecting that debt complied with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. This raises some doubt about whether resolution of the State Action would decide this case. Additionally, neither the district court nor the defendants have cited any cases to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that the parties are substantially similar when \u201cthe defendants [in the federal case] acted as agents for the plaintiff in the state case regarding all of the activities of which [the federal plaintiff] complains.\u201d (R.l-46 at 4.) This rule of substantial similarity based on agency could capture a variety of different entities and individuals and label them as \u201csubstantially similar parties.\u201d We question whether the notion of substantial similarity extends this broadly, and we are especially hesitant to understand the phrase this way in the context of a narrow abstention doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Given our doubt about whether the state and federal proceedings are parallel, we err on the side in favor of the exercise of the court\u2019s jurisdiction and reverse the district court\u2019s order dismissing the action. We need not reach the other issues presented by the parties to this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\">. As an independent basis for abstention, the defendants ask the court to apply the Brill-hart/Wilton Abstention doctrine. The defendants did not raise this theory in the district court and we decline to consider it. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
