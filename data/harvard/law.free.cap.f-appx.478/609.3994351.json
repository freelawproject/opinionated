Bernal contends there was no evidence he knew the money he was trafficking was from drugs, therefore making a sentencing enhancement associated with such knowledge inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-23\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Demarest, </em>570 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). Section 2Sl.l(b)(l) of the U.S.S.G. provides for a 6-level enhancement if \u201cthe defendant knew or believed that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of, or were intended to promote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>... an offense involving the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a controlled substance_\u201d We have upheld the application of the \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(l) enhancement in a case where a yacht broker arranged for the sale of a yacht, in an all-cash transaction, to buyers who claimed to be associated with drugs and were likely to use the yacht to smuggle drugs. <em>Demarest, </em>570 F.3d at 1243. In addition, we have held a reasonable jury can infer that a defendant would not be entrusted with a bag containing millions of dollars worth of drugs without knowing what the bag contained. <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>250 F.3d 1354, 1366 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Quilca-Carpio, </em>118 F.3d 719, 722 (11th Cir.1997) (stating a \u201c \u2018prudent smuggler\u2019 is not likely to entrust such valuable cargo to an innocent person without that person\u2019s knowledge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The district court did not clearly err by finding there were sufficient facts to impose the enhancement under \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(l). Bernal received a large sum of money, over $1 million, unlikely to be entrusted to an unknowing courier, under secretive circumstances. He was instructed to deliver the money to Laredo, Texas, a town on the border of Mexico. He suggested he might be killed over the loss of the money after its seizure, and asked for a bundle of money \u201cto run on.\u201d He also testified he knew the money was from some form of illegal activity, and the circumstances of this case favored narcotics over other possible explanations.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Bernal\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
