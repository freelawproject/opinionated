On appeal, Walden argues that: (1) there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions; (2) the district court erred when it instructed the jurors that \u201ceveryone is presumed to know the law\u201d and that \u201cignorance of the law is not a defense\u201d; and (3) his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment were violated when he was convicted for receiving and possessing child pornography. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a jury\u2019s verdict in a criminal trial, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1284 (11th Cir.2009). We review the legal correctness of a jury instruction <em>de novo, </em>but defer to the district court on questions of phrasing absent an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir.2000). We generally review a double jeopardy challenge <em>de novo, </em>but if the defendant did not raise a double jeopardy argument before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>532 F.3d 1125, 1126 (11th Cir.2008). Plain error exists where there is (1) an \u201cerror\u201d; (2) \u201cthat is plain\u201d; (3) \u201cthat affects substantial rights\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation and brackets omitted). An error is not \u201cplain\u201d if it is not \u201cclear under current law,\u201d meaning that there is no case in our Circuit or the Supreme Court resolving the specific issue raised. <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">First, we are unpersuaded by Walden\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial, we are required to resolve any conflicts in the evidence in favor of the government and accept all reasonable inferences that tend to support the government\u2019s case. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>390 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2004). When the government\u2019s case is based on circumstantial evidence, reasonable inferences, not mere speculation, must support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>250 F.3d 1354, 1365 (11th Cir.2001). A criminal conviction must be upheld unless the jury could not have found the defendant guilty under any reasonable construction of the evidence. <em>United States v. Frank, </em>599 F.3d 1221, 1233 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 186, 178 L.Ed.2d 112 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Additionally, \u201c[t]he credibility of a witness is in the province of the factfinder and [we] will not ordinarily review the factfinder\u2019s determination of credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). Indeed, we will accept a factfinder\u2019s credibility determination \u201cunless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Chirinos, </em>112 F.3d 1089, 1102 (11th Cir.1997) (quotations omitted). It is the duty of the trier of fact to \u201cresolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u201d and we, as the reviewing court, will only inquire as to whether \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">\u201c[W]hen a defendant takes the stand in a criminal case and exposes his demeanor to the jury, the jury may make adverse determinations about his credibility and reject his explanation as a complete fabrication.\u201d <em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>53 F.3d 1216, 1225 (11th Cir.1995). If the jury does not believe the defendant\u2019s version of events, the statements made by the defendant may be considered by the jury as substantive evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, at least where some corroborative evidence exists for the charged offense. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314-15 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cThis rule applies with special force where the elements to be proved for a conviction include highly subjective elements: for example, the defendant\u2019s intent or knowledge.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, unless the text of a statute states differently, the term \u201cknowingly\u201d only requires \u201cproof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.\u201d <em>Bryan v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 193, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(A), it is unlawful for any person knowingly to receive or distribute \u201cany child pornography that has been mailed, or using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce shipped or transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer.\u201d \u201cA person \u2018knowingly receives\u2019 child pornography ... when he intentionally views, acquires, or accepts child pornography on a computer from an outside source.\u201d <em>United States v. Pruitt, </em>638 F.3d 763, 766 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 113, 181 L.Ed.2d 38 (2011). \u201cKnowingly receiving\u201d child pornography images includes intentionally viewing images sent to a defendant\u2019s computer, whether or not the viewer tries to save, edit, or otherwise exert more control over the images. However, inadvertent receipt of child pornography does not violate the statute. <em>Id. </em>When a court addresses \u201cknowing receipt,\u201d it is mainly an issue of fact, not law. <em>Id. </em>at 766-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Under \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), it is unlawful when a person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">knowingly possesses, or knowingly accesses with intent to view, any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer disk, or any other material that contains an image of child pornography that has been mailed, or shipped or transported using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer, or that was produced using materials that have been mailed, or shipped or transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In this appeal, Walden only challenges whether he knowingly received and knowingly possessed such images, but based on the direct and circumstantial evidence presented at trial, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that he knowingly did both. To begin, an FBI forensic expert discovered over 5,000 saved and deleted suspected child pornography images on four computers that Walden admitted he owned and used. Walden testified that he was \u201cpretty much\u201d the sole user of the computers that were discovered in a home where he alone resided. In addition, Walden admitted to FBI Special Agent Margaret Faulkner that his screen name and email address was \u201cjbgood@alaweb.com,\u201d and Special Agent Joseph Ullmann testified that this screen name was associated with three websites that were part of the FBI Site-Key investigation of websites with images of children ranging from age 7 to 17 having sexual intercourse with adults and posed in various positions. Special Agent Faulkner also testified that during the \u201ctrap and trace\u201d warrant, she accessed websites and IP addresses associated with Walden\u2019s ISP, and the majority of the websites were pornographic, including child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Contrary to Walden\u2019s argument, the evidence did not show that the child pornography images were inadvertently placed on Walden\u2019s computers. The FBI expert testified that Walden\u2019s internet history showed that he visited various websites containing the terms \u201clolita\u201d and \u201cpreteen,\u201d which were common search terms used by people looking for child pornography. The expert also discovered various internet search terms in Walden\u2019s unallocated space, including \u201cpreteen lolita,\u201d \u201cunderage vagina,\u201d and \u201cprepubeseent vagina.\u201d Limewire and other peer-to-peer software on Walden\u2019s computer contained the search term, \u201cpedo,\u201d short for pedophile, and a movie file, titled \u201c12 yr old Puebla Mexicana\u201d was previewed on Walden\u2019s computer. Although both the FBI and Walden\u2019s forensic experts presented evidence that hackers, viruses, redirec-tions, and pop-ups could inadvertently place child pornographic images on someone\u2019s computer, the FBI expert testified that (1) there was no evidence that viruses or hackers caused the child pornography images on Walden\u2019s computers, (2) a redirection could not put a video file on a computer, and (3) the pictures in Walden\u2019s \u201cMy Pictures\u201d folder of his computer, which contained child pornography images, had to be intentionally saved. Walden\u2019s expert only examined Walden\u2019s computer for two specific days, and she could not account for the other thousands of child pornography images on his computer. The FBI expert further testified that the evidence on Walden\u2019s computers showed an active and consistent search for child pornography coupled with numerous child pornography images, which could serve as circumstantial evidence that Walden knowingly received child pornography. <em>See Pruitt, </em>638 F.3d at 766 (concluding that evidence that a person \u201csought out\u201d child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>pornography on the Internet and has a computer with child pornography images can count as circumstantial evidence that a person knowingly received child pornography).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The evidence also showed that four images of naked prepubescent girls were discovered in Walden\u2019s bathroom during the execution of a search warrant. Walden admitted to downloading those pictures from a Russian website, but testified that he was \u201cnot 100 percent sure\u201d how old the people in the picture were. However, Special Agent Faulkner testified that in one of the pictures, the lack of development in the face and genital area and minimal amount of pubic hair could serve as an indication that the people in the picture were children. There were also images on Walden\u2019s digital camera that Walden, his computer expert, and Faulkner all agreed were still images of a paused video containing child pornography. The camera was discovered in Walden\u2019s bedroom and Walden admitted that he owned the camera. Therefore, reasonable inference could support the jury\u2019s verdict that Walden knowingly possessed child pornography-</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Furthermore, Special Agent Faulkner testified that during her interview of Walden, Walden admitted to purchasing and downloading child pornography images in the past. He also said that he believed that it was only illegal to sell child pornography, not to view it. Walden\u2019s alleged confusion concerning the legality of viewing versus selling child pornography is not part of the knowledge inquiry. <em>See Bryan, </em>524 U.S. at 193, 118 S.Ct. 1939 (holding that the \u201cknowingly\u201d element did not require proof that a defendant knew his possession of an unregistered machine gun was unlawful).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In addition, where, as here, the defendant takes the stand in a criminal case and exposes his demeanor to the jury, the jury may make adverse determinations about his credibility and reject his explanations as a complete fabrication. <em>Vazquez, </em>53 F.3d at 1225. Because the jury did not believe Walden\u2019s version of the events, as evinced by the guilty verdict in this case, Walden\u2019s statements could have been considered by the jury as substantive evidence of his guilt and proof of the requisite knowledge element. <em>Brown, </em>53 F.3d at 315. Thus, based on all the above evidence, a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence showed that Walden was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of knowingly receiving and possessing child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Next, we find no merit to Walden\u2019s argument that the district court erred when it instructed the jurors that \u201ceveryone is presumed to know the law\u201d and that \u201cignorance of the law is not a defense,\u201d and when it failed to use our pattern jury instruction on the definition of \u201cknowingly.\u201d Generally, district courts are given</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqQ\">broad discretion in formulating jury instructions provided that the charge as a whole accurately reflects the law and the facts, and we will not reverse a conviction on the basis of a jury charge unless the issues of law were presented inaccurately, or the charge improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-10\"><em>Prather, </em>205 F.3d at 1270 (quotations omitted). \u201cWhen the jury instructions, taken together, accurately express the law applicable to the case without confusing or prejudicing the jury, there is no reason for reversal even though isolated clauses may, in fact, be confusing, technically imperfect, or otherwise subject to criticism.\u201d <em>United States v. Beasley, </em>72 F.3d 1518, 1525 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">We find no error or abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s jury instructions in this case. For starters, the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>struction that \u201ceveryone is presumed to know the law, and ignorance of the law is not a defense to the commission of a crime\u201d is a correct statement of law. <em>See Cheek v. United States, </em>498 U.S. 192, 199, 111 S.Ct. 604, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991) (noting that \u201c[t]he general rule that ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution is deeply rooted in the American legal system\u201d). Furthermore, the jury instructions included the elements of Walden\u2019s criminal offenses and defined key terms, including the term \u201cknowingly.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ignorance-of-the-law instruction, taken together with the rest of the instructions, therefore did not improperly guide the jury or substantially violate Walden\u2019s due process rights. <em>Prather, </em>205 F.3d at 1270.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Finally, we reject Walden\u2019s claim that his convictions for receiving child pornography and possessing child pornography violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because possession of child pornography is a lesser included offense of receiving child pornography. The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause guarantees that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. This guarantee prohibits, among other things, multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>United States v. Bobb, </em>577 F.3d 1366, 1371 (11th Cir.2009). \u201c[Wjhere the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>(1982). Thus, \u201cwhere two statutory provisions proscribe the same offense and there is no clear indication that the legislature intended multiple punishments for the offense, the Double Jeopardy Clause\u2019s prohibition against multiple punishments protects a defendant from being convicted under both provisions.\u201d <em>Bobb, </em>577 F.3d at 1371-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In addressing whether convictions for both receiving child pornography, in violation of \u00a7 2252(a)(2)(B), and possessing child pornography, in violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), constituted a Double Jeopardy Clause violation, we concluded that \u201cpossession is a lesser included offense of receipt\u201d because, \u201cby proving that a person knowingly receives child pornography, the Government necessarily proves that the person knowingly possesses child pornography.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1373, 1375 (quotations omitted). Moreover, we determined no \u201cclear indication of legislative intent to impose multiplicitous punishment for receipt and possession of child pornography.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1374 (quotations and brackets omitted). However, in <em>Bobb, </em>we affirmed each of the defendant\u2019s convictions because they were \u201ctwo distinct offenses, occurring on two different dates, and proscribed by two different statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1375. First, we noted that the defendant\u2019s Count 1 receipt offense was charged as occurring on November 12, 2004, while his Count 2 possession offense was charged as occurring on August 2005, demonstrating that the government charged him with offenses occurring at different times. We further noted that the evidence at trial showed that he downloaded images on November 12, 2004, and that he also was found to have possessed 6,000 unlawful images in August 2005, including others beyond those obtained in November, indicating that the government provided sufficient evidence to convict him of the separate offenses. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In this case, because Walden did not raise a double jeopardy argument in district court, we review his argument for plain error, and find none. Unlike in <em>Bobb, </em>Walden\u2019s indictment for receipt and possession of child pornography did not charge separate offenses on two distinctly different dates, but the date of the charges in the indictment \u2014 which provided that Walden with receiving child pornography from May 2, 2001, through November 9, 2006, and possessing child pornography on November 9, 2006 \u2014 overlap on November 9, 2006. Research has not revealed controlling law addressing this specific issue and under plain error review, this alone shows that any error is not plain. <em>Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1322.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-5\">. In addition, Walden's argument that the district court\u2019s jury instruction on \"knowingly\u201d was improper because it was not this Court\u2019s pattern jury instruction is without merit. The Eleventh Circuit pattern jury instruction for \"knowingly\u201d was the same definition that the district court provided for \"knowingly\u201d in the jury instructions. Pattern Crim. Jury Inst. 11th Cir. BI 9.2 (2010) (defining \"knowingly\u201d as \"an act [that] was done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of a mistake or by accident\u201d). But in any event, district courts are not required to use this Court\u2019s pattern jury instructions, \"for they are not precedent and cannot solely foreclose the construction of the necessary elements of a crime as stated in the statute.\u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Dean, </em>487 F.3d 840, 852 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted) (holding that district court did not err by using pattern jury instructions in a 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201 case).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b602-6\">. Moreover, <em>United States v. Davis, </em>583 F.2d 190 (5th Cir.1978), is not controlling here. In <em>Davis, </em>the former Fifth Circuit held that, when specific intent is the requisite intent for a conviction, the district court \"may not instruct that ignorance of the law is no excuse, because ignorance of the law goes to the heart of the defendant's denial of specific intent.\" <em>Id. </em>at 194. There, the Court was addressing the defendant's conspiracy conviction for exporting a weapon on the Munitions List under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1934(c), which provided that \"any person who willfully violates any provision of this section or rule or regulation issued under this section ... shall upon conviction be fined not more than $25,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\" <em>Id. </em>at 192-93 (emphasis added). The Court stated that \u201cspecific intent\u201d was required under this statute, while other statutes that did not contain a \"willfulness\u201d element may not require specific intent. <em>Id. </em>at 193 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Here, Walden\u2019s conviction required that he knowingly receive and knowingly possess child pornography. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2), (a)(5)(B). Based on this language, the offenses lack the requirement of a \"willful\u201d violation of the law and lack the requirement of specific intent. <em>See United States v. Duran, </em>596 F.3d 1283, 1292 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that since the prohibition in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 951 was \"clear on its face\u201d and required the defendants to act \u201cknowingly,\u201d then only the <em>mens rea </em>of general intent was required and \u201cignorance of the law [was] no defense to a criminal prosecution\"). Because specific intent is not necessary under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A, <em>Davis </em>does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b603-6\">. However, even under a preserved error standard of review, Walden's convictions for receiving child pornography and possessing child pornography were not in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause because Counts 1 and 2 of his indictment charged different acts that were supported by different evidence. Because Walden\u2019s violation of two distinct statutory provisions was supported by separate evidence, and they were not a part of the \"same act or transaction\u201d under the <em>Block-burger </em>test, and therefore did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
