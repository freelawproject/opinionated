He contends that the above-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the statutory sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Hernandez-Moreno asserts, inter alia, that the sentence does not support the deterrence rationale articulated by the district court, is excessive in light of the non-violent nature of his conduct, and will unnecessarily cost the Government additional money.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-21\">Hernandez-Moreno asserts that revocation sentences should be reviewed for \u201creasonableness.\u201d We typically review revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, 634 F.3d </em>841, 843 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011). However, because Hernandez-Moreno raised only a general objection in the district court to the reasonableness of his sentence, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 506 (5th Cir.2009). Thus, Hernandez-Moreno must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). We have discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-24\">Hernandez-Moreno\u2019s sentence, while in excess of the range indicated by the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 non-binding policy statements, was within the statutory maximum term of imprisonment that the district court could have imposed. <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3559(a)(3), 3583(e)(3). The district court considered the nature and circumstances of the new illegal reentry offense, Hernandez-Moreno\u2019s history and characteristics, including his multiple previous illegal reentries, and the need to deter him from future illegal conduct. The district court reasoned that a 24-month sentence was proper under the circumstances. Accordingly, the record supports that the district court based Hernandez-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Moreno\u2019s sentence on an individualized assessment of the facts and permissible sentencing factors. <em>See Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 844; <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">While Hernandez-Moreno disagrees with the district court\u2019s assessment of a proper sentence, his disagreement does not demonstrate that the district court committed error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51-52; <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 265 (5th Cir.2009) (upholding 36-month sentence, where the guidelines range was 4 to 10 months of imprisonment). He essentially seeks to have us reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which we will not do. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51. Thus, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
