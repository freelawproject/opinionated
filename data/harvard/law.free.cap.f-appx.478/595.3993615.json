The Board agreed with the finding of the immigration judge that Deryabina abandoned her application for asylum by failing to file her fingerprint notice. We deny Deryabina\u2019s petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">Immigration judges may dismiss applications for relief from removal if applicants fail to comply with requirements to submit biometrical information. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.47(c), 1208.10. Under Section 1003.47(c), the \u201c[fjailure to file necessary documentation and comply with the requirements to provide biometrics ... in conformity with the applicable regulations, the instructions to the applications, the biometrics notice, and instructions provided by [the Department of Homeland Security], within the time allowed ... constitutes abandonment of the application.\u201d Section 1003.47(c) directs that \u201cthe immigration judge may enter an appropriate order dismissing the application,\u201d but the provision permits the judge to reinstate the application if \u201cthe applicant demonstrates that [the] failure [to file the notice] was the result of good cause.\u201d <em>Id.; see id. </em>\u00a7 1208.10 (\u201cFailure to comply with pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>cessing requirements for biometrics ... within the time allowed will result in dismissal of the application, unless the applicant demonstrates that such failure was the result of good cause.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 1208.14(a) (\u201cIn no case shall an immigration judge grant asylum without compliance with the requirements of [section] 1003.47 concerning identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or examinations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Substantial evidence supports the decision of the Board that Deryabina abandoned her application for asylum. During the initial removal hearing, the immigration judge instructed Deryabina to \u201cget your fingerprints done for this application by the date on [the] notice\u201d provided by the Department. The immigration judge stressed that it was \u201cvery, very important to get the fingerprints done,\u201d and the immigration judge warned Deryabina that, \u201c[i]f you do not get your fingerprints done, the application is abandoned.\u201d Der-yabina failed to file the fingerprint notice and, when she appeared before the immigration judge more than a year later, she argued that she had \u201cno recollection of getting the actual notice.\u201d The immigration judge reviewed the audio recording of the initial removal hearing and found that the Department had provided Deryabina a fingerprint notice. Deryabina did not challenge that finding. The Board was entitled to find that Deryabina had failed to provide good cause to excuse her noncompliance, <em>see Juarez v. Holder, </em>599 F.3d 560, 565 (7th Cir.2010), and to affirm the denial of Deryabina\u2019s related request for a continuance, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (an immigration judge \u201cmay grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Deryabina argues, for the first time on appeal, that the immigration judge was biased against her, but we lack jurisdiction to consider that argument. \u201c[A]bsent a cognizable excuse or exception, \u201cwe lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the [Board].\u2019 \u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The Board also did not abuse its discretion when it later denied Deryabina\u2019s motion to reopen. Deryabina argues that her attorney acted ineffectively by failing to remind her about the fingerprint notice, but counsel\u2019s representation was not \u201c \u2018deficient to the point that it impinged on the fundamental fairness\u2019 \u201d of Deryabina\u2019s removal proceedings. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>643 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir.1999)). The Department provided Deryabina a fingerprint notice, and she knew that she had to file it.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">We DENY Deryabina\u2019s petitions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
