He filed the instant 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights suit raising claims related to the denial of his requests for parole. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed his suit. We conduct a de novo review of this decision. <em>See Xtreme Lashes, LLC v. Xtended Beauty, Inc., </em>576 F.3d 221, 226 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-17\">First, Garcia challenges the district court\u2019s rejection of his retaliation claim. In Garcia\u2019s view, the two defendants who initially voted to grant him parole in 2006 but subsequently voted to deny his request for parole in 2009 must have changed their votes to retaliate against him for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 suit. \u201cTo state a valid claim for retaliation under section 1983, a prisoner must allege (1) a specific constitutional right, (2) the defendant\u2019s intent to retaliate against the prisoner for his or her exercise of that right, (3) a retaliatory adverse act, and (4) causation.\u201d <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir.1999). Garcia has not met this standard because he has produced no direct evidence of retaliatory motivation nor has he shown a time-line of events from which retaliation may realistically be inferred. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995). Rather, his claim is based only on the conclusionary allegation that because his parole was denied <em>after </em>he filed a \u00a7 2254 petition there is necessarily causation. His personal belief that he is a victim of retaliation is insufficient to raise a meritorious retaliation claim. <em>See id.; see also Jones, </em>188 F.3d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-18\">Next, Garcia disputes the propriety of the district court\u2019s rejection of his claim that his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause were infringed when parole laws enacted after his offense and conviction were applied to him. Contrary to Garcia\u2019s assertions, the district court did not err <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>when it concluded that this claim was unavailing under <em>Wallace v. Quarterman, </em>516 F.3d 351 (5th Cir.2008). Likewise unavailing is Garcia\u2019s reliance upon evidence showing that application of the new laws has resulted in harsher sentences for offenders, as he has not established his sentence was increased because of the changes of which he complains. <em>See id. </em>at 353-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b955-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
