We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-14\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Cruz v. Publix Super Mkts., Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1379, 1382 (11th Cir.2005). Summary judgment should be entered when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-15\">The Act grants an eligible employee \u201c12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period ... [bjecause of a serious health condition that makes [him] unable to perform the functions of [his] position,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D), and the Act prohibits employers from interfering with or denying that right to medical leave, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2615(a)(1). To prevail on a claim of interference, the employee must prove that he was entitled to and \u201cavailed himself of a protected right under the [Act]\u201d; that he \u201csuffered an adverse employment decision\u201d; and that \u201cthere [was] a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Wascura v. City of S. Miami, </em>257 F.3d 1238, 1248 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-16\">Ferguson failed to prove that he was entitled to leave under section 2612(a)(1)(D). To verify that Ferguson had a severe medical condition that was incapacitating, Broward Health required Ferguson to submit \u201ca certification issued by [his] health care provider\u201d containing \u201ca statement that [he] [was] unable to perform the functions of [his] position,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2613(b)(4)(B), and \u201ca statement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>medical necessity for the intermittent leave,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2618(b)(6). Ferguson\u2019s doctor reported that Ferguson had diabetes, a disease that qualified as a serious medical condition, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.115(c)(8), but the doctor did not report that Ferguson\u2019s diabetes was incapacitating, <em>see Cruz, </em>428 F.3d at 1385-86. Ferguson\u2019s doctor responded \u201cnot applicable\u201d to questions about whether Ferguson\u2019s condition rendered him \u201cunable to perform any of his[ ] job functions\u201d; left him \u201cincapacitated for ... [an] intermittent period\u201d; \u201ccause[d] episodic flare-ups preventing the performance of his[ ] job functions\u201d; or created a \u201cmedical[] necessity] for [him] to be off from work due to ... flare-ups.\u201d And Ferguson admitted that he \u201cwas able to fully perform the essential functions of his position while at work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Even if we assume that Ferguson had been entitled to leave under the Act, he failed to refute evidence introduced by Broward Health that it fired him for reasons unrelated to his request for leave. \u201cIn an FMLA interference case, courts examine not whether the FMLA leave was the <em>but-for </em>cause of an employee\u2019s discharge or demotion, but rather whether it was the <em>proximate </em>cause,\u201d when assessing an employer\u2019s affirmative defense concerning the lack of causation. <em>Schaaf v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., </em>602 F.3d 1236, 1242 (11th Cir.2010). Broward Health presented evidence that it had fired Ferguson because he had violated rules governing attendance and punctuality and had acted inappropriately with staff and patients. Broward Health presented three consecutive performance evaluations that discussed how Ferguson\u2019s work had declined, three performance improvement plans, one disciplinary report issued for being rude to a patient, and two disciplinary reports issued for refusing to move a patient and for delaying transportation of a patient to take a break. Broward Health also introduced evidence that it had twice granted Ferguson leave under the Act for conditions unrelated to his diabetes after he had submitted completed certification forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Ferguson argues that the district court \u201cplainly erred in determining there was no causal relationship\u201d when his termination notice stated that he was being fired for taking an \u201cunapproved rest break,\u201d but Ferguson\u2019s argument fails for two reasons. First, Ferguson challenged the reason for his termination in a motion for reconsideration, but his argument \u201c \u2018could, and should, have been made before the judgment was issued.\u2019 \u201d <em>Case v. Eslinger, </em>555 F.3d 1317, 1329 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>O\u2019Neal v. Kennamer, </em>958 F.2d 1044, 1047 (11th Cir.1992)). Second, Ferguson\u2019s argument lacks merit in the light of the overwhelming evidence that he was fired for disregarding company rules, not for a request for leave that he submitted one month earlier. \u201c[T]he commencement of leave is not absolute, and if a dismissal would have occurred regardless of the request for FMLA leave, an employee may be dismissed.\u201d <em>Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., </em>602 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Broward Health.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
