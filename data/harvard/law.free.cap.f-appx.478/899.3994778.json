He was sentenced to the guidelines maximum under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 as a career offender. According to Castille, he should have received a two-level downward variance because he used an \u201cairsoft pistol\u201d instead of a firearm. He cites the robbery guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2), which provides for a six-level enhancement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>the use of a firearm and only a four-level enhancement for the use of a \u201cdangerous weapon,\u201d defined as \u201can instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury\u201d or an object that \u201cclosely resembles such an instrument.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(D)).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The district court expressly considered Castille\u2019s argument and determined that the maximum guidelines sentence was appropriate. The court explicitly found that other aspects of the offense were more important than the use of an airsoft gun, including the danger created by the mere perception that the gun was real and the trauma to those in the bank. Castille does not show that the district court erred in weighing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8558(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>633 F.3d 370, 375-76 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 3006, 180 L.Ed.2d 832 (2011). He fails to show that his guidelines sentence did not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, and he fails to overcome the presumption that his guidelines sentence was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b925-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
