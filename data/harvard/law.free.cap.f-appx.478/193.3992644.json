Calhoun first argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor asked a highly prejudicial and racially inflammatory question while cross-examining him and raised the sentiment again during the Government\u2019s closing argument. The question in dispute was, \u2018You\u2019ve got African-Americans, you\u2019ve got Hispanics, you\u2019ve got a bag full of money. Does that tell you \u2014 a light bulb doesn\u2019t go off in your head and say, This is a drug deal?\u201d Calhoun responded, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-18\">Plain error review applies to this issue, as Calhoun did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s question or the prosecutor\u2019s explanation of the question in his closing argument. <em>See United States v. Gracia, </em>522 F.3d 597, 599-600 (5th Cir.2008). To show plain error, the appellant must show a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). In the context of improper prosecutorial remarks, the substantial rights prong \u201csets a high bar,\u201d with the determinative question being \u201cwhether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks cast serious doubt on the correctness of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Morin, </em>627 F.3d 985, 1000 (5th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2126, 179 L.Ed.2d 916 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In answering that question, we consider \u201c(1) the magnitude of the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, (2) the efficacy of any cautionary instruction by the judge, and (3) the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>482 F.3d 781, 785 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If Calhoun meets his burden under the first three prongs of the plain error standard, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Gracia, </em>522 F.3d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Calhoun has not satisfied his burden. First, the improper racial overtone of the question was isolated, and the prosecutor moved on to another line of questioning after Calhoun responded negatively to the question. <em>See Morin, </em>627 F.3d at 1000. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks in his closing argument were made in response to defense counsel\u2019s reference of the question and focused on the presence of the large sum of money rather than the race of the participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Second, the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks was mitigated by the district court\u2019s instruction to the jury that the statements and arguments of the attorneys were not evidence and that the verdict must be based only on the evidence. <em>See id. </em>At defense counsel\u2019s request, the district court had also ensured during jury selection that no juror felt that he or she would be influenced by the fact that Calhoun was African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Third, the evidence against Calhoun was strong, as the testimony of several witnesses indicated that he was a knowing participant in the drug transaction. Although Calhoun testified that he was not aware of the drug transaction, his testimony also established that the other participants knowingly displayed over $400,000 in cash in front of him and brought him to the scene of their planned drug purchase. Calhoun\u2019s argument is unavailing, as the prosecutor\u2019s remarks do not \u201ccast serious doubt on the correctness of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Calhoun also contends that his sentences totaling 180 months of imprisonment are unreasonable because the district court failed to consider under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) the disparity between Calhoun\u2019s sentences and those of his co-participants in the attempted drug transaction. For each conviction, the district court sentenced Calhoun to the relevant statutory minimum term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), (D)(ii). Because the district court lacked the power to sentence Calhoun below those statutory m\u00edni-mums, his challenge to his sentence is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Doggins, </em>633 F.3d 379, 384 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Although neither party has noted an error in the written judgment, the written judgment indicates that Calhoun received concurrent five-year terms of supervised release on all three of his convictions while the district court orally pronounced concurrent five-year terms of supervised release on Calhoun\u2019s two drug convictions and a concurrent three-year term of super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>vised release for his firearm conviction. Where there is a conflict between the oral pronouncement of a sentence and the written judgment, the oral pronouncement prevails. <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 935 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED, and the case is REMANDED for the limited purpose of correcting the clerical error in the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36; <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>588 F.2d 961, 964 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b222-4\">HAYNES, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ3\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">I concur fully in the majority opinion. Specifically, I agree that Calhoun has not shown reversible plain error as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks. That said, I write separately to express deep concern about this conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">First, it should be very clear (certainly to a lawyer licensed thirty-seven years in Texas) that such racially-charged comments are completely inappropriate for any lawyer. Tex. Disciplinary Rules of Prof\u2019l Conduct R. 5.08. Next, it is particularly inappropriate for an Assistant United States Attorney \u2014 a prosecutor \u2014 to behave this way. Prosecutors are held to a higher standard than even the high professional standards applicable to all attorneys. <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935); <em>see also </em>Tex. Disoiplinary Rules of Prof\u2019l Conduct R. 3.09, cmt. 1 (\u201cA prosecutor has the responsibility to see that justice is done, and not simply to be an advocate.\u201d). \u201cThe United States Attorney is the representative ... of a sovereignty ... whose interest ... in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a ease, but that justice shall be done.... He may prosecute with earnestness, ... [b]ut, while he may strike hard blows, <em>he is not at liberty to strike foul ones.\u201d Berger, </em>295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. 629 (emphasis added). It is hard to think of a more foul blow than implying that the race or national origin of a group of people has anything to do with whether Calhoun should have known they were involved in dealing drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Finally, perhaps the most troubling of all is how the United States Attorney\u2019s Office has handled this matter thereafter. While I do not fault the determination to argue in favor of sustaining the verdict, I am dismayed by the cavalier approach to this situation. The Government\u2019s brief calls the question \u201cimpolitic\u201d and states: \u201ceven assuming the question crossed the line,\u201d as if that is in doubt. Let me clear up any confusion \u2014 the question crossed the line. An apology is in order, and I do not see it in the briefing. Indeed, it should trouble the Assistant United States Attorney in question and all those in his office not just that he said such a thing, but that he thought it. The title \u201cprosecutor\u201d \u2014 indeed, the title \u201clawyer\u201d \u2014 demands better. I hope I will not have to say this again.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
