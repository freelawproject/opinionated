He argues that his above-guidelines sentence was plainly unreasonable because it reflected an overstatement of the seriousness of his violations of the conditions of supervised release and failed to take into account his personal circumstances. His further assertion is that the district court should have considered the applicable policy statements and the relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and should have imposed a guidelines sentence of 4-10 months, which would have satisfied the goals of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-21\">Montanez did not make an objection to the reasonableness of the sentence after it was imposed. Thus, review of the substantive reasonableness of his sentence is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, Montanez must show that the district court committed a clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 260. If he makes that showing, the court will not exercise its discretion to correct the error unless it will seriously affect the \u201cfairness, integrity, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The record reflects that the district court considered the policy statement and the recommended sentencing guidelines range. Although the district court did not expressly refer to \u00a7 3558(a)(1), it was clear that the court implicitly considered the relevant factors in light of its knowledge of Montanez\u2019s history and characteristics, having presided over his first revocation proceeding, and its consideration of the testimony and documents introduced during the revocation hearing that reflected the nature and circumstances surrounding Montanez\u2019s present violations. <em>Cf. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-65; <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). The district court also considered Monta-nez\u2019s allocution and the arguments of the parties, including defense counsel\u2019s assertions that the nature of Montanez\u2019s violations did not warrant his incarceration. Montanez\u2019s appellate argument is essentially a request to have this court reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which this court will not do. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The sentence imposed falls within the 60-month statutory maximum, and the record reflects that the district court considered the policy statements and the relevant \u00a7 3553 factors. Montanez has not demonstrated any error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 265. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b944-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
