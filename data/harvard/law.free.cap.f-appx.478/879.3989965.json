He appeals the within-guidelines sentence imposed following his guilty plea conviction for Count Three of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-18\">Wellington contends that the district court clearly erred in determining the quantity of drugs attributable to him for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Specifically, he argues that the quantities of crack cocaine alleged in Counts One and Two of the indictment should not have been included because he neither pleaded guilty to nor was convicted of those counts. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>also argues that these quantities should not have been included as relevant conduct because the transactions alleged in those counts did not occur and, in the alternative, were not part of his plan or course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">The district court did not clearly err in concluding that Wellington committed the acts alleged in Counts One and Two of the indictment. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84-85 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.1995). Although Wellington neither pleaded guilty to nor was convicted of these transactions, the district court was not prohibited from including them as relevant conduct because they did not increase his sentence beyond the 20-year statutory maximum term of imprisonment allowed for his offense of conviction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>633 F.3d 370, 374 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 3006, 180 L.Ed.2d 832 (2011). Further, given the similarity, regularity, and close temporal proximity of the three transactions, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that they were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. <em>See United States v. Bethley, </em>973 F.2d 396, 401 (5th Cir.1992). To the extent Wellington argues that the similarity, regularity, and close temporal proximity of these transactions should have been discounted because they were the result of sentencing entrapment or sentencing factor manipulation, he has failed to show that the confidential informant or the Austin Police Department persuaded him to commit a greater criminal offense than he was predisposed to commit or that their conduct was overbearing or outrageous. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>664 F.3d 966, 984 (5th Cir.2011), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(May 2, 2012) (No. 11-1326); <em>United States v. Tremelling, </em>43 F.3d 148, 151-52 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, the district court\u2019s relevant conduct determination was plausible in light of the record read as a whole, and Wellington has not shown that the district court clearly erred in determining the quantity of drugs attributable to him for purposes of \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Wellington also contends that the district court clearly erred when it denied him a two-level reduction for his minor role in the offense pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b). He argues that he was substantially less culpable than the confidential informant, who arranged and was present at each transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Because Wellington was the only defendant and neither the undercover officer nor the confidential informant was a participant for purposes of \u00a7 3B1.2, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.l); \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.l), Wellington was not eligible for the minor role adjustment, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.2). Further, even if the district court had accepted Wellington\u2019s self-serving declarations that he committed the offense at the confidential informant\u2019s request, his actions were not peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, Wellington has not shown that the district court clearly erred when it denied him a two-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b). <em>See id. </em>at 203-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Finally, Wellington contends that the district court erred when it denied him a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a). Wellington denied the transactions alleged in Counts One and Two of the indictment and objected to the presentence report\u2019s inclusion of the drug quantities involved in those counts as relevant conduct. The district court rejected Wellington\u2019s objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>tion and concluded that, based on the information in the presentence report, the undercover officer\u2019s testimony at sentencing, and the Government\u2019s documentary evidence, Wellington committed the acts alleged in those counts. Therefore, the district court\u2019s denial of a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a) is not without foundation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.l(A)); <em>United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
