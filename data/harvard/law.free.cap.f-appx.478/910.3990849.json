His prior Texas aggravated assault convictions under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.02 qualify as the enumerated offense of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 200-01 (5th Cir.2007). The district court did not err in considering Andrews\u2019s first aggravated assault conviction because he was convicted as an adult. The district court did not err in determining that Andrews\u2019s second aggravated assault conviction constituted a crime of violence as the indictment shows the crime posed a serious potential risk of physical injury, even though the victim did not suffer physical injury. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>635 F.3d 774, 777 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 399, 181 L.Ed.2d 256 (2011). Because Andrews\u2019s current conspiracy offense began in January 2007, within six years of his release from prison in October 2001 for his prior convictions, the district court did not err in considering them under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e). <em>See United States v. Gipson, </em>46 F.3d 472, 475 (5th Cir.1995). Finally, Andrews\u2019s prior convictions were separated by intervening arrests and, therefore, the district court did not err in treating them as separate convictions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">Andrews maintains that the district court did not give sufficient reasons for the sentence or for rejecting his request for a variance. Because he did not raise this argument in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Andrews has not shown that there is a reasonable probability such an error affected the sentence he received and therefore cannot satisfy his burden under plain error review. <em>See id. </em>at 364. Nonetheless, the district court provided sufficient reasons for the sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and, therefore, the district court did not commit any error, plain or otherwise. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 657-58 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-15\">According to Andrews, the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; the district court did not make findings regarding those factors, including his history and characteristics; and the district court mechanically applied the career offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">The district court made an individualized sentencing decision after considering the advisory guidelines range, the Pre-sentence Report, Andrews\u2019s arguments and allocution at sentencing, the sentences imposed on his codefendants, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including his history and characteristics, the safety of the public, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>need to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment. His within-guidelines sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, 53</em>1 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). His disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). Andrews has not shown that the court\u2019s choice of a within-guidelines sentence was improper. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b937-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
