Leyva contends his sentence was unreasonable and that he deserved a downward departure. He asserts the district court did not: properly apply the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; take into account his cultural assimilation into the United States; and provide adequate reasons for the sentence imposed. On this record, our court lacks jurisdiction to review the downward-departure denial, although Leyva may still challenge his sentence as unreasonable. <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.2007), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized by United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\">A challenge to the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed in the light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If error has been preserved, review is for abuse of discretion, <em>id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; if not, only for plain error, <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Sentences are reviewed first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>for procedural error, then for substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The record does not support Ley-va\u2019s assertion that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors; the court stated it had considered them in determining Leyva\u2019s sentence. And, although Leyva asserted he had culturally assimilated to the United States, this is not a mandatory basis for a departure, and the district court was not required to accord this fact dispositive weight. <em>E.g., United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Finally, regarding the adequacy of district court\u2019s explanation of sentence, Leyva failed to raise this issue before the district court, and, therefore, review is only for plain error. Because there is no indication his sentence would have been different had the court provided greater explanation of its selected sentence, Leyva has not shown that any alleged deficiency in the district court\u2019s explanation affected his substantial rights. <em>E.g., Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Although Leyva asked for a sentence below the advisory Guidelines sentencing range, he did not specifically object to the sentence imposed. Nevertheless, we need not determine which standard of review applies <em>(i.e., </em>abuse of discretion or plain error), as Leyva is unable to satisfy either standard. Being within the properly-calculated Guidelines range, Leyva\u2019s sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>E.g., United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). The district court considered Leyva\u2019s request for a below-Guidelines sentence but determined that the record (particularly Leyva\u2019s numerous drug-and-alcohol-related convictions), in the light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, called for a sentence at the top of that range. Leyva has not shown the district court committed \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
