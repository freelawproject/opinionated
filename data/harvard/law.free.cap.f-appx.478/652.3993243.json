After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-22\">Love\u2019s excessive force claim- rests on Cotner\u2019s decision to use a taser against him during the incident in question, which took place on July 24, 2009. Love\u2019s brief cites only one of our decisions, <em>Brown v. City of Huntsville, Ala., </em>608 F.3d 724 (11th Cir.2010), to suggest that Fourth Amendment law at the time in question clearly proscribed Cotner\u2019s conduct. But we decided <em>Brown </em>in 2010, after the incident about which Love complains. Thus, <em>Brown </em>could not have \u201cput [Cotner] on notice that his conduct would be clearly unlawful.\u201d <em>Vinyard v. Wilson, </em>311 F.3d 1340, 1350 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation marks and emphases omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-23\">As for his false arrest claim, Love argues that there is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether Rodgers had arguable probable cause to arrest him, and thus whether he was entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Holmes v. Kueynda, </em>321 F.3d 1069, 1079 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that qualified immunity to a claim of false arrest is warranted if an officer had arguable probable cause to make the arrest). However, it is undisputed that during the incident in question, Love failed to obey several of the officers\u2019 orders. Thus, the record unambiguously shows that Rodgers could have reasonably believed that Love was in violation of Mobile City Code \u00a7 39-54, which makes it a crime \u201cfor any person to fail to obey the direction or order of [a police officer] while ... acting in an official capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">The district court did not err in concluding that, on this record, Cotner and Rodgers were entitled to qualified immunity. We therefore affirm its grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
