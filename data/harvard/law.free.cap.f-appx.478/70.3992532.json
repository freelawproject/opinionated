In an order entered May 18, 2010, the district court denied Barnes\u2019s motions to alter or amend the judgment and for a new trial. In November 2010, Barnes noticed his appeal from this order. On December 6, 2010, the district court denied Barnes\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal because the notice of appeal was not filed timely and the appeal was not taken in good faith. This court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was untimely. <em>Barnes v. Giroir, </em>No. 10-31148, slip op. (5th Cir. Mar. 2, 2011) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">In July 2011, Barnes filed a motion pursuant to Rule 60(b) asking the district court to revisit its May 18, 2010, order that denied his motion for a new trial because there had been a miscarriage of justice, fraud, surprise, and/or inadvertence, and newly discovered evidence regarding the determination that his notice of appeal from that denial was untimely. The district court denied the motion, stating that because this court had already held that Barnes\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, Barnes could not reopen the issue through a Rule 60(b) motion. The district court denied IFP, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-15\">By moving in this court to proceed IFP, Barnes is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-16\">Barnes contends that he is entitled to relief from the district court\u2019s December 6, 2010 order, which denied him leave to proceed IFP on appeal and determined that his appeal was untimely from the district court\u2019s May 18, 2010, order, which denied his motions to alter or amend the judgment or for a new trial, because he was not sent notice of the denial of his motion for a new trial, there were intervening circumstances beyond his control, and he would have prevailed on appeal; that the district court abused its discretion by not taking as true his factual allegations in the Rule 60(b) motion; and that the district court abused its discretion by not ruling on a motion for, or holding, an evidentiary hearing. He asserts that Rule 60(b) \u201chas been applied to pro se litigants who do not receive actual notice of a judgment agai[n]st them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">Barnes does not address the basis for the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion and certification that the appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>was not taken in good faith \u2014 that this court had already held that his notice of appeal was untimely. Pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Nevertheless, when an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Barnes has failed to challenge the reason the district court denied the Rule 60(b) motion and certified that his appeal is not taken in good faith, he has abandoned the critical issues of his appeal. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, under the law of the case doctrine, this court\u2019s prior determination that it lacked jurisdiction because Barnes\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely is binding. <em>See Fuhrman v. Dretke, </em>442 F.3d 893, 896-97 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, the appeal lacks arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Barnes\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996); \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, (g). We CAUTION Barnes that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b97-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
