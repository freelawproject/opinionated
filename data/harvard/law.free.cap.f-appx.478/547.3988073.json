Stat. \u00a7 760.10. The district court ruled that Hernandez failed to prove that the legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons Wilsonart gave for declining to hire Hernandez were pretex-tual. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Hernandez argues that Wilsonart rejected his application for a position as a delivery driver because he is Hispanic. Under Title VII and the Florida Civil Rights Act, it is unlawful for an employer \u201cto fail or refuse to hire ... any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s ... national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.10(l)(a). The Florida Act was modeled after and employs the same analytical framework as Title VII. <em>Harper v. Blockbuster Entm\u2019t Corp., </em>139 F.3d 1385, 1387 (11th Cir.1998); <em>Joshua v. City of Gainesville, </em>768 So.2d 432, 435 (Fla.2000). Because the district court concluded that Hernandez established a prima facie case of discrimination, we review <em>de novo </em>whether the reasons proffered for his termination were merely pretexts for discrimination. <em>See Rowell v. BellSouth Corp., </em>433 F.3d 794, 798 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Wilsonart presented evidence that it rejected Hernandez\u2019s application for two legitimate, non-diseriminatory reasons. First, Hernandez failed to submit a verifiable work history. Wilsonart requested that applicants submit a general application form and a driver\u2019s application form listing the names and telephone numbers of their employers for the preceding three years. Within the same time frame that the individuals Wilsonart hired, Anthony Palmer and Carl Renninger, had submitted their forms and supplementary documents required to complete the application process, Hernandez had submitted only incomplete application forms. Second, Hernandez had the least work experience. Hernandez had four years of driving experience, but both Palmer and Renninger had more years of driving experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Hernandez failed to create a genuine factual dispute about the legitimacy of those reasons. To prove pretext, Hernandez had to establish there were \u2018\u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the ... proffered legitimate reasons ... that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u2019\u201d <em>Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1265 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir.1997)). Hernandez argues that the de-cisionmaker at Wilsonart, Thomas Grear, testified inconsistently about basing his decision on customer complaints about Hernandez\u2019s work for a previous employer, but even if that proffered reason is false, Hernandez is not \u201centitle[d] ... to get past summary judgment\u201d given the other legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons to reject his application. <em>Id. </em>at 1264. Hernandez also argues that he was equally qualified for the driver position and eliminated from the interview process unfairly, but Wilso-nart was entitled to conclude that Hernandez was not as qualified as either Palmer or Renninger. <em>See id. </em>at 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Hernandez failed to present evidence that the reasons proffered by Wilsonart were pretextual. \u201cWe are not in the business of adjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair. Instead, our sole concern is whether unlawful discriminatory animus motivates a challenged employment decision.\u201d <em>Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.1999). Viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to Hernandez, he failed to create a genuine dispute that the reasons that Wilsonart proffered for rejecting his application were discriminatory or unworthy of credence. <em>Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The summary judgment in favor of Wil-sonart is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
