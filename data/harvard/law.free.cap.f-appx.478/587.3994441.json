White, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. White\u2019s complaint alleged disability discrimination in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701, <em>et seq. </em>Specifically, White claimed that he was unlawfully terminated from his probationary position as an airport security screener based on an unidentified physical disability-</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We review de novo a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>Speaker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs. Ctrs. for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, </em>628 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir.2010). Ordinarily, the Rehabilitation Act prohibits federal agencies from discriminating against disabled persons. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). This prohibition includes discrimination in the form of failure to provide reasonable accommodations and disparate treatment. <em>See Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, </em>544 F.3d 1201, 1212 n. 6 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (\u201cATSA\u201d), however, exempts the Transportation Security Administration (\u201cTSA\u201d) from certain requirements of the Rehabilitation Act with regard to the employment of security screeners. <em>Castro v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>472 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2006). Under this law, the TSA may impose certain minimum physical qualifications for security screen-ers, \u201c[n]otwithstanding any provision of law.\u201d <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44935(f). For example, security screeners must \u201cpossess basic aptitudes and physical abilities, including color perception, visual and aural acuity, physical coordination, and motor skills,\u201d even though these standards would ordinarily run afoul of the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s prohibition against making employment decisions on the basis of a physical disability. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 44935(f)(1)(B); <em>Castro, </em>472 F.3d at 1337-38. Based on this inherent incompatibility, we have held that the plain language of the ATSA \u201cexempts TSA from compliance with the Rehabilitation Act in establishing employment standards for security screeners.\u201d <em>Castro, </em>472 F.3d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">Here, the district court did not err in dismissing White\u2019s complaint for failure to state a cognizable claim of disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. Any such claim was preempted by the ATSA and fails as a matter of law. <em>See Castro, </em>472 F.3d at 1337; 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44935(f). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-9\">. White also argues that he was treated less favorably than similarly situated security screeners. As noted by the district court, this allegation is simply a restyled disability discrimination claim. Regardless, because this claim did not appear in White\u2019s complaint, it will not be considered on appeal. <em>See Speaker, </em>623 F.3d at 1379.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
