No reversible error has been shown; we affirm in part and dismiss in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to whether substantial evidence supports the decision and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). Under this limited standard of review, we may not make fact-findings, re-weigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Where substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s fact findings exists, we cannot overturn those findings even if other substantial evidence exists that is contrary to the ALJ\u2019s findings. <em>Barron v. Sullivan, </em>924 F.2d 227, 230 (11th Cir.1991). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision on whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">For a person under age 18 to be entitled to SSI benefits, that person must have \u201ca medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe functional limitations, and which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(C)(i). The ALJ is to use a three-step analysis to make this determination. First, the ALJ determines whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(b). If not \u2014 as with J.I.B. \u2014 the ALJ determines whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(c). J.I.B. has these severe impairments: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d), developmental delay, and asthma.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> So, the ALJ then determines whether the impairment or combination of impairments meets or is medically or functionally equal to an impairment listed in Appendix 1 of 20 C.F.R. part 404, subpart P, and otherwise satisfies the duration requirement. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(a); <em>see Wilson v. Apfel, </em>179 F.3d 1276, 1277 n. 1 (11th Cir.1999). About this third step, the ALJ concluded that J.I.B. did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or equaled the Listings and that J.I.B. did not have a combination of impairments that were functionally equivalent to a Listing.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">In determining whether a child\u2019s impairment functionally equals a listed impairment, the ALJ must consider six \u201cdomains,\u201d which are \u201cbroad areas of functioning intended to capture all of what a child can and cannot do.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(l). To satisfy the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d standard, a child claimant must have \u201cmarked\u201d limitations in two domains or an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in one domain. 20 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u00a7 416.926a(d). A marked limitation is defined as a limitation that \u201cinterferes seriously -with [the] ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities,\u201d and is \u201cmore than moderate.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(e)(2)(i). The ALJ must consider the \u201cinteractive\u201d and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of all medically determinable impairments, including those impairments that are not severe. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(a), (c). The ALJ must also consider how the child performs in a supportive setting and at school, as well as the effects of medication and other treatment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The ALJ concluded that J.I.B. had marked limitations in one of the domains, but had no limitation or less than marked limitations in the other five domains. On appeal, Bryant challenges only the ALJ\u2019s determination that J.I.B. had less than marked limitations in the domain of \u201cattending and completing tasks.\u201d Under this domain, the ALJ considers how well the child claimant is \u201cable to focus and maintain [his] attention, and how well [he] begin[s], carries] through, and finish[es][his] activities, including the pace at which [he] perform[s] activities and the ease with which [he] change[s] them.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(h). A child between the ages of three and six<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cshould be able to pay attention when [he is] spoken to directly, sustain attention to [his] play and learning activities, and concentrate on activities like putting puzzles together or completing art projects.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(h)(2)(iii). In addition, the child should be able to focus long enough to gather his clothes, dress and feed himself, put away toys, wait his turn, and change activities when instructed. <em>Id. </em>A child may show limitations in this domain if he (1) is easily distracted; (2) is slow to focus on or complete activities of interest to him, such as art projects or games; (3) is frequently sidetracked from his activities; (4) is easily frustrated by, and gives up on, tasks that he has the ability to complete; and (5) requires extra supervision to remain engaged in an activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(h)(3)(i)-(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that J.I.B. was less than markedly limited in the domain of attending and completing tasks and, thus, was not disabled. The record evidence demonstrates that \u2014 when the ALJ conducted the hearing on J.I.B.\u2019s application \u2014 J.I.B. generally followed directions and was able to dress and feed himself, help with chores, and complete puzzles. In addition, J.I.B. had only slight problems paying attention when spoken to, focusing on finishing tasks, taking turns, and changing activities when instructed. Although evidence existed that J.I.B. was easily distracted and had a short attention span, his behavior and concentration improved significantly with medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Because substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision and because the ALJ applied the correct legal standards, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\">. Because Bryant failed to file a new or amended notice of appeal after the district court dismissed her motion for reconsideration, we lack jurisdiction to consider her challenge to that dismissal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii); <em>Green v. Union Foundry Co., </em>281 F.3d 1229, 1233 (11th Cir.2002) (declining to consider the district court's order denying appellant\u2019s post-judgment motion \u2014 issued after appellant filed his notice of appeal\u2014 when appellant failed to file a separate notice of appeal from that order or an amended notice of appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-11\">. Bryant also asserted that J.I.B. had a cardiac impairment but the ALJ concluded that\u2014 because J.I.B. was clinically asymptomatic\u2014 his condition was non-severe. Bryant does not challenge this determination on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b672-5\">. J.I.B. was three years old when the SSI application was filed and five years old when the ALJ conducted a hearing on the application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
