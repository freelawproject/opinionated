Virginia College moved to compel arbitration in order to enforce an arbitration clause in the \u201cEnrollment and Tuition Agreement,\u201d which Daniels signed before enrolling as a student at Defendant Virginia College at Jackson (individually, \u201cthe College\u201d). On appeal, Daniels contends that the Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause does not cover her tort claims, and she contends that the arbitration clause is unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">The Enrollment Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause requires arbitration of any claim \u201carising out of or relating to [the Agreement], together will all other claims ... of any nature whatsoever arising out of or in relation to [Daniels\u2019s] enrollment and participation in courses at the College .... \u201d Daniels alleges that the College unlawfully retained the portion of her federal financial aid monies that should have been disbursed to Daniels to cover her cost of living. She brings state-law claims sounding in negligence, conversion, embezzlement, and unjust enrichment. Because these claims arose \u201cin relation to [Daniels\u2019s] enrollment and participation in courses at the College,\u201d the district court was correct in finding them subject to the arbitration, clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">Under Mississippi law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> substantive unconscionability \u201cis proven by oppressive contract terms such that there is a one-sided agreement whereby one party is deprived of all the benefits of the agreement or left without a remedy for another party\u2019s nonperformance or breach.\u201d <em>Covenant Health and Rehab. of Picayune, LP v. Estate of Moulds, </em>14 So.3d 695, 699-700 (Miss.2009) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). In <em>Covenant Health, </em>the Mississippi Supreme Court found that a contract containing an arbitration clause \u201ccoupled with a multitude of unconscionable provisions,\u201d including asymmetrical limitations on liability, choice of forum, and other matters, was unenforceable in its entirety. <em>Id. </em>at 703. Daniels argues that the Enrollment Agreement is similarly laden with unconscionable provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">First, there is language in the arbitration clause that allows the College, but not Daniels, to seek injunctive relief in court. An agreement that requires only one party to submit its claims to arbitration is unconscionable under Mississippi law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but the language at issue here merely allows the College to seek a preliminary injunction to halt a student\u2019s ongoing breach of the Enrollment Agreement. The College must seek all other relief though arbitration. An asymmetric exception so limited in scope does not make an arbitration clause unconscionable. <em>Sawyers v. Herrin-Gear Chev. Co., </em>26 So.3d 1026, 1035 (Miss.2010) (arbitration clause between car dealer and purchaser enforceable notwithstanding exception allowing car dealer to bring an action to repossess the car in court).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>Daniels also points to the arbitration clause\u2019s language prohibiting the arbitrator from awarding any damages not \u201cmeasured by the prevailing party\u2019s actual compensatory damages.\u201d Ostensibly bilateral limitations on punitive damages are unconscionable under Mississippi law if they are one-sided in practical effect due to the weaker party\u2019s being \u201cmuch more likely to be justified in seeking punitive damages.\u201d <em>Vicksburg Partners, L.P. v. Stephens, </em>911 So.2d 507, 528-24 (Miss.2005) (ostensibly bilateral punitive-damages limitation in contract of adhesion between nursing home and occupant unenforceable against occupant), <em>overruled on other grounds by Covenant Health, </em>14 So.3d at 706 (Miss.2009). However, as Virginia College concedes in its brief, the arbitration clause does not bar the arbitrator from awarding damages in excess of compensatory damages. It merely requires that the amount of such damages be based on the prevailing party\u2019s compensatory damages. <em>Sawyers, </em>26 So.3d at 1036 (interpreting nearly identical language as requiring only that the parties be \u201climited as to the amount of punitive damages which might be awarded, since such an award would have to be \u2018measured by the prevailing party\u2019s actual damages\u2019 \u201d). Such provisions are not unconscionable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Daniels next points to the Enrollment Agreement\u2019s asymmetric liquidated damages provision, which she contends would leave her without any remedy for the wrongs she alleges because its language limits her recovery to \u201can amount equal to any non-refunded tuition payments.... \u201d Contractual provisions intended to exculpate a party of liability for its own tortious conduct are particularly suspect under Mississippi law. <em>See Turnbough v. Ladner, </em>754 So.2d 467, 469 (Miss.1999). As Virginia College concedes, however, the liquidated damages provision in the Enrollment Agreement applies only to breach-of-contract damages, and would not affect recovery for Daniels\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Finally, a provision of the agreement permits the college to recover attorney\u2019s fees against Daniels if it prevails in any action or arbitration that is \u201cpermitted\u201d by the Enrollment Agreement or that \u201caris[es] out of [the Agreement] and the subject matter contained [therein.\u201d However, while the Enrollment Agreement is silent with respect to Daniels\u2019s recovering fees if she prevails, Virginia College disavows any interpretation of it that would preclude Daniels from recovering attorneys\u2019 fees to which she might otherwise be entitled under the arbitration rules. Given Virginia College\u2019s concessions regarding the meaning of its provisions, enforcing the Enrollment Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause is not unconscionable under Mississippi law.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b919-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this* opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-9\">. The Enrollment Agreement has an Alabama choice-of-law provision. But no party raises this provision, and they have relied on Mississippi law throughout their briefing on appeal and before the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b919-13\">. <em>Covenant Health, </em>14 So.3d at 700 (citing <em>Pridgen v.
