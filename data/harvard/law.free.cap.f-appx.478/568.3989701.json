After careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In late February 2011, a confidential informant arranged for Clark-Thomas to meet an undercover agent, who was posing as a disgruntled drug trafficker looking for help in robbing cocaine from a stash house. Clark-Thomas agreed to assist with the robbery in exchange for half of the expected cocaine take, and \u201cindicated that he planned on utilizing two to four associates to assist in committing the robbery.\u201d Clark-Thomas then discussed the plan with a few associates who agreed to participate in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The robbery plan was a setup, of course; and, shortly before the plan was to be executed, Clark-Thomas was arrested. Clark-Thomas pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of a mixture containing cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and 846. As part of his plea, he signed a factual proffer stipulating the truth of the facts above.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The district court found that Clark-Thomas was an \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d of the conspiracy, and as a result added a two-level enhancement to his sentencing guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). With the enhancement, Clark-Thomas\u2019s sentencing range was 135 to 168 months, and the district court imposed a sentence of 168 months. Clark-Thomas filed this appeal of his sentence, in which he disputes the district court\u2019s imposition of the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo, United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1253 (11th Cir.2005), and we review its factual determination concerning Clark-Thomas\u2019s role in this offense under the clear error standard, <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1331 (11th Cir.2003). We will therefore disturb the district court\u2019s imposition of this enhancement only if, on the entire record, we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">At sentencing, to the extent that any fact bearing on a defendant\u2019s role in an offense is disputed, the government bears the burden of establishing that fact by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>461 F.3d 1331, 1335 (11th Cir.2006). A fact admitted as part of a guilty plea may be considered by the district court at sentencing, even where the government presents no additional evidence to support it. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">Section 3Bl.l(c) of the sentencing guidelines provides that, where a defendant is an \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d over one to four co-participants in a criminal activity, a two-level sentencing enhancement may apply. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). On appeal, Clark-Thomas argues that the sentencing court erred in two ways when it imposed the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement against him. First, Clark-Thomas argues that the district court failed to consider some factors that weighed against the finding that he was an \u201corganizer/leader\u201d of the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>activity. Second, Clark-Thomas argues that the court failed to make specific findings as to whom he recruited into the robbery. Neither argument is availing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Clark-Thomas first argues that the district court failed to consider some factors that weighed against finding him to be an organizer or leader of the criminal activity. He bases his argument on one of the guidelines\u2019 application notes for \u00a7 3B1.1, which lists seven factors that courts should consider in differentiating \u201ca leadership and organizational role from one of mere management or supervision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n.4. The distinction between being an \u201corganizer\u201d or \u201cleader\u201d as opposed to a \u201cmanager\u201d or \u201csupervisor\u201d is not critical in this case, however. The district court enhanced Clark-Thomas\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), a provision that permits the enhancement for any \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(c). The accompanying commentary explains that the \u201cinclusiveness\u201d of \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) reflects the fact that, for smaller criminal endeavors, \u201cthe distinction between organization and leadership, and that of management or supervision, is of less significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. background. Thus, the application note that Clark-Thomas invokes does not shed light on why it would have been inappropriate for the district court to impose an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Next, Clark-Thomas argues that the district court was required to enumerate precisely whom Clark-Thomas recruited into the robbery plan when it imposed the \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement. He is correct that the district court is generally required to make fact findings, which facilitate meaningful appellate review. <em>See United States v. Alpert, </em>28 F.3d 1104, 1108 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc). But we have clearly stated that, \u201c[i]n making the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the sentencing judge has no duty to make any specific subsidiary factual findings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939-40 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). Besides, even if Clark-Thomas were correct that the sentencing court is required to make this subsidiary factual finding, it appears that the sentencing court in fact did. At sentencing, the court stated that it relied on the offense conduct described in the presentence investigation report to find that Clark-Thomas recruited \u201cSimon Samuels, Arthur Murphy, and Ebony Dunbar\u201d for the conspiracy. As a result, Clark-Thomas\u2019s second argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Reviewing now the district court\u2019s determination of Clark-Thomas\u2019s role in the conspiracy, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that he was an \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d of the endeavor. As part of his plea agreement, Clark-Thomas admitted to \u201cindicating] that he planned on utilizing two to four associates to assist in committing the robbery.\u201d He also admitted that he discussed the plan with a few associates, and that those associates agreed to participate in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">In the stipulated factual proffer for his plea, Clark-Thomas admitted that he told the undercover agent that \u201che commits robberies for a living and that he and his crew would be successful in committing\u201d the planned robbery. But at sentencing, he argued that he was \u201cjust blowing smoke\u201d when he made that statement, and testified that the statement was not factually true. However, aside from disputing the interpretation of that single statement, Clark-Thomas raised no other objection to the facts contained in his PSI, and the entirety of the undisputed evidence supports the imposition of the enhancement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Thus, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s finding that Clark-Thomas recruited his co-participants for the robbery is clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Mandhai, </em>375 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that a defendant\u2019s decision to recruit another individual and brief him on the details of a criminal plan was sufficient to support an enhancement). We therefore affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
