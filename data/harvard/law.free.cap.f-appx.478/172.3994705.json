He asserted that he was convicted and sentenced for attempted aggravated rape in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>violation of his constitutional rights and asked the court to reverse his conviction and sentence and award him $100,000 in damages. The district court dismissed his complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, and Elzy appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim under both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A and \u00a7 1915(e)(2). <em>Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). We will uphold a dismissal for failure to state a claim if, \u201ctaking the plaintiffs allegations as true, it appears that no relief could be granted based on the plaintiffs alleged facts.\u201d <em>Samford, </em>562 F.3d at 678 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A claim is frivolous if it lacks \u201cany arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The magistrate judge and district court were correct that the State is immune from a civil rights suit for damages and thus any \u00a7 1983 claims against the State of Louisiana necessarily fail. <em>See McCarthy ex rel. Travis v. Hawkins, </em>381 F.3d 407, 412 (5th Cir.2004). They were also correct that any claim for damages is also barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because judgment in Elzy\u2019s favor \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\u201d which he did not allege had been previously overturned or invalidated. 512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Though Elzy appears to argue that he may seek the invalidation of his conviction through a \u00a7 1983 action, the sole vehicle for obtaining this relief in federal court is by petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005); <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 499-500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">In his objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, Elzy expressed a desire to add other defendants, including the trial court and prosecutors, which could be construed as an attempt to amend the complaint. <em>See United States v. Riascos, </em>76 F.3d 93, 94 (5th Cir.1996). Generally a district court should not dismiss a pro se complaint without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to amend, <em>Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9 (5th Cir.1994). Nonetheless, dismissal was warranted because bringing the same claims against these or any other potential defendants would be \u201cindisputably meritless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9 n. 5 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Attempts to sue state employees in their official capacities for monetary damages would be barred by sovereign immunity. <em>See McCarthy ex rel. Travis, </em>381 F.3d at 412. Prosecutors and judicial officers would be entitled to absolute immunity for acts taken in the performance of their prosecutorial or judicial functions. <em>See Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284-85 (5th Cir.1994). More broadly, Elzy could not overcome the <em>Heck </em>bar because any award of damages in his favor would necessitate a ruling that his conviction was invalid, see <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, and he may not seek the invalidation of his conviction through a \u00a7 1983 claim, no matter what defendant he names, <em>see Preiser, </em>411 U.S. at 499-500, 93 S.Ct. 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">To the extent that Elzy attempts to raise on appeal new claims related to a subsequent arrest and conviction, we will not consider them because Elzy failed to raise them in the district court. <em>See Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Discount Cntrs., Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Elzy\u2019s request to submit supplemental briefing is granted. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Elzy\u2019s complaint counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Elzy is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in forma pauperis unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">AFFIRMED; PERMISSION TO SUBMIT SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEFING GRANTED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
