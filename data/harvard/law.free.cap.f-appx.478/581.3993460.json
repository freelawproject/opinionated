The district court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss Christides\u2019s complaint and denied Christides\u2019s motion to change the nature of her suit from a claim brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) to a generic civil rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>claim.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Based upon Christides\u2019s application for social security disability benefits, the administrative law judge concluded that Christides was disabled and issued a decision in her favor. Christides, however, attempted to appeal that decision, challenging the onset date of her disability. Her administrative appeal was dismissed, and the Commissioner\u2019s decision became final on 2 September 2009. In its notice of dismissal, the Social Security Administration\u2019s Appeals Council instructed Chris-tides that she had 60 days from her receipt of its notice to appeal the decision to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">On 6 November 2009, Christides filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint (\u201cInitial Complaint\u201d) against the Commissioner in the district court together with a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d). The district court dismissed her complaint without prejudice, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), because Christides alleged that she was not in fact indigent. Chris-tides did not appeal this dismissal. Instead, she refiled the instant complaint (\u201cRefiled Complaint\u201d) and the appropriate filing fee on 17 November 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Conceding that her Refiled Complaint was untimely, Christides filed a motion\u2014 styled as a letter to the district court clerk \u2014 to reinstate her Initial Complaint so that her civil suit would be considered timely filed. The district court denied her motion based on improper styling and instructed her to renew her request for relief using the proper format. Christides failed to do so. , The district court then granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss Christides\u2019s Refiled Complaint as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u201ccomplaint for failure to satisfy the statute of limitations, accepting as true the allegations contained in the complaint.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Astrue, </em>506 F.3d 1349, 1352 (11th Cir.2007). Whether equitable tolling applies is a legal question that we review <em>de novo. Id. </em>In addition, we construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">A claimant seeking judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s final decision must file a civil suit within 60 days after receiving notice of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.210(c). Absent \u201ca reasonable showing to the contrary,\u201d the date of receipt of such notice is presumed to be five days after the date of such notice. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.210(c). Christides does not contend that it took longer than five days for her to receive the Commissioner\u2019s notice. Thus, to obtain judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s 2 September decision, Christides was required to file her civil suit by 6 November. That Christides\u2019s Refiled Complaint \u2014 filed on 17 November \u2014 was untimely is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">On appeal, Christides, however, argues that she was entitled to equitable tolling of the statutory filing period because she was diligent in pursuing her lawsuit. A claimant seeking equitable tolling of section 405(g)\u2019s statute of limitations must \u201cdemonstrate extraordinary circumstances, such as fraud, misinformation, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>deliberate concealment.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>506 F.3d at 1355. It is well-established that \u201c[e]quitable tolling \u2018is an extraordinary-remedy which should be extended only sparingly.\u2019\u201d <em>Bost v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>372 F.3d 1233, 1242 (11th Cir.2004). Thus, a conclusion that equitable tolling is warranted under section 405(g) \u201cis reserved for extraordinary facts.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>506 F.3d at 1353-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Christides has failed to demonstrate such extraordinary facts. Nothing evidences that Christides\u2019s late filing was the result of \u201cfraud, misinformation, or deliberate concealment.\u201d Instead, Christides was informed in clear language of her right to appeal to the district court and was instructed to do so within 60 days of the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. That Christides understood those instructions is evidenced by her filing of her Initial Complaint on the day of the deadline and her later acknowledgment that her Refiled Complaint was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">We are also unconvinced that the dismissal without prejudice of her Initial Complaint warrants application of the equitable tolling doctrine. First, the mere fact that her complaint was dismissed <em>without </em>prejudice does not permit her to file a later complaint outside the statute of limitations. <em>See Bost, </em>372 F.3d at 1242. Christides also failed to appeal the dismissal. Even if we assume that the district court failed to inform her expressly of her right to appeal, nothing evidences that the district court engaged in \u201cfraud, misinformation, or deliberate concealment.\u201d And although Christides attempted to reinstate her Initial Complaint for purposes of rendering her lawsuit timely, she failed to respond to the district court\u2019s unambiguous instructions to refile her request using the proper format. Neither Christides\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status nor her apparent ignorance of the law, by themselves, constitutes extraordinary circumstances. <em>See Jackson, </em>506 F.3d at 1356; <em>Wakefield v. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>131 F.3d 967, 969-70 (11th Cir.1997) (refusing to equitably toll the time to appeal a decision of the Railroad Retirement Board for a <em>pro se </em>litigant). Because we see no extraordinary circumstances, Christides is unentitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\"> To the extent that Christides challenges the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to change the nature of her suit on appeal, we conclude that the district court\u2019s denial was proper. The remedies set out in section 405(g) are the exclusive source of federal court jurisdiction over cases involving Social Security claims. <em>Jackson v. Astrue, </em>506 F.3d 1349, 1353 (11th Cir.2007). Thus, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Christides's complaint outside of section 405(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
