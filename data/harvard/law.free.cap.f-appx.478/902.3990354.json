Gomez argues that the district court erred by finding that his receipt and distribution of 24 ounces (680.4 grams) of cocaine prior to his offense of conviction constituted relevant conduct for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-17\">In determining a defendant\u2019s base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, a district court may consider as part of the defendant\u2019s relevant conduct any quantities of drugs that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. <em>United States v. Wall, </em>180 F.3d 641, 644 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2); \u00a7 2D1.1 comment, (n.12). In drug distribution cases, this court has \u201cbroadly defined what constitutes the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhine, </em>583 F.3d 878, 885 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The finding of the amount of drugs attributable to a defendant is made under the preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 247 (5th Cir.2005). A district court\u2019s determination of the amount of drugs for which a defendant should be held responsible is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 878 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-22\">Contrary to Gomez\u2019s contention, the testimony of Sergeant Mitch Russell of the Midland, Texas Police Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which was credited by the district court and the veracity of which Gomez does not challenge on appeal, was sufficient to establish that Gomez\u2019s prior receipt and distribution of the 24 ounces of cocaine at issue was part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. <em>See Rhine, </em>583 F.3d at 885-91; <em>United States v. Bethley, </em>973 F.2d 396, 401 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-23\">Moreover, Gomez ignores that the district court\u2019s relevant conduct finding was also supported by the presentence report, which the district court was permitted to rely on at sentencing and which Gomez bore the burden of demonstrating was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>accurate. <em>See United States v. Ollison, </em>555 F.3d 152, 164 (5th Cir.2009). The only rebuttal evidence offered by Gomez in support of his objection was his own testimony, which the district court did find was not credible; Gomez does not challenge that credibility determination here. In short, even if Gomez preserved his current arguments by raising them sufficiently in the district court, he fails to show clear error. <em>See Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
