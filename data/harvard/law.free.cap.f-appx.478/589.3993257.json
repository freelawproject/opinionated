On appeal, Jefferson argues: (1) he should be allowed to withdraw his plea, (2) he does not qualify for the career offender enhancement, and (3) the career offender enhancement\u2019s residual clause is unconsti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>tutionally vague. After review, we affirm Jefferson\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Jefferson argues, for the first time on appeal, that the magistrate judge failed to adequately explain the elements of the underlying offense of possession with intent to distribute heroin. He claims the magistrate judge\u2019s error goes to one of the core concerns of Rule 11 and constitutes plain error, such that he should be allowed to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Jefferson fails to demonstrate plain error. No binding precedent establishes that a magistrate judge\u2019s failure to describe the underlying offense in a conspiracy charge beyond reading the plea agreement and elements of the offense constitutes plain error. <em>See United, States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003) (stating there can be no plain error where there is no binding precedent in this Court or the Supreme Court directly resolving the issue). In fact, we have previously held that \u201c[i]n a conspiracy, however, neither actual possession nor actual distribution is a necessary element of the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>190 F.3d 1247, 1253 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Jefferson next argues that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 does not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2\u2019s residual clause. He concedes <em>United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 258, 181 L.Ed.2d 150 (2011), held that \u00a7 843.01 constituted a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, but contends that <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), has abrogated <em>Nix.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">In <em>Nix, </em>we held that a defendant\u2019s conviction for a violation <em>of \u00a7 </em>843.01 constituted a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>Nix, </em>628 F.3d at 1342.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are bound by our decision in <em>Nix </em>because it has not been overruled or abrogated by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting <em>en banc. See United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cTo constitute an \u2018overruling\u2019 for the purposes of this prior panel precedent rule, the Supreme Court decision \u2018must be clearly on point.\u2019\u201d). Further, though Jefferson advances arguments as to why <em>Sykes </em>abrogates <em>Nix, Sykes </em>is not clearly on point and does not directly overrule or abrogate <em>Nix. See Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2270-77 (holding that an Indiana offense of felony vehicle flight constituted a violent felony for the purposes of the ACCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-17\">Jefferson argues, for the first time on appeal, that the residual clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) is unconstitutionally vague, relying on Justice Scalia\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Sykes. </em>However, Jefferson does not offer any controlling case in this Court or the Supreme Court which establishes that the residual clause of \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2) is void for vagueness. As a result, Jefferson fails to show that application of the residual clause was plain error. <em>See Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\">. The definition of a \"crime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) is \"virtually identical\u201d to the definition of a \"violent felony\u201d in the ACCA, and we apply a similar analysis in deciding whether a given offense qualifies as a crime of violence or a violent felony. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253 (11th Cir.2010), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1783, 179 L.Ed.2d 656 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
