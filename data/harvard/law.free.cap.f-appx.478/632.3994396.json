Barreto first appeals the district court denial of his motion for mistrial because the prosecutor improperly commented on his right to remain silent. Barreto also appeals his sentence as substantively unreasonable. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the records, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-21\">Barreto\u2019s motion for a mistrial was based on his assertion that the prosecutor violated his Fifth Amendment rights dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>ing closing arguments. The prosecutor, in reference to Barreto, stated: \u201cWhy did he do it? Truly only he can tell you. But you do know he has a gambling problem.\u201d Barreto claims that the statement made a direct reference to his failure to testify and it is error to comment on the failure of the defendant to counter or explain evidence. Alternatively, a jury would naturally and necessarily have understood the statement to be such a comment. Further, Barreto alleges that the evidence against him was scant; therefore, it is fair to presume that the prosecutor\u2019s comment had an effect on the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Knowles, </em>66 F.3d 1146, 1162 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cThe Fifth Amendment prohibits a prosecutor from commenting directly or indirectly on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant\u2019s right to remain silent is violated by a prosecutor\u2019s comment when either \u201c(1) the statement was <em>manifestly intended </em>to be a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify; or (2) the statement was of such a character that a jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on failure of the accused to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1162-63 (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant must prove that one of the criteria exists. <em>Id. </em>at 1163. Furthermore, in determining the prosecutor\u2019s motive and the impact of the statement, we examine the prosecutor\u2019s statement in context. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">We reverse a defendant\u2019s conviction because of prosecutorial misconduct \u201conly if, in the context of the entire trial and in light of any curative instruction, the misconduct may have prejudiced the substantial rights of the accused.\u201d <em>United States v. Cordoba-Mosquera, </em>212 F.3d 1194, 1198 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam). However, an error is harmless if the \u201crecord contains sufficient independent evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006). We give \u201cconsiderable weight to the district court\u2019s assessment of the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks and conduct.\u201d <em>Cordoba-Mosquera, </em>212 F.3d at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Here, there is no evidence that the prosecutor \u201cmanifestly intended\u201d to comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. However, considering the context of the entire trial, and the fact that the comment occurred during closing argument, there is a significant risk that the comment was \u201cof such a character that a jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u201d <em>Knowles, </em>66 F.3d at 1162-63. The comment occured at the conclusion of the trial, during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. At that critical stage in the proceedings, the jury was in the process of evaluating the evidence against the defendant, and such a comment clearly highlights the fact that the defendant has not taken the stand. Any lingering doubt about the defendant\u2019s guilt at this stage is highly susceptible to influence by a prosecutor\u2019s closing statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Even if the comment violated Bar-reto\u2019s constitutional rights, however, such violations are analyzed in terms of whether \u201con the whole record before us, the error ... was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 510, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983). Here, the jury was presented with testimony of <em>four </em>co-conspirators, all of whom testified that at least one shipment of drugs was taken to Barreto\u2019s house and several who indicated that Bar-reto was a heroin dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Finally, a prejudicial remark may also be rendered harmless by curative instructions to the jury. <em>United States v. Smith, 918 F.2d </em>1551, 1562 (11th Cir.1990) (stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>ing \u201c[b]eeause statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence, improper statements can be rectified by the district court\u2019s instruction to the jury that only evidence in the case be considered\u201d). The district court gave a proper curative instruction to the jury by stating that the comments of attorneys was not evidence and that the jury should not consider a defendant\u2019s choice not to testify. We presume that a jury follows a district court\u2019s instructions. <em>United States v. McGarity, </em>669 F.3d 1218, 1242 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that prosecutor eliciting testimony regarding defendant\u2019s failure to testify was harmless error and was \u201coverridden by both the overwhelming evidence of the defendants\u2019 guilt, and by the court\u2019s subsequent jury instructions\u201d). The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant Barreto\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Barreto next argues that his total sentence of 235 months, at the low end of the guideline range, is substantively unreasonable. He argues that he is entitled to a downward variance from the Guidelines range. Specifically he contends that the district court did not fully consider the age and nature of Barreto\u2019s prior convictions or his medical history. Barreto argues that his past convictions for gambling unreasonably raised his criminal history score to a category III. Instead, he claims that his criminal history score should have been a category I, resulting in total sentence of 188 to 210 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guideline range, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008). This review is deferential, requiring that we determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in the statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). We may \u201cset aside a sentence only if we determine, after giving a full measure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Barreto\u2019s sentence is proeedurally reasonable because the sentencing court properly calculated the guideline range,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> treated the guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and explained the reason it imposed a sentence within the guideline range. Barreto\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable. The court\u2019s total sentence of 235 months was well below the statutory maximum sentence of life and within the Guideline range. The sentencing court properly considered Barre-to\u2019s argument that he should receive a variance based on his medical history and rejected it. Additionally, it was not error for the district court to not mention Barre-to\u2019s prior convictions when he explained the sentence because Barreto did not raise the issue. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 53-54, 128 S.Ct. at 599 (discussing that where a party fails to raise a specific issue, it is \u201cnot incumbent on the District Judge to raise every conceivably relevant issue on his own initiative\u201d). Accordingly, Barreto\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\">. Barreto contends that his two convictions for gambling should not have been included in the Guidelines calculations. However, both of the convictions occurred less than fifteen years ago and therefore were properly included. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4A1.2(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
