Wilson alleging that Stotts had falsely accused him of paying another inmate for legal assistance; prison officials locked up the other inmate, because such payments are against prison policy; this prohibited Wilson from having any contact with the inmate at a critical time during his correspondence with the Innocence Project; after Wilson filed a grievance, Stotts harassed him when he used the law library by telling him not to talk loudly and ordering him to sign in; Wilson avoided using the library because of this harassment; and his case against Stotts was about retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">For the reasons assigned in the magistrate judge\u2019s report as well as in its own order, the district court dismissed the action as frivolous and for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). The court denied Wilson leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Wilson moves this court for leave to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The motion constitutes a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhen the prisoner opts to challenge the certification decision, the motion must be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Neither Wilson\u2019s IFP application nor his supporting brief addresses the certification decision in any meaningful way. He asserts only that the decision was wrong and that retaliation continues in prison, but he never specifically addresses whether he is the target of the alleged retaliation. Because Wilson has failed to challenge the reasons for decision or to show that the appeal raises a nonfrivolous issue, the IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See id. </em>at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">The dismissal of Wilson\u2019s appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Wilson is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tk Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
