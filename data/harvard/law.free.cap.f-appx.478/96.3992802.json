Smith, Texas prisoner #855314, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213, as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Smith argues that the district court violated his due process rights by ignoring evidence showing that he was entitled to relief. He briefly argues the facts of his claims, and he states that the record speaks for itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The district court dismissed Smith\u2019s complaint because it found that his claims for monetary damages and declaratory relief were barred by the Eleventh Amendment and his claim for injunctive relief was moot. By failing to discuss or even mention the district court\u2019s rationales for dismissing his complaint, Smith has waived any challenge to the dismissal of his complaint. See <em>Brinkmann </em>v. <em>Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Smith\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. See <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2. Smith\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Santana v. Chandler, </em>961 F.2d 514, 515-16 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Both this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s complaint count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). During the pendency of this appeal, this court imposed the \u00a7 1915(g) bar against Smith. <em>See Smith v. Hullum, </em>442 Fed.Appx. 972, 972 (5th Cir.2011). Smith is admonished that he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g). Smith is also warned that filing further frivolous matters will subject him to sanctions in addition to those that are already in place. He is instructed to review any pending matters and move to dismiss any that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR REMAINS IN EFFECT; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b123-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
