On appeal, Moore argues that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) did not include all of Moore\u2019s limitations. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AzD\">A. Five-Step Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b649-25\">In determining whether a claimant has proven that she is disabled, the ALJ must complete a five-step sequential evaluation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number><em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). The claimant has the burden to prove that (1) she \u201chas not engaged in substantial gainful activity,\u201d (2) she \u201chas a severe impairment or combination of impairments,\u201d and (3) her \u201cimpairment or combination of impairments meets or equals a listed impairment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">If the claimant\u2019s impairments do not meet or equal a listed impairment, the <em>ALJ </em>proceeds to step four and assesses \u201cthe claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u2018RFC\u2019)\u201d and \u201cability to return to her past relevant work.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[T]he regulations define RFC as that which an individual is still able to do despite the limitations caused by his or her impairments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)). Finally, at the fifth step, the burden shifts to the ALJ to determine if there is other work available in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant can perform. <em>Id. </em>at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">B. ALJ\u2019s Findings</p>\n<p id=\"AW5\">In Moore\u2019s case, the ALJ determined that Moore (1) had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since February 26, 2004, (2) has the severe impairments of degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine and right knee pain, and (3) did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or equals one of the impairments listed in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">At step four, the ALJ reviewed Moore\u2019s medical history, which included the medical reports of Dr. Ladapo Shyngle, a consulting physician. Dr. Shyngle opined, <em>inter alia, </em>that Moore (1) \u201ccould lift 10 pounds, sit 6 hours in an 8 hour workday, stand 2 hours in an 8 hour workday and walk 1 hour in an 8 hour workday,\u201d and (2) \u201cneeded a cane to ambulate and without the use of a cane could only walk 250 feet.\u201d In the RFC finding, the ALJ determined, \u201c[a]fter careful consideration of the entire record, ... that [Moore] has the residual functional capacity to perform light work activity with an occasional limitation for bending, stooping, crouching and kneeling, but capable of performing routine, predictable tasks in an atmosphere that allows for a sit/stand option.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on the RFC finding, the ALJ determined that Moore could not perform her past relevant work as a housekeeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">At step five, the ALJ asked a VE the hypothetical question whether any jobs exist for an individual \u201cthe same age, education and work experience as the claimant [and who] has the following residual functional capacity[:] capable of light work, with an occasional limitation from bending, stooping, crouching, kneeling, but capable of performing routine, predictable tasks in an atmosphere that allows for a sit/stand option.\u201d The VE opined that such an individual could perform jobs in small-products assembly, wrapping and packing, and merchandise marking. Moore\u2019s counsel cross-examined the VE and asked whether any jobs would exist for an individual with all of the above limitations and with the additional limitation that she would need to miss at least two days of work per month. The VE responded that no jobs would remain. Moore\u2019s counsel did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ask about any limitations on the claimant\u2019s ability to walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Based on the VE\u2019s testimony, the ALJ determined that Moore could perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy and was therefore not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">On appeal, Moore argues that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question was incomplete because it did not expressly include the limitation that Moore was unable to walk on uneven ground at a reasonable pace and could walk only 250 feet without a cane.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">At step five of the evaluation process, the ALJ determines whether a claimant has the ability to adjust to other work in the national economy by applying the Medical Vocational Guidelines or by obtaining a VE\u2019s testimony. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1239-40. \u201cIn order for a VE\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Apfel, </em>190 F.3d at 1229. In other words, if the hypothetical question posed by the ALJ does not comprehensively describe the claimant\u2019s impairments, the ALJ\u2019s denial of DIB, if based significantly on the VE\u2019s testimony, is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Pendley v. Heckler, </em>767 F.2d 1561, 1562-63 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question accounted for all of the limitations stemming from Moore\u2019s impairments. The ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question limited the available jobs to those that required \u201cperforming routine, predictable tasks in an atmosphere that allows for a sit/stand option.\u201d Although the ALJ did not expressly include the conditions that Moore could not walk on uneven ground and could walk only 250 feet without a cane, the \u201csiVstand option\u201d expressly limited the available jobs to those permitting constant access to a chair. <em>See Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1180 (11th Cir.2011) (noting that \u201chypothetical questions adequately account for a claimant\u2019s limitations ... when the questions otherwise implicitly account for [the] limitations.\u201d). Because the hypothetical question comprehensively described Moore\u2019s impairments, the VE\u2019s testimony constituted substantial evidence. <em>See Pendley, </em>767 F.2d at 1562-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-16\">. We review the ALJ\u2019s decision \"to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of </em>Soc. Sec., 363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation mark omitted). \"Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\" <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">. To the extent Moore argues that the ALJ erred in the RFC assessment by substituting his own opinion for Dr. Shyngle\u2019s opinion as to limitations on Moore\u2019s ability to reach, Moore\u2019s argument lacks merit because the ALJ rejected that aspect of Dr. Shyngle's assessment on the ground that Dr. Shyngle's own notes did not support such a restrictive limitation. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(4) (\"Generally, the more consistent an opinion is with the record as a whole, the more weight we will give to that opinion.\u201d). Moore also abandoned this argument by failing to raise it in the district court. <em>See Stewart v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>26 F.3d 115, 115 (11th Cir.1994) (\"As a general principle, this court will not address an argument that has not been raised in the district court.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\">. To the extent Moore argues that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical to the VE failed to include limitations on her ability to reach and to crawl, we decline to address these arguments because Moore failed to raise them in the district court and because she abandoned them by mentioning them in her brief only in passing. <em>See Stewart, 26 </em>F.3d at 115 (refusing to address an argument not raised in the district court); <em>Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998) (refusing to reach an issue mentioned only in passing in the brief filed by counsel because the issue had no supporting argument or discussion).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
