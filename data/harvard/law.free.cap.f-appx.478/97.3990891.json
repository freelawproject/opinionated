He also asserted an equal protection violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">Smith\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A); <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). However, the notice of appeal was timely to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for reconsideration, in which he argued that Mississippi\u2019s parole statute creates a liberty interest protected under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">\u201c[T]he denial of a Rule 60(b) motion does not bring up the underlying judgment for review.\u201d <em>Matter of Ta Chi Navigation (Panama) Corp. S.A., </em>728 F.2d 699, 703 (5th Cir.1984). Therefore, this court\u2019s review \u201cis limited to whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying the Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d <em>Id.; Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enterprises, Inc., </em>38 F.3d 1404, 1408 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cIt is not enough that the granting of relief might have been permissible, or even warranted \u2014 denial must have been so <em>unwarranted </em>as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-17\">Smith reurges his argument that the Mississippi parole statute creates a liberty interest protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and that he was denied due process in the Board\u2019s proceedings leading to denial of parole. He also asserts an equal protection argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-18\">A prisoner\u2019s liberty interest in parole is defined by state statute. <em>See Board of Pardons v. Allen, </em>482 U.S. 369, 371, 107 S.Ct. 2415, 96 L.Ed.2d 303 (1987). In Mississippi, the statutes creating parole confer absolute discretion on the Parole Board. <em>See </em>Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 47-7-3, 47-7-17; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>Scales v. Mississippi State Parole Bd., </em>831 F.2d 565, 565-66 (5th Cir.1987). The Mississippi statutes do not create a liberty interest, and federal due process rights are not implicated by the denial of parole and the procedures by which parole is denied. <em>See </em>Miss.Code ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 47-7-3, 47-7-17; <em>Scales, </em>831 F.2d at 565-66; <em>Irving v. Thigpen, </em>732 F.2d 1215, 1216 (5th Cir.1984). Smith\u2019s challenges to the Board\u2019s procedures and its decision are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Smith argues that his equal protection rights were violated when the Board revoked his classification status without affording him the same kind of hearing allegedly given to other participants. Smith did not raise his equal protection claim in his Rule 60(b) motion, and the district court\u2019s rejection of that claim is thus not part of the instant appeal. <em>See Matter of Ta Chi Navigation (Panama) Corp. S.A., </em>728 F.2d 699, 703 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b124-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the' limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
