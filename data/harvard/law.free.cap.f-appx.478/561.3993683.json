BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b587-24\">A. 2003 to 2006 Removal Proceedings Before IJ</p>\n<p id=\"b587-25\">In September 2002, Morales, a citizen of Colombia, entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor with authorization to remain until October 27, 2002. Morales overstayed his visa.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-26\">In September 2003, Morales filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Morales\u2019s ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>plication alleged past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) based on his political opinion. Specifically, Morales claimed that, because of his involvement with the Liberal Party and his social activism, FARC members had threatened him; shot at his car, wounding him in the leg; and then tracked him down in another town and sent him a \u201ccondolence\u201d note threatening to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">In December 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging Morales with removability, pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). Morales admitted the allegations in the NTA and conceded removability. After a 2006 merits hearing on Morales\u2019s application for asylum, withholding or removal and CAT relief, the IJ denied all requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">B.2007 BIA Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">On August 24, 2007, the BIA disagreed with the IJ and concluded Morales was entitled to asylum. The BIA determined that Morales had demonstrated past persecution and DHS had not rebutted the presumption of future persecution. The BIA remanded the case to the IJ to allow DHS the opportunity \u201cto complete or update identity, law enforcement or security investigations or examinations, and further proceedings, if necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.47(h).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">C. 2007 Remand Proceedings Before IJ</p>\n<p id=\"A7H\">On September 25, 2007, the immigration court sent notice of a hearing set for November 14, 2007 to Morales\u2019s attorney of record. At the November 14, 2007 hearing, Morales\u2019s attorney attended, but Morales did not appear. Morales\u2019s attorney advised the IJ that he was unable to locate Morales. The IJ found that Morales\u2019s failure to appear constituted abandonment of his application for relief. On the same date, the IJ denied Morales\u2019s application for lack of prosecution and entered an <em>in absentia </em>order of removal. Neither Morales nor his counsel filed a petition for review of this final removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">D. First Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">On August 22, 2008, approximately nine months after his final removal order was entered, Morales filed his first motion to reopen his removal proceedings. Morales alleged he never received notice of the November 14, 2007 hearing because the court notice to him was sent to his former address and he had since moved. Morales admitted, however, that he had not notified his attorney of his new address and telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">On June 29, 2009, the IJ denied Morales\u2019s first motion to reopen. The IJ explained that when an alien is represented by counsel, the alien is deemed to have received proper notice if it is sent to his counsel of record. Morales\u2019s attorney had attended the November 14, 2007 hearing, demonstrating that his attorney received notice of the hearing. Furthermore, Morales had not notified his counsel or the immigration court of his change of address and had not shown \u201cdue diligence in seek<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ing to redress the situation.\u201d Morales did not appeal the IJ\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">E. Second Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">On May 28, 2010, Morales filed a second motion to reopen his removal proceedings but this time Morales\u2019s motion was based on \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d in Colombia. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(e)(7)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). This time, Morales asserted that he had new evidence demonstrating that he was \u201cstill a target\u201d of the FARC and that his \u201cenemies are still looking for him.\u201d Morales argued that the political situation in Colombia had deteriorated \u201c[d]uring the pendency of these proceedings.\u201d Specifically, Morales stated that President Uribe has successfully eradicated FARC leadership, and the absence of a central command has made FARC guerrillas more violent. Moreover, Morales claimed, President Uribe\u2019s term was about to end, and the FARC believed the next president \u201cwould not follow Ur-ibe\u2019s security policies,\u201d which would allow the FARC to regain supremacy. Morales contended that, to that end, the FARC was more determined than ever to maintain its position as the most powerful terrorist group in Colombia, to \u201ceradicate all who oppose[ ] ... their political agenda\u201d and to overthrow Colombia\u2019s democratically elected government.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Morales submitted three affidavits that described two 2010 incidents in Colombia involving men who knew Morales in 2002 through the Liberal Party. In the first incident, on January 6, 2010, two men associated with the FARC attacked Luis Alfonso Marin Bedoya in Bogota, and demanded to know where Morales was. When Luis told the men that Morales was in the United States, the men accused Luis of lying, beat him, held a gun to his head, and threatened to kill him. Later, Luis received threatening phone calls and was forced to leave the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">During a second incident, on February 5, 2010, three men confronted Carlos Arturo Gomez Barragan in Bogota and threatened to kill him if he did not tell them where Morales was. After searching Bar-ragan\u2019s house, the men told Barragan to tell Morales that the \u201cFARC is looking for him, and we won\u2019t rest until we find him\u201d and that Morales would \u201chave to face the consequences, otherwise others will pay for what he did against FARC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">The IJ denied the second motion to reopen. The IJ acknowledged Morales\u2019s three affidavits indicating that the FARC \u201ccontinuefd] to pursue\u201d Morales. The IJ determined, however, that Morales\u2019s evidence did not \u201cshow any <em>\u2018change\u2019 </em>in the country conditions of Colombia\u201d and thus his second motion to reopen was time-barred and number-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">The BIA dismissed Morales\u2019s appeal. The BIA also noted Morales\u2019s \u201cthree affidavits from men in Colombia who know the respondent, two of whom were threatened or beaten by the FARC.\u201d The BIA found that Morales had not \u201cpresented sufficient facts or evidence to establish that his motion falls within the \u2018changed circumstances\u2019 exception to the time limitation for motions to reopen set forth at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).\u201d The BIA agreed with the IJ that Morales\u2019s second motion to reopen was also number-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">An alien may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and the motion must \u201cstate the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(A), (B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B). Generally, the motion must be filed within ninety days of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>BIA\u2019s final removal order. INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), 1008.23(b)(1), (3). However, the time and number limits do not apply if the movant can show \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) &amp; (3)(ii), 1003.23(b)(4)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Because motions to reopen removal proceedings are disfavored, the movant bears a \u201cheavy burden.\u201d <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009). To succeed on a motion to reopen based on changed country conditions, the movant must show that there is new evidence that was material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the removal hearing. INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), 1003.23(b)(3); <em>see also Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). To be \u201cmaterial,\u201d the evidence must be the kind that, if the proceedings were reopened, \u201cwould likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Here, Morales does not dispute that this is his second motion to reopen and that it was filed more than ninety days after his final removal order. Indeed, it was filed in May 2010, over two and a half years after his final removal order was entered. Thus, the only issue on appeal is whether Morales\u2019s second motion to reopen presented new and material evidence of changed country conditions to overcome the time and numerical bars.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">Morales failed to satisfy his heavy burden to establish changed country conditions in Colombia. The only evidence Morales submitted was the three affidavits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These affidavits showed that the FARC continues to threaten Morales. The affidavits did not show that since Morales\u2019s 2006 removal hearing the FARC has escalated its efforts to target Liberal Party members such as Morales. <em>Cf. Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1258 (explaining that evidence of \u201crecent increased enforcement\u201d of the one-child policy in alien\u2019s hometown in China showed changed country conditions). Although Morales maintained that the political situation in Colombia was deteriorating and that the FARC had recently become more violent, he did not submit any evidence to support this claim. In short, Morales\u2019s evidence showed only that he still faces the same threat he faced during his removal hearing, which is not a \u201cchange.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">Morales complains that the BIA found in 2007 that the threat Morales faced in 2006 constituted persecution and, therefore, his new evidence that the threat continues established that he is prima facie eligible for asylum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The BIA\u2019s previous decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>did not relieve Morales of the requirement to show changed country conditions in his second motion to reopen filed over two and a half years after his final removal order. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that the failure to establish a prima facie case and the failure to introduce material and previously unavailable evidence are \u201cindependent grounds\u201d for denying a motion to reopen). Moreover, despite the BIA\u2019s 2007 decision, Morales\u2019s application for relief was denied for lack of prosecution, not on the merits. Therefore, Morales\u2019s evidence that is merely cumulative of his original, abandoned persecution claims would not change the result in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Finally, we reject Morales\u2019s contention that the IJ failed to consider all of Morales\u2019s evidence and to explain adequately his decision to deny the motion to reopen. Neither the IJ nor the BIA is required to address each piece of evidence individually, so long as they considered the issues raised in the motion and announced their decisions in a way that demonstrates they \u201cheard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010)(quotation marks omitted); <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006). Here, both the IJ and the BIA acknowledged Morales\u2019s three affidavits and concluded that this evidence did not show changed country conditions, which was sufficient to allow for appellate review of their decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">For all these reasons, we cannot say that the IJ and the BIA abused their discretion in denying Morales\u2019s second motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-16\">. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Under this standard, our review is \"limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\" <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005)(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\">. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.47(h), upon remand from the BIA, the IJ must \"consider the results of the identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or examinations\u201d and \"[i]f new information is presented,\u201d the IJ \u201cmay hold a further hearing if necessary\u201d before entering \"an order granting or denying the immigration relief sought.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.47(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b590-12\">. We are unpersuaded by Morales\u2019s argument that the BIA's 2007 determination that Morales was eligible for asylum is itself evidence of changed country conditions. The BIA's 2007 determination was based on evidence Morales submitted at or before his initial 2006 removal hearing rather than on any new evidence. Thus, the BIA\u2019s 2007 determination does not support his second motion to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b590-17\">. Morales also argues that, because the BIA determined in 2007 that he was entitled to asylum, the withholding of removal statute, INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), bars his removal to Colombia. To the extent Morales moved to reopen so he could reapply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>for withholding of removal, the time and numerical limits still applied unless he could show changed country conditions, which he did not. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) (stating there is no time limit on a motion to reopen \"if the basis of the motion is to apply for relief under sections 1158 or 1231(b)(3) ... and is based on changed country conditions.\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (stating the time and numerical limits do not apply to motions to reopen filed with the BIA \"[t]o apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of removal\u201d and based on changed country conditions); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(i) (same as to motions to reopen filed with the IJ).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
