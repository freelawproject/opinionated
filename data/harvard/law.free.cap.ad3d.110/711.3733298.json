Rivera, J.), dated January 25, 2013, which denied their motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d) as a result of the subject accident.</p><p id=\"b653-7\">Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.</p><p id=\"b653-8\">The defendants met their prima facie burden of showing that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d) as a result of the subject accident <em>(see Toure v Avis Rent A Car Sys., </em>98 NY2d 345 [2002]; <em>Gaddy v Eyler, </em>79 NY2d 955, 956-957 [1992]). The defendants submitted competent medical evidence establishing, prima facie, that the alleged injuries to the plaintiffs left shoulder and to the cervical and lumbar regions of his spine, did not constitute serious injuries under either the permanent consequential limitation of use or significant limitation of use categories of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d) <em>(see Staff v Yshua, </em>59 AD3d 614 [2009]).</p><p id=\"b653-9\">In opposition, however, the plaintiff raised a triable issue of fact as to whether he sustained a serious injury to his left shoulder <em>(see Perl v Meher, </em>18 NY3d 208, 218-219 [2011]). Thus, the Supreme Court properly denied the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. Skelos, J.P., Dickerson, Lott and Austin, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
