Westchester County Department of Social Services, Respondent; Tenika C., Appellant. (Proceeding No. 1.) In the Matter of Drayvon C. Westchester County Department of Social Services, Respondent; Tenika <em>C., </em>Appellant. (Proceeding No. 2.) In the Matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>Anaiyah C. Westchester County Department of Social Services, Respondent; Tenika C., Appellant. (Proceeding No. 3.)</p><p id=\"b1031-5\">In related child protective proceedings pursuant to Family Court Act article 10, the mother appeals, as limited by her brief, from so much of an order of fact-finding and disposition of the Family Court, Westchester County (Davidson, J.), dated November 28, 2011, as, after a hearing, found that she had neglected the subject children and continued the children\u2019s placement in foster care.</p><p id=\"b1031-6\">Ordered that the order of fact-finding and disposition is affirmed insofar as appealed from, without costs or disbursements.</p><p id=\"b1031-7\">Contrary to the mother\u2019s contention, the Family Court\u2019s finding of neglect is supported by a preponderance of the evidence <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7\u00a7 1012 [f] [i] [B]; 1046 [a] [hi]; [b] [i]). While only one positive drug test result was referenced in the testimony at the fact-finding hearing, other evidence was adduced of the mother\u2019s repeated misuse of drugs without regular participation in a rehabilitative program. This evidence established a prima facie case of neglect and, therefore, neither actual impairment of the children\u2019s physical, mental, or emotional conditions, nor specific risk of impairment, needed to be established <em>(see Matter of Audrey K. [Erik K.], </em>108 AD3d 717 [2013]; <em>Matter of Sadiq H. [Karl H.], </em>81 AD3d 647 [2011]; <em>Matter of Paolo W., </em>56 AD3d 966 [2008]).</p><p id=\"b1031-8\">The mother\u2019s claim that she was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel is without merit. Viewed in totality, the record shows that she received meaningful representation <em>(see Matter of Dylan Me. [Michelle M. Me.], </em>105 AD3d 1049 [2013]; <em>Matter of Christiana C. [Carleton C.], </em>86 AD3d 606 <em>[2011]).</em></p><p id=\"b1031-9\">The mother\u2019s remaining contention is without merit. Dillon, J.P., Dickerson, Cohen and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
