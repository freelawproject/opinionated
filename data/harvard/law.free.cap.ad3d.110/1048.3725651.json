Ltd., </em>68 AD3d 576, 577 [2009]; <em>Hospital for Joint Diseases v ELRAC, Inc., </em>11 AD3d 432, 433 [2004]), established the admissibility of the documents appended to the affidavit as business records <em>(see </em>CPLR 4518; <em>Burrell v Barreiro, </em>83 AD3d 984, 985 [2011]; <em>DeLeon v Port Auth. of N.Y. &amp; N.J., </em>306 AD2d 146 [2003]), and demonstrated the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of liability against Hayavi pursuant to the personal guaranty that he executed <em>(see Inland Mtge. Capital Corp. v Realty Equities NM, LLC, </em>71 AD3d 1089, 1090 [2010]; <em>Bank of Am., N.A. v Solow, </em>59 AD3d 304 [2009]; <em>Provident Bank v Giannasca, </em>55 AD3d 812 [2008]).</p><p id=\"b990-9\">Hayavi\u2019s proffered defense regarding the plaintiffs authority to transact business at the time it entered into the subject agreements was validly waived by the express terms of the personal guaranty <em>(see Inland Mtge. Capital Corp. v Realty Equities NM, LLC, </em>71 AD3d at 1090; <em>North Fork Bank v Computerized Quality Separation Corp., </em>62 AD3d 973, 974 [2009]; <em>Red Tulip, LLC v Neiva, </em>44 AD3d 204, 209 [2007]). In any event, the plaintiffs motion papers demonstrated, prima facie, that this defense was without merit, and Hayavi failed to raise a triable issue of fact in opposition thereto <em>(see generally Zuckerman v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d 557, 563 [1980]).
