Defendant challenges the evidence supporting the unlawful entry element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>of burglary. However, the evidence amply supported the conclusion that defendant knew he had been barred from entering the premises. There is no basis for disturbing the jury\u2019s credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Since defendant did not ask for any further relief after the court sustained his objection, he did not preserve his claim that certain testimony went beyond the scope of the court\u2019s <em>Molineux </em>ruling <em>(see People v </em>Molineux, 168 NY 264 [1901]), and we decline to review it in the interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we find that the court\u2019s curative action was sufficient, and that the testimony was not unduly prejudicial in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We perceive no basis for reducing the sentence. Concur\u2014 Tom, J.P., Sweeny, Manzanet-Daniels, Feinman and Clark, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
