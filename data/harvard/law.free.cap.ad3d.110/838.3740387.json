The defendants submitted competent medical evidence establishing, prima facie, that the alleged injuries to the cervical and lumbar regions of the plaintiff\u2019s spine were not caused by the subject accident <em>(see Jilani v Palmer, </em>83 AD3d 786, 787 [2011]), and did not constitute serious injuries under either the permanent consequential limitation of use or significant limitation of use categories of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d) <em>(see Staff v Yshua, </em>59 AD3d 614 [2009]).</p><p id=\"b781-7\">In opposition, however, the plaintiff raised a triable issue of fact as to whether he sustained serious injuries to the cervical and lumbar regions of his spine that were caused by the accident (see <em>Perl v Meher, </em>18 NY3d 208, 215-218 [2011]). Therefore, the Supreme Court properly denied the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d) as a result of the subject accident. Mastro, J.P., Balkin, Sgroi and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
