Pursuant to the plea terms, the People agreed not to pursue certain additional charges against defendant and County Court committed to a prison sentence of 10 years followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant was sentenced as agreed and he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">Initially, the record does not reflect that defendant preserved his challenge to the voluntariness and factual sufficiency of his plea by making a motion to withdraw his plea or vacate the judgment of conviction <em>(see People v Borden, </em>91 AD3d 1124, 1125 [2012], <em>lv denied </em>19 NY3d 862 [2012]; <em>People v Davis, </em>84 AD3d 1645, 1645 [2011], <em>lv denied </em>17 NY3d 815 [2011]). Moreover, the narrow exception to the preservation requirement was not triggered here, as defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy that were inconsistent with his guilt or otherwise called into question the voluntariness- of his plea <em>(see People v Teele, </em>92 AD3d 972, 972 [2012]; <em>People v Davis, </em>84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>AD3d at 1646). Defendant\u2019s related claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel is likewise unpreserved for our review and, in any event, the record does not support this claim (see <em>People v Borden, </em>91 AD3d at 1125-1126; <em>People v Gomez, </em>72 AD3d 1337, 1338 [2010]). Finally, defendant\u2019s contention that his agreed-upon sentence was harsh and excessive is unpersuasive given his criminal history and the violent nature of his conduct, which was witnessed by his children (see <em>People v Jackson, </em>67 AD3d 1067, 1069 [2009], <em>lv denied </em>14 NY3d 801 [2010]; <em>People v Milstead, </em>61 AD3d 1179, 1179 [2009]). Likewise lacking in merit is his claim that fees and surcharges were improperly imposed (see <em>People v Hoti, </em>12 NY3d 742, 743 [2009]; <em>People v Overton, </em>105 AD3d 1072, 1073 [2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-3\">Lahtinen, J.P., Stein and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
