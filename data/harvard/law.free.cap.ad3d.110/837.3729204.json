Matter of Johnson v Martins, </em>79 AD3d 913, 920-921 [2010], <em>affd </em>15 NY3d 584 [2010]). Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly directed that the absentee ballot be permitted to be cast and that the Rockland County Board of Elections canvass that absentee ballot <em>(see </em>Election Law \u00a7 16-106 [1]).</p><p id=\"b780-6\">The parties\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit. Rivera, J.P., Skelos, Chambers and Hall, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
