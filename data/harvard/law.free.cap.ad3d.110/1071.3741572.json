On December 5, 2003, he allegedly sustained an on-the-job injury. The petitioner was awarded salary benefits pursuant to General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a (1) based on this incident. Thereafter, the petitioner applied for supplemental income benefits pursuant to General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a (2). The City denied the application.</p><p id=\"b1014-5\">The petitioner appealed the denial of his application and requested a hearing. The hearing officer credited the testimony of the City\u2019s expert, Dr. Warren Silverman, who opined that the pain experienced by the petitioner in his neck was not caused by the work-related injury, and that the pain he experienced in his back might have been caused by the incident, but that, in any event, the petitioner was not fully disabled because Silver-man believed the petitioner could still perform restricted duties. The City accepted the recommendation and upheld the determination denying benefits under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a (2). The petitioner commenced this proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 to review the City\u2019s denial of benefits.</p><p id=\"b1014-6\">Judicial review of an administrative determination made after a hearing required by law at which evidence is taken is limited to whether the determination is supported by substantial evidence <em>(see </em>CPLR 7803 [4]; <em>300 Gramatan Ave. Assoc. v State Div. of Human Rights, </em>45 NY2d 176 [1978]; <em>Matter of Solano v City of Mount Vernon, </em>108 AD3d 676, 676-677 [2013]). Here, the hearing officer\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence <em>(see Matter of Ridge Rd. Fire Dist. v Schiano, </em>16 NY3d 494, 499 [2011]; <em>300 Gramatan Ave. Assoc. v State Div. of Human Rights, </em>45 NY2d at 180-181; <em>Matter of Solano v City of Mount Vernon, </em>108 AD3d at 677; <em>Matter of Refino v City of Mount Vernon, </em>104 AD3d 693 [2013]; <em>Matter of Davenport v City of Mount Vernon, </em>96 AD3d 838, 838-839 [2012]). Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s assertions, the testimony of the respondents\u2019 expert was consistent and supported by the medical evidence, and the hearing officer was free to credit the testimony and report of that expert over any conflicting doctors\u2019 opinions contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>the petitioner\u2019s medical records <em>(see Matter of Solano v City of Mount Vernon, </em>108 AD3d at 677; <em>Matter of Refino v City of Mount Vernon, </em>104 AD3d at 693; <em>Matter of Miserendino v City of Mount Vernon, </em>96 AD3d 946, 947 [2012]; <em>Matter of Davenport v City of Mount Vernon, </em>96 AD3d at 839).</p><p id=\"b1015-3\">The petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions are either without merit or based on matter dehors the administrative record. Skelos, J.P., Cohen, Miller and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
