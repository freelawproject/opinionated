The plaintiff established its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law by submitting the subject contracts, sample advertisements, and proof of the defendants\u2019 failure to submit payment in the required amount <em>(see </em>CPLR 3212 [b]). In opposition, the defendants failed to raise a triable issue of fact <em>(see Elisa Dreier Reporting Corp. v Global NAPs Networks, Inc., </em>84 AD3d 122, 127 [2011]; <em>see also Dunkin\u2019 Donuts of Am. v Liberatore, </em>138 AD2d 559, 560 [1988]). Moreover, the defendants could not avoid summary judgment based on their claimed need for discovery, as they did not offer an evidentiary basis to suggest that discovery might lead to relevant evidence or that facts essential to opposing the motion were exclusively within the plaintiffs knowledge and control <em>(see </em>CPLR 3212 [f]; <em>Seidman v Industrial Recycling Props., Inc., </em>106 AD3d 983, 985 [2013]).</p><p id=\"b1003-6\">The defendants\u2019 remaining contention is without merit. Mastro, J.P., Leventhal, Lott and Roman, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
