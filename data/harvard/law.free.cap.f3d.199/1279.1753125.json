Jackson argues that he was improperly sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because one of the prior convictions relied upon by the district court in determining Jackson\u2019s career offender status was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the definition provided by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Our de novo review of the district court\u2019s legal interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines reveals no reversible error. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>139 F.3d 1390, 1392 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-14\">At sentencing, Jackson objected to the inclusion of Jackson\u2019s prior conviction for possession of a fire bomb, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 806.111, as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The district court overruled the objection, concluding that because the offense consisted of possession plus the intent that the fire bomb be willfully and unlawfully used to damage a structure or property by fire or explosion, the crime entailed \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d within the definition of a crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-15\">On appeal, Jackson argues that the offense is not a crime of violence because it did not involve any threat to another person and because the district court improperly assumed that any structure or property intended to be damaged under the statute would be in proximity to anyone so as to endanger another person. The Government responds that an analysis of the statute\u2019s elements supports the district court\u2019s conclusion and that Jackson\u2019s conviction for possession of a fire bomb is analogous to other offenses considered to be crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-16\">The Government has the better argument. A person who intends to damage a structure or property by fire <em>or </em>explosion clearly participates in conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to others. Even assuming that the structure or property which is the target of a fire bomb is unoccupied, the fire or explosion creates a danger to others. At a minimum, the fire fighters who are called to put out a fire or deal with the aftermath of an explosion face a serious risk of physical injury. In addition, bystanders could be injured, and the fire could spread to occupied structures, endangering the persons in those structures. Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) specifically lists arson as a crime of violence. Jackson\u2019s contested offense appears to be nothing more than a subcategory of arson that presents at least the same potential risk of physical injury to another person as arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\">We conclude that the possession of a fire bomb with the intent to use it to willfully damage any structure or property by fire or explosion, as defined by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 806.111, is inherently conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another person. Accordingly, the district court properly concluded that Jackson\u2019s conviction for possession of a fire bomb under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 806.111 was a crime of violence for career-offender purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
