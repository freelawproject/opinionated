Cover raises three arguments. First, he argues that he should not have received a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement for brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm during the robbery when the court sentenced him to a consecutive 60-month sentence for possessing a firearm. Second, he argues that he should not have received U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(A), (b)(5) enhancements for a carjacking and kidnap-ing by an unidentified co-conspirator because he could not reasonably foresee these events. Third, he argues that he should not have received a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(C) enhancement for the unknown quantity of money that was in the bank vault at the time of the robbery. The government appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to impose a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) six-level enhancement for \u201cotherwise using\u201d a firearm during the robbery on the ground that the actions of Cover\u2019s codefendants constituted more than merely brandishing or displaying a firearm. We AFFIRM Cover\u2019s sentence on all issues other than the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement. We REVERSE Cover\u2019s sentence as to the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement and REMAND for application of the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) enhancement for otherwise use of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-19\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-20\">On December 2, 1997, Cover and two accomplices (collectively \u201cco-conspirators\u201d), armed with firearms, took control of a NationsBank (\u201cthe bank\u201d) in Miami Beach, Florida, and held captive fifteen people (customers and employees) by force and threats of violence. <em>See </em>Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. The three co-conspirators each played different roles in the robbery, with Cover forcing the tellers to empty their drawers into a bag and to open the vault, co-defendant Andre Wilson (\u201cWilson\u201d) acting as a lookout, and an unidentified accomplice guarding the victims, who were forced at gunpoint to lie on the floor. <em>See </em>PSI \u00b64. Metro-Dade Police officers, responding to a silent hold-up alarm, came to the bank, where they witnessed Cover and Wilson attempting to exit the bank through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>front door; Cover and Wilson were apprehended at the scene after they reentered the bank and exited through a side door. <em>See </em>PSI \u00b6 5. The unidentified co-conspirator escaped by carjacking and kidnaping a motorist outside the bank; the co-conspirator held the motorist at gunpoint. <em>See </em>PSI \u00b6 6. The motorist was released unharmed. <em>See </em>PSI \u00b6 10. The police recovered the car and bag of money, containing $12,740, taken by the co-conspirators. <em>See </em>PSI \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-4\">Cover pled guilty, without a plea agreement, to bank robbery (Count One) and to using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence (Count Two). <em>See </em>PSI \u00a7 1. The probation officer recommended that Cover be given an offense level of 32 for Count One, with a base level of 20, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(a); a two-level enhancement, because \u201cthe property of a financial institution was taken,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l); a five-level enhancement, because \u201ca firearm was brandished, displayed, or possessed,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C); a four-level enhancement, because a \u201cperson was abducted ... to facilitate escape,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(A); a two-level enhancement, because \u201cthe offense involved carjacking,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(5); and a two-level enhancement, because the loss was more than $50,000 but not more than $250,000, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(C); a two-level downward adjustment, for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a); and a one-level downward adjustment, for timely notification of intent to enter a plea of guilty, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b)(2). <em>See </em>PSI \u00b6\u00b6 13-25. As to Count Two, \u00a7 924(c) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(a) mandate that Cover be given a sentence of \u201cfive years consecutive to any other term of imprisonment imposed.\u201d In an addendum to the PSI, the probation officer rejected objections that Cover had made to the PSI, including his objections to the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7) enhancement for the amount of the \u201closs,\u201d and to the \u00a7\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(A) and 2B3.1(b)(5) enhancements for carjacking and kidnaping. <em>See </em>Addendum to PSI at 1-3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">At Cover\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district judge addressed two objections raised by Cover. First, the district judge rejected Cover\u2019s challenge to the enhancements for carjacking and kidnaping on the ground that \u201cit was foreseeable to [the co-conspirators] when they walked into the bank that anything could happen, including someone being abducted in order to facilitate the escape of one of them.\u201d R4r-8. Second, after hearing testimony from two bank employees regarding Cover\u2019s attempts to get employees to open the bank vault and the probable amount of money in the vault, the district judge rejected Cover\u2019s challenge to the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7) two-level enhancement and found \u201cthat the Government has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that there was at least $100,000 in the vault on the day of the robbery.\u201d R4-18. Cover never raised before the district court his claim that enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) is inappropriate where Cover was also convicted of and sentenced for violating \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">The district judge rejected the government\u2019s objection to the recommendation that Cover\u2019s offense level be enhanced by five levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1 (b)(2)(C), for brandishing or displaying a firearm. The government argued that Cover\u2019s use of his firearm amounted to more than mere brandishment or displaying and, thus, that he should have received a six-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B), for \u201cotherwise use\u201d of the firearm. R4-19. The district judge said that she was \u201cuncomfortable applying this additional one-point enhancement\u201d and that she would \u201cdecline to do so in absence of a clear explanation from the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>Commission as to what it intended.\u201d R4-25. Thus, she adopted the Probation Officer\u2019s recommendation that Cover receive a total offense level of 32 for Count One. <em>See </em>R4-25. The guideline range for Cover, with an offense level of 32 and a criminal history category of 2, is 135 to 168 months. Because of extenuating circumstances, including several letters submitted by Cover\u2019s friends and families, the district court sentenced him to 135 months and then added the concurrent sentence of 60 months for Count Two for an overall sentence of imprisonment for 195 months, followed by three years supervised release, and a $200 assessment. <em>See </em>R4-33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-3\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">In sentencing guidelines cases, we review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual findings and review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of law to those facts. See <em>United States v. Jones, </em>32 F.3d 1512, 1517 (11th Cir.1994). We review <em>for </em>plain error rulings to which there was no objection at the district court. <em>See United States v. Antonietti, </em>86 F.3d 206, 208-09 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">Because the challenges raised by Cover and the government as to the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) enhancement are related, we \u2022address Cover\u2019s other two challenges separately and then discuss the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) challenges together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">\n<em>A. Sections 2B3.1 (b)(1) (A) and 2B3.1(b)(5) enhancements for carjacking and kidnaping</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">Cover argues that his sentence should not be enhanced under \u00a7\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(A) and 2B3.1(b)(5) because it was not reasonably foreseeable that his unidentified co-conspirator would escape by carjacking and kidnaping a motorist. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B), a eo-eon-spirator\u2019s sentence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-9\">shall be determined on the basis of ... all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-13\">If the unidentified co-conspirator\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> carjacking and kidnaping of a motorist to avoid capture by the police were \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d then the enhancements were appropriate. Whether a co-conspirator\u2019s act was reasonably foreseeable is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Pessefall, </em>27 F.3d 511, 515 (11th Cir.1994). The government must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the carjacking and abduction were reasonably foreseeable. <em>See United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir.1999) (discussing \u00a7 1B3.1 in relation to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2) firearm enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-14\">We find that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the co-conspirator\u2019s carjacking and abduction of the motorist were reasonably foreseeable. As the district judge stated in the sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-15\">A person who goes into a bank robbery with firearms and with other people intending to do whatever is necessary to effect that robbery, as the three of them showed themselves to be during the robbery, ... I would say that pretty much anything that happens under those circumstances is foreseeable to the defendants, including Mr. Cover.... I think it was foreseeable to them when they walked into the bank that anything could happen, including someone being abducted in order to facilitate the escape of one of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-16\">R4-8 (finding that enhancement for abduction was proper); <em>see also id. </em>(applying same reasoning to find that enhancement for carjacking was proper). This reasoning is sound and takes into account the circumstances surrounding the carjacking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>and abduction, including the actions taken by the co-conspirators before the arrival of the police triggered the unidentified co-conspirator\u2019s escape. <em>See id. </em>Cover\u2019s argument that his co-conspirator\u2019s decision to escape the bank by carjacking and abducting a motorist was not foreseeable because Cover had brought his car to the bank to be used as the getaway car is unavailing. \u201cReasonably foreseeable\u201d has never been limited to actions that were expressly agreed to by the co-conspirators. Rather, we have looked to the rationale found in <em>Pinkerton v. United States </em>to find that an act is reasonably foreseeable if it is \u201c \u2018a necessary or natural consequence of the unlawful agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>924 F.2d 209, 210 n. 1 (11th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 648, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 1184, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946)); <em>see also Gallo, </em>195 F.3d at 1282 (noting with approval <em>Martinez\u2019s </em>discussion of the <em>Pinkerton </em>definition of \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d). The fact that the co-conspirators agreed to a plan that did not involve carjacking or abduction does not preclude the district court from finding that carjacking and abduction were reasonably foreseeable if \u201cthe original plan went awry\u201d and the police became involved. <em>United States v. Molina, </em>106 F.3d 1118, 1121-22 (2d Cir.1997) (holding that district court erred in finding that shooting was not reasonable foreseeable merely because the co-conspirators had agreed not to discharge their firearms), (\u201cEven if Molina hoped that the original plan would be carried out and that no shooting would occur, it was nonetheless reasonable for him to foresee that, in an encounter between armed robbers and aimed guards protecting an armored car, a shooting was likely to occur.\u201d). We affirm the \u00a7\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(A) and 2B3.1(b)(5) enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">\n<em>B. Section 2B3.1(b)(7)(C) enhancement for amount of money in bank vault</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">Section 2B3.1(b)(7) enhancements address the issue of amount of loss incurred by the victim (here, the bank); \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(B) applies where the amount of loss is valued at more than $10,000 and less than $50,000, while \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(C) applies where the amount of loss is valued at more than $50,000 and less than $250,-000. Here, it is undisputed that the amount of loss is more than $10,000, because the bag of money taken contained more than $12,000. Cover argues that the district court erred in including an estimated $100,000 from the bank vault in the amount of loss. Valuation of loss is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Calhoon, </em>97 F.3d 518, 530 (11th Cir.1996).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cover argues that the inclusion of any money from the bank vault was error because no money was removed from it and that, even if it were appropriate to include that money, the evidence as to the amount of money in the vault was too speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-8\">Cover\u2019s first argument has no merit. As the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 makes clear, \u201c[i]n the case of a partially completed offense ... the offense level is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 2X1.1.... \u201d Comment. (n.2) (1998); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1, comment, (n.3) (1998) (referring to commentary to \u00a7 2B1.1 for valuation of loss). Under \u00a7 2X1.1, a defendant who partially completed an offense (i.e., only seized part of the money) will be held liable for the entire offense (i.e., the entire amount of money that the defendant attempted to seize) if \u201cthe substantive offense was substantially completed or was interrupted or prevented on the verge of completion by the intercession of law enforcement authorities or the victim.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1, comment, (n.4). <em>See also Calhoon, </em>97 F.3d at 531 (finding that intended or attempted loss would be included in sentencing determination where, but for the interception of wrongdoing by an auditor, the defendant would have caused a determinate amount of losses); <em>United States v. Rosa, </em>17 F.3d 1531, 1550-51 (2d Cir.1994) (applying sentence for entire value of attempted offense where the defendants \u201chad completed all the acts they believed necessary to conclude the substantive offense\u201d and were stopped only by their arrest). The district court heard testimony showing that Cover entered the bank vault area with the two tellers who had the key and the vault\u2019s combination. <em>See </em>R4-11-12; PSI \u00b6 4 (identifying Cover as the defendant who entered the bank vault area). These two tellers were the only people needed to open the vault in order to take the funds inside. <em>See </em>R4-12. The key was about to inserted into the lock, <em>see </em>R4-12, to be followed by entry of the combination, when \u201csomeone yelled \u2018The police are here,\u2019 \u201d which caused Cover to leave the bank vault area, <em>see </em>R4-11. In light of these facts, we find that the district court did not err in finding that Cover had completed all of the necessary acts to seize the funds in the bank vault and that, but for the intervention of the police, he would have successfully seized those funds. Accordingly, it was not clear error for the district court to include the funds in the bank vault as part of the amount of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">Cover\u2019s second argument likewise fails. Under the sentencing guidelines, \u201cthe loss need not be determined with precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n.3) (1998). Amount of loss must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Kimmons, </em>965 F.2d 1001, 1011 (11th Cir.1992), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>508 U.S. 902, 113 S.Ct. 2326, 124 L.Ed.2d 239 (1993), <em>reinstated, </em>1 F.3d 1144 (11th Cir.1993). In <em>Kimmons, </em>we upheld a district court\u2019s finding that the amount of loss from an attempted robbery of an armored car amounted to approximately $500,000 based on \u201c[testimony from managers of [the] intended victim corporations [that] established that hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars were carried on the armored cars during the specific routes that the appellants had targeted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1011. Similarly, in this case, the district court heard evidence from a bank manager regarding the amount in the bank vault at the beginning of the day of the robbery and regarding the estimated cash flow of that day. <em>See </em>R4-14-15. After giving that testimony, and being admonished not to speculate, the bank manager testified that the absolute minimum that was in the bank vault at the time of the robbery, the \u201cno way it was below X number even if it was an unusual day\u201d amount, R4-15, was $100,000, <em>see </em>R4-16. Based on this testimony, the district court did not clearly err in finding that there was at least $100,000 in the bank vault at the time of the robbery. Accordingly, we affirm the application of the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(C) two-point enhancement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">C. <em>Section 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement for brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">Cover and the government both challenge the district court\u2019s decision to enhance Cover\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C). Cover argues that any enhancement pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) is inappropriate in light of his conviction and sentence for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The government argues that the district court was correct to apply a \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) enhancement but that it was incorrect to apply the five-point enhancement found in \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) for brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm instead of the six-point enhancement found in \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) for \u201cotherwise us[ing]\u201d a firearm. Because we reject Cover\u2019s argument but agree with the government, we reverse Cover\u2019s sentence as to the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement and remand to the district court for application of the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">\n<em>1. Cover\u2019s challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Because Cover\u2019s challenge to his \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) enhancement was not raised in the district court, we review it for plain error. <em>Antonietti, </em>86 F.3d at 208-09. \u201cTo find reversible error under the plain error standard, we must conclude that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>146 F.3d 1338, 1342 (11th Cir.1998). We will find error if it \u201cis clear under current law\u2019 \u201d or if \u201cthe ruling in question is clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1342-43 (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); citing <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1549, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, the sentencing provision apphcable to \u00a7 924(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-7\">Where a sentence under this section is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for the possession, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm <em>(e.g., </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A)-(F) (Robbery)) is not to be applied in respect to the guideline for the underlying offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWY\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n.2) (1998). This provision prevents \u201cdouble counting,\u201d <em>see United States v. Washington, </em>44 F.3d 1271, 1280 (5th Cir.1995), <em>i.e., </em>the application of \u201cenhancements for the defendant\u2019s possession of the weapon, [where] punishment for possession of that weapon has been meted out in the 924(c) sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>65 F.3d 932, 933 (11th Cir.1995). The language from the sentencing hearing indicates that Cover\u2019s sentence <em>was </em>enhanced for his own possession and use of the firearm already punished by the \u00a7 924(c) sentence. <em>See, e.g., </em>R4-19 (discussing the government\u2019s \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) objection and noting that the objection was based on Cover\u2019s actions in \u201cbrandishing a firearm and threatening to kill someone, as the defendant did here with Claire Langton\u201d). To the extent that Cover\u2019s sentence was enhanced solely based on his possession of and his own use of that firearm, the district court did err. <em>See United States v. Rodgers, </em>981 F.2d 497, 500-01 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-9\">However, we find that this error was harmless and, thus, did not affect Cover\u2019s substantial rights because an alternative ground exists for affirming the application of a \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) enhancement. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d 661, 670 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cTo find harmless error, we must determine that the error did not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d), (finding that error in applying upward departure based on a mere list of arrests was harmless where a correct calculation of the defendant\u2019s criminal history category would have caused the defendant to receive the same sentence); <em>see also Bonanni Ship Supply, Inc. v. United States, </em>959 F.2d 1558, 1561 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201cWe note that this court may affirm the district court where the judgment entered is correct on any legal ground regardless of the grounds addressed, adopted or rejected by the district court.\u201d). While \u00a7 2K2.4 does bar double counting, it does not bar \u201cenhancement for a <em>separate </em>weapons possession, such as that of a co-conspirator\u201d where the defendant was convicted and sentenced for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>his own possession or use of a firearm. <em>Rodriguez, </em>65 F.3d at 933 (emphasis added); <em>see also Kimmons, </em>965 F.2d at 1011 (permitting enhancement for co-conspirator\u2019s use or possession of a firearm despite conviction for violation of \u00a7 924(c)). As the Fifth Circuit noted, where the defendant and a co-conspirator are both armed, \u201can enhancement is entirely proper because two armed men pose a much greater threat to public safety than does one.\u201d <em>Washington, 44 </em>F.3d at 1281 (citing <em>Kim-mons </em>). Here, it is undisputed that both of Cover\u2019s co-defendants possessed firearms during the robbery. Accordingly, we find that it was appropriate for the district court to apply a \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">\n<em>2. The government\u2019s challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">The government\u2019s challenge addresses the scope of the enhancement, i.e., whether the co-conspirators merely \u201cbrandished, displayed, or possessed\u201d their firearms or whether they \u201cotherwise used\u201d their firearms during the crime. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B), (C). In deciding not to give the six-point enhancement for \u201cotherwise use\u201d of a firearm, the district court rested on a legal interpretation of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B). <em>See </em>R4-25. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>181 F.3d 1232, 1233 (11th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>121 F.3d 628, 629 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">Under the Guidelines, \u201cotherwise used\u201d means \u201cthat the conduct did not amount to the discharge <em>of </em>a firearm but was more than brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon,\u201d while \u201cbrandished\u201d means \u201cthat the weapon was pointed or waved about, or displayed in a threatening manner.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment, (n.l(g), 1(c)) (1998); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1, comment. (n.l) (1998) (referring to \u00a7 1B1.1 commentary in defining \u201cotherwise used\u201d and \u201cbrandishing\u201d). In <em>United States v. Wooden, </em>we held that an implicit threat against a specific person which included \u201cpointing and holding a semi-automatic weapon one-half inch from his victim\u2019s head\u201d amounted to \u201cotherwise use\u201d of the firearm. 169 F.3d 674, 676-77 (11th Cir.1999). Judge Hill of this court, sitting by designation on the First Circuit, relied on several cases, including <em>Wooden, </em>to find that \u201cit was the specific rather than the general pointing of the gun that elevated its use from mere \u2018brandishment\u2019 to \u2018otherwise used.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. LaFortune, </em>192 F.3d 157, 161 (1st Cir.1999). We agree with this definition and, like the majority of courts that have considered the question, find that the use of a firearm to make an explicit or implicit threat against a specific person constitutes \u201cotherwise use\u201d of the firearm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 161\u2014 62 (\u201cA <em>general, </em>or even pompous, showing of weapons, involving what one would consider an arrogant demonstration of their presence, constitutes the <em>generalized </em>warning that these weapons may be, in the future, used and not merely brandished. <em>Altering this general display </em>of weaponry by <em>specifically leveling </em>a cocked firearm <em>at the head or body of a bank teller or customer, </em>ordering them to move or be quiet according to one\u2019s direction is a cessation of \u2018brandishing\u2019 and the commencement of \u2018otherwise used.\u2019 \u201d) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>135 F.3d 478, 483 (7th Cir.1998) (\u201cAs for Charles\u2019s use of the gun, we conclude that poking it into Un-ruh\u2019s back was at least as serious as leveling a dangerous weapon <em>at someone\u2019s head </em>or pointing it <em>at a specific person </em>without any physical contact. We have already found that the latter behavior constitutes \u2018otherwise using\u2019 the dangerous weapon within the meaning of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D).\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Gilkey, </em>118 F.3d 702, 706 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>facts of the case at bar, which include actual, physical seizing of the <em>specific </em>victim, the simultaneous pointing of the weapon <em>at the victim, </em>and the forced mqvement <em>of the victim, </em>indicate specific rather than general pointing of the gun. It does not matter whether the gun itself actually touched the victim.\u201d), (affirming district court\u2019s enhancement for \u201cotherwise use\u201d of a dangerous weapon) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Elkins, </em>16 F.3d 952, 953-54 (8th Cir.1994) (\u201cWe reject the invitation to conclude that placing a knife <em>against the throat of an innocent bystander </em>to facilitate cooperation with a robbery demand is not \u2018use\u2019 of a dangerous weapon for purposes of section 2B3.1(b)(2).\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>931 F.2d 238, 240 (3d Cir.1991) (\u201c[W]hen a defendant did not simply point or wave about a firearm, but actually leveled the gun <em>at the head of the victim at close range </em>and verbalized a threat to discharge the weapon, the conduct is properly classified as \u2018otherwise using\u2019 a firearm.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. De La Rosa, </em>911 F.2d 985, 993 (5th Cir.1990) (finding that brandishing of firearm combined with use of threats \u201coperates to bring this conduct within the orbit of \u2018otherwise used.\u2019 \u201d). <em>But see United States v. Matthews, </em>20 F.3d 538, 554 (2d Cir.1994) (holding that fact that robbers issued explicit threats while \u201cbrandishing] and pointing their firearms] menacingly\u201d was not sufficient to constitute \u201cotherwise use\u201d of the firearm).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, in addition to the fact that both of Cover\u2019s co-conspirators held various persons at gunpoint, <em>see </em>PSI \u00b64, it is undisputed that the unidentified co-conspirator escaped by carjacking and kidnaping an unsuspecting motorist who was outside the bank. PSI \u00b6 6. The victim was held at gunpoint on the passenger side floorboard of the vehicle as the unidentified individual fled the scene PSI \u00b6 6. We hold that the action of the unidentified co-conspirator in carjacking and abducting a motorist at gunpoint is sufficient to constitute \u201cotherwise use\u201d of his firearm. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) five-point enhancement and remand for application of the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) six-point enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">\n<em>III.

We REVERSE the application of the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) and REMAND solely for the imposition of a \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) six-level enhancement in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">.

For \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(C) to apply, the amount of loss need only be greater than $50,000.

While it is clear that the Second Circuit disagrees with the line of cases that find that specific threats or pointing of weapons is enough to finding \"otherwise use\u201d rather than mere brandishment of the weapons, it is not clear that it would disagree with our conclusion that the unidentified co-conspirator\u2019s use of a firearm to carjack and abduct a victim at gunpoint constitutes \"otherwise use.\u201d <em>See Matthews, </em>20 F.3d at 554 (suggesting that the court might find \"that the expressed threat to shoot one person in order to extort action from another goes beyond ... \u2018brandishing.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
