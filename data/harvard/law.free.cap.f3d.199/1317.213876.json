United States, </em>43 Fed.Cl. 210 (1999). Plaintiff-Appellant S &amp; M Enterprises (\u201cS &amp; M\u201d) was the owner of the property located at 207-213 East 36th Street, New York, New York (\u201cthe Property\u201d). On June 29, 1987, the United States acquired the Property through eminent domain by filing a Declaration of Taking in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance assessed a transfer gains tax on S <em>&amp; </em>M. S &amp; M filed a claim for reimbursement under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (\u201cPolicies Act\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4653(1) (1994), claiming that this tax was a \u201ctransfer tax or similar expense.\u201d The Court of Federal Claims found that this tax was an income tax and not a transfer tax or similar expense, and, therefore denied S <em>&amp; </em>M\u2019s claim for reimbursement. Because we agree that a tax based on gains is not a transfer tax or similar expense, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b974-15\">This case was initially filed in the Court of Federal Claims on September 23, 1988, however, due to a long and complicated procedural history, which is detailed in the Court of Federal Claims decision, no judgment was issued until January 29, 1999. <em>See S &amp; M, </em>43 Fed.Cl. at 210-20. The case was timely appealed to our court and submitted for our decision following oral argument on December 8,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-16\">The only issue currently before this court is whether the transfer gains tax assessed against S &amp; M<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after its property was acquired by the government can be classified as a \u201ctransfer tax or similar ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>pense\u201d within the meaning of the Policies Act. Under the Policies Act, the government is required to reimburse a property owner whose property has been taken pursuant to the government\u2019s eminent domain powers for \u201cexpenses he necessarily incurred for ... recording fees, transfer taxes, and similar expenses incidental to conveying such real property to the United States.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4653(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">The Federal Circuit has examined a similar issue once before in a case involving the Vermont Land Gains Tax. <em>See Collins v. United States, </em>946 F.2d 864 (Fed.Cir. 1991). That case interpreted the language \u201ctransfer taxes, and similar expenses\u201d as used in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4653 to be limited to the \u201cset of expenses that are customarily and necessarily paid \u2018in order to complete the [legal] transaction\u2019 of property title transfer or to perfect the recording of the new deed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 869 (quoting 35 Fed. Reg. 19232, 19243 (1970)). In that case, this court held that the Vermont Land Gains Tax bore no relationship to the acts of completing legal title transfer or recording the new deed, and therefore it was neither a transfer tax nor a similar expense. The court thoroughly expounded on the minimal legislative history available to reach the conclusion that the Policies Act did not cover the Vermont Land Gains Tax, stating that \u201cthe traditional nature of a locality\u2019s property transfer taxes [renders them] ... generally due at settlement or before the property transfer transaction can be given legal effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that since the \u201ctitle transfer is recorded regardless of payment\u201d of the Vermont Land Gains Tax, which is distinguishable from Vermont\u2019s Property Transfer Tax due at \u201cthe time of delivery to the clerk for recording of a deed evidencing a transfer of title to property subject to the tax,\u201d the Vermont Land Gains Tax cannot be considered a transfer tax, or similar expense \u201cbecause the tax bears no relationship to the acts of completing legal title transfer or recording of the new deed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">In the instant case, New York State, as Vermont did in the <em>Collins </em>case, implemented a real estate tax \u201con each deed at the time it is delivered by a grant- or to a grantee when the consideration or value of the interest conveyed exceeds one hundred dollars...\u201d N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law, Art. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 1400-1410 (McKinney Supp.1983-84). In 1989, Article 31 was amended. Section 1402, as amended, provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-10\">A tax is hereby imposed on each conveyance of real property or interest therein when the consideration exceeds five hundred dollars, at the rate of two dollars for each five hundred dollars or fractional part thereof; provided, however, that with respect to (A) a conveyance of a one, two or three-family house and an individual residential condominium unit, or interests therein; and (B) conveyances where the consideration is less than five hundred thousand dollars, the consideration for the interest conveyed shall exclude the value of any lien or encumbrance remaining thereon at the time of conveyance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law \u00a7 1402(a) (McKinney 1994). Payment of the transfer tax imposed by Article 31 is required prior to deed recordation, and the tax is paid through the purchase of documentary stamps or through the use of a metering machine. The real estate tax is a tax designed merely to cover the costs of the actual transfer, including the costs of recording the deed, and other administrative tasks the government must do to perfect the transfer. The New York State transfer gains tax is a separate tax designed to raise revenue, not to merely offset expenses, and is taxed at the rate of ten percent on the gains earned on the transfer. We held in <em>Collins </em>that the policy behind the Policies Act was to reimburse unwilling conveyors of their property only for those expenses \u201cincidental to conveying such real property to the United States\u201d\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>not with the profits they may earn from the transfer. It is clear that in the instant case, the New York State transfer gains tax is not merely a fee to cover such incidental costs, and is therefore, not meant to be reimbursed under the Policies Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">S &amp; M argues that the fact that the tax is on the gains is only one factor to be considered in determining whether the tax is a \u201ctransfer tax, or similar expense.\u201d We disagree, and hold that regardless of the many different factors that may come into play, such as when the tax is due, or who is responsible for the tax, if the tax is based solely on the <em>gain, </em>if any, and not on the <em>size </em>of the transfer, it is never a \u201ctransfer tax, or similar expense\u201d and, therefore, never reimbursable under the Policies Act. In a case, such as this one, where if there had been a loss incurred in the transfer no New York transfer gains tax would have been due, the tax is solely against the gain, and not against the conveyance, the tax cannot be a \u201ctransfer tax, or similar expense.\u201d It is, instead, merely a tax on the gain, and therefore, not reimbursable. It does not matter, in the instant case, that section 1447(l)(f)(l)(i) of the New York State transfer gains tax prohibits the recording of the deed until the gains tax, if due, is paid, that liability for the tax can, in certain limited circumstances, be imposed on both the seller and the buyer, and that the tax is imposed simultaneously with the <em>transfer. </em>The dispositive factor is that the tax is assessed against any profit earned, and not assessed against the size of the conveyance made.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">The summary judgment in favor of the government, holding that S <em>&amp; </em>M is not entitled to reimbursement for the amount assessed under the New York State Transfer Tax and paid by S <em>&amp; </em>M, is therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-6\">.
