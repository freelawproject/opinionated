Judge Bowen ordered that the dog be returned provided the veterinarian\u2019s bill and approximately half the board bill be paid. The appeal seeks to avoid the payment of any amount as a prerequisite to the return of the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">The appellees move to dismiss the appeal because only part of the testimony\u2014that of the appellant\u2014-was transcribed and printed in the record extract, and that what was reproduced is not sufficient to enable this Court properly to determine either the question sought to be raised or any other aspect of the correctness of the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">We think the appeal should be dismissed. Maryland Rule 826 c 2 requires (with alternate procedures not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>here pertinent) the filing as part of the record of \u201ca transcript of all the testimony.\u201d Rule 828 b 1 requires the printed extract to \u201ccontain such parts of the record as may reasonably be necessary for the determination of the questions presented by the appeal,\u201d including \u201cso much of the evidence * * * as is material to any question the determination of .which depends upon the sufficiency of the evidence * * *.\u201d Rule 835 b 5 provides that on motion of a party an appeal may be dismissed because the contents of the printed record do not comply with section b of Rule 828. Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss is appropriate and has substance and force.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
