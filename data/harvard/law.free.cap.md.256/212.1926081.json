Abel and Abel, t/a Galena Boat Yard, </em>246 Md. 895 (1967), and for that reason we shall not repeat it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">On 11 July 1968 the Kent County Planning Commission approved Abel\u2019s application for a \u201cZoning Certificate and/or Building Permit\u201d for the construction of a \u201cbulkhead and 7 covered slips\u201d to be added to his marina, Galena Boat Yard, which at the time had 42 slips and which he had owned and operated since 1956. His 6(4 acre tract, situated at the confluence of the Sassafras River and Swantown Creek, is designated \u201cC\u201d (Commercial) on the zoning map. In the minutes of the Commission there is the notation that \u201cMr. Rasin [counsel for Abel] stated that the application is for an extention [sic] of the marina and will not be used as warehouse, livery station or for boat repairs.\u201d The appellants appealed to the Kent County Board of Zoning Appeals. The hearing took place on 11 November 1968. \u201cInterested parties\u201d were heard, \u201call matters filed\u201d were \u201cread and considered\u201d and the \u201cspecific property and the neighborhood\u201d were studied. On 4 December 1969 the Board an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>nounced its decision denying the appeal and affirming the action of the Planning Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The Board\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d state that Abel has an \u201cestablished boatyard and marina\u201d on property which is zoned commercial; that he proposes to build seven additional double slips for the mooring and storage of boats up to 50 feet in length and \u201cto add fill along * * * [the] property line adjacent to the water to the extent of 280 feet;\u201d that the bulkhead will be 270 feet long and within 500 feet of the adjoining \u201cR\u201d (Residential) property; that the \u201carea in which repairs to boats are made is physically separated by a natural barrier\u201d from the marina on which the bulkhead will be constructed; that the repair area consists of an enclosed, heated building 60 feet by 80 feet into which boats are brought by a \u201ctravel lift;\u201d that boats are lifted out of the water in this area only; that all painting and major repairs are made in the building; that engine changes, \u201ctune-ups\u201d and major mechanical repairs are made \u201cin the immediate area of the repair shed;\u201d that Abel \u201cwould not clean out a fuel tank in the vicinity of the proposed use;\u201d that he \u201cwill install shore facilities such as toilet [s] * * * showers, etc;\u201d that owners, not employees of Abel, \u201chave done maintenance work on their boats, when necessary;\u201d that \u201cpollution mentioned by * * * [appellants] is unsupported by evidence of any expert, nor are the allegations as to algae supported by an expert who could testify as to the cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In <em>Kent County Planning Inspector, supra, </em>we suggested the possibility that the boatyard and the marina uses might be divisible. Abel thereafter sought a decree declaring that such uses were divisible but Chief Judge Carter, speaking for the Circuit Court for Kent County, Equity No. 5118, dismissed his petition but \u201cwithout prejudice to the right of the parties to bring appropriate proceedings before the Planning Commission and/or the Board of Appeals of Kent County for determination\u201d of the question. The Board, after quoting from Judge Carter\u2019s opinion, concluded \u201cas a matter of law\u201d that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>combined operation of a boat repair yard and a marina by Abel \u201care divisible and separate enterprises.\u201d In its order upholding the decision of the Planning Commission the Board added the proviso that Abel \u201cdo no repairs in the area of the proposed use, <em>except as limited by Mr. Abel's testimony, </em>and provided further that showers, toilet facilities, etc., be installed <em>as provided in the testimony.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) An appeal to the circuit court followed. The case came on for trial before Rasin, J., on 10 March 1969. According to the docket entries \u201cby agreement of counsel, no record was made of the testimony.\u201d Judge Rasin, several days later, filed a brief opinion in which he said he had \u201cexamined the transcript of the testimony taken at the hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals\u201d and, having found that there was sufficient evidence before the Board to make the question fairly debatable, he had \u201cno alternative but to affirm the decision\u201d of the Board. An appeal to this Court was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">It will now be clear that the pivot of this dispute is subsection 6 of Section 10.01 (Principal Permitted Uses) of Article X (\u201cC\u201d\u2014Commercial District) of the Kent County Zoning Ordinance, which permits;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\u201cMarina or boat livery station, but not including boat repair yards, marine railways, warehouses and like uses unless five hundred (500) feet from any Tt\u2019 District.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">If Abel\u2019s proposed construction will do nothing more than increase or intensify his marina operation it is a permissible commercial use. If it could be said that the two uses are not divisible then the proposed construction would be impermissible since it would be within the prohibition of \u201cboat repair yards\u201d within 500 feet of a residential district.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Appellants seem to suggest that there is some fatal contradiction in the words \u201cmarina\u201d and \u201cboat livery station.\u201d In their brief they say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">\u201cWebster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary, 1960 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Edition, contains no reference to the word marina. The word livery, in that Editionj is defined, in part, as \u2018the keeping of horses, and hence of vehicles, boats, etc. in readiness to be hired.\u2019 It would thus appear that a boat livery station is a boat rental operation, with which the case at bar does not deal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The same dictionary, however, gives as a first meaning for livery, \u201cthe feeding, stabling and care of horses <em>for pay.\u201d </em>A later edition (1965) defines marina as \u201ca dock or basin providing secure moorings for motorboats and yachts and <em>often </em>offering supply, repair, and other facilities.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Abel testified at the hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals that while no repair work would be done in the marina area there were some things that could not very well be done elsewhere. An excerpt from his testimony follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">\u201cQ. Do you do mechanical repairs at your boat yard? A. In the immediate area of the repair shed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">\u201cQ. Do you do mechanical repairs? A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">\u201cQ. What kind of mechanical repairs do you do ? A. Change engines; tune-ups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">\u201cQ. Suppose the boat won\u2019t run, do you get it running for the owner? A. Yes, we can put points and plugs in it and get it running.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">\u201cQ. For example, suppose the generator isn\u2019t working.'Would you repair that? A. No, I would have to take it off and take it down to Chester-town and have it repaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\">\u201cQ. If there were some small repair you might be able to repair that, it if didn\u2019t require a new generator? A. If it didn\u2019t require a new generator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-13\">\u201cQ. Or exchanging voltage regulators, for example? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u201cQ. Battery replacement? A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">\u201cQ. Carburetor adjustment? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201cQ. Do you do carburetor replacement, do you? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201cQ. These repairs are generally done wherever the boat happens to be, aren\u2019t they? A. Not necessarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\u201cQ. It could be though? A. It could be done wherever the boat happens to be, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Appellants say \u201c [s] urely it is naivet\u00e9 in the utmost degree to assume, based upon Mr. Abel\u2019s <em>nudum pactum, </em>that neither he nor his employees would perform repairs to the forty and fifty foot yachts while they occupy the slips in the new construction.\u201d Abel\u2019s <em>pactum </em>is not quite so <em>nudum </em>as appellants would have us believe. We think the Board relied on Abel\u2019s assurances that repair work in the marina area would be limited to the minor operations listed above and it would seem to follow that, absent such assurances, the permit would have been denied. And, to be sure, his avouehment in this regard is now a matter of record and should he at some future time exceed the limits staked out by the Board it will be a simple matter for the appellants to invoke the sanctions set forth in Article XVIII (Violations, Penalties and Enforcement) of the Zoning Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">We have read the testimony which was presented to the Board of Appeals and it seems clear to us that it made the issues there presented fairly debatable. We see no reason why Judge Rasin\u2019s order should be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\">.
