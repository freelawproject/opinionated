On 8 September 1967 the appellee (Srnec) barged into the left rear of Katherine Cavey\u2019s car. Both were westbound on Franklin Street. In late May 1968 she and her husband, Robert, filed suit against Srnec. In the \u201cfirst cause of action\u201d Katherine claimed $50,000 for her \u201cphysical pain and mental anguish;\u201d in the \u201csecond cause of action\u201d Robert claimed $10,000 for the loss of Katherine\u2019s services and medical expenses incurred as a result of her injury; in the \u201cthird cause of action\u201d both Katherine and Robert claimed $20,000 for the \u201closs of consortium.\u201d The case came on for trial in March 1969 before Cullen, J., and a jury. According to the docket entries the trial ended in a \u201cVerdict in favor pf * * * [Katherine] for the sum of $200 and in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>of * * * [Robert] for the sum of $400 and costs.\u201d On the same day, 27 March, \u201cJudgments on Verdicts Nisi\u201d were entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">On the day following Katherine filed a motion for a new trial \u201cas to damages only\u201d for the reason that the verdict in her favor represented only the \u201cfair value of her wages for loss of time\u201d and gave no award \u201cwhatever for pain and suffering.\u201d In his supporting memorandum counsel for Katherine said, \u201cThat she will have a 25% permanent disability to her cervical spine was never contradicted.\u201d The docket entry for 1 April 1969 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201cJudgment absolute in favor of * * * [Robert] for the sum of $400 with interest and costs of suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">A few days short of two months later, 26 May, Judge Cullen sent to counsel the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">\u201cGentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">\u201cThe Court has given careful consideration to the Motion for New Trial filed in the above entitled cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">\u201cThe decision on this Motion has been withheld hoping the parties could settle the matter between themselves, which apparently cannot be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">\u201cThis Court will grant a new trial based on the fact that the amount of damages awarded by the jury were inconsistent with the verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">James K. Cullen\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">The docket entry for 26 May shows \u201c* * * [Katherine\u2019s] motion for new trial GRANTED (CULLEN, Judge).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">On 25 June counsel for Srnec filed the document set forth in full below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-15\">\u201cThis Petition by Ernest Srnec, Defendant by James B. Wheatley, his attorney, respectfully states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u201c1. The Court passed an order granting a new trial in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Subsequent to the Order the Plaintiff, Robert Cavey has requested payment of the judgment rendered in his favor by the Jury, and the Plaintiff, KATHERINE E. CAVEY, has indicated the intention of having the New Trial based on the question of damages only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201c3. The Defendant believes that the question arises as to what issues and to what parties the new trial applies. Is it to be tried de novo on all issues as to all parties, or is it granted as to one Plaintiff alone, and on what issues? If it is not granted as to Robert Cavey, can the \u2018Third Cause of Action\u2019 in the Declaration be pursued?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">\u201cWHEREFORE, the Defendant requests that the Court pass an order clarifying its Order granting a New Trial, and that the Court Order such other and further relief for the Defendant as in the judgment of the Court may be proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">James B. Wheatley,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">Attorney for Defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">On the same day, 25 June, Judge Cullen sent to counsel the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">\u201cGentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">\u201cI can understand that there may be some confusion as to the action of the Court in granting a new trial in the above entitled cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-13\">\u201cThis Court believes, after examination, of its notes, that the amount of damages awarded by the jury showed a lack of understanding of the issues involved in the case. The Court meant by its previous Order and does hereby grant a new trial (trial de novo) on all issues and as to all parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-14\">James K. Cullen\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The docket entries for 25 June are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Petition for Clarification of Issues to be determined at New Trial filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201cCourt\u2019s Clarification of Issues, as requested by Defendant\u2019s Petition. Letter of Court filed (CULLEN, Judge).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Both the copy of the Petition for Clarification and the copy of Judge Cullen\u2019s letter were received the next day by counsel for the Caveys who, until then, had been unaware of either the petition or the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Srnec filed neither a motion <em>N.O.V. </em>nor a motion for a new trial. His only response to the verdicts and Katherine\u2019s motion for a new trial was the \u201cpetition for clarification.\u201d In this Court, there is neither brief nor appearance for him. The transcript of the record contains neither the testimony of the witnesses nor the court\u2019s instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Robert invites our attention to the absence of any allegation (or proof) of fraud, mistake or irregularity in the entry of his judgment. This being so, he argues that Judge Cullen had no power or authority to strike out his judgment, a necessary consequence of the granting of a new trial. That Robert is right requires only the citation of Maryland Rule 625; <em>Hale v. Cramer, </em>254 Md. 592 (1963); <em>Household Finance Corporation v. Taylor, </em>254 Md. 349 (1869); <em>Himes v. Day, </em>254 Md. 197 (1969); <em>Grantham v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>251 Md. 28 (1968); <em>Murray v. Fishman Construction Company, Pac., </em>241 Md. 538 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">Katherine\u2019s case points up some sticky problems in procedure. Rule 567 c empowers the court to grant a new trial in respect of any \u201cseverable part of the matters in controversy, or only some or one of the parties\u201d and to enter \u201cfinal judgment as to the remaining parts or parties.\u201d While there seems to be no rule allowing the filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>of a motion for a new trial limited to a single issue, <em>e.g., </em>damages, neither does there seem to be any restriction against so doing. But, as matters now stand, it is clear that such a motion does not limit the court\u2019s powers in this regard to the granting only of the limited new trial asked for. Obviously this puts counsel in a delicate and perhaps perilous position. In the case at bar, for instance, Katherine\u2019s motion could result in a new trial limited to damages or to a new trial on all issues from which she very well might emerge empty-handed. If we assume that the court in granting the new trial limits it to damages only, then there arises the question of the effect of Rule 567 e on the adjudication of liability. Is the plaintiff then entitled to have the clerk \u201center final judgment as of course,\u201d on the issue of liability only; and what, for instance, might be the effect of a motion limited to damages only on the right to have a final judgment entered \u201cas of course\u201d on the issue of liability? The court has the power to deal with the entry of final judgments \u201cas to the remaining parts or parties,\u201d Rule 567 c, but it does appear that some thought should be given to the question whether the court\u2019s discretion ought to be controlled or limited, and to what extent, if at all, by what a party asks for in a motion for a new trial. We shall direct the Rules Committee to look into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In the case at bar the situation is unclear, perhaps even a little foggy. Katherine\u2019s motion states unequivocally that it is \u201cfor a new trial as to damages only.\u201d As Judge Cullen stated in his letter of 26 May, he gave her motion \u201ccareful consideration.\u201d He went on to say that he would \u201cgrant a new trial.\u201d It is uncertain, however, whether it was his intention, on that date, to grant a new trial limited to damages only or a new trial as to all issues, including liability. A month later he said he meant to \u201cgrant a new trial (trial de novo) on all issues and as to all parties.\u201d The clerk\u2019s docket entry dispels none of the fog. It states simply that Katherine\u2019s \u201cmotion for new trial [has been] GRANTED.\u201d Srnec\u2019s petition alleges doubt, and confusion on his part. Judge Cul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>len in his letter of 25 June concedes \u201cthere may * * * [have been] some confusion.\u201d All things considered, the circumstances suggest that Judge Cullen himself may have been confused. If this were not so he would have realized, we think, that he was without the power to disturb Robert\u2019s judgment short of a showing of fraud, mistake or irregularity. We shall remand the case so that Judge Cullen can consider Katherine\u2019s motion with all facts and circumstances seen in proper perspective. It will be entirely within his discretion, of course, to deny her motion, to grant a trial <em>de </em>novo, or to grant a new trial on the issue of damages only. It seems clear to us, however, despite the scanty record, that we have here the kind of situation this Court had in mind when it promulgated Rule 567 c. Srnec\u2019s liability has twice been determined by the jury, once in Katherine\u2019s case and for the second time in Roberts\u2019 case. This is also true in respect of the absence of contributory negligence on the part of Katherine. We doubt that the rehashing of these issues would serve any useful purpose. Indeed, Srnec seems resigned to this since he moved neither for a new trial nor for a judgment <em>N.O.V. </em>Nor has he bothered to contest the issue in this Court. The case is in a posture which clearly calls for the application of the discretion conferred by Rule 567 c.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\n<em>Neither affirmed nor reversed. Case remanded for the reconsideration of Katherine Cavey\u2019s motion for a new trial. Costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
