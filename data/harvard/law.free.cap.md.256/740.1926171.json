The appeal by the developer from the judgment entered on the jury\u2019s verdict asks us to hold that the episodes of flooding and the resulting damages were not attributable to any act or omission of the developer and that there was no evidence before the jury which could support its finding of the amount of damages suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Counsel for the developer at the trial\u2014who was not counsel on appeal\u2014preserved nothing for this Court to pass on. The homeowners offered evidence of negligence and damages which was not objected to. The developer made a motion for a directed verdict at the end of the plaintiffs\u2019 case but, when it was denied, waived the motion by offering testimony, and did not renew the motion at the conclusion of all the evidence. The court\u2019s charge to the jury was not objected to by either side. No question is now presented to us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
