On appeal, Fletcher presents three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>1. Did the State, the appellee, prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">2. Did the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any of the acts complained of occurred within one year of the date of the issuance of the warrant on April 29,1969 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">3. Did the State prove that Randy was a delinquent minor ?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The hearing in the case in the lower court took place on May 5, 1969. Randy testified that he had met Fletcher (aged 39) approximately two summers ago, in the summer of 1967. He stated that Fletcher had invited him to come to Fletcher\u2019s trailer and \u201cplay with him.\u201d The nature of the \u201cplay\u201d consisted of Fletcher taking Randy\u2019s penis and playing with it during which Fletcher would put it in his mouth. This type of play, according to Randy, took place approximately 50 times, usually in Fletcher\u2019s trailer. The last time it took place was \u201clast summer\u201d (1968) in approximately June or July.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">On cross-examination there was some confusion about the last time Fletcher committed any sexual act with Randy. The cross-examination and redirect examination were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">\u201cQ. Anyhow, the last time you were at Mr. Fletcher\u2019s trailer was around Halloween of 1967 wasn\u2019t it? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">\u201cQ. And weren\u2019t you forbidden by your parents to go up to Mr. Fletcher\u2019s anymore? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">\u201cQ. And you haven\u2019t been in Mr. Fletcher\u2019s company since then, have you? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-13\">\u201cQ. Well, you said that was the last time, I assume you\u2019re right. Now then, you were also forbidden to go to your grandmother\u2019s house weren\u2019t you ? A.-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-15\">\u201cQ. I think that\u2019s all son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-16\">\u201c (Mr. Stakem) Just a couple of more questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-17\">\u201cQ. Did you say that the last time you were\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u201cObjection by Mr. Ryan: I object, I object. We have cross examined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">\u201c(The Court) Well, he has testified to two different dates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201c(Mr. Ryan) --He has just testified that it was Halloween, 1967.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">\u201c (The Court) Was it 1967 or 1968? A. 1968.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">\u201cQ. Why did you tell me it was 1967, son? You told me a minute ago, it was 1967. You don\u2019t know when it was do you ? A. It was Halloween, 1967. Last year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">\u201cQ. No, no, it was 1967 Halloween when you were at Mr. Fletcher\u2019s trailer. A. Well, I didn\u2019t mean that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-12\">\u201c(Mr. Stakem) No further questions. That\u2019s the state\u2019s case, your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">Randy further testified that the \u201cplay\u201d occurred with regularity each time he went to Fletcher\u2019s trailer, which was about once a day. During these visits to the trailer, Fletcher would also ask Randy to put Fletcher\u2019s penis in Randy\u2019s mouth and required the boy to take pictures of Fletcher naked. Fletcher made Randy promise that he would not tell anybody of these acts. Randy kept the promise until March 1969 when he told his grandfather, Russell Goodfellow, who had already become suspicious because Fletcher had given Randy some expensive presents. Randy stated that Fletcher had given him money when he went to the races and at Christmas time had given him $18.00. Fletcher also gave him a pair of walkietalkies and some money for a jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">Randy\u2019s grandfather, Russell Goodfellow, testified that he had known Fletcher for approximately a year and eight months\u2014since August of 1967. During that time Fletcher and Randy were \u201crunning around a lot together.\u201d He testified that Fletcher had given Randy a wrist watch and an expensive set of walkie-talkies. He stated that on one occasion, \u201csome seven or eight months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>ago,\u201d Fletcher took Randy into the bedroom with him, locked the door and would not let the girls in.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Fletcher testified that he knew Randy and felt that he was neglected by his family. For this reason, he gave Randy a walkie-talkie for Christmas and each of his little sisters a watch and a baby doll. He stated that he had known Randy since the end of 1967 but denied ever indulging in any sexual play with the boy. Fletcher disputed that he had any meeting with Randy in June 1968 and stated that the last time he saw Randy was in 1967, around Halloween time. Fletcher denied ever taking pictures of the boy while nude or having Randy take pictures of Fletcher while nude.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In our opinion, there was sufficient evidence with reasonable inferences from the evidence, from which the trial judge could conclude that Fletcher was guilty of violating Code (1957) Art. 26, \u00a7 55. This statute provides for the punishment of a person 18 years of age or older over whom the judge may have jurisdiction under \u00a7 53, if found guilty of any act or omission as therein defined, by a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment not exceeding two years, or both. There are provisions for an election of a jury trial or of trial before a criminal court, neither of which are applicable here as Fletcher made no such elections. Art. 26, \u00a7 53 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court has original jurisdiction, unless there is a waiver as therein provided and subject to the right of trial by jury, to try \u2014 any parent, guardian or any other person 18 years of age or over \u201cfor any wilful act or omission bringing a child within the jurisdiction of the court * * Art. 26, \u00a7 52 (e) defines a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">\u201c(e) \u2018Delinquent child\u2019 means a child (1) who violates any law or ordinance, or who commits any act which, if committed by an adult, would be a crime not punishable by death or life imprisonment; (2) who is incorrigible or ungovernable or habitually disobedient or who is be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>yond the control of his parents, guardian, custodian or other lawful authority; (3) who is habitually a truant; (4) who without just cause and without the consent of his parents, guardian or other custodian, repeatedly deserts his home or place of abode; (5) who is engaged in any occupation which is in violation of law, or who associates with immoral or vicious persons; or (6) who so deports himself as to injure or endanger the morals of himself or others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">These statutory provisions were in force when the acts took place and the case tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In <em>Vincent v. State, </em>220 Md. 232, 237, 151 A. 2d 898, 901 (1959), Judge (later Chief Judge) Prescott, for the Court gave the test for sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201cIn every criminal case, evidence, to meet the test of legal sufficiency, must show directly, or support a rational inference of, the facts required to be proved; and the facts must be established, or the inference supported, beyond a reasonable doubt or to a moral certainty, or a reasonable doubt of an opposite fact must be created.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">When a case is tried by the court without a jury, as was the present case, we may review the case upon both the law and the evidence, but we will not reverse the lower court\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous, giving due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses. Maryland Rule 886 a. We do not determine on appeal whether or not the appellant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether or not there was any evidence present or rational inferences to be drawn from the evidence from which the trial court could find the appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If there was such evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>reasonable inferences, we will not find that the trial court\u2019s decision was erroneous. <em>Abney v. State, </em>244 Md. 444, 447, 223 A. 2d 792, 794-95 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>387 U. S. 925, 87 S. Ct. 2043, 18 L.Ed.2d 981. Inasmuch as the credibility of the witnesses is a matter for the trier of facts to determine, the trial court may disbelieve any exculpatory statements by the accused. <em>Bird v. State, </em>231 Md. 432, 436, 190 A. 2d 804, 806 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In the present case there was a clear conflict in the testimony. The trial court chose to believe the testimony of Randy and his grandfather and to reject the exculpatory statements of Fletcher. It cannot be said that this determination was erroneous. There was ample evidence from the rather graphic description by Randy of acts of unnatural and perverted sexual practice by Fletcher, occurring approximately 50 times, with the supporting evidence of the grandfather and the admitted gifts to support the trial court\u2019s determination of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Code (1968 Replacement Volume), Art. 57, \u00a7 11 provides that \u201cNo prosecution shall be commenced for any fine, penalty or forfeiture, or any misdemeanor, except those punished by confinement in the penitentiary, unless within one year from the time of the offense committed.\u201d This statutory provision is, in our opinion, applicable to the charge involved in the present case so that the State must prove that one or more of the unnatural and perverted acts occurred within one year prior to April 29, 1969. As we have already pointed out there was some conflict in the testimony in regard to when the last act occurred, but, in our opinion, the trial court carefully considered the evidence and concluded that some of the acts occurred in June or July, 1968. On this issue the record indicates the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">\u201c(The Court) Now the boy has testified, as I recalled his testimony that he doesn\u2019t remember what happened or he doesn\u2019t know whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>last time he was with him was as far as he knows as I understood his testimony was June or July of 1968. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201c(Mr. Stakem) [Attorney for the State] He later said the last time he was at Mr. Fletcher\u2019s trailer was Halloween of 1968. But he did say June or July, 1968 as far as these occurrences. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">\u201c(The Court) The last time anything took place was June or July, 1968, is that his testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">\u201c (Mr. Stakem) That\u2019s as I recall it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">\u201c(The Court) Do you recall it Mr. Ryan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">\u201c(Mr. Ryan) [Attorney for Fletcher] That\u2019s what I\u2019d say. That\u2019s what the boy said.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">In our opinion, we should not find that the trial court was clearly in error in concluding that the prosecution was not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">Fletcher finally contends that the State did not prove that Randy was a delinquent minor. As already set forth, Art. 26, \u00a7 53 subjects Fletcher to the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court in the event he commits \u201cany wilful act or omission bringing a child within the jurisdiction of the [Juvenile] court.\u201d Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>but without deciding, that under this statutory provision the State must prove that Randy was a delinquent child, the State, in our opinion, has proved that Fletcher committed a wilful act or omission causing Randy to be brought within the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court. It is clear to us that the testimony supports a finding that Fletcher did commit such wilful acts and omissions by committing perverted sexual acts with Randy in violation of Code (1967 Replacement Volume), Art. 27, \u00a7 554 which makes it a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $1,000 with imprisonment in jail, the house of correction or the penitentiary for 10 years, or both in the discretion of the court for a person \u201cconvicted of taking into his or her mouth the sexual organ of any other person or animal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>or who shall be convicted of placing his or her sexual organ in the mouth of any other person or animal, or who shall be convicted of committing any other unnatural or perverted sexual practice with any other person or animal * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">As we have seen, the definition of a delinquent child in Art. 26, \u00a7 52 (e) means a child \u201c(1) who violates any law or ordinance, or who commits any act which, if committed by an adult, would be a crime not punishable by death or life imprisonment;\u201d * * * \u201c(5) * * * who associates with immoral or vicious persons * * Randy was enticed by Fletcher into committing an unnatural or perverted act in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 554 and Fletcher by committing these acts upon Randy was clearly \u201can immoral or vicious person\u201d with whom Randy \u201cassociated.\u201d In the present case, the approximately 50 unnatural or perverted acts clearly made Randy a delinquent child; and these wilful acts committed by Fletcher caused Randy to be brought within the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">It should be observed that Art. 26, \u00a7 53 was repealed by the Acts of 1969, Ch. 432, \u00a7 2 and that under Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (7), added by the Acts of 1969, Ch. 432, \u00a7 2, the Juvenile Court has exclusive original jurisdiction to \u201ctry any person who has reached his eighteenth birthday (or, in Baltimore City, until July 1, 1970, to try any person who has reached his sixteenth birthday) for any wilful act or omission causing a child <em>to be adjudicated </em>neglected, delinquent, or in need of supervision.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The addition of the words \u201cto be adjudicated\u201d in the new statute, effective generally on July 1, 1969, except in Baltimore City where it became effective on June 1, 1969, and with a special provision for an effective date in Montgomery County, rather indicates that prior to the effective date of the new statute there was no requirement that the child <em>should be adjudicated </em>neglected, delinquent, or in need of supervision. If the existing law were thought to require such an adjudica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>tion, it would most likely not have been thought by the General Assembly to have been necessary to have added those specific words in the new legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, the costs to be paid by the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
