We have no doubt but that if the parties were writing the agreement today, the terms would have been defined with greater precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Sylvia Lewis, appellant and cross-appellee, and Bernard Lewis, appellee and cross-appellant, entered into articles of separation on May 21, 1956. The divorce decree passed by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on March 27, 1961, incorporated by reference paragraphs fifth and sixth of the separation agreement relative to custody of the minor child and support. The pertinent portion of the agreement is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">\u201cThe husband shall, commencing on the 1st day of June 1956, make monthly payments, in advance, tax free, of Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00), 60% of which is for the support of the wife and 40 % for the support of the child, payable to the wife for her support and maintenance and for the support and maintenance and education of their child, with the express agreement that commencing on April 15, 1957, the husband shall pay a sum equal to 50% of his net income to his wife and child for their support, payable in advance, in twelve (12) monthly installments, and the same basis shall apply each year thereafter, <em>based on the preceding year\u2019s net federal income tax return </em>filed by the husband. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">\u201c* * * The sum of $250 per month for the year of 1956 is accepted on behalf of the wife and child, based on the fact that the said husband maintains he is earning approximately $5,000 per year.\u201d (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">At the time of the preparation of the agreement and in the divorce proceeding the parties appear to have been represented by counsel other than their present counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Mrs. Lewis filed a petition in the divorce proceeding asking the court to assess arrearages against Mr. Lewis under the decree of March 27, 1961, and to enter judgment in her favor for the amount of these arrearages. The chancellor (Pugh, J.) interpreted \u201cnet income\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>mean \u201cnet taxable income\u201d and determined there were no arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Mrs. Lewis in her appeal presents two questions, (1) whether the chancellor erred in interpreting \u201cnet income\u201d as used in the decree to mean \u201cnet taxable income\u201d as determined for federal income tax purposes, and. (2) whether the chancellor erred in finding that Mr. Lewis was not in arrears under the decree. Mr. Lewis in his appeal contends that the chancellor erred in overruling his demurrer, contending that equity has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition of Mrs. Lewis to assess arrearages. We shall affirm the action of the chancellor in both rulings on the law and reverse him on his finding of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Mrs. Lewis contends the definition of \u201cnet income\u201d here used was deficient in two respects, namely the fact that Mr. Lewis was permitted to deduct alimony payments in computing net income and that in computing net income, deductions were permitted for depreciation, a capital loss on a stock investment and other similar items normally permitted as deductions in the computation of income for Federal income tax purposes. Mrs. Lewis calls the depreciation item \u201ca mere bookkeeping or paper loss\u201d and likewise labels the capital loss a \u201cpaper loss\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The precise question here involved does not appear to have previously reached this Court. Our predecessors in the case of <em>Welsh v. </em>Canfield, 60 Md. 469 (1883), in a case involving construction of a partnership agreement, commented somewhat pithily relative to the analogous term \u201cnet profits\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">\u201cTo say that if \u2018the net profits\u2019\u2014that is, the surplus left after deducting all losses, for such only can be the meaning of the term \u2018net profits\u2019\u2014\u2018in any one year should be so small that the portion of said Welsh should not amount to $2500, that then his account shall be credited a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>sum sufficient to make that amount\u2019 \u2014 that amount, plainly, of net profits\u2014does not mean whatever sum will give him the equivalent for not realizing $2500 in net profits, or in other words he shall be so credited in his account as if he had gained that amount, we cannot comprehend the significance of the language employed. To credit Welsh with a sum as \u2018net profits,\u2019 and then charge him with a loss that not only eats up the sum credited but inflicts an absolute loss beyond is not giving him anything in the nature of a net gain, but only giving him the benefit of a certain sum to which it would be a misnomer to apply the term <em>net.\u201d Id. </em>at 475. (emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Mrs. Lewis relies on the cases of <em>Sturtevant v. Sturtevant, </em>146 Conn. 644, 153 A. 2d 828 (1959) ; <em>Silver v. Silver, </em>12 App. Div.2d 325, 211 N.Y.S.2d 348 (1961), and <em>Estate of Matthews, </em>210 Wis. 109, 245 N. W. 122 (1932). In <em>Sturtevant, supra, </em>the agreement provided, \u201cThe net income of the * * * [defendant] is to be determined upon the basis of his Federal Income Tax Return and in order that the * * * [plaintiff] may have accurate information relative thereto\u201d the defendant was to send the plaintiff a copy of the return simultaneously with the filing of the original. The \u201cfiscal year\u201d with respect to payments under the agreement was to begin on March 15 and end on the following March 14. The agreement further provided that payment \u201cto be made during a \u2018Fiscal Year\u2019 will be determined upon the basis of the income shown by the Federal Income Tax Return for the previous calendar year. Payments [were] to be made monthly * * The agreement was made in 1934. At the time the agreement was made, alimony payments by a husband were not deductible from his income in determining the amount of his taxable income, and were not treated as income to the wife for purposes of determining her income tax liability. Revisions of the Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Revenue Code in 1942 made the alimony payments deductible in his return and includible as income in her return. The husband sought to deduct the alimony payments. The Court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">\u201cIt is apparent from the agreement that the parties felt that the defendant\u2019s net income would be properly reflected in his income tax returns when legally prepared, as they apparently were. But it is significant that the agreement did not provide that the phrase \u2018net income,\u2019 as used in the agreement, would be whatever figure, if any, was denominated \u2018net income\u2019 in the tax return. \u2018Net income\u2019 was not defined in the agreement. Therefore it should be given its ordinary meaning as used in general accounting practice as distinguished from any special meaning it may have under the federal income tax laws. This is true whether we are considering the income tax laws of 1934, of the present time, or of any intermediate period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201cIn general accounting practice, net income, as applied to this case, would ordinarily consist of the total income received by the defendant from all sources, less the legitimate expenses of realizing it, such as office expenses or other expenses of practice. * * * A deduction of the alimony paid to the plaintiff during the year covered by the return, even though presently authorized for income tax purposes, should not be made in computing the net income of the defendant under the agreement, since the payment of alimony would not constitute an expense incurred in realizing income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In <em>Silver v. Silver, supra, </em>the agreement after providing for the payment of a base alimony for the years 1954 through 1958 of $11,000.00 had a provision calling for payment of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u201can amount * * * equal to thirty-three and one-third (33%%) Per cent of any increase of the Husband\u2019s \u2018Net Income\u2019 before federal income taxes over Thirty-two Thousand ($32,000) Dollars in each of said years ($32,000 being item 3 on page 3 of Husband\u2019s federal tax return for the year 1952, i.e. Net Income), but not to exceed One Thousand ($1,000) Dollars in each of said years, as the same shall be reflected in the Husband\u2019s federal income tax return.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The husband\u2019s income in the years 1955 and 1956 would have been in excess of $32,000 had it not been for the deduction representing the $11,000 alimony payment which appeared in his return. The wife sued. The court refused to allow the deduction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cIn the pilot return of 1953 there was no alimony deduction as no alimony was paid in the prior year. It is evident from the entire agreement that the alimony was, with certain corrections, to approximate one third of defendant\u2019s income. The use of tax returns was to provide a convenient method of determining both income and the share payable to plaintiff. * * * Furthermore, providing defendant\u2019s contentions are correct, if he should at some later date pay alimony to his second wife that also would be a deductible item. It passes the bounds of imagination that this result would represent the intent of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-8\"><em>Estate of Matthews, supra, </em>concerned division of income in a trust between life tenant and remaindermen. The testator had died in 1913 within a few months of the ratification of the income tax amendment. There was nothing in the will tying the term \u201cnet income\u201d to income tax provisions. We see no analogy to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">More nearly in point is the Washington case of <em>Berry </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>v. Berry, </em>50 Wash. 2d 158, 310 P. 2d 223 (1957). There the agreement in controversy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">\u201cEach year hereafter, the Husband shall pay to the Wife, as support money, a sum equal to 12% of his annual net income (before Federal Income Tax) in excess of $5,000.00 as shown upon his Federal Income Tax Return. Such sum shall be due and payable on or before April 1st of each year, commencing April 1, 1952. Said payment due April 1, 1952, shall be for the full calendar year of 1951.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The agreement was incorporated into the divorce decree. The husband contended that his payments were to be made on the basis of the \u201cannual net income\u201d on which his income tax was computed. The wife contended \u201c* * * that the term \u2018net income\u2019 as used in the agreement was used by the parties in its ordinary sense, that is, the amount remaining after deducting ordinary business expenses from gross income, and that reference to federal income tax returns was only made to furnish * * * some fairly reliable source of information as to the amount of * * * [husband\u2019s] income.\u201d The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201cWe are not in accord with the construction placed on the term \u2018net income\u2019 by the wife and adopted by the trial court, in the face of a specific declaration that the husband shall pay to his wife a certain percentage \u2018of his annual net income (before Federal Income Tax) in excess of $5000 as shown upon his Federal Income Tax Return.\u2019 It is difficult to conceive of more apt language to indicate an intention that the payments were to be a percentage of the husband\u2019s net income as computed for income tax purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">It seems to us that careful examination of the portions of the agreement adopted by the decree make it clear that, \u201cnet income\u201d is equated to \u201cnet taxable in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>come\u201d in the original agreement as soon as a prior year\u2019s income tax return was available, that is approximately nine months after the original payments began. The agreement says, \u201c[T]he husband shall pay a sum equal to 50% of his net income to his wife and child for their support * * * and the same basis shall apply each year thereafter, <em>based on the preceding year\u2019s net federal income tax return filed by the husband.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) The parties here did not say the net income of the husband was to be based on his \u201cfederal income tax return\u201d, but said it was to be based on his \u201cnet federal income tax return.\u201d We conclude the insertion of the word \u201cnet\u201d was with the intention that \u201cnet income\u201d should mean \u201cnet taxable income\u201d. Alimony was deductible in the computation of net income for federal tax purposes as were each of the other items concerning which the wife made complaint. Accordingly, the chancellor\u2019s ruling in this regard was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Mrs. Lewis next contends that even if her contentions as to law are overruled, that the court has erred in its determination of the facts, with which position we are in agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The chancellor made a finding of fact as to the net income of Lewis for the years 1961 to 1967, inclusive. Mr. Lewis was obliged to pay 50% of his net income to his wife as alimony and for support of the child. Mrs. Lewis testified as to the payments she received. Mr. Lewis did not dispute her testimony. The income as found by the court was in accordance with the actual income tax returns of Lewis filed in evidence. A table of his income and the amounts paid to Mrs. Lewis is thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Based on Prior Year Year Paid Amt.

He points to paragraph 14 of the articles of separation which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-50\">\u201cIf the husband fails in the due performance of his obligations, hereunder, the wife shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>have the right at her election, to sue for damages for a breach of this agreement, or to rescind the same and seek such legal remedies as may be available to her. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to restrict or impair the wife\u2019s right to exercise this election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Mr. Lewis then proceeds to make the argument that although Code (1966 Kepi. Yol.) Art. 16, \u00a7 28 grants the equity courts \u201cthe power to enforce separation agreements,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the parties have a right to waive or limit their legal remedies in the event of breach of the agreement, that Mrs. Lewis has done this and that equity has no jurisdiction of an action purely for breach of contract, citing <em>Perlmutter v. Minskoff, </em>196 Md. 99, 75 A. 2d 129 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">This is not an action for breach of contract. Mr. Lewis apparently overlooks the fact that the parties here requested the inclusion of paragraphs five and six of the articles of separation in the court\u2019s decree, which was done. Prior to the passage of a decree, paragraph fourteenth might have limited the actions the wife could bring. Thereafter, it was the decree of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County which she was seeking to enforce. In <em>Emerson v. Emerson, </em>120 Md. 584, 87 A. 1033 (1913), Judge Constable said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201cWe are of the opinion, that if a Court approves the provisions of an agreement as to alimony it can incorporate them in its decree, but it, nevertheless, has the same power of modification of the decree as it had in the absence of an agreement. If then remarriage is a ground for the annulment of the provision for alimony, the annulment will take place the same in a decree based upon an agreement as in one founded upon testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>See also <em>Knabe v. Knabe, </em>176 Md. 606, 613, 6 A. 2d 366 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">It would be a peculiar rule of law that would hold that a court after incorporating the provisions of an agreement into a decree could modify the decree, but would be powerless to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed in part and reversed in part and case remanded for passage'of a decree in conformity with this opinion; costs to be paid by the., appellee and cross-appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-51\">.
