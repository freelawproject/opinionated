It does not charge any crime whatever; it does-not specify what appellant peddled or where he peddled it; and there is nothing on the face of the affidavit to justify an amendment. Page 61 of the Laws of 1908 contains all the law on the subject. It will be noted that a foot peddler for each county must pay a license of $30'; a peddler with one horse must pay $40-; a peddler with, a wagon and one horse must pay $50; and a two horse wagon must pay a license of' $80; and a peddler by wagon of tinware or pottery not manufactured in this state must pay $20, but if such pottery or tinware is manufactured by the peddler himself in this state he is exempt from a privilege tax. Now, in which of these-classes of peddlers does this affidavit charge appellant to belong ? Different individuals peddling different articles in different ways pay different amounts for license. This affidavit simply charges that he is carrying on the business of a peddler without obtaining license for that purpose. <em>Non constat, </em>but that he was peddling such property as would exempt him entirely from a privilege license.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-8\">\u25a0 The fine attempted to be imposed by the judgment was. $100. Under Code 1906, \u00a7 3894, which is the law governing-the amount of fines to be imposed for the non-payment of privilege tax, the minimum fine for such case must not be less than an amount equal to five times the tax imposed on such privilege. If we take this code provision to determine the charge against him, appellant was tried for peddling with wagon tinware or pottery, or both, not manufactured in this state, $20. This is the lowest license under the statute required to be paid by peddlers. But the law will not allow such reasoning to be-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>adopted in order to make good an affidavit like tbe one under consideration.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b660-6\"><em>George Butter, </em>assistant attorney-general, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-7\">Appellant contends that tbe affidavit upon wbicli tbe conviction rests is absolutely void in tbat it does not specify wbat \u25a0appellant peddled or bow be peddled it, whether on foot or by \u2022wagon.\u2019 Tbe affidavit is not so specific as it might have been, \u2022but all possible defects could have been cured by amendment, \u2022and, \u2019 therefore, there is no merit in this suggestion.
