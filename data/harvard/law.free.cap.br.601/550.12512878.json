Dr. Luis Fernando Alvarado Ortiz (the \"Foreign Administrator\") sought recognition of the Colombian Insolvency Proceedings in the United States through a Chapter 15 Bankruptcy (Case Number 17-16559-BKC-LMI).

On October 6, 2017, the Foreign Administrator filed a Petition for Recognition of Foreign Proceeding (ECF #1) (the \"Petition for Recognition\") (Case Number 17-22193-BKC-LMI) asking this Court to recognize the Debtor's Colombian insolvency action (the \"Colombian Intervention Proceeding\") as a foreign non-main proceeding, which recognition the Court granted in its Order Granting Recognition of Colombian Proceeding as a Foreign Non-Main Proceeding Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201517\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ECF #18) (the \"Order of Recognition\") dated December 18, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel for the Debtor lodged an objection to recognition at the recognition hearing but conceded that, at the time, he had no evidence to present in support of the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Debtor filed the Motion to Terminate approximately five months after the Order for Recognition was entered.

However, the Motion to Terminate never articulates\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the purposes of chapter 15 were not served by the recognition by this Court of the Colombian Intervention Proceeding as a foreign non-main proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The relief the Debtor actually appears to have sought in the Motion to Terminate is set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201517\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) which states that \"[T]he provisions of this subchapter do not prevent modification or termination of recognition if it is shown that the grounds for granting it were fully or partially lacking or have ceased to exist, but in considering such action the court shall give due weight to possible prejudice to parties that have relied upon the order granting recognition.\" Section 1517(d) is a purely discretionary provision. For a modification or termination to occur, the Court must apply a two-part test. The test is disjunctive - there must be a showing that the grounds for granting recognition (1) were fully or partially lacking (this test looks backwards to the time of recognition) or (2) have ceased to exist (this test looks forward\n   from the time of recognition). \"[T]he reviewing court that evaluates the presence or absence of either one of those prongs may consider new evidence and it is not limited to considering only the evidence that was or ought to have been available at the time the court granted recognition.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Sullivan v.

E.D. Va. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As this case and issues therein evolved over several continuances and discovery battles, the ultimate disputed issues to be resolved at trial were identified by the Foreign Administrator and the Debtor in a Joint Pretrial Stipulation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   a. Whether the judicial intervention proceeding in Colombia qualifies as a \"foreign proceeding\" as defined in section 101(23) subject to the Court's recognition pursuant to section 1517.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   b. Whether the continued recognition of the Colombia Proceeding would be \"manifestly contrary to public policy of the United States\" such that the public policy exception under section 1506 should be applied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   c. Whether the Debtor is an \"individual\" as that term is used in section 1501(c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   d. Whether the Debtor is a \"debtor\" as that term is used in section 1502(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Foreign Administrator moved for a directed verdict at trial, which the Court granted as to all the issues other than the third - that is, whether the Debtor is a debtor under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201501\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The issue of whether the Debtor is a debtor under section 1501(c) is a two-fold inquiry. Section 1501(c) states that chapter 15\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   does not apply to -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) an individual, or to an individual and such individual's spouse, who have debts within the limits specified in section 109(e) and who are citizens of the United States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States;...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   11 U.S.C. 1501(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court made a finding on the record during trial that the Debtor has proven that, at least for now, she has permanent residence in the United States. Whether that will change shortly is not the Court's immediate concern and, based on the balance of the Court's finding, does not impact this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court took the second inquiry under advisement, that is, whether the claims of the Colombian government are contingent or unliquidated such that the Debtor \"[has] debts within the limits specified in section 109(e)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\" The Foreign Administrator, Dr. Alvarado, testified that the Debtor is jointly and severally liable with all other intervened debtors in the Colombian case for a total of $220,000,000. That being the case, the Foreign Administrator asserts, the Debtor's debts clearly exceed the statutory limits of section 109(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Debtor argues that the claim of the Colombian government is contingent and unliquidated and therefore cannot be included in calculating the Debtor's debt limit\n   under section 109(e). First, the Debtor argues, the Foreign Administrator, in his original declaration in support of the Petition for Recognition (ECF #5), stated that \"the Colombian government estimates that Estraval and its principals defrauded investors out of 600 Billion Colombian pesos ($220,000,000 US dollars) and its investigation into the fraud remains ongoing.\" Thus, the Debtor argues, because the claim amount is\n   <em>\n    estimated\n   </em>\n   , the debt is still unliquidated and does not count. Second, the Foreign Administrator testified that the ultimate amount of the debt will be reduced at such time as all assets that are subject to seizure and liquidation are, in fact, liquidated. Thus, the Debtor argues, the claim is both contingent (if other sources of payment pay the obligation in full) and unliquidated because the ultimate claim will be or could be reduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As this Court wrote in\n   <em>\n    In re Perez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3316038\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/400/879/\">\n    400 B.R. 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

At trial, Dr. Alvarado testified that the amount due and owing was $220,000,000, that the number is now fixed. Dr. Alvarado also testified, without contradiction, that the value of the assets that are subject to liquidation will not satisfy the debt. As the Court observed when it ruled on the Debtor's public policy argument at trial, the Debtor appealed her intervention in the Colombian Intervention Proceeding in the Colombian courts in August of 2017, which the Colombian appellate body rejected in October of 2017, thus the Debtor's status as an intervened debtor has been finally determined. Moreover, because there will be some liability, based on Dr. Alvarado's unrebutted testimony that the value of the assets that will be liquidated will not be sufficient to pay the claim in full, the Debtor will ultimately have some obligation to pay. Thus, the claim of the Colombian government is not contingent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The only remaining issue is whether the other sources of payment of the debt - liquidation of assets, collection from the primary debtors, collection from other intervened debtors - and the consequent uncertainty as to the actual amount that the Debtor may be ultimately required to pay, means the claim is unliquidated. Do any of these factors render the amount owed by the Debtor to the Colombian government subject to the exercise of discretion by the trier of fact? The answer is \"no\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court looked to Florida law to determine the answer to this last question since the issue is the Debtor's qualifications to be a chapter 13 debtor, which eligibility is based on the Debtor's Florida residency (the Debtor has lived in Florida for several years). Under Florida law, a collateral source of payment does not reduce the liability of a tortfeasor or contract debtor if there is joint and several liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re General Coffee Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121507\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/85/905/\">\n    85 B.R. 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

The Foreign Administrator testified that all of the intervened debtors are jointly and severally liable for the debt to the Colombian government. Because the Debtor's obligations to the Colombian government are fixed, and not in need of further calculation, other than with respect to other possible sources of recovery, the Colombian government's claim is liquidated, and therefore the Debtor could not qualify as a debtor under section 109(e). Consequently, the Debtor cannot claim the section 1501(c)(2) exemption from Chapter 15 eligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Debtor never pursued dismissal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20305\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; moreover, the Debtor certainly did not provide any proof that section 305(a) relief was appropriate.
