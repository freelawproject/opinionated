Manning, Chief United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 11 and 25, 2017, a trial was held on the complaint (the \"Complaint\"), filed by James Berman, the Chapter 7 Trustee (the \"Plaintiff\"). The Complaint seeks to have the debt evidenced by a certain stipulated judgment (the \"Stipulated Judgment\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   entered against Jon C. Leary (the \"Defendant\"), in the amount of $ 1,189,250.00, declared nondischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) and \u00a7 523(a)(6). The Plaintiff alleges that the Stipulated Judgment debt arises out of the Defendant's fraudulent activities in connection with a Ponzi scheme operated by Michael S. Goldberg (the \"Goldberg Scheme\"), and is therefore nondischargeable based on the Defendant's \"actual fraud\" and \"willful and malicious conduct\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The allegations in the Complaint are predicated upon the Amended Proposed Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law issued by this Court in the Goldberg Adversary Proceeding (the \"Amended Findings\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which were accepted by the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut with minor exceptions not relevant here (the \"District Court Order\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each party called witnesses and introduced exhibits during trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, judgment will enter in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). This Court has authority to hear and determine this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and the Order of Reference of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut dated September 21, 1984. The instant action is a core proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and (b)(2)(I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52, made applicable to this adversary proceeding through Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052, the following are the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    The Goldberg Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   1. For a period of about twelve years, Michael S. Goldberg (\"Mr. Goldberg\"), and Michael S. Goldberg, LLC, occasionally d/b/a Acquisitions Unlimited Group (\"AUG\"), which was controlled by Mr. Goldberg (collectively, the \"Goldberg Debtors\"), operated the Goldberg Scheme, a pure Ponzi scheme with no legitimate business purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pre-trial Stipulation dated October 10, 2017 (the \"Stipulation,\" Adv. Proc. No. 15-02039, ECF No. 64), \u00b6 1; Amended Findings p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   2. The Goldberg Scheme did not involve any legitimate, actual business, or investment activity by the Goldberg Debtors. In fact, the only revenues derived in connection with the Goldberg Scheme were the moneys the Goldberg Debtors collected from a succession of new investors, whose money was then used to repay the earlier investors their original investment and guaranteed profits. Amended Findings pp. 4-5, 16; Plaintiff's Exh. D \u00b6 11. The transfers by the Goldberg Debtors in furtherance of the Goldberg Scheme were made with actual fraudulent intent. Amended Findings pp. 62-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   3. The Goldberg Scheme consisted of two types of business deals: 1) \"Diamond Liquidation Deals\"; 2) \"Chase Asset Deals\". Amended Findings p. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   4. The Diamond Liquidation Deals purported to give the Goldberg Debtors access to purchase diamonds at very low wholesale prices and pay investors a rate of return of approximately twenty percent (20%) every sixty (60) days, while purporting to grant investors a security interest in the diamonds. Plaintiff's Exh. D \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   5. As evidenced by a fabricated \"Chase Foreclosure Manifest,\" the Chase Asset Deals purportedly gave the Goldberg Debtors the contractual right to purchase foreclosed assets from Chase Manhattan Bank that the Goldberg Debtors would then sell, in prearranged sales, to large companies such as Bechtel Corporation and Swinerton Builders. Amended Findings p. 14. The Chase Asset Deals also provided that Chase Manhattan Bank was obligated to refund the full amount of the purchase price if the Goldberg Debtors were unable to re-sell the acquired assets to the ultimate buyer. Amended Findings p. 19; Plaintiff's Exh. D \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   6. In his contracts with the investors in the Chase Asset Deals (the \"Chase Contract(s)\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Goldberg pretended to use the investment funds to buy foreclosed or seized properties for resale and to give investors back their initial investment plus a 20% profit margin. The Chase Contracts were characterized to be between Mr.\n   Goldberg representing AUG and the individually named investors. Amended Findings p. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   7. The Chase Contracts were generally for a period of 90 days, but many investors reinvested all of the proceeds from the earlier investment so that the effective annual returns would be substantially in excess of 100% from compounded profits. In many of the Chase Contracts, Mr. Goldberg represented that\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   , not the investor, would be responsible for paying any income tax owed by the investors on the profits generated (emphasis added). Amended Findings p. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   8. As word of these high returns on the purportedly risk and tax-free investments spread, an increasing number of investors (together, the \"Sub-investors\"), wanted in on the Goldberg Scheme. This increased investment activity was largely attributable to the Goldberg Debtors' \"feeders\" such as the Defendant's client, Edward Malley (\"Mr. Malley\"). These \"feeders\" had significant financial incentive to bring in potential investors to receive a percentage of the investment dollars they brought in and, in some instances, a finder's fee up to 10% on investments made by their investors. Amended Findings p. 17; Plaintiff's Exh. D \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   9. When major investors began demanding full payment on their investments, the Goldberg Debtors began making late payments while trying to find replacement investors. The late payments created increased concern among large investors. Amended Findings p. 17; Plaintiff's Exh. D \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   10. Ultimately, Mr. Goldberg was sued and his assets were frozen by a group of large investors whose contracts he never paid. In November 2009, Mr. Goldberg voluntarily turned himself in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Amended Findings p. 17; Plaintiff's Exh. D \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    The Defendant's Involvement in the Goldberg Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   11. The Defendant is an attorney and was the sole member of the law firm of Kablick &amp; Leary, P.C. (\"K &amp; L\"), at least as early as 1997. Transcript of the Trial held on October 11, 2017\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Oct. 11 Tr.,\" ECF No. 74), at 24:19-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   12. K &amp; L is no longer operating. During the time that K &amp; L was operating, it maintained an IOLTA Account (the \"IOLTA Account'). Oct. 11 Tr. at 26:25-27:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   13. The Defendant learned about the Goldberg Scheme through his friend and client of fourteen years, Mr. Malley. During the period of 2005 through 2009, Mr. Malley extensively invested in the Goldberg Scheme and worked as a \"feeder,\" soliciting other persons to enter into financial transactions with him and the Goldberg Debtors. Amended Findings pp. 23-24; Oct. 11 Tr. at 43:11-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   14. The Defendant was first shown a Chase Contract by Mr. Malley in 2005. The Defendant discovered and advised Mr. Malley that AUG was not registered either as a corporation or an LLC with the Office of the Connecticut Secretary of State. The Defendant also expressed concerns about the unprofessional manner in which the Chase Contract was drafted and its unusually high rates of return of 20% plus margin per quarter. Amended Findings pp. 15 n.17, 20; Oct. 11 Tr. at 34:14-35, 39:1-6, 40:7-24; Plaintiff's Exh. J at 97:10-100:13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   15. At some time between 2005 and 2006, the Defendant also expressed his\n   concern to Mr. Malley about the Chase Contract's questionable representation that the Goldberg Debtors would pay Mr. Malley's taxes and advised Mr. Malley to pay his taxes himself. Amended Findings pp. 19-20; Oct. 11 Tr. at 38:5-15; Plaintiff's Exh. J at 99:1-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   16. The Defendant also knew that Mr. Goldberg was not a professional investor, and in fact worked as a medical device salesman. Oct. 11 Tr. at 163:23-164:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   17. At no time prior to making his first investments, nor at any time thereafter, did the Defendant inquire of Mr. Goldberg as to whether he had any licenses or permits that were necessary to run his businesses nor was he provided with a name of the Mr. Goldberg's alleged accountant. Amended Findings p. 67; Oct. 11 Tr. at 125:25-126:4, 164: 5-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   18. Despite the signs of the fraudulent nature of the Goldberg Scheme, in April 2006, the Defendant invested $ 100,000.00 with Mr. Malley with the understanding that Mr. Malley would be investing the money with the Goldberg Debtors. The Defendant ultimately received a return on his investment of 20-25% per quarter in the total amount equal to what Mr. Malley received from the Goldberg Debtors, with Mr. Malley collecting no fee. Amended Findings pp. 20, 26; Oct. 11 Tr. at 43:21-25, 44:13-45:13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   19. The Defendant understood his repayment from Mr. Malley was dependent upon there actually being a profit on his investment with the Goldberg Debtors. Amended Findings p. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   20. The Defendant and Mr. Malley sometimes treated Sub-investors' money as loans directly to themselves. Each used the money for his own purpose, allowing their own funds to be invested longer with the Goldberg Debtors. Amended Findings p. 26. In one occasion, the money received from an acquaintance of the Defendant, Frank Mete, was divided up between the Defendant and Mr. Malley for their own use. Amended Findings p. 26, n.37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   21. The Defendant drafted materials soliciting the Sub-investors to invest in the Goldberg Scheme and invested money into the Goldberg Scheme on behalf of his cousins' Trust, the \"Nick and Jenny Angelillo Trust\". Amended Findings p. 24; Oct. 11 Tr. at 44:16-45:3, 51-52, 132:21-23; Plaintiff's Exhibit DD, FF, and HH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   22. Between January and February 2008, the Defendant prepared an opinion letter as part of the effort to convince Robert Gengras (\"Mr. Gengras\"), to invest in the Goldberg Scheme. Amended Findings p. 24. In the letter, the Defendant wrote that the investment was \"operated by a limited liability company ... in good standing under the laws of the State of Connecticut\", despite his knowledge that AUC was not a registered LLC. The letter also falsely claimed that Mr. Malley and Mr. Goldberg had been business partners in a private investment. Amended Findings p. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   23. Along with the opinion letter, the Defendant also prepared an information sheet that described the general nature of the Goldberg Scheme for Mr. Gengras. The information sheet contained many falsehoods, including that Mr. Malley was a partner in the Goldberg Scheme and that Mr. Malley and Mr. Goldberg had been \"accepted as a certified vendor in connection with the New Orleans reconstruction, enabling the company to sell goods to certified contractors.\" Amended Findings pp. 24-25. Mr. Gengras, in a meeting with the Defendant and Mr. Malley, was told that \"he could make a profit of three times his investment over a period of six months to a year.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Mr. Gengras decided not to invest with the Goldberg Debtors as such high returns promised with \"all the\n   secrecy and ... no hard date, no clear-cut names, ranks, serial number\" were \"too cloudy\" and \"too shady.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   24. Throughout the period in which Mr. Malley worked as a \"feeder\" for the Goldberg Debtors, the Defendant also drafted promissory notes for most of Mr. Malley's investors (collectively, the \"Malley Notes\"). Amended Findings pp. 20, 23, 26-27; Plaintiff's Exh. J at 117:17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   25. The Malley Notes drafted by the Defendant were copied by other \"feeders\" such as Mr. LaBonte in drafting their own promissory notes with third parties. Amended Findings pp. 31, 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   26. The Defendant was the only person who had control over the IOLTA Account. Between July 15, 2005 and September 16, 2008, the Defendant, at the direction of Mr. Malley, effectuated and oversaw the transfers of about $ 3,934,500.00 to the Goldberg Debtors through the IOLTA Account. The transfers included investments by himself, Mr. Malley, and the Sub-investors solicited by Mr. Malley. Amended Findings p. 20; Oct. 11 Tr. at 27:3-29:16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   27. In 2008 and 2009, the Defendant withdrew nearly $ 1,200,000.00 from the Goldberg Scheme through his IOLTA Account and ultimately received a profit of over $ 1,000,000.00 on his investment. Plaintiff's Exh. J at 104:12-14, 114:23-116, 154-14, 158:12-14, 163:17-19, 166:3-6, 166:14-16; Oct. 11. Tr. at 84:4-7, 172:5-174:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   28. Between about July 17, 2008 and November 4, 2009, the Defendant effectuated and oversaw the re-transfer of approximately $ 12,366,000.00 from the Goldberg Debtors to the IOLTA Account, which he then distributed to himself, Mr. Malley, and the Sub-investors. Amended Findings p. 21; Plaintiff's Exh. K at 187:23-188:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   29. In August 2009, the Defendant sent an e-mail to his cousins stating he expected to receive payments for the Nick and Jenny Angelillo Trust funds the Defendant invested into the Goldberg Scheme and assured them that \"the money is there and will be paid\" without any basis to support such claim. Plaintiff's Exhibit HH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   30. By the Fall of 2008, the Defendant was sending e-mails to Mr. Goldberg expressing concern over the delay in payments and started pursuing substantial repayment of his investment. Amended Findings p. 34; Plaintiff's Exh. J at 165: 6-166:1; Plaintiff's Exh. K at 202:20-203:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   31. The Defendant received fees for his accounting services rendered for Mr. Malley's investments with the Goldberg Debtors. Amended Findings p. 83; Oct. 11. Tr. at 84:4-7; Plaintiff's Exh. J at 114:23-116, 154:14, 158:12-14, 163:17-19, 166:3-6, 166:14-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   32. On November 18, 2009, an involuntary Chapter 7 was filed against Mr. Goldberg. The Goldberg Adversary Proceeding was commenced in the Goldberg Chapter 7 case on May 14, 2010. The Defendant and K &amp; L were among the more than thirty (30) named defendants in the Goldberg Adversary Proceeding. Amended Findings p. 3; Plaintiff's Exh. X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   33. The claims asserted against the Defendant and others in the Goldberg Adversary Proceeding included, but were not limited to, claims for intentional fraudulent transfers set forth in the Twelfth and Fourteenth Claims for Relief. Plaintiff's Exh. D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   34. A trial on the First, Second, Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, and Fourteenth Claims for Relief in the Goldberg Adversary Proceeding was held on June 13, 14, 15, 22, and 23, 2011 (the \"Trial\"). Amended Findings p. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   35. On the first day of Trial, prior to the introduction of evidence, the Plaintiff reported that he had reached a settlement with the defendants Jon Leary (the Defendant in the instant adversary proceeding), Laura Leary, and K &amp; L. The Defendant's counsel was present when the report was made on the record that the Defendant agreed to stipulate to the entry of a judgment against him in the amount of $ 1,189.250.00. Amended Findings p. 2, n. 1; Transcript of Trial held on June 13, 2011, in Goldberg Adversary Proceeding at p. 31 (ECF No. 417 in Adv. Pro. No. 10-2082).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   36. The Defendant was called as a witness and testified at the Trial. Amended Findings p. 23; Transcript of Trial held on June 13, 2011, in Goldberg Adversary Proceeding at p. 134 (ECF No. 417 in Adv. Pro. No. 10-2082).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   37. After the Trial was concluded, the Plaintiff and the Defendant filed the Stipulated Judgment on July 8, 2011. The Stipulated Judgment provided that a judgment enter against the Defendant in the amount of $ 1,189,250.00. Plaintiff's Exh. C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   38. On July 20, 2011, the Court \"Approved and So Ordered\" the Stipulated Judgment (ECF No. 442 in Adv. Pro. No. 10-2082).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   39. On March 11, 2015, the Defendant filed his voluntary Chapter 7 case entitled\n   <em>\n    In re:\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jon C.
