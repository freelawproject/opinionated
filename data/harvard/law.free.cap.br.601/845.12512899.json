Vargas Moya and Sandra Ramirez P\u00e9rez (\"Plaintiffs\" or \"Debtors\"); the\n   <em>\n    Response to Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment and Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof\n   </em>\n   filed by the Administraci\u00f3n Sistemas de Retiro de los Empleados de Gobierno y la Judicatura (\"Retiro\") (Docket No. 42); and the\n   <em>\n    Reply to Support of Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   filed by the Plaintiffs (Docket No. 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Debtors, David Noel Vargas Moya and Sandra Ramirez P\u00e9rez, filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on March 22, 2012. (Lead Case 12-02105, Docket No. 1). Debtors' plan dated March 12, 2012 (Lead Case, Docket No. 2) was confirmed on May 30, 2012. (Lead case, Docket No. 22). A post-confirmation modification of the plan was filed by the Debtors on July 7, 2013 (Docket No. 56) and granted by the court on March 8, 2016 (Lead Case, Docket No. 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 25, 2016, the Debtors, David Noel Vargas Moya and Sandra Ramirez P\u00e9rez filed the present Adversary Proceeding against the Administraci\u00f3n Sistemas de Retiro de los Empleados de Gobierno y la Judicatura ET AL (Docket No. 1). The Plaintiffs alleged that Retiro, with actual notice and knowledge of the\n   bankruptcy case, willfully collected an unsecured claim scheduled in Debtor's bankruptcy case which was subject to the automatic stay. The Plaintiffs alleged that Retiro had attempted to obtain secured status of its lien by presenting an unregistered mortgage note in the Property Registrar after the filing of the petition. Moreover, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendant resumed monthly garnishments post-petition from the Debtor's paycheck, and that they have been \"seriously distressed and damaged\" by Retiro's wage garnishment. On the same date, the Plaintiffs filed an\n   <em>\n    Urgent Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 2) and\n   <em>\n    Memorandum of Law in Support for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 3). The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendant was causing irreparable damage to the Debtors, the bankruptcy estate and the interest of other creditors, as Retiro's actions jeopardized the Debtors' ability to continue their Chapter 13 payments and obtain the Discharge Injunction Order upon completion of the payment plan. On their\n   <em>\n    Memorandum of Law\n   </em>\n   , the Plaintiffs argued that the prongs for temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction were met, that is: (a) that the Defendant had clearly violated the automatic stay while attempting to collect the debt post-petition and, therefore, there was likelihood of success on the merits, (b) that the Defendants were causing irreparable harm to the Debtors, as the Defendants actions forced them to default on the confirmed payment plan, (c) that in the balance of equities, a TRO or injunction will not harm the Defendant as they had failed to collect for a \"now unrecoverable credit for forty seven months\", and (d) that the effect of the public interest favored injunctive relief \"since it would send a message to third parties that they must respect the Orders of this Honorable Court, specifically the Automatic Stay Order...\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Retiro filed its\n   <em>\n    Answer for Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 13), stating that at the moment the request for temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction was filed, Retiro had already requested the agency to stop the deductions of Debtor's wage and that Retiro had informed the Debtors that it could take a \"few payrolls\" in order for it to stop. Additionally, the Defendant stated that the Plaintiff failed to meet the requirements for injunctive remedy, as they had no probability to prevail on the merits. The Defendants alleged that the Debtors had no legal basis to assert that Retiro's claim was unsecured, considering that the debt is secured \"as per 3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 779a, and cannot be discharged under section 523(a)(18) of the Title 11 of US Code\". As stated by the Defendant \"if the moving party cannot demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest, the remaining factors become matters of idle curiosity\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 18, 2016, the Defendant filed its\n   <em>\n    Motion for Extension of Time to File Dispositive Motion or Otherwise Plead\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 15). On May 20, 2016, the court held the TRO and/or temporary injunctive relief hearing, and the request was held in abeyance (Docket No. 18). Additionally, the Defendant was granted until June 20, 2016, to answer the complaint. On June 20, 2016, Retiro filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss Adversary Proceeding\n   </em>\n   stating that the Plaintiffs had failed to state a claim against the Defendant upon which relied could be granted (Docket No. 20) and an\n   <em>\n    Answer to Complaint\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 21). Retiro asserted that the Debtors had applied for a mortgage loan which was approved on September 28\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2010, and received the amount of $ 100,00.00. Pursuant to the\n   Promissory Note and Pension Loan Repayment Schedule, the Debtors were to make monthly payments continuously until February 2041. The Debtor signed an authorization consenting to Retiro's withdrawal of the payment from his monthly wages and consenting to a lien on his retirement funds, present and future, as well as all the savings that he might have in the Puerto Rico Commonwealth Employees Association (\"AEELA\"), including any other benefit or payment, which the debtor might earn from the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Additionally, the Retiro statute grants a statutory lien that deems all its claims as secured with the Debtors' retirement funds. Furthermore, the Defendant alleged that section 362(b)(19) allowed Retiro to continue the withholding from Debtors' wages. The Defendant stated that the collection of a retirement loan is excepted from the automatic stay. Additionally, section 1322(f) states that a plan may not materially alter the terms of a loan described in section 362(b)(19) and any amounts required to repay such loan shall not constitute \"disposable income\" under section 1325. Furthermore, the Defendant alleged that the Debtors' personal obligation to the Retiro loan is not discharged, pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(18). The Defendant alleged that it meets the exception of section 362(b)(19) which requires: (1) that the plan must be a pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or other plan established under one of 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code Sections that is sponsored by the debtor's employer or an affiliate, successor or predecessor of such employer; and (2) the loan must be a loan from a plan under section 408(b)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or subject to section 72(p) of the Internal Revenue Code or a loan from a thrifts saving plan permitted under subchapter III of Chapter 84 of Title 5 of the United States Code that satisfies the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208433\">\n    5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The Defendant additionally alleged that punitive damages cannot be imposed to the Commonwealth or its agencies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Debtors filed their\n   <em>\n    Response to Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   alleging that: (1) the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code in which the Defendant relies when discussing sections 362(b)(19) and 523(a)(8) \"only regulate the effect of the automatic stay and the discharge upon personal loan benefits to thrift savings plan participants and must not be confused with mortgage loan benefits offered under those plans at issue in this proceeding\"; (2) the garnishments against Debtor's salary were meant to enforce the mortgage loan and not the statutory lien; (3) section 362(a)(4) and/or (5) forbids enforcement of \"any lien\"; (4) under Puerto Rico Law, recording is essential for the validity of a mortgage and that \"one that is not recorded is a nullity\" (Docket No. 23). As alleged by the Plaintiffs \"...any other accessory documents or alleged guarantees signed by Debtor and Retiro for purposes of supporting the mortgage loan are a nullity and unenforceable in the bankruptcy court\". For the stated reasons, the Plaintiffs objected the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , affirming that the complaint pleaded correctly that Retiro violated the automatic stay, and that the complaint stated plausible claims for relief for willful stay violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Defendant filed its\n   <em>\n    Reply to Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   on July 13, 2016 (Docket No. 24). Retiro stated that regardless of the mortgage being void, the Retiro loan continued to be a secured claim, because 33 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 779a(c) grants a statutory lien on debtor's retirement funds and benefits. The Defendant alleged that, at the moment a participant voluntarily decided to obtain a\n   loan from Retiro, a statutory lien attaches to all the contributions accrued and to be accrued on behalf of the borrower in the System, as well as all the savings he might have with AEELA, including any other benefit or payment, which the participant might earn from the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, as provided by statute. Retiro alleged that the lien is effective by operation of law and that the Debtors had not presented any legal authority requiring any further act for its statutory lien to attach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Plaintiff's filed a\n   <em>\n    Sur-Reply to Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , alleging that a mortgage could not be called a personal loan, for purposes of enforcement of the automatic stay under the Code, and that Retiro was attempting to \"transmute a mortgage loan into an ordinary personal loan to bring it under the stay-exempt provisions of 362(b)(19)\" (Docket No. 26). The Plaintiff alleged that the mortgage was a consensual lien supporting a secured transaction much greater than Debtor's accumulated retirement savings account and that \"...a personal loan of the type specifically incorporated into the Code from subchapter III of chapter 84 of Title 5 of the US Code that satisfies the requirements of section 8433(g), cannot be greater than Debtor's accumulate retirement savings.\" Additionally, the Plaintiffs alleged that considering the nullity of the mortgage, any other accessory documents or alleged guarantees signed by the Debtor and Retiro for purposes of supporting the mortgage loan are a nullity and unenforceable. The court heard the parties on September 9, 2016 (Docket No. 29). The\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   and its\n   <em>\n    Reply\n   </em>\n   were held in abeyance and the parties were granted time to file a settlement agreement and to file dispositive motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 28, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed their\n   <em>\n    Motion for Summary Judgment and Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 41). The Plaintiffs clarified that there was only one legal issue remaining to be addressed by the court, that is, if Retiro's statutory lien under Article 4-106 attaches to the Debtor's post-petition contributions accumulated in his retirement account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As posed by the Plaintiffs, the bankruptcy law cuts off and voids Retiro's statutory lien, starting from the date of the petition, while Retiro argues that its lien continues to attach to the contributions deposited in the Debtor's retirement account on a post-petition basis. The Plaintiffs allege that \"settled bankruptcy law compels that Retiro's alleged statutory priority over the postpetition funds in Debtor's pension account must be subordinated to the paramount public policy underlining the discharge and the Debtors' right to a fresh start...\" The Debtors argue that Retiro's initial lien originates from an unrecorded mortgage loan and, therefore, a security interest. As the lien was unrecorded in the Property Registrar at the moment of the petition, the Debtors argue that the filing of the petition nullified the debtors' mortgage obligation and, therefore, also nullified the continuing nature of the statutory lien. The Debtors, citing\n   <em>\n    In Re West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6715850\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/128/205/\">\n    128 F. 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. OR. 1904), allege that, considering that the initial loan was a mortgage loan, it cannot \"continue under the guise of some other loan or obligation and the lien must fail\". The Plaintiffs further state that the holding in\n   <em>\n    In Re Miranda Soto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"463851,6555924\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/667/235/\">\n    667 F.2d 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (1st Cir. 1981) is applicable to the present situation. The Plaintiffs state that AEELA's continuing\n   statutory lien operates similarly to Retiro's lien. In\n   <em>\n    In re Miranda\n   </em>\n   , the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit determined that an assignment of future property could only attach to property rights that a debtor had at the time of the filing of the petition. The Plaintiffs additionally argue that the facts in\n   <em>\n    In Re Feliciano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6104641\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/111/380/\">\n    111 B.R. 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D.P.R. 1990) are \"identical\" to the present case, as \"Retiro is asserting an analogous statutory lien under Article 4-106 in order to attach funds deducted from the Debtor's post-petition wages and deposited in his retirement account. Funds that exist only by virtue of the fruits of Debtor's post-petition labor.\" The Plaintiffs further state that \"[a] statutory lien must yield to the fundamental; public policy of the bankruptcy discharge and fresh start\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 21, 2017, Retiro filed its\n   <em>\n    Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 42). The Defendant argues that it has a statutory lien as defined by Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code, which arises solely by force of state law, referencing Article 4-106 of Law 447-1951, supra, 33 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 779a(c), that attaches to all the contributions accrued and to be accrued on behalf of the borrower in the System, as well as other benefits, as provided by statute. Retiro argues that the lien commenced at the moment the participant decided to obtain the loan from Retiro and that the Defendant needs not to act further for the lien to attach. Therefore, as argued by the Defendant, the lien is not dependent on the inscription of the mortgage deed. Although there was no mortgage at the time of the filing of the petition, \"as soon as the debtor received the loan and the creditor accepts the promissory note accepting the debt, the mortgage contract becomes valid and binding for one and the other contracting party\",\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liechty v. Descartes Saur\u00ed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8811960\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pr-dec/109/496/\">\n    109 D.P.R. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). The Defendant argues that the lien will continue to attach to the co-debtor's contributions made to his retirement account, only up to the amount that may correspond to the value of the debt. Retiro further clarified that the decision in\n   <em>\n    In Re Feliciano\n   </em>\n   cited by the Plaintiffs discussed a lien that arose from a security interest assigned by the debtor through a promissory note and not by a specific statutory mandate. Furthermore, Retiro argues that the Court in\n   <em>\n    Fonseca v. Gov't Emples. Ass'n (AEELA)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361567\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/628/\">\n    542 B.R. 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. BAP 2015) recognized that although, generally, a lien can only attach to property that the debtor owned, or had rights to, at the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petition, there are, however, exceptions to the general rule, as, for example, some statutes specifically expanded the scope of the lien to include after-acquired property. Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    In Re West\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In Re Miranda\n   </em>\n   decisions also refer to liens held on account of a security interest and not a statutory lien. The Defendant additionally alleges that the Debtors' debt to Retiro is nondischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(18) and that the debtor's contributions to the retirement funds are not property of the estate as excluded by \u00a7 541(b)(7)(i)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 10, 2017, the parties filed a\n   <em>\n    Stipulation and Partial Settlement Agreement\n   </em>\n   , agreeing upon all matters presented in the Complaint, except for the following: (1) whether Retiro has a statutory lien over the totality of the debtor's retirement funds and benefits-including future funds or contributions made by the debtor to the retirement system, or if the statutory lien only applies to the retirement funds accumulated up to the filing of the plaintiffs' bankruptcy petition on March 12\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2012, and (2) Whether any portion of Retiro's claim shall be discharged in bankruptcy\n   (Docket No. 43). The Stipulation was approved on May 5, 2017 (Docket No. 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 30, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed a\n   <em>\n    Reply in Support of Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 57). The Debtors reargued there position as to the statutory lien, and, additionally, argued that the unrecorded mortgage loan was made relying on the mortgage agreement itself, and not on the statutory lien of Article 4-106, in order to enforce its claim and that the statutory lien is an \"afterthought\" of Retiro, upon realizing that the mortgage is unenforceable. The Debtors additionally argue that, as in\n   <em>\n    In Re Rivera Feliciano\n   </em>\n   , Retiro's claim is a security agreement and that, as in said case, \"the assignment of debtor's wage deductions contributed to the pension fund held by Retiro... is limited to those wages earned and deducted on the date this petition was filed.\" The Debtors allege that Retiro's \"...reliance on 523(a)(18) is misplaced because that statute only regulates the effect of the discharge upon personal loan benefits to thrift savings plan participants and must not be confused with mortgage loan benefits offered under those plans at issue in this proceeding. As such, Retiro's main defense against the obvious inapplicability of a continuing lien to the discharged mortgage claim is flawed because we are not dealing here with a \"personal loan\" obligation\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 8, 2017, the court requested the parties to inform if the present adversary proceeding was stayed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202161\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2164 on account of the filing of the Title III Petition (Docket No. 58). On August 11, 2017, Retiro filed a\n   <em>\n    Notice of Commencement of Case Under Title III of PROMESA and of Automatic Stay Proceedings\n   </em>\n   , requesting the court to stay the proceedings (Docket No. 71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 13, 2017, The Plaintiffs filed their\n   <em>\n    Memorandum of Law Re: Orders at Docket 58, 67 (Remaining Cause of Action and Applicability of PROMESA)\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 87). The Plaintiffs argued that the Stay of PROMESA was not applicable to the present adversary proceeding, as the issues pending for the court's consideration did not fit as a \"liability\" pursuant to the definition included in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202194\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and stated that Retiro had voluntarily submitted the remaining issues to this court's consideration through the\n   <em>\n    Stipulation and Partial Settlement\n   </em>\n   filed between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 24, 2018, Retiro informed the court that the parties were discussing the possibility of requesting the Relief of Stay in the PROMESA case to continue with the proceedings in the adversary proceeding and requested the court additional time to inform (Docket No. 93). On July 26, 2018, The Plaintiffs informed the court that they Stay had been lifted in the PROMESA case, to continue the present proceedings, allowing the court to adjudicate the\n   <em>\n    Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   files the Plaintiffs and its\n   <em>\n    Opposition\n   </em>\n   thereto (Docket No. 103).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Applicable Law and Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Standard for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Fed.

First, the Retiro lien attaches to \"...any amount a participant is entitled to receive as a final liquidation for accrued regular vacation or sick leave owed by the agency, entity, or department in which he/she worked or from the savings liquidation that the Puerto Rico Government Employee Association must make, or from the contributions or interest accrued on the System, any amount owed for personal, cultural, or mortgage loans, or loans originated as provided in \u00a7 785a of this title, by said participant when she/he permanently ceases or separates from service\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, this aspect of Retiro's statutory lien is not controverted in the present adversary proceeding. Secondly, Retiro's statutory lien is also secured and with priority over any other debt, \"\n   <em>\n    by the contributions made and subsequently accrued in the System\n   </em>\n   , the pension, benefit, or reimbursement exceeding the contributions designated by the participant or pensioner pursuant \u00a7\u00a7 785-779a [...], and in the amount that, in case of death of the participant or pensioner, may correspond to his/her estate or any beneficiary as designated by the participant by him/her...\" In this case, the Retiro's statutory lien specifically states that it attaches to future property, that is, all the contributions accrued or to be accrued in the System. This is precisely the statutory disposition in controversy in the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the statute recognizes\n   the possibility of a simultaneous consensual lien when it states that \"the statutory lien created in this section 4-110 shall remain in full force and effect in the event that mortgage and personal loans are transferred by the Administrator to third parties...\" 3 L.P.R.A. 785a\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Similarly, section 779a(a)(1)(C), in relation to mortgage loans, states that \"[t]he loan shall be secured by a first mortgage on the real property for whose acquisition, extension, or refinancing the loan was made, for the contributions accrued and to be accrued on behalf of the borrower in the System, and in the amount that may correspond to the estate or the person the borrower would have designated as a beneficiary in case of death of the borrower, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 773 and 774 or 786-10 of this title.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Retiro's statutory lien, again, extends to after acquired contributions of the borrower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Plaintiffs argue conspicuously that considering that the Retiro's loan was intended to be, initially, a mortgage loan which was not perfected in the Property Registrar, the loan is a \"nullity\" and, therefore, all other guarantees of the loan are not sustainable, including the statutory lien. However, the Plaintiffs agree that the statutory lien created by said loan attaches to the contributions already accrued in the System. The court notes that said position is contradictory to the allegation of \"nullity\" argued by the Plaintiffs. Furthermore, \"[i]n a mortgage credit legal relationship two (2) elements coexist: the credit and the mortgage. Credit gives rise to the pertinent personal action, and the real liability derives from the security aspect of the mortgage.\n   <em>\n    P.R. Prod. Credit Ass'n v.

Additionally, the Retiro lien is specific and limited as it refers exclusively to contributions accrued and to be accrued in the Retiro system in contrast to the extent of tax liens, as discussed above, and, therefore, do not defeat the fresh start policy of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    e.\n    <em>\n     The effect of the Discharge upon Retiro's loan\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Defendant argues that the loan in the present case is non dischargeable pursuant to Section 523(a)(18) which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"A discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (18) owed to a pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, or other plan established under section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 under\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (A) a loan permitted under 408(b)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or subject to section 72(p) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (B) a loan from a thrift savings plan permitted under subchapter III of chapter 84 of title 5, that satisfies the requirements of section 8433(g) of such title;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   But nothing in this paragraph may be construed to provide that any loan made under a governmental plan under section 414(d), or a contract or account under section 403(b), of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 constitutes a claim or a debt under this title; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   ...\" 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(18).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In its pertinent part, as to the Chapter 13 discharge, Section 523(a) references \u00a7 1328(b) which discusses the discharge for a debtor \"...that has not completed payments under the plan...\" and excludes \u00a7 1328(a).
