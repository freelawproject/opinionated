Brown, Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   THIS MATTER comes before the Court on the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   (\"Motion\"), filed by Defendant First Land Development, LLC (\"FLD\"), and the response filed by Plaintiff Brooks L. Kellogg (\"Debtor\"). Central to this dispute is whether a lien creditor has the ability to create a new judgment lien once the underlying debt has been discharged in bankruptcy and the creditor's prepetition lien has expired under state law post-discharge. The Court being otherwise advised in the premises hereby FINDS and CONCLUDES:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Many of the basic facts of this proceeding, at least as they relate to Defendant FLD, are not in dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Several years prior to his bankruptcy filing, FLD obtained two judgments against the Debtor on June 30, 2010 and August 16, 2010. Shortly thereafter, FLD recorded both judgments with the Routt County Clerk and Recorder, which is the county in which the Debtor's home is located. These recordings created judgment liens on the Debtor's home pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-52-102\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-52-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under that statute, a judgment lien does not last indefinitely. Rather, the statute provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The lien of such judgment shall expire six years after the entry of judgment unless, prior to the expiration of such six-year period, such judgment is revived as provided by law and a transcript of the judgment record of such revived judgment, certified by the clerk of the court in which such revived judgment was entered, is recorded in the same county in which the transcript of the original judgment was recorded, in which event the lien shall continue for six years from the entry of the revived judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-52-102\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-52-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). Applying this provision and absent revival, FLD's judgment liens on Debtor's house were set to expire on June 30, 2016 and August 16, 2016, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before expiration occurred, the Debtor filed a chapter 7 petition on April 25, 2016. The Debtor listed FLD's claim and judgment liens in his schedules. FLD received notice of the bankruptcy case. Neither the Debtor nor the chapter 7 trustee took any action to avoid FLD's liens\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and FLD did not object to the entry of discharge in the Debtor's case. On September 19, 2016, the Debtor received his discharge and on November 2, 2016, the Debtor's bankruptcy case closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While the Debtor's bankruptcy case was pending, the deadline for FLD to extend its prepetition judgment liens was tolled by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20108\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under that subsection, the deadline was extended to the later of (1) the end of the statutory period provided for in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-52-102\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-52-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or (2) thirty days after termination or expiration of the automatic stay with respect to such claim. The later date in this case is the expiration of the automatic stay. The automatic stay terminated as to the Debtor's home when that property was no longer property of the bankruptcy estate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). The date on which the home lost its status as property of the estate is tied to the closing of this case. According to \u00a7 554(c), property that a debtor schedules, but which a trustee\n   does not administer is deemed abandoned to the debtor upon the closing of the case. Because the Debtor listed the home as an asset, but trustee did not administer it prior to case closing, the home ceased to be property of the estate on November 2, 2016. This means FLD had thirty days from case closing under \u00a7 108(c), or until December 2, 2016, to revive and record its judgments, and thereby extend its prepetition judgment liens for another six years. Thus, despite the discharge of the underlying indebtedness, FLD could have acted to revive the judgment, solely as a means of preserving its lien rights, but it had to do so by December 2, 2016. FLD did not act within this timeframe. Instead, almost three months later, on March 7, 2017, FLD obtained verified transcripts of its judgments and recorded them with the Routt County Clerk and Recorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   FLD admits that this filing was procedurally deficient because it failed to file a motion to revive the judgments as required by Colo. R. Civ. P. 54(h). FLD further concedes that, because of this deficiency, a judgment lien was not created on that date. Nevertheless, in late 2018 when the Debtor was attempting to sell his home and asked FLD to remove the improper filing, FLD instead demanded payment of its judgment debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   FLD argues that its failed attempt to create a new judgment lien and its subsequent demand for repayment did not violate the discharge injunction. FLD contends that, while entry of discharge eliminated the Debtor's personal or \"in personam\" liability for its judgments, it did not eliminate FLD's ability to proceed on an \"in rem\" basis. Because liens \"ride through\" bankruptcy, FLD argues it can seek to revive its judgment and create a new judgment lien in an in rem action without violating the discharge injunction. The Debtor disagrees, arguing that when FLD's prepetition judgment liens expired, any attempt to impose a new lien post-discharge or to otherwise collect on the judgments was a violation of \u00a7 524(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This dispute first came to the Court's attention when the Debtor filed a motion to reopen his bankruptcy case on October 31, 2018, more than two years after entry of discharge. After the Court granted that relief, FLD and another judgment creditor, AMT, LLC (\"AMT\"), filed a joint motion for relief from stay, seeking either relief to file motions to revive their respective judgments in state court, or an order declaring that the automatic stay does not prevent revival. The Debtor objected to that motion and, shortly thereafter, filed a Motion to Avoid Judicial Liens, seeking to avoid the judgment liens held by FLD, AMT, and two other judgment creditors pursuant to \u00a7 522(f). The Court held a hearing on both motions on January 29, 2019, at which the parties agreed to resolve the issues between them in an adversary proceeding. The Court set deadlines for the Debtor to file a complaint against FLD and AMT, as well as a deadline for those Defendants to file a summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Debtor then initiated this adversary proceeding. Debtor's complaint in this adversary alleges three claims for relief: (1) violation of the discharge injunction against FLD only; (2) declaratory judgment determining the extent and priority of liens against both FLD and AMT; and (3) a spurious lien claim against FLD only. FLD then filed its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the first claim for relief, violation of the discharge injunction. Because that claim does not involve AMT and the facts concerning AMT's lien have not been fully developed, this Order does not address AMT's lien. Instead, this Order addresses only FLD's liability for violation of the discharge injunction. However,\n   to determine that claim, this Court must also rule on the Debtor's second claim for declaratory judgment as to the extent of FLD's liens. Thus, even though FLD did not seek summary judgment on the second claim, this Court's ruling includes both of the first two claims, but only as to Defendant FLD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Bankruptcy Discharge and Lien Ride Through\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The effect of a bankruptcy discharge is controlled by \u00a7 524, which in relevant part provides that a discharge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) voids any judgment at any time obtained, to the extent that such judgment is a determination of the personal liability of the debtor with respect to any debt discharged under section 727 ... of this title, whether or not discharge of such debt is waived;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (2) operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or an act, to collect, recover or offset any such debt as a personal liability of the debtor, whether or not discharge of such debt is waived ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). A key part of subsection (a)(2) is that it prohibits only those actions that seek to recover from a debtor\n   <em>\n    personally\n   </em>\n   . This is an important distinction for secured creditors. A secured creditor with a lien on a debtor's property has two ways of collecting on that debt-the creditor can file suit against the debtor personally for damages or it can foreclose on its lien and collect payment from the proceeds of the sale of the debtor's property. The Supreme Court has held that a bankruptcy discharge eliminates the first option, an in personam claim against the debtor, but does not eliminate the latter option, an in rem action against the debtor's property.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Home State Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107779\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/78/#p83\">\n    501 U.S. 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83-84,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6507321,1107779\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/111/2150/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107779\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/78/#p83\">\n    115 L.Ed.2d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). This principle is commonly expressed through the maxim that liens \"ride through\" bankruptcy unaffected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As described by one commentator, the idea of liens riding through bankruptcy is an \"odd historical artifact\" that reflects the original purpose of our bankruptcy law, namely a method for a debtor's unencumbered, non-exempt assets to be liquidated and distributed amongst the debtor's general unsecured and priority creditors.

Implicit in this understanding was the notion that bankruptcy should not impair a secured creditor's right to realize the full value of its collateral and that a bankruptcy trustee takes a debtor's assets subject to any existing liens.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107779\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/78/#p83\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the various bankruptcy acts passed in the United States have all contemplated \"that a lien good [on the petition date] as against the debtor ... shall remain undisturbed [unless] it is one which has been obtained in contravention of some provision of the act ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107779\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/78/#p83\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Hewit v.

FLD created two judgment liens prepetition. Under the principles discussed above, those liens \"rode through\" the Debtor's bankruptcy case. While the six-year life span of the liens ended during the bankruptcy case, \u00a7 108(c) of the Bankruptcy Code tolled the expiration dates until thirty days after the closing of the case. FLD could have extended the life of these prepetition liens and executed on them without violating the discharge injunction if it had filed the necessary paperwork before December 2, 2016. But when FLD failed to do so, those liens were extinguished, not by operation of the Bankruptcy Code, but under Colorado law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Thus, when FLD subsequently filed a transcript of judgment on March 7, 2017, it was no longer acting to preserve a prepetition lien. Instead its actions were an attempt (albeit an unsuccessful one) to create a\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   judgment lien on the Debtor's property. Absent the Debtor's bankruptcy filing, it would have been free to do so because its twenty-year judgment would have still existed. But when FLD attempted to do so post-discharge of the indebtedness, its actions violated both the discharge injunction and Colorado law. As discussed above, a new lien cannot be created in the absence of a valid debt.\n   <em>\n    Birney v. Smith (In re Birney)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11493064,4232959\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/225/\">\n    200 F.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228 (4th Cir. 1999). The Debtor's personal liability for FLD's judgments was discharged pursuant to \u00a7 524(a)(1). Because the Debtor no longer owes a debt to FLD, there is no basis to create a\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   judgment lien on his property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11493064,4232959\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/225/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Paeplow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1871424,6521147\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/972/730/\">\n    972 F.2d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735 (7th Cir. 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   FLD argues it can obtain a new lien without violating \u00a7 524(a) because it is allegedly proceeding \"in rem\" against the Debtor's property rather than on an in personam basis. This argument misinterprets the extent of the lien ride through maxim. As discussed above, that maxim was developed to protect a secured creditor's lien rights\n   <em>\n    as they existed on the petition date\n   </em>\n   by allowing such liens to ride-through bankruptcy and remain post-discharge. A secured creditor is then permitted to proceed on an in rem basis (the only basis it has left) to execute on its existing lien post-discharge. In this case, those protections were afforded to FLD's prepetition judgment liens. But once those liens terminated post-discharge under state law due to FLD's failure to timely renew them, the protections of the lien-ride through also ceased. There is no concomitant rule or policy reason to protect FLD's efforts\n   <em>\n    as an unsecured creditor\n   </em>\n   to create a new lien post-discharge in order to collect a discharged debt. Indeed, the discharge injunction is in place to prevent such collection efforts. Because FLD is no longer a lienholder under Colorado law, it is not seeking to proceed on a purely \"in rem\" basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6518264,10514682\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/299/\">\n    970 F.2d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (7th Cir. 1992). To obtain a new lien against the Debtor's property, FLD must necessarily establish that the Debtor owes it a judgment debt. FLD cannot do so because that debt has been discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   FLD emphasizes that, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-52-102\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-52-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it still has time to \"revive\" its judgments because the judgments' twenty-year statutory life spans have not expired. FLD cites to two state court cases from Missouri and Illinois, both of which use similar arguments to conclude that the discharge injunction did\n   not prevent a creditor from reviving judgments and obtaining new liens post-discharge under similar state statutory provisions.\n   <em>\n    See FLD Reply Brief\n   </em>\n   , 2-3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Meyer v.

These cases argue that, if it is permissible for a secured creditor with an existing, prepetition lien to revive a judgment and extend that lien post-discharge, then a creditor whose lien expired post-discharge (e.g. FLD) should also be able to go through the same steps to obtain a new lien. The fact that the judgment creditor's prepetition judgment lien expired is deemed \"irrelevant,\" so long as the creditor acts within the state law time limits to revive the underlying judgment.\n   <em>\n    First Nat'l Bank in Toledo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=208%20Ill.%20Dec.%20820\">\n    208 Ill.Dec. 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=650%20N.E.2d%20277\">\n    650 N.E.2d at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court does not find these arguments or these decisions persuasive. While state-law time limits for judgment revival are important, they do not control the scope of a discharge nor the extent of the lien ride through, both of which are matters of federal bankruptcy law. The key distinction missing in the cited cases is that a secured creditor with an unexpired prepetition lien has the protection of the lien ride through and therefore can extend the life of that lien and execute on it post-discharge. On the other hand, a creditor who allows its prepetition lien to expire under state law becomes an unsecured creditor, making the lien ride through no longer applicable. At that point, the creditor is merely an unsecured creditor attempting to collect a discharged judgment through a new lien. Even if the state deadline for obtaining such a lien has not expired, the discharge injunction bars the creditor from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   FLD does not cite to, nor does this Court find, any decision from this circuit that addresses precisely the facts presented in this case. The Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\") did deal with the application of the discharge injunction to a post-discharge judgment lien under New Mexico law in\n   <em>\n    Sprague v. Williams (In re Van Winkle)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511665\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/583/759/\">\n    583 B.R. 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. BAP 2018). In that case, the creditor had obtained a prepetition judgment lien on the debtor's property. While the lien was in existence, the debtor filed a chapter 7 petition and received a discharge. Shortly thereafter the debtor passed away. During the bankruptcy case, the creditor obtained relief from stay to foreclose on its judgment lien. The creditor ultimately had the winning credit bid at the foreclosure sale, leaving a deficiency judgement of over $ 270,000. The creditor recorded this deficiency judgment in the real property records post-discharge, with a notation that it was a lien on real estate and not a personal liability of the debtor's probate estate. The personal representative of the debtor's probate estate then filed a petition to exercise the now-deceased debtor's right to redeem the property by paying the same amount as the creditor's winning bid at the foreclosure sale. The creditor objected and filed its own petition to foreclose on its deficiency judgment lien. The debtor then filed an adversary proceeding arguing that the creditor's attempt to foreclose on the deficiency judgment lien violated the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The bankruptcy court held that the creditor's actions violated the discharge injunction because the creditor was attempting to execute its lien on property that the debtor's probate estate obtained post-discharge. The lower court acknowledged that the debtor owned the property when he filed bankruptcy, but held that he had lost title through the first foreclosure and that his probate estate only reacquired title through redemption, which occurred\n   well after discharge.\n   <em>\n    Sprague v.

Feb. 10, 2017). The BAP reversed, holding that the redeemed property was not newly acquired property. Rather, under New Mexico law, when a debtor redeems his foreclosed property, it is deemed to \"once again\" become part of his real estate and is subject to all prior judgment liens.\n   <em>\n    In re Van Winkle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511665\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/583/759/\">\n    583 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   769 (citing\n   <em>\n    Constr.

In other words, under New Mexico law, redemption reinstates the debtor's ownership of the subject property, and all prior judgment liens automatically revive and reattach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

Based on this law, the BAP concluded that the creditor was merely proceeding in rem to foreclose on its judgment lien on the debtor's prepetition property and did not violate the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   While the\n   <em>\n    Van Winkle\n   </em>\n   case presents an interesting factual scenario, it is not controlling in this case. The BAP relied on specific New Mexico state court case law in making its determination, which law is not applicable here. The\n   <em>\n    Van Winkle\n   </em>\n   case is procedurally and factually very different from this case. FLD did not foreclose on its prepetition liens, did not obtain a deficiency judgment, and the Debtor did not redeem any property. Under applicable Colorado law, FLD's prepetition judgment liens expired when it failed to renew them. Thus, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Van Winkle\n   </em>\n   convinces this Court it should reach a different conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Violation of the Discharge Injunction &amp; Contempt\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court concludes that FLD lost its prepetition judgment liens on December 6, 2016. At that point, it merely became an unsecured creditor of a discharged debt. It lost its ability to execute against the Debtor's property to collect on a discharged debt. Both FLD's post-discharge attempts to obtain a new lien and its continued demands for repayment of its prepetition judgments violated the discharge injunction because they were attempts to collect a discharged debt on an in personam basis from the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    Paul v.

Other circuits have held that a creditor's good faith belief is not a defense to liability for contempt, but may be asserted to limit the recovery of damages. See\n   <em>\n    IRS v.

The Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Taggart\n   </em>\n   is currently before the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In this case, FLD admits it received notice of the entry of the Debtor's discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FLD's Answer to Complaint, \u00b6 17. FLD further admits it recorded the transcripts of judgment on March 7, 2017, with the intent of reviving them to obtain new judgment liens. However, FLD's good faith belief or lack thereof has not been addressed by the parties, nor has the calculation of any damages the Debtor may have suffered. Accordingly, the Court declines to rule on those issues on a summary judgment basis. This ruling is limited to granting partial summary judgment on the Debtor's first and second claims for relief and only to the extent necessary to conclude that FLD's liens expired under state law and any attempt to create a new lien has and would continue to violate the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
