Elizabeth W.

After hearing, the Court took this matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 26, 2018, Debtors filed a Petition for Relief under Chapter 13 of Title 11 of the United States Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 27, 2018 the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") filed a proof of claim (\"Claim\") that was subsequently amended on June 7, 2018 and June 13, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The final Claim asserted tax liabilities totaling $ 822,891.44, which consisted of a $ 88,675.87 unsecured priority claim and a $ 814,215.57 general unsecured claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 28, 2018, Debtors objected to the Claim (\"Objection\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   taking issue with the priority classification of $ 82,085, for the shared responsibility payment (\"SRP\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the federal Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\"), taxpayers may pay the SRP as an alternative to retaining minimal essential health insurance coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Debtors argue that the SRP is not a priority claim because the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") labels it a \"penalty.\" The IRS responds that the SRP's label does not resolve whether it is considered a \"tax\" or a \"penalty\" under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The IRS seeks priority status, thus, it has the burden of proving the SRP falls within \u00a7 507(a) defining priority claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IRS has adequately characterized the SRP as a tax, not a penalty, making the SRP a priority claim under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code allows for the discharge of all debts with the exception of those listed as priority clams in \u00a7 507(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, section 507(a)(8)(A)(iii) prevents a debtor from discharging a priority tax\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   while sections\n   523(a)(7)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 1328(a) allow for the discharge of a penalty. The distinction between tax and penalty is not as clear as one might imagine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Courts define \"tax\" as \"a pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property for the purpose of supporting the government.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v. New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Supreme Court expanded the definition concluding that a tax must be an \"effort by the United States to obtain ... revenue.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, a \"penalty\" is an \"exaction imposed by statute as a punishment for an unlawful act\" or omission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, \"an exaction having in part a deterrent effect does not make the exaction a penalty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Shared Responsibility Payment is a Tax\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   SRP liability arises under \u00a7 5000A of the IRC, which was enacted as a part of the ACA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 5000A(a) requires individual taxpayers to maintain minimum essential health insurance coverage, unless they qualify for an exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, subsection (b) offers a taxpayer as an alternative, the right to make a SRP to the government when he files his tax return without incurring any other consequences.

Sebelius\n   </em>\n   , guides and forecloses some of this Court's analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that the assessment under \u00a7 5000A (or SRP) constituted a tax and therefore was within Congress' constitutional powers to create. In reaching its conclusion, the Court applied the same functional-analysis test used to determine the nature of an assessment under \u00a7 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   , the Court reasoned that the SRP appeared to be a tax because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [The SRP] looks like a tax in many respects. [It] ... is paid into the Treasury by \"taxpayer[s]\" when they file their tax returns. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(b). It does not apply to individuals who do not pay federal income taxes because their household income is less than the filing threshold in the Internal Revenue Code. \u00a7 5000A(e)(2). For taxpayers who do owe the payment, its amount is determined by such familiar factors as taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing status. \u00a7\u00a7 5000A(b)(3), (c)(2), (c)(4). The requirement to pay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by the IRS, which-as we previously explained-must assess and collect it 'in the same manner as taxes.' ... This process yields the essential feature of any tax: It produces at least some revenue for the Government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Having found the SRP's assessment to be similar to all taxes, the Court turned its attention to the defining characteristics of penalties. In\n   <em>\n    Drexel Furniture\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Supreme Court had previously enumerated three (3) characteristics distinguishing penalties from taxes. According to\n   <em>\n    Drexel Furniture\n   </em>\n   , penalties: (1) \" impose an exceedingly heavy burden\" for lack of compliance; (2) contain a scienter requirement typical of punitive statutes; and (3) are enforced by an agency other than the IRS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Examining the SRP under\n   the\n   <em>\n    Drexel Furniture\n   </em>\n   analysis, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   ...[F]or most Americans the amount due will be far less than the price of insurance, and, by statute, it can never be more .... Second, the individual mandate contains no scienter requirement. Third, the payment is collected solely by the IRS through the normal means of taxation-except that the Service is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   allowed to use those means most suggestive of a punitive sanction, such as criminal prosecution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The conclusion that the SRP did not function like a penalty also pertained to allegations that it was regulatory or coercive. The\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Indeed, '[e]very tax is in some measure regulatory. To some extent it interposes an economic impediment to the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed.' [ ] That \u00a7 5000A seeks to shape decisions about whether to buy health insurance does not mean that it cannot be a valid exercise of the taxing power.... While the individual mandate clearly aims to induce the purchase of health insurance, it need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful. Neither the Act nor any other law attaches negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond requiring payment to the IRS.... if someone chooses to pay rather than obtain health insurance, they have fully complied with the law. Indeed, it is estimated that four million people each year will choose to pay the IRS rather than buy insurance. We would expect Congress to be troubled by that prospect if such conduct were unlawful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, the Court recognized that the SRP was expected to raise over four (4) billion dollars in revenue per year, offsetting some of the costs of the ACA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As previously noted, the\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   Court's analysis regarding the nature of the SRP cannot be distinguished from an analysis under \u00a7 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. While Sebilus was primarily concerned with the Constitutionality of the SRP, the Court's citation to bankruptcy authority in making its determination forecloses any argument that the different contexts of\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   and this matter should result in different outcomes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This conclusion results because\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   cites to two (2) bankruptcy decisions as support for its approach:\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Sotelo\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court considered IRC \u00a7 6672 which assessed a \"penalty\" for failure to pay trust funds to the government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying the functional analysis test, the\n   <em>\n    Sotelo\n   </em>\n   Court held the assessment was not a penalty but a tax under the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court explained that although the statute referred to the liability as a \"penalty\" it \"d[id] not alter their essential character as taxes,\" because the \"liability is predicated on a failure to pay over, rather than a failure initially to collect, the taxes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    CF &amp; I\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court applied the functional analysis test when considering the \"taxes\" imposed under IRC \u00a7 4971(a) against employers who fail to adequately fund pension plans. Finding that the 'tax' was actually a penalty for bankruptcy purposes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   the\n   <em>\n    CF &amp; I\n   </em>\n   Court employed a two-step approach: (1) whether the exaction meets the general definition of a tax, and (2) whether the exaction possesses other characteristics of a tax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court held that IRC \u00a7 4971 exaction had a \"patently punitive function,\" thus, it was a penalty and not a tax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    CF &amp; I\n   </em>\n   provides that the distinction between lawful and unlawful conduct is an important, if not determinative, factor when concluding whether an assessment is a penalty or a tax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, some courts hold that the lawful-unlawful distinction is \"best viewed as a nonexclusive factor ... in deciding whether an exaction has the purpose of supporting the government.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   For instance, the bankruptcy court in\n   <em>\n    In re Bradford\n   </em>\n   did not apply the lawful-unlawful distinction made in\n   <em>\n    CF &amp; I\n   </em>\n   as a \"blanket rule, exclusive of any other test.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, it followed the reasoning of the court in\n   <em>\n    In re Cespedes\n   </em>\n   , stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Because the exaction in question in\n   <em>\n    CF &amp; I\n   </em>\n   was related to an unlawful omission, it was not necessary for the Court to consider whether a penalty could also apply to an act or omission that was lawful, but discouraged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Furthermore, both courts found it persuasive that\n   <em>\n    CF &amp; I\n   </em>\n   did not stop the inquiry once the conduct was determined to be unlawful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, how the assessment fits into the scheme of the Tax Code and the provision's legislative history were important.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the lawful-unlawful distinction constitutes a very important factor when applying a functional analysis to determine the assessment's character, but it is not the only factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Refusing to purchase health insurance and instead pay an assessment does not constitute an \"unlawful act.\" This is a strong indication that the SRP does not constitute a penalty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the legislative history implies that the SRP is a tax because Congress refers multiple times to how it raises revenue:\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"There are two clear winners....

(8) Eighth, allowed unsecured claims of governmental units, only to the extent that such claims are for-...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Section 507(a)(8) grants priority to certain income or excise taxes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (8) Eighth, allowed unsecured claims of governmental units, only to the extent that such claims are for-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (A) a tax on or measured by income or gross receipts for a taxable year ending on or before the date of the filing of the petition-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (i) for which a return, if required, is last due, including extensions, after three years before the date of the filing of the petition;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (ii) assessed within 240 days before the date of the filing of the petition, exclusive of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (I) any time during which an offer in compromise with respect to that tax was pending or in effect during that 240-day period, plus 30 days; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (II) any time during which a stay of proceedings against collections was in effect in a prior case under this title during the 240-day period, plus 90 days; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (iii) other than a tax of a kind specified in section 523(a)(1)(B) or 523(a)(1)(C) of this title, not assessed before, but assessable, under applicable law or by agreement, after, the commencement of the case;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (E) an excise tax on-(i) a transaction occurring before the date of the filing of the petition for which a return, if required, is last due, under applicable law or under any extension, after three years before the date of the filing of the petition ...\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Only those taxes that fall within the scope of \u00a7 507 are entitled to priority status. The United States Constitution allows the imposition of four (4) types of taxes: duties, excises,\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   direct taxes\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   and income taxes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   The power to tax a duty confers on the national government the exclusive power to tax imports into the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   The SRP is not a duty or impost tax because health care has no relation to an importation of goods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Furthermore, the SRP is not a direct tax. A \"Direct Tax\" is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A tax that is imposed on property, as distinguished from a tax on a right or privilege. A direct tax is presumed to be borne by the person upon whom it is assessed, and not \"passed on\" to some\n   other person. Ad valorem and property taxes are direct tax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A \"Capitation Tax\" or \"Poll Tax\" is: \"A fixed tax levied on each person within a jurisdiction,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   of \"a tax that everyone must pay simply for existing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that the SRP does not:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   ... [F]all within any recognized category of direct tax. It is not a capitation.... The whole point of the [SRP] is that it is triggered by specific circumstances-earning a certain amount of income but not obtaining health insurance. The payment is also plainly not a tax on the ownership of land or personal property.... thus [the SRP] is not a direct tax that must be apportioned among several States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Thus, the SRP must be either a excise tax or an income tax. The SRP is found in a section of the IRC titled \"Miscellaneous Excise Taxes.\" While its location in the Internal Revenue Code and title is not conclusive, it is persuasive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code does not define the term \"excise tax,\" but courts generally apply a broad definition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[A]n excise tax is imposed upon 'a discrete act by the person or entity being taxed,' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it \"essentially encompass[es] any tax that is 'indirectly assessed.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is one \" 'that is not directly imposed upon people or property' but is instead 'imposed upon a particular use of property' or upon the exercise of 'right or privilege.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since the SRP is assessed when a taxpayer exercises his or her right to remain uninsured, it may be a tax imposed \"upon the exercise of a right or privilege,\" making it an excise tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This is not the first time Congress has used a tax to encourage Americans to buy something. \"Tax incentives already promote, for example, purchasing homes and professional educations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   Excise taxes have also been used to deter conduct even when it is Constitutionally guaranteed, such as the excise tax imposed on the sale of firearms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, \u00a7 5000A is unique in that it taxes the right to do nothing rather than crediting or fining a taxpayer for taking certain actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Alternatively, the SRP might be an income tax which is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [A] tax upon earning, taking that term in its broadest sense, and irrespective of the question whether the person whose income is taxed has actively earned it or has merely profited by loaning his capital for active employment by another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   This argument gains weight since the SRP is based on an individual's income level.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, if not an excise tax, the SRP could be an income tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Admittedly, the SRP does not fit neatly into either definition, but the Supreme Court's elimination of the SRP as either a duty, impost, or direct tax leaves only the remaining choices. Thus, by the process of elimination, the SRP is either an excise or an income tax, either of which affords it priority status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   To effectuate the purpose behind \u00a7 507-providing equal distribution to similarly situated creditors-the Court concludes that the primary function and purpose of IRC \u00a7 5000A's SRP is to support the government. Thus, it functions like a tax. Accordingly, the SRP is a nondischargeable \"tax\" entitled to priority status within the meaning of \u00a7 507(a)(8). Debtors' Objection to Claim of the IRS is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   An Order in accord with these Reasons will be entered separately.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    P-1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    PoC # 8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    PoC #8-3 at 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    P-56.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    It is also referred to as a Shared Responsibility Payment liability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <em>\n     Grogan v.
