The issue is raised by the Trustee's motion for turnover of a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   portion of the bonus, based on the\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   by days method, and is submitted to the Court without trial, on a stipulated statement of facts and memoranda of law filed by the Debtor and the Chapter 7 Trustee, Charles E. Covey (Trustee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the stipulated statement of facts, the Debtor is employed by Caterpillar as an at-will, non-union employee, whose employment is not subject to a collective bargaining agreement or any employment contract. The Debtor is eligible to participate in the Caterpillar Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP), under which she has been paid an annual bonus (STIP bonus) following each year of her employment with Caterpillar. The parties have stipulated that the STIP bonus is discretionary and fully revocable by operation of the terms of the STIP documents. The relevant STIP provisions are summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 A participant shall not be vested in any awards and shall not be entitled to payment in advance of actual receipt of the payment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 The Vice President shall have the right to make reductions to the base award otherwise payable to a participant for any reason;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 The plan administrator reserves the right to make any adjustments or rescissions to the awards payable to a participant hereunder for any reason and at any time;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 The compensation committee retains the absolute and unconditional right at any time prior to the date payment is actually made to decrease or terminate any and all awards to be paid pursuant to the plan;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 The Company shall have the right at any time prior to the date payment is actually made to amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of this plan by action of the compensation committee;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 The Company expressly reserves the right to terminate the plan at any time prior to the date payment for that plan year is actually made;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 No participant shall have any right to receive a benefit hereunder except in accordance with the terms of the plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the basis of these provisions, the parties have stipulated that \"payment of the entire bonus is discretionary and that no employee has a right to receive the bonus until the money is deposited into their bank account.\" The parties also stipulate that the Debtor has received a STIP bonus for every year of her employment with Caterpillar. They agree that because the petition filing date of August 17, 2018 is 62.7% of the way through the calendar year, if the Debtor receives in 2019, a STIP bonus for 2018, \"62.7% of the bonus is rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Trustee argues that the STIP bonus has enough roots in the prebankruptcy past sufficient to bring it into the bankruptcy estate, whereas the Debtor, while admitting that the bonus is rooted to some extent in the prebankruptcy past, argues that those roots are not sufficient to warrant inclusion in the estate. As explained below, the question will not be decided through application of the \"sufficiently rooted\" test. Rather, the STIP bonus is determined not to have entered the bankruptcy estate because the Debtor did not have a prepetition property interest in the bonus as a matter of Illinois law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 541(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that commencement of a bankruptcy case creates an estate which includes \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

Section 541(a)(1)'s phrase \"as of the commencement of the case\" operates as a temporal cutoff point, meaning that property interests that exist and belong to a debtor when the petition is filed are included within the bankruptcy estate, whereas property interests that the debtor acquires after the bankruptcy filing are not part of the estate, subject to certain exceptions stated in section 541.

At the other end of the spectrum are property interests originating from a contractual relationship, including an employment relationship, an occurrence or some activity that existed or took place prepetition, but where the debtor, on the petition date, has only potential rights that are not certain to arise and that do not become enforceable, if at all, until after bankruptcy.

At the time of the bankruptcy filings on September 27, 1961, the Internal Revenue Code provided for loss-carryback adjustments so that a taxpayer who incurred losses during a given year could use those losses to offset and obtain a refund of income taxes paid during recent preceding years. The individual partners were eligible to use the partnership losses suffered during 1961 to obtain a refund of income taxes they had previously paid. The court determined that their loss-carryback refund claims were within the meaning of the term \"property\" as used in the Bankruptcy Act, emphasizing that the two factual predicates necessary to claim the refund were in existence on the petition date. Income taxes had been paid during the several years prior to the filing, and during the year of bankruptcy at the time of filing the partnership had suffered a net operating loss. The court summarized its reasoning using a two-part analysis: the loss-carryback refund claim \"is sufficiently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past and so little entangled with the bankrupts' ability to make an unencumbered fresh start that it should be regarded as 'property' under \u00a7 70a(5).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/\">\n    at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The tax refund claim at issue in\n   <em>\n    Segal\n   </em>\n   was treated by the Court as a property interest in existence on the petition date. Under the Internal Revenue Code, the individual debtors had a right to a refund subject only to the contingency of the end-of-year determination of the partnership's loss. The amount of the refund was uncertain, but the statutory right to a refund was unconditionally established as of the petition date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Segal\n   </em>\n   dealt not with an expectancy but, rather, with a property interest subject to a contingency. In addition, the debtors' right to the tax refund was a federally created property interest arising under the Internal Revenue Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   There is little doubt under section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code, that the second part of\n   <em>\n    Segal's\n   </em>\n   test, whether the property interest is so entangled with the debtor's fresh start that it should be excluded from the estate, is no longer a relevant factor. Many courts, however, continue to apply the \"sufficiently rooted\" half of the test to the property of the estate analysis under section 541. It is stated in the legislative history to section 541 that the \"result\" of\n   <em>\n    Segal\n   </em>\n   is followed and the \"right to a refund is property of the estate,\" without any reference to the \"sufficiently rooted\" test. House Report No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 367-8 (1977); Senate Report No. 95-989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 82-3 (1978). Since\n   tax refunds were at issue in\n   <em>\n    Segal\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   and the legislative history refers to\n   <em>\n    Segal's\n   </em>\n   \"result\" but not the \"sufficiently rooted\" test, whether that test survived enactment of the Bankruptcy Code is debatable. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has concluded that although Congress specifically approved of\n   <em>\n    Segal's\n   </em>\n   result, the \"sufficiently rooted\" test did not survive the enactment of the new definition of property of the estate in section 541.\n   <em>\n    In re Burgess,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996944,37714\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/493/\">\n    438 F.3d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498-99 (5th Cir. 2006) (under current law, a debtor's interest in property may be contingent or enjoyment postponed until after bankruptcy, but the debtor must have had a prepetition legal interest nonetheless).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Similarly, the Seventh Circuit has expressed skepticism about the usefulness of the \"sufficiently rooted\" test even in the context of tax refunds in\n   <em>\n    In re Meyers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049545,3774409\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/626/\">\n    616 F.3d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2010), a case concerning what portion of a debtor's right to federal and state income tax refunds were property of her bankruptcy estate. Referring to the two-part \"sufficiently rooted\" test of\n   <em>\n    Segal\n   </em>\n   and characterizing it as the \"background rule under the old Bankruptcy Act, to which courts still refer in the era of the Bankruptcy Code,\" the court stated that \"[t]hese general rules provide the background for resolving disputes over tax refunds, but they are only a starting point. The fact that reasonable people can identify competing methods for calculating the pre-petition share of the refunds betrays the incompleteness of a rule that simply calls for identifying at what time an asset became 'rooted'.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049545,3774409\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/626/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049545,3774409\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/626/\">\n    at 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The common law \"sufficiently rooted test\" has been superceded by section 541(a)(1)'s requirement of a \"legal or equitable interest ... as of the commencement of the case.\" If applicable state law provides that a potential property interest of a debtor was merely an expectancy as of the petition date, the expectancy is properly excluded from the estate without regard to whether the interest may be said to be \"rooted\" in the debtor's pre-bankruptcy past. The fact that the parties have stipulated that 62.7% of the Debtor's 2018 STIP bonus is rooted in her prebankruptcy past will play no role in the analysis of whether the Debtor had a prepetition property interest in the STIP bonus, which will be decided as a matter of Illinois law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Illinois Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A review of Illinois caselaw indicates that a bonus revocable at the employer's discretion until paid is a mere expectancy, not a property interest.

The STIP documents provided for an annual bonus to eligible employees payable in March or April of each year; the bonus was intended to reward business division, service unit and individual performance; an employee's eligibility for the program was subject to a determination by the employer that the employee was in good standing at all times, including the time of payment, as determined by the employer in its sole discretion; the employee's manager or CEO had the discretion to disallow an incentive award for any employee at any time; the CEO or department head had the right to revise, modify or take away an incentive award to accommodate circumstances that may arise with respect to an individual participant, in his or her sole discretion; and the incentive program could be terminated, amended, or modified by the employer at any time with or without notice to participants in the employer's sole discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At issue was Burke's claim brought under the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act, 820 ILCS 115/1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , requiring that separated employees receive final compensation including \"earned bonuses.\" The appellate court determined that the 2007 STIP bonus was not an \"earned bonus\" under the Wage Act since the bonus was discretionary and dependent upon several conditions which were not satisfied. These included that Burke was in violation of a company policy at the time the bonus was to be \"actually paid,\" and that he was not in good standing at the time of payment as determined by Zurich in its sole discretion. The court concluded that the STIP documents did not contain an \"unequivocal promise\" that Burke would be paid a bonus based solely\n   on his performance in 2007 and the fact that Zurich had already approved Burke's bonus before he was fired did not transform the discretionary bonus into an unequivocal promise that the bonus would be paid. The discretionary nature of the STIP bonus was critical to the court's conclusion that the bonus, approved but not yet paid, was not \"earned\" at the time of Burke's termination and was not required to be paid under the Wage Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206969208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b619 and \u00b620.

The trial court found that the bonus was not marital property because it was not a property interest at all but, instead, was a mere expectancy. Reviewing the evidence, the appellate court determined that the husband did not have an employment contract and so had no contractual right to receive a bonus. The employer's bonus program specifically provided that \"bonuses and awards are discretionary,\" and the entitlement to and amount of any bonus or award \"shall be determined and awarded, if at all, in the discretion of the Company.\" On this basis, the appellate court affirmed the trial court, holding that the bonus, if the husband received one, did not constitute marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   It follows from these authorities that where an employer reserves the absolute discretion not to award a future bonus, the bonus is treated under Illinois law as an expectancy, not a present property interest. Contract language, like that used by Caterpillar, that makes the bonus discretionary and disclaims any obligation to pay it, is enforced according to its terms. Moreover, the Court is aware of no support in Illinois caselaw for the argument advanced by the Debtor that a historic pattern of bonus payments by an employer may override plan provisions that make the bonus discretionary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because the Debtor, on the date of the petition, had only a bare expectancy interest, the Trustee takes no present property interest in any future STIP payment and no part of it can become property of the estate. To consider the bonus to be property of her estate simply because it related to her prepetition employment would be to give the bankruptcy estate more than the Debtor had on the petition date. The Court holds that the Debtor's expectancy interest in the 2018 STIP bonus is not a legal or equitable interest in property as of the commencement of the case under section 541(a)(1) and is not an asset of her estate subject to the Trustee's administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Trustee's motion for turnover of 62.7% of the Debtor's 2018 STIP bonus will be denied. A separate order will be entered. This memorandum of decision constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The Fifth Circuit's description of its holding is instructive:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    \"We hold that the right to claim loss-carryback refunds under the circumstances of this case is property as that term is used in [\u00a7 70a(5) of the Bankruptcy Act], notwithstanding that the claim is subject to adjustment in the event the taxpayer has other losses or earnings during the balance of the year, and the claim may not be filed until the end of the taxable year. This right of action springs from and rests on the fact that the income taxes theretofore paid were paid subject to adjustment in the event of future losses, and are available for that purpose to the end of providing the refund. The right to adjustment is definite; the time for filing the claim is definite; only the amount of the refund is contingent and this meets the test of a possibility vested with an interest.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     Segal v.
