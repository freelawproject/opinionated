Its creditors or other interested parties may respond by acting to protect the debtor's estate and their interests in it. But legal action after already at risk for losing money as a creditor can be costly. To encourage improved distributions possibly resulting from creditors taking an assertive role in a debtor's reorganization, Congress permits creditors to recover administrative expenses incurred in substantially benefitting the debtor's Chapter 11 estate. Creditors, however, may not seek a windfall solely for protecting their own interests. Creditors may recover administrative expenses only for steps transcending their narrow interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Properly applying these principles, the Bankruptcy Court found the Chapter 11 debtor failed for months to make efforts to\n   secure the necessary sale of its business. Facing the debtor's inertia, one secured creditor eventually filed various motions which, the Bankruptcy Court found, jolted the debtor from slumber to action, eventually resulting in the long-awaited and necessary sale of the debtor and successful reorganization. After evaluating witness credibility and adduced exhibits, the Bankruptcy Court found the secured creditor's conduct transcended its narrow interest and warranted a partial award of administrative expenses and legal fees-but only for the steps providing the substantial benefits to the estate. The Bankruptcy Court declined to award costs for certain expenses it found protected only the creditor's interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We find no clear error in the Bankruptcy Court's detailed fact findings based on the Bankruptcy Judge's credibility evaluations of extensive testimony and first-hand supervision of the various actors' conduct in this multi-year case. We affirm the Bankruptcy Court's reasoned award of administrative expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Judge Chan described DeVal's plan as \"patently unconfirmable,\" because the sale to Parts Life \"would close before the government decided whether to approve the novation of its contracts with [DeVal], requiring the parties to later unwind the closing if the novation\" failed to receive approval, and the financing contingency of $ 2,700,000, \"even if satisfied, would have fallen far short

sidelines as an observer. \"We were just monitoring what was going on in that first four-month period,\" Mr. Haber testified, \"[b]ut it was pretty clear during this process that they were doing nothing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Realizing \"[n]obody else was doing anything,\" Mr. Haber testified PDI \"had to take action, otherwise this case would languish.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   He described Deval's position as \"perilous\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   given their perilous cash position, given the company's fragile

This is not an incidental benefit to the estate.

Our Court of Appeals'\n    <em>\n     Lebron\n    </em>\n    holding permits recovery of administrative expenses only for creditor conduct transcending self-protection.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This dispute involves section 503(b)(3)(D) of the Bankruptcy Code, which permits a creditor to submit administrative expenses and receive as an award \"the actual, necessary expenses ... incurred by ...

After Mechem's board ousted minority shareholder W. James Scott from his positions as an officer and director, shareholder Scott initiated litigation against the company. Shareholder Scott discovered the company's President \"misappropriated millions of dollars,\" and Scott then filed a complaint in equity in Pennsylvania state court seeking, among other things, \"appointment of a custodian to prevent further mismanagement and fraud\" and \"a complete and accurate accounting of\" company assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The state court ordered \"inventories of all assets, investments, and accounts held by Mechem or [its President] personally,\" but did not receive a satisfactory inventory in response. After shareholder Scott obtained another state court order requiring the information, the company filed a chapter 11 petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Shareholder Scott successfully moved in the Bankruptcy Court for appointment of a trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n   He then provided \"the trustee all of the information that he had gathered during his pre-bankruptcy petition legal actions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon the recommendation of the trustee, the Bankruptcy Court converted the case to a chapter 7 liquidation. \"The trustee also brought numerous adversary proceedings against [the President] and his wife, which resulted in the turnover of additional property to the estate\" and a substantial judgment against the President and his wife.\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shareholder Scott then sought \"reimbursement for the expenses he had incurred in connection with the Mechem legal actions and his participation in the chapter 11 and chapter 7 proceedings\" under sections 503(b)(3) and (b)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n   Awarding shareholder Scott the requested reimbursements in full, the Bankruptcy Court found without shareholder Scott's \"substantial contribution,\" the company \"might still be fleecing individuals\" and \"could have continued to operate until all of the assets were dissipated.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    106\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court reversed, finding, as relevant here, \"Scott could not recover any expenses that he incurred prior to the date Mechem filed its chapter 11 petition,\" and shareholder Scott could not recover administrative expenses because he undertook his actions to protect his interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    107\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Reversing and remanding for further proceedings, our Court of Appeals addressed the meaning and history of section 503(b)(3)(D). It found this statute \"represents an accommodation between the twin objectives of encouraging meaningful creditor participation in the reorganization process, and keeping fees and administrative expenses at a minimum so as to preserve as much of the estate as possible for the creditors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    108\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Court of Appeals held \"[i]nherent in the term 'substantial' is the concept that the benefit received by the estate\n   <em>\n    must be more than an incidental one arising from activities the applicant has pursued in protecting his or her own interests.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    109\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute's focus on\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   contributions, our Court of Appeals held, requires courts apply a presumption of self-interest, which the creditor may overcome only by \"satisfy[ing] the court that [its] efforts have transcended self-protection.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    110\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Court of Appeals also found Congress did not intend section 503(b)(3)(D) \"to impose an across-the-board bar to the reimbursement of expenses incurred before the filing of the petition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    111\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Our Court of Appeals remanded for the Bankruptcy Court to determine whether\n   shareholder Scott's \"actions were designed to benefit others who would foreseeably be interested in the estate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    112\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Court of Appeals acknowledged the evidence below \"tending to show that Scott incurred the reimbursed expense in pursuit of his own interests ... for example, in litigation over control of Mechem initiated many months before a reorganization was anticipated by anyone.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    113\n   </footnotemark>\n   But \"[o]n the other hand,\" the court described, \"there was evidence from which the bankruptcy court could have concluded that at least some of Scott's efforts were designed to benefit the chapter 11 estate and its creditors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    114\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Court of Appeals remanded for the Bankruptcy Court to make this finding of fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    115\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Bankruptcy Court applied the proper standard and we find no clear error in its finding of a substantial contribution.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Addressing how a creditor could overcome the presumption of self-interest, our Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Lebron\n   </em>\n   explained \"[a] creditor should be presumed to be acting in his or her own interest unless the court is able to find that his or her actions were designed to benefit others who would foreseeably be interested in the estate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    116\n   </footnotemark>\n   This focus on the design of the creditor's actions, Parts Life emphasizes, requires we assess not only the objective benefits flowing to the debtor's estate, but the actor's motivations in providing such benefits. Even \"[a] large benefit is nonetheless incidental\"-and thus cannot form the basis of an administrative expense award-\"if the creditor's primary purpose was to further its own self-interest,\" Parts Life argues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    117\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Parts Life cites opinions from the United States Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits critiquing\n   <em>\n    Lebron\n   </em>\n   and applying a more objective standard under section 503(b)(3)(D). \"[N]othing in the Bankruptcy Code requires a self-deprecating, altruistic intent as a prerequisite to recovery of fees and expenses under section 503,\" the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found in\n   <em>\n    In re DP Partners Ltd. Partnership.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    118\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held \"[t]he benefits, if any, conferred upon an estate are not diminished by selfish or shrewd motivations,\" and \"a creditor's motive in taking actions that benefit the estate has little relevance in the determination whether the creditor has incurred actual and necessary expenses in making a substantial contribution to a case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    119\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit adopted the Fifth Circuit's objective focus on benefits flowing to the estate, reasoning \"[e]xamining a creditor's intent unnecessarily complicates the analysis of whether a contribution of considerable value or worth has been made.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    120\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Court of Appeals acknowledged the disagreement in a footnote in 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    121\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Parts Life's emphasis on extra-circuit authority is of no moment\n   here. Judge Chan applied\n   <em>\n    Lebron\n   </em>\n   , not authority from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth or Eleventh Circuits. Judge Chan's November 15, 2018 opinion discusses\n   <em>\n    Lebron\n   </em>\n   at length, emphasizing PDI \"must show that its actions were designed to benefit others who would foreseeably be interested in the estate,\" and the court \"may not allow as an administrative expense costs associated with actions primarily designed to advance the applicant's own interests.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    122\n   </footnotemark>\n   And we find no error in Judge Chan's application of\n   <em>\n    Lebron\n   </em>\n   to the facts. Judge Chan found three of PDI's actions procured a substantial benefit to the estate-and PDI intended them to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Parts Life's latches onto Mr. Haber's testimony PDI's broad goal in the bankruptcy case was to secure repayment of PDI's claim. But Judge Chan did not find every action PDI took in the case entitled it to an award of expenses. Judge Chan isolated discrete actions: the objection to extension of the exclusivity period, \"the initial PDI Plan and the Trustee Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    123\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parts Life, however, would have us conflate a creditor's purpose in in the\n   <em>\n    entire case\n   </em>\n   with the creditor's purpose in taking\n   <em>\n    the acts for which it seeks an award of administrative expenses.\n   </em>\n   We find no such rule in\n   <em>\n    Lebron.\n   </em>\n   Our Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Lebron\n   </em>\n   expressly acknowledged the economic reality that \"[m]ost activities of an interested party that contribute to the estate will also, of course, benefit that party to some degree, and the existence of a self-interest cannot in and of itself preclude reimbursement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a principle makes ample sense, as every actor in a bankruptcy case must, in a general sense, be mindful of its own interests, especially officers of corporate creditors owing a fiduciary duty and a duty of loyalty to its stakeholders and shareholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Parts Life also places great weight on\n   <em>\n    In re Geriatrics Nursing Home, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    125\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey declined to award administrative expenses to a creditor seeking to acquire the Chapter 11 debtor. In\n   <em>\n    Geriatrics Nursing\n   </em>\n   , the creditor seeking administrative expenses, Health Resources, purchased a $ 260.10 unsecured claim and filed a competing plan of reorganization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Bankruptcy Court found Health Resources produced a demonstrable benefit to the debtor's estate because its competing plan helped result in \"the dramatic improvement in the treatment of creditors under the Debtors' confirmed plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the court declined to award expenses after carefully reviewing time records attached to the request for administrative expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Bankruptcy Court found it \"readily evident to the court both from the time records and the positions it took at various court hearings that Health Resource's efforts were not directed at furthering the reorganization or even at protecting its interests as a creditor, but rather were directed at acquisition of the nursing home in furtherance of its own business purposes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Geriatrics Nursing\n   </em>\n   supports, rather than undermines, Judge Chan's findings. Judge Chan undertook the diligent time record review appropriate when a creditor\n   has previously expressed interest in acquiring the debtor. Judge Chan carefully parsed which creditor conduct furthered its own interests in an acquisition and which creditor conduct benefitted the entire estate, awarding reimbursement only for the discrete acts motivated to benefit the debtor's estate. Judge Chan's fact findings are not undermined by\n   <em>\n    Geriatrics Nursing\n   </em>\n   , because PDI alone acted to save DeVal from imminent collapse, and in\n   <em>\n    Geriatrics Nursing\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, various creditors took an active role in the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    130\n   </footnotemark>\n   PDI did not purchase a claim to wage a takeover of the debtor. It had a vested interest in DeVal for years. The parties mutually negotiated their original Asset Purchase Agreement six years before DeVal ever filed its Chapter 11 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Lebron\n   </em>\n   instructs a more relevant indication of self-interest is whether an action \"would have been undertaken absent an expectation of reimbursement from the estate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    131\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Bankruptcy Court found PDI would not have taken such an aggressive role in the bankruptcy case if it were merely looking out for its own interests. Mr. Haber testified without the prospect of recovery of expenses, \"it would [have] be[en] unlikely that we would have proceeded down this path to invest the kind of money and time that we did.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    132\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Chan found his testimony credible. And Judge Chan found \"PDI's primary design in filing the objection to exclusivity, cross-motion for a trustee, renewed motion for a trustee, and filing of its first plan, which was the only legitimate plan filed at the time, was to save Deval from a total implosion and becoming administratively insolvent. This is not an incidental benefit to the estate. Their actions forced the debtor to wake up and try to save the company from its own inaction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Ample evidence supports Judge Chan's detailed findings. Judge Chan observed DeVal's inaction, followed by its change of course after PDI asserted itself in the proceedings. Mr. Haber's testimony credibly presented Deval's position as \"perilous.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon managing this multi-year reorganization to success, and evaluating witness credibility, Judge Chan reasonably found PDI acted with the motivation of \"accelerat[ing] the sale process in order to preserve the value of [DeVal's] business as a going concern and prevent the estate from becoming administratively insolvent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Chan reviewed expense records and did not award expenses for items (such as limousines) unrelated to the debtor's benefit. She properly followed\n   <em>\n    Lebron.\n   </em>\n   We have no basis to challenge these detailed fact findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
