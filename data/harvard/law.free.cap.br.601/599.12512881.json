The dispute is which party has a priority interest in the inventory, and its proceeds, sold by the Debtors on consignment from Sport Dimension (the \"Disputed Goods\"). For the reasons stated below, the Court will grant WSFS's motion and deny Sport Dimension's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 2, 2016, (the \"Petition Date\") The Sports Authority Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, the \"Debtors\") filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11. The Debtors were national retailers of sporting goods and active apparel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Relationship of WSFS and Debtors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2006, the Debtors entered into a secured financing facility that included a term loan which, following a refinancing in 2010, amounted to $ 300 million (the \"Term Loan\"). (Orenstein Decl. Ex. A, Adv. D.I. 83-1.) Bank of America (\"BOA\") was the administrative agent for the group of lenders providing the Term Loan (the \"Term Loan Lenders\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As of the Petition Date, approximately $ 276.7 million, exclusive of accrued and unpaid interest, fees, and other obligations, was outstanding under the Term Loan. (Aguilar First Day Decl. \u00b6 27, D.I. 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Term Loan was secured by, in part, a second-priority lien on the Debtors' inventory, including all after-acquired inventory and proceeds thereof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Orenstein Decl. Ex. B at 2, Adv. D.I. 83-2.) The lien was perfected by the execution of a security agreement and the filing of UCC-1 financing statements and continuation statements in the appropriate jurisdictions. (Orenstein Decl. Exs. B-F, Adv. D.I. 83.) On December 31, 2015, WSFS succeeded\n   BOA as the administrative agent (the \"Term Loan Agent\"). (Brooks Decl. Exs. B &amp; C, Adv. D.I. 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Relationship of Sport Dimension and the Debtors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As part of their business, the Debtors developed a program for the sale of goods on consignment. To participate in the program, vendors entered into a \"pay by scan\" deal sheet specifying whether they would be paid on a cost or retail split basis. The Debtors paid the vendors in accordance with the terms of their respective consignment agreements, which was either a fixed amount for each item sold or a percentage of the retail sale price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Sport Dimension is a manufacturer of athletic apparel under the \"Body Glove\" brand. Sport Dimension began selling its Body Glove apparel to the Debtors in the 1990s. Around 2011, Sport Dimension entered the Debtors' pay by scan consignment program on a retail split basis - 45% to Sport Dimension and 55% to the Debtors. (Orenstein Decl. Ex. K, Adv. D.I. 83.) Sport Dimension did not file a UCC-1 to cover the goods it provided to the Debtors on consignment until January 25, 2016, approximately one month before the Petition Date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. L, Adv. D.I. 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Early in the Debtors' bankruptcy case, an issue arose as to the Debtors' authority to pledge or sell consigned goods in their possession. Pending the filing of (and ruling on) an adversary proceeding to determine respective rights to the consigned goods, the Court permitted the Debtors to sell the consigned goods so long as they complied with the terms of the consignment agreements, including making payments to the consignors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Order, D.I. 1704.) The Final Order preserved WSFS's rights as the Term Loan Agent, including the right to recoup any payments made to the consignors from the sale of the consigned goods if it were determined that WSFS had a superior security interest in them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 16, 2016, the Debtors commenced this adversary proceeding against Sport Dimension, seeking declaratory relief on competing claims to the Disputed Goods. (Adv. D.I. 1.) WSFS intervened in the adversary proceeding and seeks a declaration that it has a perfected security interest senior to Sport Dimension's interest in the Disputed Goods and seeks disgorgement of their proceeds. (Adv. D.I. 2.) Sport Dimension filed an answer and counterclaim seeking a declaration that WSFS's security interest did not attach to the Disputed Goods and, if it did, that WSFS's lien is subordinate to Sport Dimension's interest. (Adv. D.I. 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 10, 2018, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment seeking a determination of their respective interests in the Disputed Goods. (Adv. D.I. 79 &amp; 84.) Briefing is complete, and the matter is now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding, as it is a core proceeding dealing with the determination of the validity, priority, and extent of liens on property of the estate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 157(b)(2)(K).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Sport Dimension does not consent to entry of any final order or judgment by the Court.

However, this Court has concluded in a similar proceeding in this case that (1) Article III does not prohibit the Court from hearing such \"core proceeding[s],\" and that (2) \"Article III does not limit the Court's authority to enter final judgment on the claims and counterclaims at issue ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    TSA Stores, Inc. v.

The Court has previously held that the threshold for substantial engagement is met only if consigned goods comprise \"20% or more\" of the value of the Debtors' inventory.\n   <em>\n    TSA Stores, Inc. v.

Additionally, in all but one of the cases cited by both WSFS and Sport Dimension, the minimum 20% threshold was either expressly articulated or factually satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re State Street Auto Sales.

While\n   <em>\n    Creative Goldsmiths\n   </em>\n   did not acknowledge a bright-line minimum threshold and stated that substantial engagement does not require \"primarily\" dealing in consigned goods, it ultimately determined that the consignor had not proven that the debtor was substantially engaged in selling the goods of others because there was insufficient evidence to make such a finding.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6098068\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/178/87/#p93\">\n    178 B.R. at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Creative Goldsmiths\n   </em>\n   does not provide a basis for departing from the minimum 20% threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Sport Dimension also cites\n   <em>\n    Eurpac\n   </em>\n   in support of its contention that 20% is not required to satisfy the Exception.\n   <em>\n    Eurpac Serv. Inc. v.

App. 2000). However, the\n   <em>\n    Eurpac\n   </em>\n   Court did not rely on actual knowledge of the \"substantial engagement\" portion of the Exception for its ruling. Instead, its ruling was predicated on actual knowledge of the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   consignor's relationship with the debtor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9449050\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/37/447/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Lastly, Sport Dimension argues that the Debtors' CFO, Jeremy Aquilar, testified in the bankruptcy case that a \"substantial portion of the Debtors' business involves the sale of goods on consignment.\" (Aquilar First Day Decl. at \u00b6 26, D.I. 22.) Sport Dimension asserts that this admission alone should be dispositive of the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   WSFS, however, directs the Court's attention to the Debtors' representation in the Term Loan, which explicitly states that consignment inventory was \"an immaterial portion of total inventory for sale.\" (Orenstein Decl. Ex. B at Schedule 3.06, Adv. D.I. 83-2.) WSFS argues that the Debtors represented and warranted to the Lenders that they would not sell consignment inventory other than that \"immaterial portion\" listed on Schedule 3.06 of the Term Loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, as noted above, the Debtors have stipulated that they never held more than 14% of their inventory on consignment. (Stip. of Fact, D.I. 1400.) WSFS argues, therefore, that such representations preclude a finding that the Lenders had actual knowledge of the Debtors' substantial engagement in consignment sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court agrees with WSFS. The minimum threshold for substantial engagement is 20% of consigned goods. Mr. Aguilar's imprecise testimony that a \"substantial portion\" of the Debtors' business involved consigned goods does not provide sufficient evidence that the Debtors met that legal threshold. Further, that testimony is contradicted by the more recent and more specific admission by the Debtors that they did not sell more than 14% of their inventory on consignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Even if the Debtors' statements alone could establish \"substantial engagement,\" they do not establish the Term Loan Agent's actual knowledge at the time the Term Loan was extended.\n   <em>\n    MJ Soffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206885922\">\n    2018 WL 6885922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6 (finding that actual knowledge must be present at the time the Term Loan was incurred). In this case, the Debtors' representation in the Term Loan documents to the Agent was that the Debtors were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   substantially engaged in selling goods on consignment. (Orenstein Decl. Ex. B at Schedule 3.06, Adv. D.I. 83-2.) Thus, the Court finds that Aguilar's testimony neither establishes the Debtors' substantial engagement in consignment sales nor the Term Loan Agent's actual knowledge of substantial engagement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Sport Dimension did not establish that the total value of consignments in the Debtors' inventory exceeded the minimum 20% threshold or that the Term Loan Agent actually knew that the Debtors were \"substantially\n   engaged\" in selling the goods of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Actual knowledge of specific consignor\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Sport Dimension also argues that WSFS conflates the \"general knowledge\" exception with the \"actual knowledge\" exception. It argues that courts require\n   <em>\n    neither\n   </em>\n   knowledge of substantial engagement\n   <em>\n    nor\n   </em>\n   of a specific creditor when considering whether\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   knowledge has satisfied the Exception. It asserts instead that actual knowledge that \"some\" portion of the Debtors' business deals with consignments is sufficient to satisfy the Exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eurpac\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9449050\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/37/447/#p449\">\n    37 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   448-50 ;\n   <em>\n    Fariba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986210\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/178/156/\">\n    178 Cal.

Pa. 1979). On this basis, Sport Dimension asserts it is sufficient that the Term Loan Lenders had actual knowledge of\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   consignments, as evidenced by (i) Schedule 7.01(b) of the Term Loan which lists some\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   consignors, (ii) the Debtors' audited financials which identified consigned inventory of\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   consignors, and (iii) the public UCC-1 filings of a number of\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   consignors. (Brooks Decl. Exs. D, G-J, Adv. D.I. 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   WSFS argues that actual knowledge of either \"substantial engagement\" or of the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   consignor (i.e., Sport Dimension) is required to satisfy the Exception. It contends that actual knowledge of \"some\" of the Debtors'\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   consignment relationships is insufficient if \"some\" does not rise to the minimum level of 20%. WSFS states that neither the Term Loan Agent nor Term Loan Lenders had actual knowledge of substantial engagement or of Sport Dimension's consignments specifically and, therefore, the Exception is not satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court agrees with WSFS. The second prong of the Exception requires that the Lenders have actual knowledge that Sport Dimension\n   <em>\n    specifically\n   </em>\n   was dealing on a consignment basis with the Debtors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TSA Stores, Inc. v.

D. Del. 2018). Sport Dimension concedes that it has no evidence of actual knowledge by the Term Loan Agent (or Lenders) of its consignment arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Sport Dimension's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Eurpac\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fariba\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    GBS Meat\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. All three cases involved actual knowledge of a specific consignor and/or substantial engagement and, therefore, contradict Sport Dimension's argument. In\n   <em>\n    Eurpac\n   </em>\n   , for example, the court found that the creditor \"understood that a portion\" of the debtor's inventory consisted of consigned goods and that the debtor's consignment inventory was identified in separate schedules, which included the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   consignor in dispute.\n   <em>\n    Eurpac\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9449050\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/37/447/#p449\">\n    37 P.3d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in both\n   <em>\n    Fariba\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    GBS Meat\n   </em>\n   , the courts found that the secured creditors had actual knowledge of the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   consignors in dispute.\n   <em>\n    Fariba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986210\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/178/156/\">\n    178 Cal.

Code Ann., tit. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 9-322, 9-324. Sport Dimension only disputes the third contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Under section 9-322(a), conflicting perfected security interests rank according to priority in time of UCC-1 filings. However, section 9-324(b) provides an exception for a party who obtains a purchase money security interest (\"PMSI\"), such as a consignment interest,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in inventory collateral that is already subject to a prior perfected security interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087997\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/474/1357/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 9-324(b)(1)-(4). Under that provision, the later filing PMSI-holder may obtain a priority interest in inventory it delivers to the consignee if it meets the following requirements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (1) the purchase-money security interest is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the inventory;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (2) the purchase-money secured party sends an authenticated notification to the holder of the conflicting security interest;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (3) the holder of the conflicting security interest receives the notification within five years before the debtor receives possession of the inventory; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (4) the notification states that the person sending the notification has or expects to acquire a purchase-money security interest in inventory of the debtor and describes the inventory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087997\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/474/1357/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 9-324(b)(1)-(4). WSFS argues that Sport Dimension failed to provide proper notice under subsections (2) and (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Sport Dimension filed a UCC-1 on January 25, 2016, creating a PMSI in inventory delivered to the Debtors on consignment after that date. (Brooks Decl. Ex. L, Adv. DI. 87-12; Orenstein Decl. Ex. J, Adv. D.I. 83.) Sport Dimension provided notices of its UCC-1 filing that same day to a number of the Debtors' creditors, including BOA, the\n   <em>\n    predecessor\n   </em>\n   Term Loan Agent. (Brooks Decl. Ex. M, Adv. D.I. 87-13.) Sport Dimension argues, therefore, that it satisfied the requirements of section 9-324(b) and its interest has priority over WSFS's prior perfected interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   WSFS argues that Sport Dimension's notice to BOA failed to satisfy the UCC's notice requirement. To satisfy the requirement, a consignor must send notification to the addresses of other secured parties that appear on their respective UCC-1s.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9-324(b), cmt. 6. At the time Sport Dimension provided notice to BOA (January 25, 2016), WSFS as successor Term Loan Agent had already filed an amended UCC-1 reflecting its address (December 31, 2015). (Orenstein Decl. Ex. C, Adv. D.I. 83-3.) WSFS asserts, therefore, that Sport Dimension failed to provide notice to the appropriate address and, accordingly, failed to satisfy the requirements for obtaining a priority PMSI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court agrees with WSFS. Sport Dimension provides no legal authority to support its argument that proper notice is provided by notice to a predecessor agent to a secured party. Nor is there any evidence that BOA forwarded the notice to WSFS. Thus, the Court finds that Sport Dimension has failed to satisfy the requirements of section 9-324(b) and, consequently, WSFS's lien has priority. Therefore, the Court concludes that all proceeds of the Disputed Goods that were paid to Sport Dimension postpetition must be disgorged. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Order \u00b6 8, D.I. 1704 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny Sport Dimension's motion for\n   summary judgment and grant WSFS's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   An appropriate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    In the course of the bankruptcy case, the lenders who originally had a first priority lien on the Debtors' inventory were paid in full.
