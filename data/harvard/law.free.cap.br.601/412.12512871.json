The Court did not set the matter for hearing and took the matter under advisement. After considering the arguments made and the pleading of counsel, and the file and record in the case, the Court finds that the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss should be granted as to Count 1 of the First Amended Complaint (Preferential Transfers) and denied as to Counts 2 (Fraudulent Transfers) and Count 3 (Objection to Claim No. 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over this Motion to Dismiss pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 157(b)(2)(A) (administration of the estate), (B) (allowance or disallowance of claims), (F) (proceedings to determine, avoid, or recover preferences), and (H) (proceedings to determine, avoid, or recover fraudulent conveyances).

The Court entertained oral argument on the Motion to Dismiss and responsive pleadings.

Legal Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Litigation Trustee alleges that, though not an original shareholder, Larry Struthoff (\"Struthoff\") became a shareholder of OEI in 2010. (ECF No. 11 at \u00b6 4.06). From at least 2011 through August 12, 2016 (the \"Petition Date\"), Struthoff was the majority shareholder and served as a Director and President of OEI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Tracey Janicke (\"Janicke\") was a shareholder of OEI and served as a Director and an Officer of OEI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Debtor's Statement of Financial Affairs states that Struthoff and Janicke owned 63.5% of the issued and outstanding equity interests in OEI. (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges that Struthoff controlled OEI at all times relevant to the claims made by the Litigation Trustee against DCM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Litigation Trustee alleges that Struthoff was a shareholder, director, and officer of S.W.L. Enterprise, Inc. (\"SWL\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.07). SWL, during it existence, was also owned by Hugh Long (\"Long\") and Jim Weynand (Weynand\"). Struthoff also controlled Olmos Construction, Inc and was the manager of Olmos Companies I, LLC, the company that paid the original retainer of $ 200,000 to DCM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On or about May 19, 2011, Weynand filed suit against OEI and its affiliates, Struthoff, Hugh Long, SWL and Janicke in Bexar County under Cause No. 201CI08332 styled\n   <em>\n    Jim Weynand v. Olmos Equipment Inc., et al\n   </em>\n   (the \"Weynand Litigation\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.09). The Weynand Litigation principally concerned the dispute between Weynand, Long, and Struthoff over the sale by Weynand, Long and Struthoff of Olmos Construction, Inc. and SWL to OEI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Weynand contended that Struthoff, Long, and Janicke through their management and control of OEI, breached their fiduciary obligations to Weynand and shorted Weynand approximately $ 6,000,000.00 in\n   connection with the transaction through the manipulation of the books of OEI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Struthoff directed OEI to pay the legal fees of Struthoff, SWL, and Janicke as well as OLE's legal fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to the Litigation Trustee, Struthoff took total control of OEI effective November 14, 2011, when all existing shareholders of OEI irrevocably granted their proxy to Struthoff through January 24, 2015 and granted Struthoff control of the management and operations of OEI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.11). The transfer of control to Struthoff was memorialized by the Written Consent for Special Meetings, Resolutions and Affidavit of the Board of Directors &amp; Shareholders of Olmos Equipment, Inc. to Extend Voting Rights until the 24th day of January, 2015 (the \"Control Resolution\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Whereas, the Corporation have [sic] still been adversely effected by external factors, including the poor economy, labor and materials markets, and decline in the construction market, as well as by internal factors including, internal lawsuits, and external lawsuits. As a consequence the Corporation is unable to meet its financial, legal and contractual obligations, including its ability to pay its accounts payable and payroll and it cannot purchase needed materials necessary for current contractual obligations with its customers. The Corporation is essentially broke and bankrupt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Exh. 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Litigation Trustee also alleges that DCM began working on and billing for the representation of Struthoff, SWL, and OEI immediately, but DCM did not formally accept the engagement until August 14, 2015, some 75 days later, when DCM entered into a Legal Representation Agreement with OEI, SWL and Struthoff in connection with the Weynand Litigation (the \"DCM Engagement Letter\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.15; Exh 2). Pursuant to the DCM Engagement Letter, DCM assumed representation of OEI, Struthoff, and the then defunct entity, SWL. The agreement further required that all fees were to be paid \"in full no later than thirty days from the date on which the fee statement is received by Clients....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The DCM Engagement Letter also acknowledged the receipt of a retainer in the amount of $ 200,000.00 paid by Olmos Companies 1 LLC, a company wholly owned and controlled by Struthoff, which funds would be used to satisfy the firm's billings through July 2, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges that, at least as of the date of the execution of the DCM Engagement Letter, DCM knew of the limitations under the governing corporate documents on the ability of OEI to pay for the representation of Struthoff and the prohibition against the payment for the representation of SWL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, by DCM's access to the books and records of OEI both before and after the formalization of the engagement of DCM by Struthoff and OEI, DCM was in actual possession of knowledge otherwise only available to those closely involved with the inner-workings of OEI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.17). In addition to access to information otherwise only available to \"insiders\" of OEI, DCM knew or should have known at the time that DCM contracted with OEI, Struthoff, and SWL that the transaction evidenced by the DCM Engagement Letter was not an ordinary course, arms-length transaction and, in fact, was prohibited under the bylaws of OEI. (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges that DCM, in its election to disregard the governing documents of OEI and the public records on file with the State of Texas, and contract with Struthoff for the representation of the interests of Struthoff and SWL, knowingly and intentionally entered into a transaction that was, from its inception, not arms-length. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that the dealings between DCM and OEI further evidence a less-than-arms-length transaction through the conscious disregard by DCM of the contractual terms of the DCM Engagement Letter, including the acceptance of payments outside of the payment terms proscribed by the DCM Engagement Letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Following an approximately three month trial, the jury returned a verdict on December 17, 2015, finding that: (1) OEI breached its agreement with Weynand and committed statutory fraud against him, resulting in damages of $ 3,400,000.00 and $ 68,815.922, respectively; (2) Struthoff breached his fiduciary duty to Weynand and breached his fiduciary duty to SWL, resulting in damages of $ 233,333.33; and (3) Janicke committed statutory fraud against Weynand, resulting in damages of $ 68,815.923.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, at the time that DCM assumed representation of Struthoff, SWL and OEI, DCM knew that the financial livelihood of OEI was inextricably tied the success of the defense of Struthoff directly and through SWL and OEI in the Weynand Litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.21). Because of the relationship of DCM to OEI, directly and through Struthoff, DCM had actual knowledge that the acceptance of payments for the legal representation of Struthoff (directly and on behalf of SWL and OEI) was not authorized by the Bylaws of OEI and, if the representation proved unsuccessful, the payment by OEI to DCM violated the Bylaws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that, at the time of the engagement, DCM was (or should have been) aware of the of insolvency of OEI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the Bylaws of OEI only authorize the payment and/or reimbursement of legal fees under limited circumstances: to Struthoff, and only if the representation is \"successful.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.22). Though the Control Resolution contemplates the payment of the fees and expenses of Struthoff and Janicke to Chunn, based upon the books and records of OEI made available to the Litigation Trustee, the Bylaws of OEI were never modified to permit payment or reimbursement in the absence of success; a fact which DCM should have been aware at the time of the execution of the DCM Engagement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges that the records of OEI are devoid of any authorization for the hiring of DCM, whether directly or on behalf of Struthoff and/or SWL, or the payment to DCM of the fees incurred in connection with that representation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Struthoff, as the majority shareholder and sole control person of OEI and the only remaining shareholder of SWL with successor liability for the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty to Weynand, representation by DCM under the DCM Engagement Letter was substantially for Struthoff's (and SWL's) benefit, and not OEI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.23). Plaintiff maintains that, even if OEI were authorized to have paid the fees incurred by DCM in connection with the representation of Struthoff (and those controlled by him), which the Litigation Trustee disputes, the Bylaws precluded such payment because the representation was not successful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Based upon the billing statements, DEM continued to represent Struthoff, SWL, and OEI, through March 24, 2016.

Between July 25, 2015 and March 25, 2016, DCM billed OEI a total of $ 1,890,656.61 and an additional $ 53,290.98 for the period April 25, 2016 through April 25, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

Therefore, to prevail on a preference for this period, DCM must be classified as an insider. The Court agrees with Defendant that there are no facts in the First Amended Complaint that support any allegation that DCM exerted control over the ongoing business operations of OEI under such that DCM could be defined as an insider under \u00a7 101(31). DCM provided legal services, billed, and was partially paid for those services during OEI's business. As such, the Court finds that DCM is not a statutory insider. Therefore, the Court must determine if DCM is a non-statutory insider of OEI. The Fifth Circuit's opinion in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Browning Interests v.

The Court granted Plaintiff the opportunity to amend Count 1 to assert enough facts to support the necessary element of his claim, being, that the Debtor OEI and DCM were not operating at arm's length at the time of the challenged transactions.

Further, there are no allegations of a pre-existing relationship between DCM and Debtor other than Plaintiff's assertion that DCM conducted a due diligence examination of OEI roughly 75 days before agreeing to represent Debtor. As such, accepting Plaintiff's allegations as true, the Court cannot discern how the attorney-client relationship and agreement between OEI and DCM is any different than any attorney-client relationship. The fact that Debtor was in financial distress at the time of engagement and subsequent payments is not different than any other situation where a party is threatened with suit with a potential loss resulting in bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As noted herein, there is a dearth of case law construing non-statutory insider status within the Fifth Circuit and other federal courts.

(ECF No. 12 at 5). DCM argues that an attorney-client relationship was entered in the ordinary course of business of the parties for DCM to provide legal services to the Debtor, and the others, on the eve of a pending trial by DCM in exchange for payment for those services by Debtor, SWL, and Larry Struthoff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). DCM maintains that it was engaged to perform particularized legal tasks and for specific purposes, namely, to defend at a trial in a few weeks coming, each of OEI, Struthoff and SWL from the $ 8,000,000.00 - plus claims of Plaintiff Weynand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   DCM notes that the First Amended Complaint refers to the OEI Bylaws, which are attached to the Complaint as Exhibit 3, and Trustee's conclusion that a supposed violation of the Bylaws occurred, but the Trustee fails to support his conclusions and provide factual content by identifying and specifying the applicable provision(s) and section(s) of the Bylaws that were allegedly violated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Moreover, DCM argues that notwithstanding the Trustee's contention that the corporate documents limit what DCM and its clients could do, the November 14, 2011 Shareholders and Directors Resolutions were unanimously approved by the owners and managers of OEI-100% of the 2011 Directors and Shareholders of Olmos Equipment, Inc.-and, upon execution of the consent, superseded any contrary provisions in the Bylaws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). These resolutions placed control of OEI under Struthoff's supervision. DCM argues that the corporate resolutions were never reversed, and, based on this document, the corporation and all the shareholders waived all their rights and causes of action against Larry Struthoff as well as agreed to hold harmless and indemnify Larry Struthoff, including payment of his attorneys' fees and court costs. (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff argues that the Trustee has sufficiently set forth factual allegations that plausibly contend that DCM unduly influenced OEI to pay DCM for the representation of Struthoff and SWL. (ECF No. 13 at \u00b6 1.02). Further, the Litigation Trustee maintains that he has sufficiently set forth factual allegations that plausibly demonstrate that DCM knew that OEI was only authorized to indemnify Struthoff (and not SWL) for legal fees incurred by Struthoff in his capacity as an officer or director of OEI \"actually and necessarily incurred by [him] in any action, suit, or proceeding to which [Struthoff] is made a party by reason of holding that position.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Litigation Trustee argues that he has sufficiently plead and facially met his burden for plausibility under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.02). The Litigation Trustee asserts that the First Amended Complaint allows the Court to draw the reasonable inference that DCM received a preferential transfer because: \"(1) the existence of the debtor-creditor relationship between OEI and DCM, (2) the existence of the antecedent debt alleged to be owed by the Debtor to DCM, (3) that the Debtor made each of the payments to DCM which the Trustee seeks to recover, (4) that the payments were made and negotiated within the one year preceding the Petition Date, (5) that the Debtor was, based upon the Debtor's own admissions and the calculations of the Trustee's outside accountants, insolvent during at the time of the payments to DCM, (6) that sufficient plausible facts have been plead to indicate that DCM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   qualifies as a non-statutory insider of the Debtor, and (7) that the payment to DCM enabled DCM to receive more than it would have received under the conditions set forth in \u00a7 547(b)(5).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.05).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court reviewed Defendant's Reply to Plaintiff's Opposition and finds that the arguments raised duplicate earlier arguments in Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. Further, because Defendant does not raise any additional grounds for dismissing Counts 2 and 3 of the First Amended Complaint (which were previously denied), the Court will not revisit its prior ruling finding that Counts 2 and 3 met the plausibility requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court agrees with DCM that Plaintiff has not met the plausibility requirements of showing that DCM is a non-statutory insider of Debtor. Under the two-prong test of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     U.S. Medical, Inc.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Holloway,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the Plaintiff has not shown that DCM had a sufficiently close relationship with OEI or that DCM exercised control or influence over the Debtor such that the transaction at issue was not done at arm's length. The facts as deemed true only allege a contractual relationship between DCM and OEI and the course of dealing between the parties was that of an attorney-client. DCM represented OEI in complex civil lawsuit in state court that resulted in an adverse judgment. Plaintiff's argument that Debtor's By-Laws or other corporate documents precluded DCM from representing Debtor is unavailing-Struhoff had the requisite authority to engage DCM. Plaintiff has not cited with any specificity as to which corporate provisions were violated. Plaintiff's assertion that DCM had access to OEI's internal documents is insufficient to support a finding that DCM exercised control or influence over OEI. The fact that Debtor made payments to DCM for services performed is precisely what any other legal counsel would have requested in the allegations raised here. The payments, based on Plaintiff's allegations, comport with what was required under DCM's engagement letter.
