(\"Motion,\" ECF Doc. # 111.) Previously, Carbon moved to extend the deadlines to object to Bressler's discharge under section 727(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and to the dischargeability of Bressler's debt to Carbon under section 523(c) of the Code. Bankruptcy Rules 4004(a) and 4007(c) require those extension requests to be made no later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under section 341(a). The first date set for the meeting of creditors in Bressler's case was November 16, 2018, meaning the extension requests needed to be made by January 15, 2019. Carbon's request, however, was not filed until February 4, 2019. As a result, this Court issued a memorandum opinion and order denying Carbon's request, finding it was untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bressler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512842\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/600/739/\">\n    600 B.R. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

S.D.N.Y. June 4, 2019). Carbon now seeks an extension under Rule 4004(b)(2) relying on newly learned facts that allegedly form the basis for an objection to Bressler's discharge. For the reasons stated below,\n   the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Bressler filed a voluntary chapter 7 petition on October 12, 2018. (\"Petition,\" ECF Doc. # 1.) Bressler is a former portfolio manager and Chief Investment Officer for Carbon. (\"Arbitration Award,\" ECF Doc. # 102-1, at 2.) Prior to the Petition, Carbon filed a civil suit against Bressler in the District Court of Oklahoma County, State of Oklahoma, in an action styled,\n   <em>\n    Carbon Investment Partners, LLC, et al. v. Lee A. Bressler\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CJ-2018-1211. (ECF Doc. # 69 \u00b6 10.) The civil suit alleges that Bressler committed fraud and breached his fiduciary duty by making unauthorized trades, which resulted in substantial losses to Carbon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On March 30, 2018, Carbon filed an arbitration proceeding against Bressler, which also asserted claims for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. On December 7, 2018, this Court modified the automatic stay \"to permit the AAA Arbitration to proceed until such time as a written award is rendered which decides its outcome ....\" (\"Order,\" ECF Doc. # 38.) The hearing on the merits in the arbitration was conducted March 18 through March 22, 2019. (Arbitration Award at 1.) The arbitrator issued a final award on April 30, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) The final award sustains Carbon's claims, finding by clear and convincing evidence that Bressler breached his fiduciary duties to Carbon and committed actionable fraud in his dealings with Carbon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Those findings are supported by evidence that Bressler opened secret accounts to conceal unauthorized trades, secured by Carbon's funds, and that the unauthorized trades exceeded Carbon's total assets under management by up to 3,000%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-16.) When the trades proved unsuccessful, not only did they wipe out the fund, but they resulted in a multi-million-dollar deficiency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The arbitrator's award describes Bressler's conduct as \"willful [and] without remorse ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) The arbitrator awarded Carbon approximately $16.8 million, including approximately $12.7 million in compensatory damages and $2.5 million in punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) On June 7, 2019, Judge Don Andrews of the Oklahoma County District Court entered orders confirming the arbitration award and granting judgment in conformity therewith. (\"Order and Judgment,\" ECF Doc. # 132, Ex. A-B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Carbon's Prior Attempt to Extend the Deadline to Object to Discharge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While the arbitration case was pending, Carbon filed a motion seeking an extension of time to object to discharge of debt under section 523(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or discharge under section 727 of the Bankruptcy Code. (\"Motion to Extend,\" ECF Doc. # 54.) The Motion to Extend was filed February 4, 2019, and it sought an extension of time to object to discharge until May 15, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) The problem with the request was that Carbon's time to object to discharge or extend the deadline to object to discharge had already expired. Under the Bankruptcy Code and Rules, a creditor has 60 days from the\n   <em>\n    first date set\n   </em>\n   for the 341 meeting of creditors to file an adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability of a debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. BANKR. P . 4004(a), 4007(c), 7001(6). The initial date scheduled for the meeting of creditors in Bressler's case was November 16, 2018. (Motion to Extend \u00b6 2.) That means the deadline to object was January 15, 2019 (\"Objection Deadline\"). Carbon was notified of the deadline in a letter sent by the Court, which Carbon does not deny receiving. (\"Notice,\" ECF Doc. # 4 \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Creditors may seek to extend the time to object beyond the 60-day deadline; however, under Bankruptcy Rules 4004 and 4007, a request must be made to the court before the expiration of the 60-day window.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. BANKR. P. 4004(b)(1) (\"On motion of any party in interest ... the court may for cause extend the time to object to discharge .... [\n   <em>\n    T]he motion shall be filed before the time has expired\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added)); FED. R. BANKR. P . 4007(c) (\"[A] complaint shall be filed no later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under \u00a7 341(a) .... [T]he court may for cause extend the time fixed under this subdivision.\n   <em>\n    The motion shall be filed before the time has expired\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added)). Carbon's Motion to Extend was filed after the deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Bressler objected to Carbon's request as untimely. (\"Objection to Motion to Extend,\" ECF Doc. # 62.) In response, Carbon argued that the deadline to file a non-dischargeability complaint expires 60 days after the 341 meeting actually takes place, rather than the date it was originally scheduled. (\"Reply to Motion to Extend,\" ECF Doc. # 65, \u00b6\u00b6 5-10.) Bressler's 341 meeting was adjourned, so it did not take place on November 16, 2018 as initially scheduled. (Motion to Extend \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.) The 341 meeting was held on December 7, 2018, meaning that if Carbon's interpretation was correct, its request for an extension was timely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Carbon also argued that Bressler's counsel orally agreed to stipulate to extend the deadline and that the agreement was binding. (Reply to Motion to Extend \u00b6\u00b6 11-19.) Moreover, Carbon alleged it was entitled to an extension on equitable grounds. Carbon contended that the Debtor was equitably estopped from arguing the deadline expired, and that the Court should equitably toll the deadline due to misconduct by the Debtor and his counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Court's Memorandum Opinion Denying Carbon's Request for an Extension\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A hearing on Carbon's Motion to Extend was held February 25, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Transcript,\" ECF Doc. # 72.) The Court issued its\n   <em>\n    Memorandum Opinion and Order Denying Motion to Extend Time to Object to Discharge\n   </em>\n   on May 10, 2019. (\"Prior Opinion,\" ECF Doc. # 103.) The Court held that the deadline to object to discharge runs from the first date scheduled for the 341 meeting, rather than when the meeting is actually held, and that Carbon's Motion to Extend was therefore untimely. (Prior Opinion at 8-11.) Additionally, the Court rejected Carbon's argument that the verbal agreement to extend the deadline between Carbon and Bressler's counsel was binding and enforceable because only the Court can extend the deadlines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) Lastly, the Court denied Carbon's request for equitable relief. The Court found equitable estoppel inapplicable because it was unreasonable for Carbon to rely on Bressler's counsel's verbal agreement to extend the deadline without court approval and that equitable tolling was inappropriate when Carbon had notice of the deadline to object but failed to do so timely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 12-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Carbon filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the Prior Opinion. (ECF Doc. # 109.) The Court denied that motion. (ECF Doc. # 126.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Carbon's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Contemporaneous with moving for reconsideration, Carbon filed the motion at issue in this opinion. (\"Motion,\" ECF Doc. # 111.) The Motion seeks an extension of time to file an objection to Bressler's discharge under section 727 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Motion at 1.) Bankruptcy Rule 4004(b)(2) permits a party to seek an extension\n   of time to file a non-dischargeability complaint even after the deadline to object has passed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. BANKR. P. 4004(b)(2). Under Rule 4004(b)(2), however, a party can only move to extend the deadline if the proposed objection is based on facts learned\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the time to object has expired and if those facts would provide a basis for denying a discharge under section 727(d) of the Code. If the moving party learns new facts, it must promptly move to extend the time to object.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%202382947\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Carbon provides the following reasons why it is now entitled to an extension: First, Carbon alleges that the debtor \"substantially delayed the discovery process[,]\" by objecting to Carbon's Rule 2004 discovery requests, including requests to examine Bressler and others. (Motion \u00b6 19.) The motion seeking the discovery was filed on December 19, 2018, Bressler's objection to the discovery was filed on December 27, 2018, and the Court issued an order compelling the discovery on February 14, 2019. Bressler still has not fully complied with the order, according to Carbon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Next, Carbon alleges Bressler failed to disclose his employment with Microsoft or a $50,000 stock award from Microsoft on his Schedules of Assets and Liabilities (\"SOAL\") and Statement of Financial Affairs (\"SOFA\"). Carbon alleges it only learned about the stock award on April 11, 2019, after the Objection Deadline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Third, Carbon accuses Bressler of failing to disclose a Santander checking account titled solely in his name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Moreover, Carbon alleges Bressler did not disclose that $1,165,000 was transferred from the Santander account on June 8, 2017 for the purchase of property in East Hampton. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   n.2,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .) Carbon states that neither the account nor transaction were disclosed in Bressler's SOAL or SOFA, and that Carbon did not discover them until Bressler's wife made supplemental production of documents on April 12, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Fourth, Carbon argues that Bressler spoliated evidence in the arbitration proceeding by deleting files on his laptop computer in violation of the arbitrator's and a district court's orders. Bressler was sanctioned by the arbitrator as a result. The spoliation occurred after the deadline to object had passed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Fifth, Carbon alleges Bressler has a beneficial interest in a trust called 83 Spring Trust, which he failed to disclose in the bankruptcy case. Carbon supposedly learned of this alleged interest when Bressler's sister disclosed documents on March 8, 2019 and April 30, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Lastly, after the Objection Deadline, Carbon served Bressler with a Rule 2004 subpoena on March 13, 2019, requiring him to appear for testimony and produce documents by April 9, 2019. In response, that same day, Bressler's counsel asked to reschedule the testimony and indicated he would provide alternative dates. Carbon alleges Bressler's counsel never provided alternative dates. When Carbon's counsel followed up on April 3, 2019, Bressler's counsel did not respond until April 29, 2019. Documents were thereafter produced on May 13, 2019, after the Court issued its Opinion. However, Carbon alleges Bressler still has not produced tax returns, real estate closing statements, credit card statements, and documents relating to various trusts. Also, Bressler allegedly still has not appeared for oral testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Carbon alleges that if any of the previous facts \"were identified after a discharge had been awarded to [Bressler], revocation [of the discharge] would be warranted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Carbon accuses Bressler of\n   \"knowingly conceal[ing] assets ... to prevent the Trustee from liquidating [Bressler's] interests[,] ... knowingly destroy[ing] records in order to disclose [sic] his fraudulent actions[,] ... [and] refus[ing] to obey the Court's Rule 2004 Order, by consistently refusing to present himself for testimony and turn over documents ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   If Carbon's Motion is denied, it does not necessarily mean Bressler will receive a discharge. The chapter 7 trustee (\"Trustee\") timely filed an adversary complaint, objecting to the Bressler's discharge under section 727 of the Code. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Trustee's Adversary Complaint,\" Case No: 19-01132, ECF Doc. # 1.) To support its position that Bressler should not be entitled to a discharge, the Trustee's Adversary Complaint identifies the same facts alleged by Carbon in the Motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-26, 29-36, 41-47, 52-62.) In addition, the Trustee cites three additional facts why Bressler should not receive a discharge. They are: (1) Bressler failed to disclose an ownership interest in an entity called 1 South Wacker Holdings, LLC in his SOAL and SOFA (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28); (2) less than a year before the Petition was filed, Bressler completed a financial form for a bank, showing he individually and solely owned stocks and bonds valued at $6,000,000, real estate worth $4,000,000, and retirement accounts worth $400,000, yet Bressler's SOAL does not disclose his ownership interests and his SOFA does not disclose the disposition of the assets (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-43); and (3) Bressler's SOFA fails to disclose that a $50,000 payment to his counsel in the bankruptcy case was made by 83 Spring Trust, rather than him personally (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Trustee's Adversary Complaint contains seven counts. The Trustee alleges the Court should deny Bressler a discharge under section 727(a)(4) for making false oaths or accounts, in count one (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-71); under section 727(a)(2)(B) for concealing property of the estate with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors and the Trustee, in count two (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-77); under section 727(a)(2)(A) for fraudulent concealment and transfer of debtor's property within one year before the filing of the Petition, in count three (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-84); under section 727(a)(4)(D) for knowingly and fraudulently withholding books and records, in count four (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85-92); under section 727(a)(3) for concealing, destroying, mutilating, falsifying, or failing to keep or preserve any recorded information, books, documents, records, and papers, in count five (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 93-97); under section 727(a)(5) for failing to explain satisfactorily the loss or deficiency of assets, in count six (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-101); and under 727(a)(6) for refusing to produce documents and information as required by a bankruptcy court order, in count seven (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-05). Bressler has yet to answer the Adversary Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Carbon annexed a proposed adversary complaint to the Motion. (\"Proposed Adversary Complaint,\" ECF Doc. # 111-3.) It largely mirrors the Trustee's Adversary Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Motion \u00b6 16 (\"Carbon's [Proposed Adversary Complaint] will [seek] relief on substantially the same grounds as specified in the [Trustee's Adversary Complaint].\").) The primary differences are that Carbon does not include any count relating to the concealment of the 83 Spring Close Trust, nor a count under section 727(a)(6) for failing to comply with the Rule 2004 subpoena.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Bressler's Objection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Bressler's Objection disputes many of the factual allegations in the Motion. First, it alleges he did not knowingly conceal assets. Bressler alleges he was unaware he needed to disclose the Microsoft stock award because it is restricted stock that is contingent on his continued employment. (Objection \u00b6 33.) Therefore, Bressler did not believe it was property of the estate; however, \"[h]aving learned that his estate may have an equitable interest in the value of the stock ... Debtor ... amended his schedules to list [the] interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) In addition, Bressler alleges that Carbon's counsel was made aware of the Microsoft stock award at the 341 meeting, as it was discussed during Bressler's testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Regarding the 83 Spring Close Trust, Bressler alleges he disclosed its existence in his schedules; however, under the incorrect name. Bressler states unbeknownst to him, the name of the trust was changed from Jane C. Bressler 2010-B Family Trust to 83 Spring Close Trust before he completed the schedules. The Jane C. Bressler 2010-B Family Trust is disclosed in his schedules. Bressler alleges Carbon's counsel was made aware of this error, as it was discussed during the 341 meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because Carbon was aware of any potential fraud involving the stock award and trust at the 341 meeting, which was held before the Objection Deadline, Bressler argues that the alleged concealment cannot form the basis for a late extension under Rule 4004(b)(2). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Next, Bressler alleges the concealment of the Santander account by Bressler was inadvertent and lacking in fraudulent intent; therefore, it cannot form a basis to deny a discharge under Rule 4004(b)(2). Bressler asserts that \"the account had been inactive for over a year and had a nominal balance as of the Petition Date (under $10.00).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) Bressler states the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   value is indicative of an absence of fraudulent intent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45-46.) Moreover, regarding the alleged $1.165 million transferred out of the account in June 2017, Bressler claims that was the result of a \"clerical error\" and that the bank/or trustee inadvertently remitted the purchase funds to his personal account instead of the account for 83 Spring Close Trust, which was the purchaser of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Bressler claims instead of wiring the money back, he \"simply remitted the funds to the seller on behalf of the Spring Close Trust in order to facilitate a timely closing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Therefore, he denies he had a legal or equitable interest in the funds transferred\n   to him. Bressler did not disclose the transaction for that reason. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Third, Bressler denies being dilatory in response to the Rule 2004 subpoena. Bressler states he has produced over 1,400 documents and \"adequately addressed all outstanding items.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)

R. BANKR. P. 4004(b)(2). Rule 4004(b)(2) was added to the Bankruptcy Rules in 2011 to resolve the problem created when the basis for denying a debtor's discharge is first learned during the \"gap period,\" which is the period of time between when the deadline to object expires and when the discharge is actually granted. 9 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY \u00b6 4004.03 (16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ed. 2019).

However, due to normal ministerial delays, discharges are not always granted immediately.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Emery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11888064,11889333\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/132/892/\">\n    132 F.3d 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 894 (2d Cir. 1998). In addition, in cases such as this one, a gap period exists when a creditor does not receive an extension of time to object to discharge under Rule 4004(b)(1), but another creditor or trustee does, delaying a debtor's discharge.

D. Mont. Sept. 26, 2012). Courts consider the following factors when determining whether cause exists under Rule 4004(b)(1) : \"(1) whether the creditor had sufficient notice of the deadline and the information to file an objection, (2) the complexity of the case, (3) whether the creditor exercised diligence, (4) whether the debtor refused in bad faith to cooperate with the creditor, and (5) the possibility that proceedings pending in another forum will result in collateral estoppel on the relevant issues.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Nowinski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2158801\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/291/302/#p306\">\n    291 B.R. at 305-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Those factors are less impactful under 4004(b)(2), however. That is because a movant under Rule 4004(b)(2) does not simply seek more time to decide whether or not to object to discharge or to investigate further (which is often the case under Rule 4004(b)(1) ), but instead, seeks leave from the court to file an adversary complaint\n   objecting to discharge, as is the case here. Under Rule 4004(b)(2), a moving party must possess facts that form the basis for its complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. BANKR. P. 4004(b)(2)(A). Therefore, the Court finds that meeting the requirements of Rule 4004(b)(2) establishes a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for cause. The burden then shifts to the debtor to establish why cause does not exist, for example, because the moving party failed to investigate diligently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Rule 4004(b)(2) spells out a test for whether cause exists during the gap period to permit an objection to discharge. If the test is met, the court has the discretion to grant an extension under Rule 4004(b)(2), and it should, absent any compelling reason to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Therefore, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . In granting parts of the Motion, the Court does not conclude that the facts alleged by Carbon are true or that Bressler will be denied a discharge as a result. Those facts will bear out in discovery and at trial, if necessary. Rather, the Court today simply concludes that cause exists to extend the deadline for Carbon to file an objection to discharge complaint, based on newly discovered facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Failure to Disclose Microsoft Signing Bonus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Carbon alleges that Bressler received a signing bonus of $50,000 in stock when he was hired by Microsoft in July 27, 2018. (Motion \u00b6 24.) Carbon further alleges that Bressler failed to disclose the receipt of the bonus on his SOAL or SOFA and that it did not learn of the existence of the bonus until April 11, 2019, after the Objection Deadline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Therefore, Carbon alleges Bressler fraudulently concealed assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In response, Bressler alleges he did not intentionally conceal the stock award, rather he did not think it needed to be disclosed because the award is contingent on his continued employment and none of the shares vested before his Petition. (Objection \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) Bressler's contention is supported by an affidavit. (\"Bressler Affidavit,\" ECF Doc. # 125 \u00b6 3.) Bressler declares that when he learned of his misunderstanding, he amended his schedules to disclose his interest in the stock. (Bressler Affidavit \u00b6 3; Objection \u00b6 34.) That was done on May 24, 2019, after this Motion was filed. (ECF Doc. # 115.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Moreover, Bressler alleges Carbon received notice of the stock award during the 341 hearing, which occurred on December 7, 2019, before the Objection Deadline. Bressler cites to a portion of the meeting in which he reveals there can be a bonus or commission element to his current employment. (\"341 Transcript,\" ECF Doc. # 125-Attachment 1, at 6-7; Objection \u00b6 32.) Because Carbon had notice of the alleged fraud before the Objection Deadline, Bressler argues it cannot form a basis for an extension under Rule 4004(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Bressler fraudulently concealed the signing bonus by not disclosing it on his SOAL or SOFA, which is grounds for revocation of a discharge under 727(d)(1). Bressler denies the omission was intentional. Fraudulent intent would have to be shown by circumstantial evidence. Because Bressler (1) failed to disclose the identity of Microsoft as his employer on his Petition; (2) failed to reveal the identity of Microsoft as his employer during questioning at the 341 meeting; (3) objected to the propounding of Rule 2004 discovery on Microsoft; (4) delayed filing his schedules by approximately one month; and (5) made other supposedly \"accidental\" omissions on his SOAL and SOFA, it can be inferred that the omission was intentional and for the purpose of concealing the stock award, rather than an accident. Moreover, Bressler's credibility could be called into question based on the arbitrator's finding that he spoliated evidence by deleting files on his computer, which is a dishonest act, and based on the recently confirmed $16 million arbitration award finding that Bressler breached his fiduciary duties and committed actionable fraud, and that his conduct was willful and \"without remorse.\" Therefore, Bressler's claim of mistake may not carry much weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The more difficult inquiry is whether Carbon had notice of the stock award prior to the Objection Deadline. Carbon's\n   counsel submitted a declaration indicating \"Carbon did not definitively learn of the Debtor's Microsoft Stock Award until on or about April 11, 2019, ... after the Objection Deadline had passed.\" (\"Klestadt Declaration,\" ECF Doc. # 139 \u00b6 10.) As stated above, however, definitive knowledge is not needed, rather an extension request can be denied if a party had notice of the allegedly fraudulent conduct prior to the objection deadline. In this instance, the Court finds Carbon did not have notice before the Objection deadline. Bressler only stated he could be awarded a bonus in his current position but did not testify as to the nature of the bonus, its source, or when he became entitled to it. Carbon did not know if the bonus was earned prepetition and therefore property of the estate that was required to be disclosed by Bressler. Bressler should not be rewarded for his obstructionist tactics in refusing to answer valid questions at a 341 meeting. Furthermore, Carbon's alleged inquiry notice is undermined by the fact that Bressler objected to Carbon's Rule 2004 discovery request to Microsoft and has not appeared yet at a deposition, further delaying Carbon's ability to discover the alleged fraud. Therefore, the Court concludes that cause exists to extend the deadline to permit Carbon to file an objection to discharge complaint based on Bressler's alleged omission of the Microsoft stock award. That portion of the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Failure to Disclose Beneficial Interest in the 83 Spring Close Trust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Next, Carbon alleges that Bressler failed to disclose a beneficial interest in a trust called 83 Spring Close Trust in his SOAL or SOFA. Carbon alleges it did not learn of this interest until Bressler's sister, the trustee of the 83 Spring Close Trust, produced documents on March 8, 2019. (Motion \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) Carbon alleges Bressler fraudulently concealed his beneficial interest. (Motion \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Bressler denies intentionally concealing the trust. (Objection \u00b6\u00b6 35-37.) He asserts that the name of the trust was changed in July 2017 from the Jane C. Bressler 2010-B Family Trust to 83 Spring Close Trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Bressler declares he was \"confused\" about the name at the time he filed his schedules (Bressler Affidavit \u00b6 4), although he did disclose the Jane C. Bressler 2010-B Family Trust in his SOAL. (\"Schedule A/B: Property,\" ECF Doc. # 16 \u00b6 25.) Therefore, there was no fraudulent intent, according to Bressler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Further, Bressler alleges he revealed the mistake at the 341 meeting. (Objection \u00b6 36.) Bressler cites to a portion of the 341 meeting transcript in which Carbon's counsel asked about the 83 Spring Close Trust, which Bressler then identified as the Jane C. Bressler 2010-B Family Trust. (341 Transcript at 29.) Therefore, Carbon had notice of the alleged fraud prior to the Objection Deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court need not reach the issue of fraudulent intent. In the Klestadt Declaration, Carbon's counsel denies knowledge of the existence of the 83 Spring Close Trust before the Objection Deadline. (Klestadt Declaration \u00b6 15.) That statement, however, is contradicted in the same declaration where Carbon's counsel also states that the 83 Spring Close Trust was discussed at the 341 meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6 (\"One of the parties ... to subpoena was the Jane C. Bressler 2010-B family Trust, which\n   <em>\n    according to the Debtor's Section 341 Meeting testimony is the 83 Spring Close Trust\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added).) The 341 meeting was held December 7, 2018, prior to the January 15, 2019 Objection Deadline. Therefore, Carbon had notice of Bressler's alleged fraud relating to the omission of\n   the 83 Spring Close Trust prior to the Objection Deadline. Accordingly, that part of the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Failure to Disclose Santander Checking Account\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Carbon argues Bressler is not entitled to a discharge because he failed to disclose a Santander checking account titled solely in his name. (Motion \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.) Carbon also alleges that Bressler transferred $1.165 million out of the account in June 2017, and failed to disclose that transfer in his SOFA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.) The transfer is currently the subject of an avoidance action filed by the Trustee. (Case No. 19-01127, ECF Doc. # 1.) Carbon alleges it did not become aware of the Santander account or transfer until it received supplemental production from Bressler's wife on April 12, 2019. (Motion \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Bressler does not deny that he failed to disclose the existence of the Santander account. Rather, he claims the omission was inadvertent. (Objection \u00b6 44.) Bressler declares that he believed \"only active accounts had to be listed and ... the account had been inactive for over a year and had a nominal balance [as of the Petition].\" (Bressler Affidavit \u00b6 5.) Bressler alleges there is a materiality element of Rule 4004(b)(2) and that the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   value of the account vitiates his fraudulent intent. (Objection \u00b6\u00b6 44-46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   With respect to the transfer, Bressler alleges that he had no legal or equitable interest in the funds and that they were only transferred to him due to a clerical error. (Objection \u00b6 47.) Bressler states that the funds were used by the 83 Spring Close Trust to purchase real estate. He indicates that Northern Trust transferred the funds to his personal account instead of the account for the trust, and Bressler only remitted the funds to the seller to facilitate the closing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Bressler does not explain the origins of the money at Northern Trust. It is unclear who the accountholder was that transferred the money. It could be 83 Spring Close Trust, but that is unclear from the record, and Bressler himself is an accountholder at Northern Trust. (Schedule A/B: Property \u00b6 21.) It is also unclear why the clerical mistake occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Bressler again claims there is no fraudulent intent. The circumstantial evidence indicates otherwise. The non-disclosure of the account appears to be material when considering $1.165 million was transferred out of it within two years of the filing of the Petition. While Bressler claims the transfer was the result of a clerical mistake, he has provided no concrete evidence, other than his affidavit, to support that position. The Trustee, however, filed an adversary complaint alleging the transfer was a fraudulent conveyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Moreover, this is the third supposed mistake involving failure to disclose assets and Bressler has a history of fraud. His denial may not be credible. When considering the totality of the circumstances, there is a plausible claim that Bressler intentionally concealed the account and transfer. There was no notice of the account or transfer prior to the Objection Deadline, the motion has been filed promptly (approximately a month after discovery of the transfer), and Carbon acted diligently in investigating Bressler's financial affairs. Thus, the portion of the Motion seeking an extension for Bressler's allegedly fraudulent concealment of the Santander account and related transfer is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Failure to Comply with Arbitration Order; Destruction of Laptop\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Carbon alleges Bressler should be denied a discharge because, during the gap period, he violated discovery orders in the\n   arbitration proceeding as well as an injunctive order of an Oklahoma state court. Bressler was ordered to produce his laptop computer in the arbitration. (\"Ruling on Carbon's Motion for Sanctions,\" ECF Doc. # 85-2, \u00b6 11.a.) The arbitrator found that on March 3, 2019, prior to producing it, Bressler ran clean-up software on the laptop that destroyed files. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.c.-d.) Bressler also deleted his profile. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.e.) Bressler was sanctioned by the arbitrator as a result. The arbitrator held that Bressler's conduct was \"intentional and in direct violation of Discovery Orders and the District Court Injunctive Order[,]\" which required him to preserve evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Bressler does not deny this dishonest conduct. However, he states it does not support a claim for relief. (Objection \u00b6\u00b6 56-59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Court does not believe that Bressler's violation of the orders of the arbitrator or of the Oklahoma state court requiring a turnover of his computer provides a basis for denying a discharge under section 727(a)(6). As previously explained, the violation must be of an order entered by a bankruptcy court. But to the extent Bressler's computer contained books and records from which his financial condition or business transactions could be ascertained, no court order requiring preservation or turnover of the computer was required for denial of a discharge under section 727(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Under section 727(d)(1), a court may revoke a discharge if the discharge was obtained through fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). Courts have held that if a debtor commits an act described in section 727(a)(2), it is grounds for revocation of a discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Zembko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5419948\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/367/253/#p257\">\n    367 B.R. at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 727(a)(2) has two elements-an act to conceal property and fraudulent intent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5419948\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/367/253/#p257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5419948\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/367/253/#p257\">\n    at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The question is then whether Bressler intended to defraud creditors. If the laptop contained information regarding assets of Bressler's estate or evidence of Bressler concealing assets, then his intent very well could have been to defraud creditors. Without knowing what was deleted, it is unclear if that was the case. This may well raise issues about any presumptions or inferences that arise as a matter of law from spoliation. The Court need not decide that precise point at this time. The Court is satisfied that Carbon has put forth sufficient evidence to show that cause exists to grant an extension on account of Bressler's spoliation. There is no question of notice as the spoliation occurred on March 3, 2019, after the deadline to object had passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The fifth count of Carbon's Proposed Adversary Complaint includes the allegations concerning spoliation of the laptop. (Proposed Adversary Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 63-66.) Carbon alleges in that count that Bressler committed an act described in section 727(a)(3), rather than (a)(2). Here, as a result of spoliation, it appears that Bressler \"concealed, destroyed, mutilated, .., or failed to keep or preserve any recorded information, including books, documents, records, and papers, from which the debtor's financial condition or business transactions might be ascertained,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), by wiping clean his laptop. The exception to discharge under 727(a)(3) contains no requirement of fraudulent intent. But for a discharge to be revoked under section 727(d)(1), and therefore for an extension to be granted under Rule 4004(b)(2), fraudulent intent must be present. Thus, for Carbon to deny Bressler a discharge because of spoliation, it is going to have to satisfy the fraudulent intent requirement of section 727(d)(1), even if the Trustee's claim under section 727(a)(3) can be established without having to meet the same fraudulent intent standard. Carbon\n   needs to modify the draft complaint, if it will include allegations regarding the laptop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Therefore, the portion of the Motion seeking an extension of time to object to discharge because of the spoliation is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Failure to Comply with Rule 2004 Subpoena\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Lastly, Carbon alleges in the Motion that Bressler failed to comply with an order of this court by not complying with a Rule 2004 subpoena. Refusing to respond to a subpoena can form the basis for a denial of discharge under section 727(a)(6)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

D.) The subpoena required Bressler to appear for testimony on April 9, 2019. (ECF Doc. # 111, Ex. E.) Upon being served, Bressler's counsel sent an email to Carbon's counsel, telling him April 9\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   was not a good date and that he would suggest alternative dates. (ECF Doc. # 111, Ex. F.) Bressler's counsel never did, however. Carbon's counsel then sent a follow up email on April 3, 2019, inquiring into Bressler's availability for the weeks of April 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and April 22\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   . (ECF Doc. # 111, Ex. G.) In response, Bressler's counsel sent an email on April 29, 2019 stating Bressler was in the process of assembling documents and that a response, presumably to the subpoena, would be provided in the next few days. The response did not address Bressler's outstanding testimony. (ECF Doc. # 111, Ex. H.) Bressler thereafter produced documents on May 13, 2019, (ECF Doc. # 111, Ex. I); however, Carbon argues the responses are incomplete and that Bressler still has not produced tax returns, real estate closing statements, credit card statements, and documents relating to various trusts. (Motion \u00b6 49.) In addition, Carbon alleges Bressler has still not appeared for oral testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Bressler denies being \"dilatory in any way with respect to the Rule 2004 subpoena ....\" (Objection \u00b6 52.) He claims he has produced over 1,400 pages of documents and adequately addressed all outstanding issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, he alleges that Carbon has failed to show that any recalcitrance was in bad faith or intentional. (Id. \u00b6 53.) Therefore, Bressler asserts relief is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   There is insufficient circumstantial evidence before the Court to infer that Bressler has been intentionally non-compliant with the subpoena. Carbon has only attempted twice to schedule Bressler's oral testimony. It has not sought help from the Court in scheduling it. Asking to reschedule then not responding to a single follow up email does not result in a strong inference that there was intentional non-compliance. Additionally, there is no evidence that Bressler's counsel made Bressler aware of the follow up request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   With respect to the production of documents, Bressler allegedly still has not produced all items requested, including tax returns and credit card statements. His response to the request for documents contains objections to some of the requests. (ECF Doc. # 125, Ex. C.) The Court is unclear as to how well taken the objections are, but Carbon has not sought any relief from the Court, such as an order to compel. Denial of a discharge is a harsh penalty and the Court is cautious not to deny a discharge simply because parties are involved in a discovery dispute. Because Carbon has not put forth facts showing that Bressler has been willfully noncompliant with the subpoena, the Court finds that cause does not exist for an extension of time to object to discharge on that basis. That portion of the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . If it turns out, however, that Bressler's response to the subpoena was frivolous and resulted in him not producing evidence showing he concealed assets, that may be circumstantial evidence of fraudulent intent involving the other facts alleged in the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Failure to Disclose Interest in 1 South Wacker Holdings LLC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Although not addressed directly in the Motion, Carbon's Proposed Adversary Complaint also includes a count for failure to disclose Bressler's interest in an entity called 1 South Wacker Holdings LLC in his SOAL. (Proposed Adversary Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 46, 51.) On June 26, 2019, at the hearing on the Motion, Carbon's counsel represented to the Court that he and Carbon did not learn of this interest until after the Objection Deadline. Bressler's counsel accepted this representation on the record and put forth no objection to Carbon's request for an extension based on the newly learned information. As such, Carbon's request to extend the time to file an objection to discharge complaint with regard to the alleged non-disclosure of 1 South Wacker Holdings LLC is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . It should be noted that the Trustee's Adversary Complaint contains a cause of action based on Bressler's alleged failure to disclose his 1 South Wacker Holdings LLC interest (Trustee's Adversary Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 67, 74), so Bressler is not prejudiced by this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Failure to Disclose Various Other Interests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Also not discussed in the Motion or the Klestadt Declaration was Bressler's alleged concealment of interests in $6 million in stocks and bonds, $4 million in real estate, and IRA/Keough accounts valued at $400,000 (\"Various Other Interests\"). Carbon's Proposed Adversary Complaint contains two counts relating to those interests. (Proposed Adversary Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 53-62.) Carbon's counsel stated at the June 26, 2019 hearing that he learned of those interests when reviewing a personal financial statement completed by Bressler and that he obtained the statement before the Objection Deadline. Because the personal financial statement was obtained by Carbon before the Objection Deadline, Carbon had notice of the alleged fraud before the Objection Deadline, and therefore, Carbon does not meet Rule 4004(b)(2)(B)'s requirement that it did not have knowledge of facts in time to permit an objection. Thus, Carbon's request for an extension based on the non-disclosure of the Various Other Interests is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . If Carbon's counsel did not have enough information to file an objection to discharge complaint in compliance with Rule 9011 before the Objection Deadline, the remedy was to seek an extension of time under Rule 4004(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Carbon Has Exercised Diligence in Investigating Bressler\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Since Carbon has established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for cause, as to some of the facts alleged in the Motion, the burden rests with Bressler to demonstrate why relief should not be granted. Bressler argues Carbon should not be afforded relief because it did not diligently investigate his financial affairs prior to the Objection Deadline. (Objection \u00b6\u00b6 60-63.) This argument lacks merit. First, Bressler has consistently been late in meeting his own obligations in the case, including filing late schedules, adjourning the 341 meeting, and not timely responding to the Rule 2004 discovery requests, which had the impact of delaying Carbon's investigation. More importantly, Carbon filed its Rule 2004 Application, seeking a considerable amount of discovery from multiple parties, on December 19, 2018, less than two weeks after the 341 meeting, approximately one month after Bressler tardily filed his initial schedules, and approximately one month prior to the Objection Deadline. (\"Rule 2004 Application,\" ECF Doc. # 41.) The timing of the Rule 2004 Application refutes Bressler's allegation of a lack of diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   For the reasons explained above, Carbon's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . Carbon's Proposed Adversary Complaint contains counts under section 727(a) of the Code. Carbon will need to revise its draft complaint to comply with this Court's Rule 4004(b)(2) rulings as set forth above. Carbon shall file its denial of discharge adversary complaint within 30 days from the date of this opinion. Of course, granting Carbon an extension may prove to be academic, in any event, as the Trustee's Adversary Complaint includes essentially the same allegations alleged in the Motion. If the Trustee is successful in denying Bressler's discharge under section 727, Carbon will get the same relief it is seeking in its separate complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Carbon's Proposed Adversary Complaint was drafted before the Court issued the Prior Opinion. It notes that its Motion to Extend is\n    <em>\n     sub judice\n    </em>\n    . The Proposed Adversary Complaint includes causes of action under sections 727(a)(2)(A), (a)(2)(B), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(4)(D), and (a)(5).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    The Trustee also filed an adversary complaint against Amy Bressler, as trustee of the 83 Spring Close Trust, relating to the alleged transfers from the Santander account. (Case No. 19-01127, ECF Doc. # 1.) The funds allegedly were used to purchase a home in East Hampton that Amy Bressler, in her capacity as trustee, has title to. The adversary complaint alleges, among other things, that Bressler is the sole holder of the Santander account, that he failed to disclose the existence of the account in bankruptcy to avoid discovery that its funds were used to acquire the property, that Bressler orchestrated Amy Bressler's acquisition of the property in the name of the trust for the purpose of concealing it from creditors, and that Bressler and his relations utilize the property as if Bressler owned it. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 12-33.) The complaint alleges that Bressler has a legal and equitable interest in the transfers and property, which are property of the estate. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.) It seeks turnover of the property, the imposition of a constructive trust and an equitable lien on the property, an award for unjust enrichment, and avoidance of the transfers as fraudulent conveyances under New York Debtor and Creditor Law and the Bankruptcy Code.
