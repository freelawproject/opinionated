The Motion seeks summary judgment in this Chapter 15 case to deny recognition of the Debtor's Indonesian Proceeding, or the PKPU Proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Debtor PT Bakrie Telecom Tbk, or BTEL, was in the business of providing a fixed digital radio cellular telecommunication national network and services.\n   <em>\n    See Declaration of Petitioner Jastiro Abi\n   </em>\n   ... (referred to herein as the Abi Declaration) at ECF No. 6 \u00b6 2. However, it currently has very limited business activities and negligible revenue. It is in the process of trying to implement an Indonesian court-approved debt restructuring plan, or the PKPU Plan, that would allow it to avoid liquidation and conduct more significant business operations.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BTEL's current financial woes stem from a default on certain senior notes issued pursuant to an indenture and supplemental indenture.\n   <em>\n    See Foreign Representative's Response to Noteholders' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts\n   </em>\n   ... (referred to herein as the Undisputed Facts) at ECF No. 65 \u00b6 1. Bakrie Telecom Pte. Ltd. (referred to herein as the Issuer), a subsidiary of BTEL, issued $ 380 million in 11.5% guaranteed senior notes due 2015 on behalf of BTEL.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Indenture is governed by New York law.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. The Indenture contains a forum selection clause providing that the Issuer, BTEL, and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below) irrevocably and unconditionally [submit] to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or United States Federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Indenture, any Note, or any Guarantee (as discussed below).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Abi Declaration, Ex. A \u00a7 12.07(b). The Bank of New York Mellon is the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Undisputed Facts \u00b6 3. Jastiro Abi-the purported foreign representative who filed this case on behalf of the Debtor-was a Director of both BTEL and of the Issuer at the time of the Offering.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BTEL solicited potential investors in the offering of the Notes by, among other things, distributing offering memoranda and traveling to New York, where it distributed an investor presentation to underwriters and potential investors.\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-9. The investor presentation indicated that BTEL would use the offering proceeds to refinance its existing debt and for capital expenditures.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. BTEL caused the Issuer to be created for the sole purpose of issuing the Notes and loaning the offering proceeds to BTEL, which the Issuer did pursuant to an Intercompany Loan Agreement and Supplemental Intercompany Loan Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. As security for repayment of the Notes, the Issuer granted the Indenture Trustee an assignment of all creditor rights under the Intercompany Loan Agreements and a power of attorney upon an event of default on the Notes.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22;\n   <em>\n    see generally id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Additionally, as primary obligations to secure repayment of the Notes, BTEL guaranteed the Notes pursuant to a Parent Guarantee.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. The Parent Guarantee provides noteholders and the Indenture Trustee direct recourse to BTEL without requiring them to pursue the Issuer for non-payment.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Petitioner Abi executed the Parent Guarantee on behalf of BTEL and understood that BTEL was obligated to repay the Notes if the Issuer failed to do so.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. PT Bakrie Network and PT Bakrie Connectivity similarly guaranteed the Notes pursuant to a Subsidiary Guarantee.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. I will refer to them as the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Parent Guarantee and the Subsidiary Guarantee are governed by New York law.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BTEL, the Issuer, and the Subsidiary Guarantors ultimately defaulted on scheduled interest payments due on the Notes in November 2013 and May 2014.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Before the scheduled payment in May 2014, BTEL issued a written notice to all noteholders stating that (i) it was engaged in discussions with a Steering Committee of key noteholders regarding the current financial and operational position of the company and a potential restructuring of the Notes, and (ii) it would not be making any further interest payments on the Notes pending the resolution of such discussions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. In response, the Objecting Noteholders-who are purchasers and beneficial holders of some $ 105 million in face amount of the Notes, or over 25% of the outstanding $ 380 million in Notes issued-and three other noteholders formed an Ad Hoc Committee to engage in discussions with BTEL about its financial and operational plans.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 52. That summer, the Ad Hoc Committee worked with BTEL and its financial consultant to conduct due diligence and evaluate the merits of BTEL's restructuring efforts.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53;\n   <em>\n    see generally id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-58. But by August 2014, discussions between BTEL and the Ad Hoc Committee had broken down.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Accordingly, in September, three of the Objecting Noteholders commenced litigation in New York state court against BTEL, the Issuer, and the Subsidiary Guarantors for breach of the Notes.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. They subsequently issued to and served on BTEL, the Issuer, and the Indenture Trustee a notice of acceleration declaring all principal and interest immediately due and owing under the Notes and demanding immediate payment.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Meanwhile, on October 23, 2014, one of BTEL's other creditors filed a PKPU application against BTEL in the Central Jakarta Commercial Court (the \"Commercial Court\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. A PKPU proceeding is a court-enforced suspension of payments process in Indonesia that is designed to provide a debtor a definite period of time to restructure its debt and reorganize its affairs pursuant to a composition plan with its creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Abi Declaration \u00b6 12. BTEL engaged in months of restructuring negotiations with the noteholders, ultimately resulting in the Commercial Court granting a Temporary Suspension of Payment in the PKPU.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Undisputed Facts \u00b6\u00b6 68, 70. The Suspension of Payment named Titik Tejaningsih as Supervisory Judge and appointed William Eduard Daniel and Imran Nating as Administrators.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. The Administrators then set a 29-day schedule within which a restructuring plan was to be finalized, voted on, and confirmed.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For BTEL's PKPU Plan to be accepted, the proposal was required to be approved by the requisite majority of creditors attending and voting at the meeting at which the Plan was considered, namely a majority in number and two-thirds in value of holders of each class of debt that attended and voted at the meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Abi Declaration \u00b6 16. Broadly, the Objecting Noteholders complain that, even though they filed claims, they were excluded from the PKPU process.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Undisputed Facts \u00b6\u00b6 75-113. They contend that they were prevented from meaningfully participating in the PKPU Proceeding because the Administrators used something called the \"record and reports\" to evaluate and determine who could vote on BTEL's PKPU Plan, and the Administrators denied the claims filed by the Ad Hoc Committee and Steering Committee because they were not recorded on the record and report.\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88-94. Rather, BTEL listed the Issuer as its creditor owing the $ 380 million on the record and report, and the Administrators allowed this claim under the Intercompany Loan Agreements.\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91-92. The Objecting Noteholders assert that the Indenture Trustee did not consent to the Issuer voting the Note debt instead of the noteholders (and told the Administrators as much), that the Issuer lacked standing to vote the Note debt and was not authorized to do so under the terms of the Indenture, and that the PKPU Plan would not have received the requisite votes needed for approval if the Issuer had abstained from voting.\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 100-124. They also claim that the Administrators ignored multiple letters they sent concerning, among other things, information requests, how to submit their claim, and a request for extension of the PKPU Proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   BTEL's PKPU Plan ultimately did receive the requisite creditor support and was approved in December 2014.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119. Neither the Indenture Trustee nor any of the Objecting Noteholders appealed the Indonesian Court's decision, but the Minister of Communication and Informatics of the Republic of Indonesia did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Abi Declaration \u00b6 19-20. This appeal was denied by the Supreme Court of Indonesia (the \"Indonesian Supreme Court\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21, Ex. C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The same day that their claims were rejected in the PKPU Proceeding, the Objecting Noteholders commenced a second action in the New York state court against BTEL, BTEL's minority shareholder PT Bakrie &amp; Brothers Tbk (referred to herein as \"B &amp; B\"), and some present and former commissioners and directors of the Issuer, BTEL, and the Subsidiary Guarantors (referred to herein as the Individual Defendants) for fraud and other tortious conduct in connection with the Offering.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Abi Declaration \u00b6 28. The Objecting Noteholders also sought a declaratory judgment that the PKPU Proceeding was invalid with respect to the Notes and the Indenture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Undisputed Facts \u00b6 137. These claims were subsequently consolidated with the breach of Notes and other claims already pending in the New York state court.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The New York court granted summary judgment on the Objecting Noteholders' breach of contract claim and sustained the claims against the Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors for fraud in connection with the Offering but dismissed the claims against the Individual Defendants and B &amp; B for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 139-140. On cross-appeals, the New York Appellate Division affirmed summary judgment in favor of the Objecting Noteholders as to liability on the Notes, Indenture, and Guarantees, sustained the fraud claims, reinstated the claims against the Individual Defendants and B &amp; B, and\n   ordered jurisdictional discovery.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141-142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In December 2017, the New York trial court ordered the parties to proceed with jurisdictional discovery.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 143. Less than two weeks later, BTEL executed a \"Declaration of Appointment of Foreign Representative and Authorization to File Chapter 15 Petition\" that appointed Petitioner Abi to serve as BTEL's foreign representative and authorizing him to file a petition under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144. He filed the Chapter 15 case in late January 2018.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145. Shortly after the filing, BTEL, the Issuer, and the Subsidiary Guarantors stipulated to entry of judgment in the amount of $ 161,614,872.09 on the Objecting Noteholders' breach of contract claim in the New York litigation.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146. The money judgment was so ordered and entered in the Office of the Clerk, but the Objecting Noteholders have stipulated not to execute or enforce the money judgment pending resolution of the Chapter 15 case.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In late 2018, the Objecting Noteholders filed the Motion for summary judgment denying recognition of the PKPU Proceeding, and this Court heard argument on the Motion in late January 2019. The Motion seeks summary judgment, arguing that the Debtor cannot satisfy the requirements for recognition given the undisputed facts. More specifically, the Objecting Noteholders contend that the Debtors cannot satisfy the following requirements for recognition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1) The property requirement of Bankruptcy Code Section 109(a) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2) The appointment of a foreign representative within the meaning of Sections 101(24) and 1515(a) of the Bankruptcy Code ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   3) The requirement that the proceeding be collective as defined by Section 101(23) and not be manifestly contrary to U.S. public policy as required by Section 1506.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While the Debtor has opposed the Objecting Noteholders' request for summary judgment, the Debtor itself has not moved for summary judgment, content to let these issues be addressed at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For the reasons I will explain, the Court concludes that the summary judgment Motion of the Objecting Noteholders should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Summary judgment is not proper if there is any evidence from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in the non-moving party's favor as to an issue on which summary judgment is sought.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re WorldCom, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201836599\">\n    2007 WL 1836599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Bankr.

Under Article 291 of the PKPU Law, BTEL's failure to implement the PKPU Plan could result in BTEL's being subjected to a court-supervised liquidation in the Commercial Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Admittedly, the Debtor has provided a less-than-fulsome record concerning the appointment of Abi as its foreign representative. But the Debtor has explained that (1) Abi is a director of BTEL,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Abi Declaration \u00b6 1, (2) Abi was appointed by BTEL's board of directors pursuant to a corporate resolution,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35, and (3) Abi is authorized to administer the reorganization of the Debtor's affairs and represent the Debtor in this Chapter 15 case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. At oral argument, Debtor's counsel put some additional context around these facts by explaining-in essence-that the Debtor had hoped to resolve the New York litigation without seeking relief under Chapter 15, but those efforts were unsuccessful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 18, 2019 Hearing Transcript at 69:16-77:6 [ECF No. 73]. While such an explanation is not evidence, construing the facts we do have in the light most favorable to the Debtor as the non-moving party, the above facts are sufficient to defeat summary judgment. Indeed, it appears clear that the Debtor seeks Chapter 15 relief as the method to effectuate the PKPU Plan and allow the Debtor to resume operations. The Objecting Noteholders do not posit an alternative rationale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In reaching today's conclusion, the Court is unaware of any authority explicitly precluding the appointment of a foreign representative for purposes of pursuing Chapter 15 relief after the foreign proceeding has been closed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, given the policy underlying Chapter 15, it would be hard to imagine why such action would be categorically prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Objecting Noteholders caution against recognizing the foreign representative here because, \"[w]ere the Court to hold [that Abi was properly appointed as a foreign representative], then any entity that ever has gone through a foreign proceeding could determine years later that, as here, it wants to appoint a foreign representative for the purposes of seeking recognition under and obtaining the benefits of Chapter 15.\" Motion \u00b6 94. But the Objecting Noteholders' argument ignores\n   the fact that the PKPU Plan-which was indisputably approved \"in the context of, during, and in the course of\" the foreign proceeding-remains to be implemented. And, as the Debtor points out, it is unclear what supposedly improper benefits a foreign debtor would have to gain by pursuing such a strategy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Foreign Representative's Opposition to Motion \u00b6 112. In any event, the Court must evaluate each case on the merits based on its own unique facts and circumstances. The Court concludes that the mere fact of the delay in seeking Chapter 15 relief after a foreign proceeding has been closed-in and of itself-does not preclude a finding that this foreign representative was not properly appointed. In the end, the Court concludes that a trial here is appropriate to examine the circumstances surrounding the timing of the foreign representative's appointment and the significance, if any, of the delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, the Court rejects the Objecting Noteholders' argument that the appointment of the foreign representative is ineffective under Indonesian law because it was not approved by the Administrators who exercise joint control and authority with the BTEL Board over any action taken during the PKPU Proceeding with respect to management or ownership of the Debtor's assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion \u00b6 95. The\n   <em>\n    Vitro I\n   </em>\n   court explicitly addressed-and rejected-a nearly identical argument, albeit in the context of Mexican law, holding that the matter of whether a foreign representative is properly appointed \"is a matter of United States-not Mexican-law.\"\n   <em>\n    Vitro I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3956258\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/470/408/#p411\">\n    470 B.R. at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noteholder's legal expert admitting that \"why these United States Courts decided to allow [an officer or director of a Mexican debtor] to serve as foreign representative is beyond my knowledge, because it's a matter of United States law\") (internal quotations omitted).

The Objecting Noteholders then point to the decisions of the Commercial Court and the Indonesian Supreme Court, which both state that the Administrators denied the Indenture Trustee's claim because it was not contained in the\n   record and report of the Debtor in accordance with Article 271.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Directory of Judgment of Supreme Court of Republic of Indonesia, attached as Exhibit F to the Declaration of Kenneth Puhala in Support of Foreign Representative's Opposition to Motion (the \"Puhala Declaration\") [ECF No. 64-6] at 32, 38; Judgment Ratification of Homologation, attached as Exhibit 79 to the Bloom Declaration [ECF No. 57-79] at 20.

For instance, after a composition plan is accepted by the required majority of creditors, PKPU Law provides that the Commercial Court may still reject the plan if,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the plan was reached \"because of swindle, or conspiracy with one creditor or more, or because of the use of other unfair attempts without considering whether or not the debtor or other party has cooperated to achieve the matter.\" PKPU Law Article 285(2)(c). But the Commercial Court here instead chose to approve the PKPU Plan.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Judgment Ratification of Homologation, attached as Exhibit 79 to the Bloom Declaration. And PKPU Law also provides that ratification of the composition plan by the Commercial Court can be further appealed to the Indonesian Supreme Court, the highest court in Indonesia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PKPU Law Article 295(1). While the Objecting Noteholders and Indenture Trustee chose not to appeal the Commercial Court decision, that decision was appealed by the Minister of Communications and Informatics of the Republic of Indonesia based upon the same voting process arguments that had been made by the Indenture Trustee and the Objecting Noteholders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Directory of Judgment of Supreme Court of Republic of Indonesia at 137-140, attached as Exhibit F to Puhala Declaration.

Even the Objecting Noteholders' own Indonesian law expert does not categorically opine that Article 271 of the PKPU Law requires administrators to blindly adhere to a debtor's record and report, stating instead that the administers are \"\n   <em>\n    free to object\n   </em>\n   (i.e., not recognize) a creditor's claim that was not listed in the debtor's record and report but is being submitted to participate in the PKPU proceeding....\" Sidharta Declaration \u00b6 60 (emphasis added). Under PKPU Law, the administrators (along with the debtor) are also involved in the management of the debtor's assets during the PKPU proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PKPU Law Article 225(3) (stating that managers \"along with the debtor manage the wealth of the debtor.\").

For instance, a collective proceeding contemplates the \"consideration and eventual treatment of claims of various types of creditors....\"\n   <em>\n    In re Ashapura\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155289\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/480/129/#p136\">\n    480 B.R. at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As reflected in the decision of the Commercial Court-which was affirmed by the Indonesian Supreme Court-the PKPU Plan restructured all of BTEL's more than $ 770\n   million of indebtedness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment Ratification of Homologation at 24-85, attached as Exhibit 79 to the Bloom Declaration.

But the Objecting Noteholders have not provided the Court with any evidence regarding corruption with respect to PKPU proceedings in general or with respect to this proceeding in particular. Given other issues of fact the Court has identified above as to the PKPU Proceeding, reliance here on the Country Report alone is an insufficient basis on which to grant summary judgment for the Objecting Noteholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Raising arguments similar to those already discussed, the Objecting Noteholders finally argue that the PKPU Proceeding should not be recognized because it was manifestly contrary to U.S. public policy. But \"[t]he public policy exception set forth in [S]ection 1506 is narrowly construed and invoked only under exceptional circumstances that concern matters of fundamental importance to the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Poymanov\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268784\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/24/#p38\">\n    571 B.R. 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38 (Bankr.

These include issues of fact regarding how the PKPU Proceeding worked here and the independence of the officials that participated therein. Accordingly, the Court will deny summary judgment on the basis of Section 1506 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For all the reasons set forth above, the Court denies the summary judgment Motion of the Objecting Noteholders.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The Foreign Representative argues that the PKPU schedule was actually set by the Commercial Court, not the Administrators.
