The Court has subject matter jurisdiction of this contested matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202166\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Court heard oral argument on the Motion on April 24, 2019 (the \"Hearing\"). Having considered carefully all of the submissions and arguments made in connection with the Motion, the Motion is denied for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Motion arises in the context of litigation commenced by the Oversight Board and the Committee concerning bonds issued by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \"Commonwealth\" or \"Puerto Rico\") and its instrumentalities. On December 21, 2018, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (the \"Oversight Board\") and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the \"Creditors' Committee\") commenced an adversary proceeding captioned\n   <em>\n    Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico et al. v. Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority\n   </em>\n   , Adv. Proc. No. 18-149 (the \"PBA Adversary Proceeding\"). On January 14, 2019, the Creditors' Committee and the Oversight Board's Special Claims Committee filed the\n   <em>\n    Omnibus Objection Of (I) Financial Oversight and Management Board, Acting Through Its Special Claims Committee, and (II) Official Committee Of Unsecured Creditors, Pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Section 502 and Bankruptcy Rule 3007, to Claims Filed or Asserted by Holders of Certain Commonwealth General Obligation Bonds\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 4784, the \"GO Bond Claim Objection\" and, together with the PBA Adversary Proceeding, the \"Pending Litigation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The complaint in the PBA Adversary Proceeding alleges that the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority (the \"PBA\") is a party to certain agreements that purport to lease PBA facilities to the Commonwealth and other public entities, but that those agreements are, in substance, financing agreements rather than\n   <em>\n    bona\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    fide\n   </em>\n   leases. The PBA Adversary Proceeding seeks judicial determinations that the obligations of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and public corporations under the\n   PBA lease agreements should not be treated as lease obligations under Section 365(d)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor as administrative obligations under Section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The GO Bond Claim Objection builds on the allegations of the PBA Adversary Proceeding and alleges that bonds issued by the PBA-which are guaranteed by the Commonwealth-are actually obligations of the Commonwealth that were disguised as PBA obligations to circumvent the debt service limit and the balanced budget clause of the Constitution of Puerto Rico. (GO Bond Claim Objection \u00b6\u00b6 2-5.) The GO Bond Claim Objection contends that the PBA bonds therefore should be included in calculating the constitutional limits on the Commonwealth's debt service and budgetary obligations, and that the Commonwealth exceeded those constitutional constraints when it issued more than $ 6 billion of general obligation bonds in 2012 and 2014 (the \"Challenged GO Bonds\"). On that basis, the GO Bond Claim Objection seeks to invalidate all claims based on the Challenged GO Bonds. (GO Bond Claim Objection \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In connection with the GO Bond Claim Objection, the Creditors' Committee and the Oversight Board's Special Claims Committee also filed the\n   <em>\n    Urgent Motion of (i) Financial Oversight and Management Board, Acting Through its Special Claims Committee, and (ii) Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors for Entry of Order, Under Sections 105(a) and 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rule 3007, and Sections 301(a) and 310 of PROMESA, Establishing Procedures with Respect to Omnibus Objection to Claims Filed or Asserted by Holders of Certain Commonwealth General Obligation Bonds and Requesting Related Relief\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 4788, the \"Initial GO Bond Claim Objection Procedures Motion\"). That motion sought to establish procedures to provide notice to parties in interest of the GO Bond Claim Objection, to create a \"notice of participation\" mechanism for each party to provide notice of its intention to be involved in litigating the GO Bond Claim Objection, and to require parties to confer among themselves to establish procedures for the litigation of that dispute. The Court granted the Initial GO Bond Claim Objection Procedures Motion on February 15, 2019. (Docket Entry No. 5143.) To date, over a thousand notices of participation have been filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 2, 2019, the GO Group filed the\n   <em>\n    Omnibus Conditional Objection of the Ad Hoc Group of General Obligation Bondholders to Claims Filed or Asserted by the Public Buildings Authority, Holders of Public Buildings Authority Bonds, and Holders of Certain Commonwealth General Obligation Bonds\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 6099, the \"Conditional Claim Objection\"). The Conditional Claim Objection raises several issues arising out of arguments presented in the Pending Litigation. According to the Conditional Claim Objection, if the PBA structure is a subterfuge intended to circumvent requirements of the Puerto Rico Constitution, the proper remedy is the invalidation of the PBA bond obligations. (Conditional Claim Objection at 19-20.) Furthermore, the Conditional\n   Claim Objection argues that the logic of the GO Bond Claim Objection, if accepted, would require the invalidation of Commonwealth and PBA bond obligations that were issued as early as 2009. (Conditional Claim Objection at 31-33.) The Conditional Claim Objection further asserts that, to the extent earlier bond issuances are found to be invalid, they should not be counted toward the Commonwealth's debt service and balanced budget limitations. (Conditional Claim Objection at 5 &amp; n.5.) Although the Conditional Claim Objection is styled as an objection to claims pursuant to Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code and Rule 3007 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the Conditional Claim Objection presents its arguments as hypothetical propositions and expressly disclaims any implication that the GO Group endorses the relief described therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The GO Group filed the Motion contemporaneously with its Conditional Claim Objection. The Motion is patterned on the Initial GO Bond Claim Objection Procedures Motion. It seeks to give notice of the Conditional Claim Objection to parties in interest and to allow them to participate in the formulation of procedures for litigation of the issues raised in the Conditional Claim Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Several parties in interest interposed objections to the Motion. The objections to the Motion predominantly argue that the Conditional Claim Objection impermissibly seeks an advisory opinion because the arguments asserted therein are asserted in the hypothetical and are entirely contingent on certain outcomes of disputed issues in the Pending Litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket Entry No. 6254 at \u00b6 15; Docket Entry No. 6261 at \u00b6 11.) Certain objectors also contend that it would be more efficient and economical to first resolve issues in the Pending Litigation that underlie the Conditional Claim Objection prior to implementing the relief sought in the Motion and litigating the Conditional Claim Objection. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket Entry No. 6181 at \u00b6 5; Docket Entry No. 6254 at \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Article III, section 2 of the Constitution of the United States limits the exercise of federal judicial power to actual cases and controversies.\"\n   <em>\n    ACP Master, Ltd. v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (In re Fin. Oversight &amp; Mgmt. Bd. for P.R.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524316\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/328/#p336\">\n    300 F.Supp.3d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 336 (D.P.R. 2018),\n   <em>\n    aff'd,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520576\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/919/638/\">\n    919 F.3d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2019). Federal courts lack jurisdiction \"to render advisory opinions, or to entertain 'friendly' suits, or to resolve political questions, because suits of this character are inconsistent with the judicial function under Art. III.\"\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v. Morton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723565\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/727/\">\n    405 U.S. 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 732 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723565\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/727/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723565\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/727/\">\n    31 L.Ed.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972) (citations and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By means of the Conditional Claim Objection, the GO Group seeks to present legal disputes for adjudication by the Court that are expressly conditioned on future events that may or may not occur, specifically, the Court's determination that certain PBA lease agreements are disguised financing transactions and that the Challenged GO Bonds are invalid under\n   certain provisions of the Puerto Rico Constitution. Disputes concerning the nature of the PBA lease agreements and the application of the debt limit and balanced budget provisions of the Constitution of Puerto Rico have been commenced via the PBA Adversary Proceeding and the GO Bond Claim Objection. The GO Group contends that the related issues raised in its Conditional Claim Objection are ripe now because they arise directly out of the arguments advanced by the Oversight Board and the Creditors' Committee in the GO Bond Claim Objection. (Docket Entry No. 6429, the \"Reply,\" at 5-6.) The Motion seeks to establish complex notification and procedural provisions in connection with the Conditional Claim Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   However, the Motion and the related Conditional Claim Objection make clear that the GO Group itself does not, at this point in time, actually even support the relief described in the Conditional Claim Objection. Nor is there any certainty that the GO Group would support the relief described therein at any point in the future. Instead, the Conditional Claim Objection appears to present a hypothetical request for relief instead of an actual case or controversy. In its current form and with its current movant, the Conditional Claim Objection appears to seek an advisory opinion that would not be justiciable in the present posture of the matter. Under these circumstances it would be improper to implement related procedures, including the dissemination of broad and potentially confusing notice of a request that is not currently being pressed by any party in interest and may never be pressed at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The GO Group contends that the Motion would provide notice to individuals and entities whose rights may be affected indirectly by issues decided in the Pending Litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 8-9.) However, the issues identified in the Conditional Claim Objection are not currently presented by parties to the Pending Litigation, and it is possible that they never will be. Furthermore, several holders and insurers of PBA bonds have already sought and been granted the right to intervene in the PBA Adversary Proceeding, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 54 in Adv. Proc. No. 18-149 (granting seven motions to intervene in the PBA Adversary Proceeding)), and the Court's order granting the Initial GO Bond Claim Objection Procedures Motion does not preclude the involvement of parties in interest whose rights may be affected by the resolution of the questions raised in that litigation. The issues raised in the Conditional Claim Objection may ripen into concrete disputes between adverse parties in the course of the Pending Litigation; parties in interest eventually may raise defenses or plead counterclaims or crossclaims that, like the Conditional Claim Objection, assert alternative calculations of the debts that count toward the constitutional debt service limit or dispute the validity of PBA bonds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that has not yet happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The GO Group's analogy to Rule 14(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reply at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lehman v. Revolution Portfolio L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397330\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/389/\">\n    166 F.3d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 1999) ))-which allows a litigant to assert claims against a nonparty who may be liable for all or part of a claim against\n   the litigant-is also unavailing at this time and in these particular circumstances. Rule 14(a) is not incorporated in contested matters,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014(c), and it does not expand the scope of the federal courts' jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution. Furthermore, even absent the limitations imposed by Article III, it would not be prudent to commence giving notice to hundreds or thousands of bondholders of a motion (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Conditional Claim Objection) that no party in interest actually advocates based upon the possibility that arguments that have been raised by the Pending Litigation-but which have not been briefed or otherwise proceeded beyond the early stages of litigation-may, if accepted by the Court, indirectly affect those bondholders' interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Motion is denied without prejudice.
