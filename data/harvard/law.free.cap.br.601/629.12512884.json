O'Malley filed a motion indicating that O'Malley died on May 10, 2019 and requesting an order \"holding in abeyance all proceedings in this cause\" and ordering \"supplemental briefing on motions pertaining to\" his death. (Adv. No. 16-00552, Dkt. No. 139.) Despite the fact that O'Malley has died, the legal analyses and conclusions in this Memorandum Opinion are unchanged. To resolve this long-undecided adversary proceeding and to aid in the potential settlement or other resolution of the related adversaries that continue to pend, the Court denies the requests in the motion and issues the instant Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-9\">\n   Janet S. Baer, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Brenda P. Helms, as chapter 7 trustee (the \"Trustee\") of the bankruptcy estate of\n   Michael K. O'Malley (\"O'Malley\"), filed a six-count adversary complaint against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\"MetLife\"), O'Malley, Tracy Zellmer (\"Zellmer\"), and TAMO, LLC (\"TAMO\"). In the complaint, the Trustee seeks a declaratory judgment that O'Malley's interest in an excess benefit retirement plan is non-exempt property of the estate (Count I), turnover of the proceeds of the retirement plan (Count II), avoidance and recovery of certain post-petition transfers related to the retirement plan (Counts III and IV), an award of damages for willful violations of the automatic stay (Count V), and disallowance of any claims filed by Zellmer or TAMO (Count VI). This matter now comes before the Court on the Trustee's motion for summary judgment on Counts I-V and O'Malley's cross-motion for summary judgment on all six counts of the complaint. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact, that the Trustee is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Counts I-IV, and that O'Malley is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Count V. Because neither Zellmer nor TAMO filed any proofs of claim, Count VI will be dismissed by the Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Internal Operating Procedure 15(a) of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

O'Malley's Bankruptcy Filing and Schedules\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 19, 2013, O'Malley filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"Code\"). (Bankr. No. 13-10864, Dkt. No. 1.) Subsequently, on April 5, 2013, O'Malley filed schedules B and C on which he failed to disclose any interest in any retirement plans. (Bankr. No. 13-10864, Dkt. No. 13.) About two weeks later, on April 23, 2013, the 341 meeting of creditors was held. (O'Malley Resp. to Tr.'s Stmt. of Undisputed Facts, Adv. No. 16-00552, Dkt. No. 103, \u00b6 26.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) During the meeting, O'Malley's attorney stated that O'Malley would amend his schedules to include \"a Met Life ... defined benefit pension plan\" and that 50% of that plan was pledged to O'Malley's former spouse Debbie O'Malley pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order (the \"QDRO\"). (Tr. of 341 Meeting, Bankr. No. 13-10864, Dkt. No. 167-1, at 23:22-24:3.) On June 4, 2013, O'Malley filed amended schedules B and C, listing a \"Met Life Defined Benefit Pension Plan\" of \"Unknown\" value and claiming exempt 100% of its value. (O'Malley Resp. to Tr.'s Stmt. of Undisputed Facts, Dkt. No. 103, \u00b6\u00b6 28 &amp; 29; Am. Sch. C, Bankr. No. 13-10864, Dkt. No. 35, at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   About eight months later, on February 11, 2014, the 341 meeting concluded. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. No. 13-10864, Dkt. No. 100.) Thereafter, on March 24, 2014, the Trustee filed a no-asset report. (Bankr. No. 13-10864, Dkt. No. 113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. O'Malley's Retirement Plans: The Traditional Plan and the Auxiliary Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   O'Malley's employment with MetLife commenced in August 1981 and terminated in April 2005. (O'Malley Dep., Dkt. No. 92-5, at 10:23-11:7; MetLife Add'l Facts, Dkt. No. 108, \u00b6 8.) As a MetLife employee, O'Malley participated in two separate retirement plans: the \"Metropolitan Life Retirement Plan for United States Employees\" (the \"Traditional Plan\") and the \"MetLife Auxiliary Pension Plan\" (the \"Auxiliary Plan\"). (O'Malley Dep., Dkt. No. 92-5, at 71:1-5, 71:20-23, 72:15-17, 75:3-11; MetLife Answer to Tr.'s Compl., Dkt. No. 92-1, \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Traditional Plan is intended to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\") and the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code governing tax-qualified pension plans. (Traditional Plan, Dkt. No. 92-6, at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Auxiliary Plan is a nonqualified excess benefit plan governed by \u00a7 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. (Auxiliary Plan, Dkt. Nos. 92-7 &amp; 108-3, at 2;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   MetLife Resp. to Tr.'s Stmt. of Undisputed Facts, Dkt. No. 108, \u00b6 18.) It is \"completely unfunded,\" and \"[a]ll obligations under th[e] Plan are entirely separate\" from the Traditional Plan. (Auxiliary Plan, Dkt. Nos. 92-7 &amp; 108-3, at 13.) O'Malley's benefits under the Auxiliary Plan are subject to a QDRO issued in 2011, which provides for the assignment of a portion of the benefits to his former spouse. (O'Malley Resp. to Tr.'s Stmt. of Undisputed Facts, Dkt. No. 103, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Pursuant to the Auxiliary Plan, participants can elect from a range of payment options, including different types of contingent survivor annuities. (MetLife Payment History Report, Dkt. No. 92-13, at 7-8.) A contingent survivor annuity provides monthly payments to a participant until his or her death; after the participant's death, a percentage of those payments go to the participant's designated beneficiary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) Without an election on file, participants who are married at the time distributions commence receive payments in the form of a default 50% contingent survivor annuity. (MetLife Add'l Facts, Dkt. No. 108, \u00b6 2; Auxiliary Plan, Dkt. Nos. 92-7 &amp; 108-3, at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Commencement of Distributions Under the Auxiliary Plan, the Trustee's Turnover Demands, and the Filing of the Adversary Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   O'Malley and Zellmer married on June 5, 2015. (O'Malley Resp. to Tr.'s Stmt. of Undisputed Facts, Dkt. No. 103, \u00b6 30.) On July 23, 2015, O'Malley designated Zellmer as his survivor and elected the 100% contingent survivor annuity payment option under the Auxiliary Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   About a week later, on August 1, 2015, O'Malley's benefits under the Auxiliary Plan began, entitling him to net monthly payments of $ 3,614.72 after taxes and payments to his former spouse pursuant to the QDRO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34 &amp; 36.) O'Malley\n   directed MetLife to send all of his eligible payments under the Auxiliary Plan to a TAMO bank account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Zellmer is the sole member of TAMO and was in control of TAMO at all times relevant to this adversary proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) The payments delivered to the TAMO account (the \"TAMO transfers\") totaled at least $ 46,991.36 between September 1, 2015 and August 1, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) The Court did not authorize the delivery of those payments to TAMO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) Zellmer used the funds in the TAMO account to pay household bills, taxes, and other personal expenses. (Zellmer Dep., Dkt. No. 92-4, at 104:8-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 13, 2016, MetLife received a turnover letter from the Trustee and complied with the demand by withholding payments under O'Malley's Auxiliary Plan. (Tr. Resp. to MetLife Add'l Facts, Dkt. No. 124, \u00b6 15.) Pursuant to the Court's order dated March 16, 2018, MetLife deposited with the Trustee the withholdings for the period August 2016 to February 2018 totaling $ 68,679.68. (Dkt. No. 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 14, 2016, the Trustee sent a letter to Zellmer and TAMO demanding turnover of all funds in their possession stemming from the Auxiliary Plan payments, but Zellmer and TAMO failed to comply. (O'Malley Resp. to Tr.'s Stmt. of Undisputed Facts, Dkt. No. 103, \u00b6\u00b6 43 &amp; 44.) Thereafter, on August 5, 2016, the Trustee sent a letter to O'Malley demanding turnover of his interest in the Auxiliary Plan (including the proceeds delivered to TAMO), but O'Malley also failed to comply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45 &amp; 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 31, 2016, the Trustee filed a six-count adversary complaint against MetLife, O'Malley, Zellmer, and TAMO. (Tr. Compl., Dkt. No. 1.) A year and a half later, in February 2018, the Trustee filed the instant motion for summary judgment on Counts I-V of the complaint, contending that: (1) O'Malley's interest under the Auxiliary Plan is non-exempt property of the bankruptcy estate; (2) MetLife, O'Malley, Zellmer, and TAMO are in possession, custody, and/or control of O'Malley's interest under the Auxiliary Plan, and its proceeds are subject to turnover to the estate; (3) the Trustee may avoid and recover both O'Malley's election of the 100% contingent survivor annuity payment option and his direction of payments to TAMO; and (4) O'Malley, Zellmer, and TAMO willfully violated the automatic stay. (Tr. Mot., Dkt. No. 91.) Subsequently, O'Malley filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on Counts I-VI, arguing that: (1) the Trustee's failure to object to O'Malley's exemption bars all counts of the complaint; and (2) the Auxiliary Plan is exempt. (O'Malley Mot., Dkt. No. 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After the motions were briefed, the Court took the matter under advisement. Having reviewed the relevant documents, exhibits, and arguments, as well as applicable case law, the Court is now ready to rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (made applicable to adversary proceedings by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7056 ). The primary purpose of summary judgment is to avoid unnecessary trials where no genuine issues of material fact exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trautvetter v.

Thus, on a motion for summary judgment, the court must decide, based on the evidence, \"whether there is any material dispute of fact that requires a trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Kodish v.

A factual dispute is \"material\" only if its resolution might change the outcome under the governing\n   law, and a factual issue is \"genuine\" only if \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

O'Malley now attempts to characterize the Traditional Plan and the Auxiliary Plan as two components of one single \"defined benefit retirement plan from MetLife.\" (O'Malley Resp., Dkt.

No authority mandates such an obligation, and the two cases to which O'Malley cites in support of his position are misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   , the trustee timely objected to the debtor's claims of exemption; thus, whether the trustee had a duty to object to an inadequately claimed exemption and request an extension was not at issue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"440084\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/209/897/#p901\">\n    209 B.R. at 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead of doing so, O'Malley insufficiently claimed an exemption in a single retirement plan. Had he listed the two retirement plans on his schedule C separately and adequately, he would not need to resort to the \"strong medicine\" of judicial estoppel because\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   would have barred this action. As a result, any advantage derived by the Trustee and any detriment imposed on O'Malley cannot be accurately characterized as \"unfair.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, applying judicial estoppel here would adversely affect O'Malley's creditors. As discussed above, O'Malley's inadequately claimed exemption in the Auxiliary Plan failed to put the Trustee on notice of the questionable assertion. Judicially estopping the Trustee from pursuing her complaint now would deprive O'Malley's creditors of potentially valuable assets. Accordingly, the Court finds that it would be inequitable to apply judicial estoppel in this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biesek v. Soo Line R.R.

In\n   <em>\n    DeGroot\n   </em>\n   , the court's application of judicial estoppel arose from the actions of the trustee, who \"took the position that [an asset] was fully administered to respond to pressure from the United States Trustee\" and who \"was aware of [the asset] and [even] partially administered it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 171. Importantly, the\n   <em>\n    DeGroot\n   </em>\n   court emphasized that its holding was based on the unique circumstances of the case and that the court \"regard[ed] the Trustee's closing and reopening [of] the case ... as 'cynical gamesmanship.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Here, O'Malley has pointed to no evidence to establish that the Trustee acted with \"cynical gamesmanship\" by filing the no-asset report. It is undisputed that the Trustee did not even know that the Auxiliary Plan existed when she filed the report. In fact, O'Malley himself acknowledged that the Trustee did not know or believe that any retirement plan might be non-exempt. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , O'Malley Resp., Dkt. No. 115, at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court holds that the Trustee is not barred from challenging O'Malley's exemption in the Auxiliary Plan, nor is she judicially estopped from bringing this action.

The uncontested facts in this adversary proceeding establish that the Auxiliary Plan became property of the estate upon O'Malley's voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, that the plan remains in the estate because O'Malley failed to properly claim an exemption, and that the plan is non-exempt under applicable law. Thus, the Auxiliary Plan and related proceeds constitute property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Under the default 50% contingent survivor annuity payment option, monthly payments to O'Malley during his life would have been $ 5,190.52 (before taxes and payment to his former spouse pursuant to the QDRO), with Zellmer getting $ 2,595.26 per month (before taxes) after O'Malley's death. (MetLife Payment History Report, Dkt. No. 92-13, at 7.) In contrast, under the 100% contingent survivor annuity payment option that O'Malley elected, he received during his life monthly payments of only $ 4,647.19 (before taxes and payment to his former spouse), with Zellmer getting the same amount per month (before taxes) after O'Malley's death.

For that reason, a transfer of property of the estate occurred when O'Malley made the Payment Election. Moreover, because election of a payment option under the Auxiliary Plan is a power that O'Malley was able to exercise for his own benefit, that election right also constitutes property of the estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072072\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/513/333/#p343\">\n    513 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   343 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Gifford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6483169\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/93/636/#p640\">\n    93 B.R. 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640 (Bankr.

The Trustee Cannot Elect Another Payment Option Because the Election Period Had Ended.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Although the Trustee's right to elect a payment option on behalf of the estate is restored, she cannot make a payment election because she waited too long. Under the Auxiliary Plan, the election period had ended when the Trustee brought this adversary proceeding. With the Payment Election nullified, the estate is entitled to the default payment option of the 50% contingent survivor annuity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As discussed above, the bankruptcy estate's interest in a pension plan is limited to the same extent as that of the debtor.\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516744,6516948\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/969/591/\">\n    969 F.2d at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Auxiliary Plan mandates that all payment elections be made \"prior to the payment commencement date.\" (Auxiliary Plan, Dkt. Nos. 92-7 &amp; 108-3, at 6.) It is undisputed that monthly payments to O'Malley under the Auxiliary Plan began on August 1, 2015. Accordingly, the election period ended on the same date. More than one year later, on August 31, 2016, the Trustee initiated this adversary proceeding. Therefore, the Trustee cannot make an election now because the right to do so expired pursuant to the terms of the Auxiliary Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Although the Trustee cannot make an election now, the estate is still entitled to the property rights provided by the Auxiliary Plan. Without a payment election, the default provision kicks in. That default provides that O'Malley, as a married participant when the payments commenced, receives benefits pursuant to the 50% contingent survivor annuity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Auxiliary Plan, Dkt. Nos. 92-7 &amp; 108-3, at 5.) Moreover, pursuant to the Auxiliary Plan, the election of any payment option other than the 50% contingent survivor annuity requires Zellmer's notarized consent as O'Malley's spouse. (MetLife Payment History Report, Dkt. No. 92-13, at 7.) Thus, the estate is entitled to monthly payments under the 50% contingent survivor annuity payment option, after the deduction of applicable taxes and the QDRO payment to O'Malley's former spouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In sum, the Payment Election will be avoided, and the Trustee's right to elect an alternative payment option restored. As such, the Trustee's motion for summary judgment as to Count III will be granted. However, the Trustee cannot elect a payment option now because the election period had long since passed when this adversary proceeding was initiated. Thus, the estate is entitled to payments under the default 50% contingent survivor annuity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    Count IV: Avoidance and Recovery of the TAMO Transfers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In Count IV of the complaint, the Trustee seeks avoidance and recovery of\n   the TAMO transfers made by O'Malley post-petition pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 549 and 550, respectively. The Trustee's motion for summary judgment on Count IV will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   As to avoidance, the undisputed facts in this matter establish that the TAMO transfers satisfy all four elements required under \u00a7 549(a). First, monthly payments totaling at least $ 46,991.36 under the Auxiliary Plan were delivered to a bank account controlled by TAMO, and TAMO subsequently received those funds. (O'Malley Resp. to Tr.'s Stmt. of Undisputed Facts, Dkt. No. 103, \u00b6\u00b6 37 &amp; 38.) Second, as proceeds of the non-exempt Auxiliary Plan, those payments were property of the bankruptcy estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). Third, the transfers occurred between September 1, 2015 and August 1, 2016, more than two years after the commencement of the case. (O'Malley Resp. to Tr.'s Stmt. of Undisputed Facts, Dkt. No. 103, at \u00b6 38.) Finally, neither the Court nor the Bankruptcy Code authorized the transfers to TAMO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)

It is undisputed that O'Malley did not have immediate access to all proceeds under the Auxiliary Plan.

As a result, they must turn over the proceeds to the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   It is undisputed that MetLife administers the Auxiliary Plan and has been and continues to be in possession, custody, or control of the plan proceeds. In fact, MetLife has been accounting for, holding, and depositing the proceeds of the Auxiliary Plan with the Trustee since August 2016, shortly after the Trustee demanded their turnover. (MetLife Add'l Facts, Dkt. No. 108, \u00b6\u00b6 15 &amp; 16.) Thus, the Trustee is entitled to the turnover of the proceeds of the Auxiliary Plan from MetLife under the default 50% contingent survivor annuity payment option. As for O'Malley, the uncontested facts establish that he directed MetLife to send proceeds of the Auxiliary Plan totaling at least $ 46,991.36 to a TAMO bank account. Thus, he was in control of the proceeds for purposes of \u00a7 542(a). Finally, there is no genuine dispute that Zellmer and TAMO controlled the proceeds deposited into the TAMO account. Accordingly, the Trustee is entitled to the turnover of the proceeds totaling at least $ 46,991.36 from O'Malley, Zellmer, and TAMO as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    Count V: Willful Violation of the Automatic Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Finally, the Trustee seeks damages for O'Malley's, Zellmer's, and TAMO's alleged willful violations of the automatic stay pursuant to \u00a7 362(k) and/or the Court's civil contempt power under \u00a7 105(a). Because the Court finds as a matter of law that a trustee cannot recover damages under \u00a7 362(k) and the circumstances of this case do not warrant the exercise of the Court's civil contempt power under \u00a7 105(a), the Trustee's motion for summary judgment on Count V will be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
