Anderson First Day Decl. \u00b6 13. These suits commenced in 1977 and have continued to the present. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 13,000 pending asbestos-related lawsuits against Maremont and MEP, of which approximately 1,900 were considered by the Debtors to be active.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   During the five-year period ending December 31, 2018, approximately 2,600 asbestos-related lawsuits were asserted against Maremont and MEP.

In addition to the claims asserted against Maremont and its subsidiaries, certain plaintiffs also have alleged asbestos-related personal injury or wrongful death claims against one or more Non-Debtor Affiliates of Maremont, including Meritor, based upon or arising from alleged exposure to the Debtor Product Lines. Anderson First Day Decl. \u00b6 14. These claims appear to name Non-Debtor Affiliates solely on account of the plaintiffs' purported exposure to the Debtor Product Lines. None of the Non-Debtor Affiliates has ever engaged in or been involved in the manufacture, distribution or sale of any of the Debtor Product Lines, and, to date, no court has issued a ruling or made a finding that any Non-Debtor Affiliate is liable for any claims based upon or arising from any of the Debtor Product Lines or that any such Non-Debtor Affiliate should be treated as a successor in interest or alter ego of the Debtors, or that Maremont's corporate veil should be pierced.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   8. In addition, Meritor and certain of its predecessors and affiliates other than the Debtors have been named as defendants in asbestos lawsuits alleging personal injury or wrongful death as a result of exposure to asbestos used in the Rockwell Product Lines of Rockwell International Corporation, i.e., the Rockwell Claims. Anderson First Day Decl. \u00b6 15. Liability for certain Rockwell Claims was transferred to a predecessor of Meritor at the time of the spin-off of Rockwell International's automotive business to that predecessor in 1997. The Rockwell Product Lines are independent of the Debtor Product Lines, and while claims relating to the Debtor Product Lines will be channeled to the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust under the terms of the Plan, the Rockwell Claims will not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plan \u00a7 I.A.43, I.A.76, I.A.82, I.A.144, I.A. 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Historically, Maremont maintained insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities under a number of primary and excess insurance policies issued by various insurers. The majority of Maremont's insurance coverage has been exhausted and released through insurance coverage settlements and is no longer available to provide coverage for asbestos-related personal injury or other claims. Anderson First Day Decl. \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   10. The only remaining coverage currently held by Maremont is with FFIC pursuant to the FFIC Agreement, which is a coverage-in-place settlement agreement entered into with FFIC in 2010.

As described in detail in the First Day Declaration, in the face of mounting costs to defend and resolve Asbestos Personal Injury Claims and dwindling insurance and other assets, Maremont decided to investigate a potential restructuring to be implemented through a chapter 11 proceeding, utilizing section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code to establish and fund a trust that would provide for the fair and equitable treatment of all Holders of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims. The parties' negotiation of the terms of the Plan and Asbestos Personal Injury Trust ultimately centered around fixing the amount of the Meritor Contribution for its and its affiliates' protections under the Asbestos Personal Injury Channeling Injunction and related provisions of the Plan. Following several months of good faith, arm's length negotiations, the parties agreed to the terms of a settlement now embodied in the Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Anderson Decl. \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   13. In addition to the parties spending considerable time negotiating a settlement, including the principal terms of significant contributions by Meritor and Maremont to help fund the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust, the advisors to the ad hoc committee of firms representing personal injury claimants (the \"\n   <em>\n    Ad Hoc Committee\n   </em>\n   \") and the prepetition Future Claimants' Representative, personally and/or through their advisors, engaged in numerous discussions regarding the terms of potential settlements with Maremont and Meritor and conducted their own negotiations regarding the terms of the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust. Anderson Decl. \u00b6 15. This included extensive negotiations regarding initial payment percentages and claim and distribution procedures for Holders of current Claims and future Demands. Following the initial negotiations between the Ad Hoc Committee and the prepetition Future Claimants' Representative regarding the terms of the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Agreement and the TDP, counsel to the Debtors reviewed the proposed documents and further engaged in negotiations with the Ad Hoc Committee and the prepetition Future Claimants' Representative regarding the specific terms of the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Agreement and the TDP.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   During these negotiations, counsel to the Debtors sought to understand the rationale and basis for including certain provisions in the TDP.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Various revisions were made to the TDP as a result of negotiations among the Debtors, the Ad Hoc Committee and the prepetition Future Claimants' Representative.

The Asbestos Personal Injury Trust shall constitute a \"qualified settlement fund\" under section 468 of the Internal Revenue Code. Plan \u00a7\u00a7 I.A.11, VIII.E.2. The Asbestos Personal Injury Trust will be funded by the contribution of the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Assets, which include: (a) the Maremont Contribution, which includes (i) all insurance proceeds and obligations owed to the Debtors, (ii) all Cash and cash equivalents held by the Debtors as of the Effective Date after giving effect to the Intercompany Loan Payment and the Settlement Payment,\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   the Effective Date Payment, the Reserve Funds, and the Effective Date Working Capital, and (iii) the Meritor Contribution (to the extent included in the Maremont Contributed Cash and described in (b) herein); (b) the cash portions of the Meritor Contribution, which includes (i) the Intercompany Loan Payment-pursuant to which Meritor owed Maremont approximately $ 20 million as of the Petition Date, and (ii) the Settlement Payment in Cash by Meritor to Maremont in the amount of $ 28 million; (c) all other assets, rights, and benefits assigned, transferred, or conveyed to the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust in connection with the Plan or any Plan Documents, including, without limitation, the Reorganized Maremont Stock; and (d) all proceeds of the foregoing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan \u00a7\u00a7 IV.B.l, IV.B.2, IV.C, IV.E, IV.I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   15.

Valid business, factual and legal reasons exist for separately classifying the various Classes of Claims and Interests created under the Plan, the classifications were not promulgated for any improper purpose and such Classes do not unfairly discriminate between or among Holders of Claims or Interests.

The Chapter 11 Cases were filed and the Plan was proposed with the legitimate purpose of providing a fair and equitable resolution of the Debtors' Asbestos Personal Injury Claims and maximizing the returns available to creditors and other parties in interest. The Plan allows the Debtors to do this by channeling their Asbestos Personal Injury Claims to the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust and assigning their Environmental Claims to an affiliate of their ultimate parent, Meritor. Anderson Decl. \u00b6 33. The Debtors' good faith is evident from the facts and record of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Disclosure Statement, the record of the Combined Hearing, and other proceedings held in the Chapter 11 Cases. The record demonstrates that the Debtors engaged in extensive good-faith, arm's length negotiations with Meritor, the Ad Hoc Committee, and the prepetition Future Claimants' Representative, which led to the Plan's formulation.

The Plan and the contracts, instruments, agreements, and documents necessary and related to implementing, effectuating, and consummating the Plan, including all exhibits\n   to the Plan - including the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Documents - along with the Plan's classification, indemnification, release, injunction, and exculpation provisions, were the product of lengthy and hard-fought negotiations among the parties, and reflect the global compromise of numerous complex and interdependent issues. Anderson Decl. \u00b6 34; Patton Decl. \u00b6 10.

The proposed sole director and officer of Reorganized Maremont and each of the Reorganized Subsidiaries was selected with the approval of the Asbestos Claimants Committee and the Future Claimants' Representative, who have each determined that having Mr. Edmiston continue as the sole director and officer of the Reorganized Debtors will benefit the Holders of Claims and Interests. Patton Decl. \u00b6 19. The continuation in office of the proposed sole director and officer of each of the Reorganized Debtors will allow the Reorganized Debtors to benefit from the director's familiarity with the Debtors' reorganization and business going forward, which is consistent with the interests of Holders of Claims and Interests and with public policy. The Plan therefore satisfies the requirements of section 1129(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Inapplicability of Section 1129(a)(6).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   52. The Plan does not provide for any change in rates subject to the jurisdiction of any governmental regulatory commission and will not require governmental regulatory approval. Accordingly, section 1129(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code does not apply to the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    7.

The Plan satisfies section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code. The liquidation analysis set forth in Section IX.D of the Disclosure Statement and other evidence proffered or adduced in the Anderson Declaration and at the Combined Hearing: (i) are reasonable, persuasive and credible as of the dates such analysis or evidence was prepared, presented, or proffered; (ii) utilize reasonable and appropriate methodologies and assumptions; (iii) have not been controverted by other evidence or challenged; and (iv) establish that each Holder of a Claim or Interest in an Impaired Class either has accepted the Plan or would not receive or retain property of greater value if the Debtors were liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   54. Two Classes of Claims or Interests (other than Intercompany Claims) are Impaired under the Plan: Class 4 (the Voting Class) and Class 7 (Maremont Equity Interests). Holders in the Voting Class who voted on the Plan voted unanimously to accept the Plan, thereby satisfying section 1129(a)(7). With respect to Class 7, the requirement of section 1129(a)(7) is also satisfied because the Holders of Maremont Equity Interests would receive no distribution if Maremont were liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code due to the absence of the Meritor Contribution. Disclosure Statement \u00a7 IX.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   55. As described further in the Disclosure Statement, the Debtors expect that there will be substantially more assets available to pay Holders of Claims under the Plan than would be the case if there were no Plan because of, among other reasons, the Meritor Contribution. Anderson Decl. \u00b6 37. The Meritor Contribution includes, among other things, (i) the Settlement Payment of $ 28 million in cash, (ii) the Meritor Release, (iii) the contribution and subsequent cancellation of the Intercompany Receivables, which were valued at approximately $ 165 million as of the Petition Date, and (iv) the Intercompany Loan Payment, the balance of which was approximately $ 20 million as of the Petition Date, and (v) Arvin Environmental's assumption of Environmental Claims and the agreement of Meritor Heavy Vehicle Systems, LLC and Arvin Environmental to indemnify the Reorganized Debtors and their affiliates from and against Environmental Claims, pursuant to and to the extent set forth in the Environmental Assumption and Indemnification Agreement. Plan \u00a7 IV.B.l. The Plan is the result of an extensively negotiated settlement, which avoids costly and time-consuming litigation that would deplete the funds available for creditors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   All of these factors demonstrate that the Plan provides greater recoveries to creditors and Demand holders than would be realized in a chapter 7 liquidation, the costs of which would deplete much of the recoveries from the liquidation of the Debtors' assets. Thus, Confirmation of the Plan is in the best interests of all creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    8.

Holders of Claims in the Voting Class were the only Holders of Claims or Interests entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan pursuant to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Holders of Claims in the Voting Class (Class 4 - Asbestos Personal Injury Claims) have voted to accept the Plan pursuant to section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code. Holders of Claims and Interests in Classes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 are deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. Holders of Claims in Class 6 (Intercompany Claims) are conclusively\n   deemed to have accepted or rejected the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) or 1126(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, as determined by the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors, as applicable. The Holder of Interests in Class 7 (Maremont Equity Interests) is conclusively deemed to have rejected the Plan pursuant to section 1126(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. Notwithstanding the lack of compliance with section 1129(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to Class 6 (to the extent such Class is deemed to reject) and Class 7, the Plan is confirmable because, as set forth below, it satisfies section 1129(b)(1) and (b)(2)(C)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to each such Class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   57. The only known Intercompany Claims in Class 6 are the Intercompany Receivables held by Meritor, which are being contributed to Maremont as part of the Meritor Contribution, and then are being contributed to MEP, AVM, and FRCOC as part of the Maremont Contribution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Anderson Decl. \u00b6 38. The Intercompany Receivables are therefore being consensually resolved and settled pursuant to the Plan, and Meritor, as Plan Proponent, affirmatively consents to the treatment of the Intercompany Receivables notwithstanding any deemed rejection of Class 6 under section 1126(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   58.

The treatment of Administrative Expense Claims, including Professional Fee Claims, under Section II. A of the Plan satisfies the requirements of section 1129(a)(9)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code. The treatment of Priority Tax Claims under Section II.C of the Plan satisfies the requirements of section 1129(a)(9)(C) of the Bankruptcy Code. No Holder of an Allowed Administrative Expense Claim other than a Holder of a Professional Fee Claim (which must file an application with the Bankruptcy Court for Allowance of such Professional Fee Claim) is required to file a Proof of Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, except to the extent that a Holder of an Allowed Priority Tax Claim agrees with the applicable Debtor(s) to less favorable treatment, Allowed Priority Tax Claims shall receive (a) Cash in an amount equal to the Allowed amount of such claims under the Plan and this Order on or as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date, or (b) with respect to Allowed Priority Tax Claims that are not due and payable on or before the Effective Date, such claims shall be paid in the ordinary course of business or under applicable non-bankruptcy law as such obligations become due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    10.

As evidenced by the Voting Declaration, at least one Class of Claims that is Impaired under the Plan has voted to accept the Plan, determined without including the acceptance by any insider with\n   respect to the Debtors. Specifically, Class 4, the Class of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims, has voted unanimously to accept the Plan in number and amount, determined in accordance with section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    11.

The Plan is feasible within the meaning of section 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code. The evidence proffered or adduced at or prior to the Combined Hearing and in the Anderson Declaration, the Patton Declaration, the Confirmation Memorandum, and the financial projections attached to the Disclosure Statement as Exhibit B (a) was reasonable, persuasive, accurate and credible as of the dates such analysis or evidence was prepared, presented, or proffered; (b) has not been controverted by other evidence; (c) utilizes reasonable and appropriate methodologies and assumptions; (d) establishes that the Reorganized Debtors will have sufficient funds available to meet their obligations under the Plan; and (e) establishes that confirmation of the Plan is not likely to be followed by a liquidation or further reorganization of the Reorganized Debtors. Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors will create and fund the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Asbestos Personal Injury Trust will be in a position to begin operating on the Effective Date, as the relevant governing and other documents (the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Agreement, the TDP, the Asbestos Claims Indemnification Agreement, the Asbestos Personal Injury Claimant Release, and the Asbestos Records Cooperation Agreement) have been included as exhibits to the Plan and will go into effect upon the Effective Date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan Ex. A, B, C, D, E. In addition, on the Effective Date, Meritor will contribute the Settlement Payment of $ 28 million as part of the Meritor Contribution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan \u00a7 IV.B. The Asbestos Personal Injury Channeling Injunction will effectively redirect the liability and responsibility of the Debtors for Asbestos Personal Injury Claims (including Demands) to the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust from and after the Effective Date, enabling the Reorganized Debtors to operate without further responsibility for such liabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   62. On the Effective Date, the Debtors will also make the Effective Date Payments or set aside the Reserve Funds sufficient for the payment in Cash of the Allowed amount of any unpaid Administrative Expense Claims, Priority Tax Claims, Priority Non-Tax Claims, Secured Claims, General Unsecured Claims, and all legal fees and expenses reasonably likely to be incurred by the Reorganized Debtors through the closing of the Chapter 11 Cases-including all legal fees and expenses necessary to defend to final resolution any appeal of this Order, hearing on a Professional Fee Claim, and any adversary proceeding pending as of the Effective Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   63. The Plan is also feasible because of the revenue generated by Reorganized Maremont's continued management of its commercial property business, which will continue to generate rental income pursuant to the Commercial Property Lease (as defined in the Disclosure Statement). Anderson Decl. \u00b6 43. The financial projections prepared by the Debtors based on this ownership show sufficient cash flow to fund the Reorganized Debtors' operations going forward, and provide a dividend to the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust as the owner of Reorganized Maremont.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Disclosure Statement Ex. B. Accordingly, the Debtors have established that the Plan has a reasonable likelihood of success.

The Plan provides that Class 6 (Intercompany Claims) will either be Unimpaired or Impaired, as to be determined by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, and as a result the Intercompany Claims will either be deemed to accept or deemed to reject the Plan and were not entitled to vote on the Plan. Class 7 (Maremont Equity Interests) is Impaired and is deemed to reject the Plan pursuant to section 1126(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based upon the evidence proffered, adduced, and presented by the Debtors prior to and at the Combined Hearing, the Plan does not discriminate unfairly and is fair and equitable with respect to Class 6 and Class 7, as required by sections 1129(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   67. The only known claims in Class 6 are the Intercompany Receivables, which are being consensually resolved and settled under the Plan pursuant to the Meritor Contribution and the Maremont Contribution, and Meritor, as Plan Proponent, affirmatively consents to such treatment notwithstanding any deemed rejection of Class 6 under section 1126(g) and supports confirmation of the Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Anderson Decl. \u00b6 46. Thus, the Plan may be confirmed notwithstanding any deemed rejection of the Plan by Class 6 pursuant to section 1126(g), and notwithstanding the reinstatement of Class 8 (Subsidiary Equity Interests).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   68. The Plan's treatment of Class 6 is proper because no similarly situated Class of Claim or Interests will receive more favorable treatment under the Plan. There are no similarly situated Classes of Interests pursuant to the Plan, so the Plan does not unfairly discriminate with respect to Class 7. The Plan is fair and equitable to Class 7 because no Holder of any Interest that is junior to such Class will receive or retain any property under the Plan on account of such junior interest, and no Holder of a Claim or Interest in a Class senior to Class 7 is receiving more than 100% of recovery on account of its Claim or Interest. Thus, the Plan may be confirmed notwithstanding the deemed rejection of the Plan by Class 7. Additionally, for the same reasons, the Plan is fair and equitable with respect to Class 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    15.

In the absence of the Plan and based on the substantial number of asbestos-related personal injury lawsuits that have been asserted against Maremont and MEP in the past and that remained unresolved on the Petition Date, as well as the long latency period for many asbestos-related diseases, the Debtors would be subject to substantial future Demands for payment arising out of the same or similar conduct or events that gave rise to the Asbestos Personal Injury Claims that are addressed by the Asbestos Personal Injury Channeling Injunction.

Patton Decl. \u00b6 28. Without the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust as provided by the Plan and the TDP, holders of Demands would be forced to litigate their Claims in the tort system on an individual basis, distributions to creditors would most likely be delayed, and, due to the costs of litigation, the funds actually available for distribution to creditors and Demand holders may be reduced substantially and the relief available would likely be inconsistent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, a substantial portion of the Debtors' aggregate liability for Asbestos Personal Injury Claims relates to Demands, and estimates of the predicted liability for such Demands may vary widely.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because of the uncertainties inherent in litigation and the limited resources of the Debtors, Holders of asbestos-related Demands would almost certainly obtain inconsistent awards and disparate recoveries.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   89.

Plan \u00a7 VIII.E.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   101. The Debtors and their Estates have given the releases set forth in Section VIII.E of the Plan as part of the overall settlements contained in the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <strong>\n    W. Exemption from Certain Taxes.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   102. Pursuant to section 1146(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, any issuance, transfer or exchange of any note or security contemplated by the Plan (including, without limitation, the Reorganized Maremont Stock), the creation of any mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, or other security interest, the making or assignment of any lease or sublease, or the making or delivery of any deed or other instrument of transfer under, in furtherance of, or in connection with the Plan shall be exempt from all stamp, transfer, or similar taxes, as provided in section 1146(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    X. Exemption from Securities Laws.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   103. The offer, issuance, distribution, transfer or exchange of Reorganized Maremont Stock pursuant to the Plan shall be, and shall be deemed to be, exempt from registration under any applicable federal or state securities laws to the fullest extent permissible under applicable non-bankruptcy law and under bankruptcy law, including, without limitation, section 1145(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   <strong>\n    Y. Good Faith Negotiation, Implementation, and Consummation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   104. The Debtors, Meritor, the Asbestos Claimants' Committee, and the Future Claimants' Representative participated in good faith in negotiating, at arm's length, the Original Plan, the Plan, and all contracts, instruments, releases, agreements, and documents related to or necessary to implement, effectuate, and consummate the Plan, including each of the Asbestos Claims Indemnification Agreement, the Asbestos Personal Injury Claimant Release, Reorganized Maremont's Certificate of Incorporation, and Reorganized Maremont's Bylaws, and all agreements and releases to be executed and delivered in connection with the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust. The Debtors, the Asbestos Claimants Committee, the Future Claimants' Representative, and Meritor also participated in good faith in each of the actions taken to bring about, and in satisfying each of the conditions precedent to, Confirmation and Consummation. In so determining, the Bankruptcy Court has considered, among other things, the totality of the circumstances surrounding the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the record of this proceeding and the Plan and all related pleadings, exhibits, statements, and comments regarding Confirmation. The restructuring documents contemplated by the Plan and all other relevant and\n   necessary Plan Documents shall, upon completion of documentation and execution, be valid, binding, non-avoidable and enforceable agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    Z. Retention of Jurisdiction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   105. Pursuant to sections 105(a) and 1142 of the Bankruptcy Code, and notwithstanding the entry of this Order or the occurrence of the Effective Date, the Bankruptcy Court and, to the extent applicable, the District Court, except as otherwise provided in the Plan or herein, shall retain jurisdiction over all matters arising out of, or related to, the Chapter 11 Cases and the Plan to the fullest extent permitted by law, including, but not limited to, the matters set forth in Article XI of the Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Plan, the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Agreement and the TDP shall govern the satisfaction of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims and the forum in which Asbestos Personal Injury Claims shall be determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   <strong>\n    AA. Waiver of Stay.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   106. Under the circumstances, it is appropriate that the 14-day stay imposed by Bankruptcy Rules 3020(e) and 7062(a) and any other Bankruptcy Rules, if applicable, be waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <strong>\n    BB. Satisfaction of Confirmation Requirements.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   107. Based upon the foregoing and all other pleadings and evidence proffered or adduced at or prior to the Combined Hearing, the Plan satisfies the requirements for confirmation set forth in section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, including sections 1122 and 1123 thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <strong>\n    CC. Conditions to Confirmation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   108. Section IX.A of the Plan contains conditions precedent to Confirmation that must be satisfied or duly waived by the Plan Proponents. For the reasons set forth herein, each of the conditions precedent in Section IX.A.1 through and including Section IX.A.3 of the Plan has been satisfied or duly waived, subject to the affirmance of this Order by the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   <strong>\n    DD. Compliance with Section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   109. The Bankruptcy Court hereby determines that, under section 1141(d), the Debtors are and shall be entitled to a discharge. In reaching this determination, the Bankruptcy Court has considered section 1141(d)(3), which provides for denial of a discharge to a corporate debtor only if three criteria are met: (i) the plan provides for the liquidation of all or substantially all estate property, (ii) the debtor does not engage in business after consummation of the plan, and (iii) the debtor would be denied a discharge under section 727(a) if the case were a Chapter 7 case.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3). However, the Bankruptcy Court hereby determines that the Debtors will engage in business after the consummation of the Plan, thus negating the first and second requirements for denial of a discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   110. The Debtors are entitled to a discharge under section 1141(d) because confirmation of the Plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation of the Reorganized Debtors or the need for further financial reorganization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <strong>\n    EE. Propriety of Settlement and Plan-Related Documents.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   111. In light of the extensive litigation related to the Asbestos Personal Injury Claims and the consideration to be provided by Maremont and Meritor to the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust on behalf of the Protected Parties under the Plan, and further based on the evidentiary record of the\n   Chapter 11 Cases, the settlement of claims and potential claims against or involving the Debtors set forth in the Plan, and the channeling of all Asbestos Personal Injury Claims to the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust, in exchange for the consideration provided under the Plan, as embodied in the Plan, is fair, reasonable, and adequate, in accordance with applicable United States Supreme Court and Third Circuit law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Protective Comm. for Indep. Stockholders of TMT Ferry, Inc. v.

In light of all of the circumstances and the record in the Chapter 11 Cases, each of the transactions contemplated by or referenced in the Plan, including the creation of the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust, is integral to the terms, conditions, and settlement contained in the Plan and is critical to the effectuation of the purposes of the Plan. All contracts, instruments, releases, agreements, and documents entered into in connection with, or necessary to implement, effectuate, and consummate, the Plan, including, without limitation, (a) each of the contracts, instruments, agreements and documents to be executed and delivered in connection with Article IV of the Plan; (b) each of Reorganized Maremont's Bylaws and Reorganized Maremont's Certificate of Incorporation, attached to the Plan as Exhibit K and Exhibit L, respectively; (c) the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Agreement, attached to the Plan as Exhibit C; (d) the TDP, attached to the Plan as Exhibit D; (e) the Asbestos Claims Indemnification Agreement, attached to the Plan as Exhibit A; (f) the Asbestos Personal Injury Claimant Release, attached to the Plan as Exhibit B; (g) the Environmental Assumption and Indemnification Agreement, attached to the Plan as Exhibit G; (h) the Asbestos Records Cooperation Agreement, attached to the Plan as Exhibit E; and (i) all other contracts, instruments, agreements, or documents that any of the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, Meritor, or the Asbestos Personal Injury Trustee may execute and deliver in connection with the consummation of the Plan or the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust are valid, proper, and reasonable under the circumstances and due and sufficient notice thereof has been provided in connection with, among other things, approval of the Disclosure Statement and confirmation of the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   113. Without limiting the foregoing, the Bankruptcy Court concludes that, pursuant to section 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and in consideration of the distributions and other benefits provided under the Plan, the provisions of the Plan, and the transactions contemplated by the Plan, including, without limitation, each of the injunctions, releases, exculpation, indemnifications, and discharges set forth in Article VIII of the Plan, the creation and administration of the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust as set forth in Section IV.E of the Plan, and each of the transactions contemplated in Article IV of the Plan constitute a fair and reasonable, good faith compromise and settlement of all claims or controversies relating to the rights that a Holder of a Claim, Demand, or Interest may have with respect to any Claim (including an Asbestos Personal Injury Claim), Demand, or Interest or any distribution to be made pursuant to the Plan on account of any Allowed Claim (including an Asbestos Personal Injury Claim), Demand, or Interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   114. Moreover, based upon the representations and arguments of counsel for the Plan Proponents and all other testimony either given or proffered at the Confirmation Hearing or prior hearings relating to the negotiations leading to, among other things, the Original Plan, the Plan, or the\n   various plan-related agreements and Plan Documents, the Plan constitutes a fair, reasonable, and good faith settlement and compromise of all claims or controversies relating to the rights of Holders of Claims or Demands against, and Interests in, the Debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   <strong>\n    FF. Transfer of Books and Records to the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   115. Section IV.E.1 of the Plan provides that on the Effective Date, the Asbestos Records Cooperation Agreement shall become effective and the Debtors' asbestos records shall be treated in accordance with such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Decrees\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-238\">\n   WHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, DECREED, AND DETERMINED THAT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Disclosure Statement.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   116. For the reasons set forth in this Order, the Disclosure Statement (i) contains sufficient information of a kind generally consistent with the disclosure statement requirements of applicable non-bankruptcy laws, rules and regulations, including the Securities Act; and (ii) contains \"adequate information\" (as such term is defined in Bankruptcy Code section 1125(a)(1) and used in Bankruptcy Code section 1126(b)(2) ) with respect to the Debtors, the Plan, and the transactions contemplated therein. Accordingly, the Disclosure Statement hereby is\n   <strong>\n    APPROVED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Solicitation and the Solicitation Procedures complied with Bankruptcy Code sections 1125 and 1126, Bankruptcy Rules 3017 and 3018, all other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, and all other applicable rules, laws, and regulations, and were appropriate and satisfactory, and are approved. In connection with the Solicitation, the Debtors properly relied on, to the extent necessary, the exemption from registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to sections 4(a)(2) and 18(b)(4)(F) and Rule 506 of Regulation D thereof. The Solicitation Package complied with the Bankruptcy Code, including sections 1125 and 1126 thereof, the Bankruptcy Rules, including Bankruptcy Rules 3017 and 3018, the Local Rules, the Scheduling Order, any applicable non-bankruptcy law, and any other applicable rules, laws, and regulations, and were appropriate and satisfactory and hereby are approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Debtors and\n   the Reorganized Debtors are authorized to take all actions necessary or appropriate to enter into, implement, and consummate the contracts, instruments, releases, leases, indentures, and other agreements or documents created in connection with the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is any direct conflict between the terms of the Plan or any exhibit thereto and the terms of this Order, the terms of this Order shall control.

All objections (including any reservations of rights contained therein) to approval of the Disclosure Statement or Confirmation of the Plan that have not been withdrawn, waived, or settled prior to entry of this Order, are not cured by the relief granted herein, or are not otherwise resolved as stated by the Debtors on the record of the Combined Hearing, are\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED\n   </strong>\n   on the merits and in their entirety, and all withdrawn objections are deemed withdrawn with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

References in this Order to any article, section, paragraph, or provision of the Plan are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to affect the interpretation of the Plan. The failure to specifically include or to refer to any particular article, section, paragraph, or provision of the Plan in this Order shall not diminish or impair the effectiveness of such article, section, paragraph, or provision, it being the intent of the Bankruptcy Court that the Plan be confirmed in its entirety, except as expressly modified herein, and that the Plan Documents and all exhibits and schedules thereto, and all other agreements, instruments, or other documents filed in connection with the Plan and/or executed or to be executed in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Plan, and all amendments and modifications of any of the foregoing made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan governing such amendments and modifications, are approved in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   <strong>\n    H.

A Holder of a Claim that has accepted or rejected the Plan shall be deemed to have accepted or rejected, as the case may be, the Plan as modified, unless, within the time fixed by this Court, if any, such Holder changes its previous acceptance or rejection, to the extent such Holder is afforded the opportunity to do so under section 1127(d) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   138.

This Release is not intended to release or discharge any Asbestos Claim or potential Asbestos Claim that the Injured Party's heirs (if any), spouse (if any), the Official Representative (if any) or the Official Representative's heirs (if any) (other than the Injured Party) may have as a result of their own exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1232\">\n   12.

It is further agreed and understood that no Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Released Parties shall have any liability to the Releasor or any other person or entity in connection with such liens or reimbursement claims and that the Releasor will indemnify and hold the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Released Parties harmless from any and all such alleged liability as provided in the following sentence. The Releasor will indemnify and hold the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Released Parties harmless, to the extent of the amount of payment hereunder, excluding attorney's fees and costs, from any and all liability arising from subrogation, indemnity or contribution claims related to the Asbestos Claim released herein and from any and all compensation or medical payments due, or claimed to be due, under any applicable law, regulation or contract related to the Asbestos Claim released herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1233\">\n   13. The Releasor understands that the Asbestos Claim released herein is being resolved by the Asbestos Trust, and a liquidated value ($ ______________) has\n   been established for such Asbestos Claim. The Releasor acknowledges that, pursuant to the TDP, the Asbestos Trust will only be able to pay the Releasor a percentage (the \"\n   <em>\n    Payment Percentage\n   </em>\n   \") of the liquidated value of such Asbestos Claim. The Payment Percentage applicable to the Asbestos Claim will be determined in the manner set forth in the TDP. The Releasor further acknowledges that the Payment Percentage is based on estimates that change over time, and that other claimants may have in the past received, or may in the future receive, a smaller or larger percentage of the value of their claims than the Releasor. The Releasor further acknowledges that, other than as specifically set forth in the TDP, the fact that earlier or later claimants may have been paid or may in the future be paid a smaller or larger percentage of the value of their claims shall not entitle the Releasor to any additional compensation from the Asbestos Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1234\">\n   14. In the event of a verdict against others, any judgment entered on the verdict that takes into account the status of the Asbestos Trust as a joint tortfeasor legally responsible for the Injured Party's injuries shall be reduced by no more than the total and actual amount paid as consideration for this Release or such lesser amount as allowed by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1235\">\n   15. The Releasor understands, represents, and warrants that this Release is a compromise of a disputed claim and not an admission of liability by, or on the part of, the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Released Parties. Neither this Release, the compromise and settlement evidenced hereby, nor any evidence relating thereto, will ever be admissible as evidence against the Asbestos Trust in any suit, claim, or proceeding of any nature except to enforce this Release. However, this Release is and may be asserted by the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Released Parties as an absolute and final bar to any claim or proceeding now pending or hereafter brought by or on behalf of the Injured Party with respect to the Asbestos Claim released herein, except as expressly provided herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1236\">\n   16. The Releasor (a) represents that no judgment debtor has satisfied in full or in part, the Asbestos Trust's liability with respect to the Injured Party's Asbestos Claim as the result of a judgment entered in the tort system, and (b) upon information and belief, represents that the Releasor has not entered into a release (other than this Release) that discharges or releases the Asbestos Trust's liability to the Releasor with respect to the Injured Party's Asbestos Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1237\">\n   17. The Releasor represents that he or she understands that this Release constitutes a final and complete release of the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Released Parties with respect to the Injured Party's Asbestos Claim. The Releasor has relied solely upon his or her own knowledge and information, and the advice of his or her attorneys (if any), as to the nature, extent and duration of the Injured Party's injuries, damages, and legal rights, as well as the alleged liability of the Asbestos Trust and the legal consequences of this Release, and not on any statement or representation made by or on behalf of the Asbestos Trust or any of the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust Released Parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1238\">\n   18.

The trustee of the Asbestos Trust (the\n   <strong>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     Trustee\n    </em>\n    \")\n   </strong>\n   shall implement and administer this TDP in accordance with the Trust Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1648\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ARTICLE 1\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1649\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1650\">\n   <strong>\n    1.1 Purpose.\n   </strong>\n   This TDP has been adopted pursuant to the Trust Agreement. It is designed to provide fair, equitable and substantially similar treatment for all similarly situated Asbestos Claims that may presently exist or may arise in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1651\">\n   <strong>\n    1.2 Interpretation.\n   </strong>\n   Except as may otherwise be provided below, nothing in this TDP shall be deemed to create a substantive right for any claimant. The rights and benefits provided herein, if any, to holders of Asbestos Claims shall vest in such holders as of the Effective Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1652\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ARTICLE 2\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1653\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     OVERVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1654\">\n   <strong>\n    2.1 Asbestos Trust Goals.\n   </strong>\n   The goal of the Asbestos Trust is to treat all similarly situated claimants equitably and in accordance with the requirements of Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. This TDP furthers that goal by setting forth procedures for processing and paying the Debtors' several shares of the unpaid portion of the liquidated value of Asbestos Claims, with the intention of paying all claimants over time as equivalent a share as possible of the value of their claims based on historical values for substantially similar claims in the tort system. To this end, the TDP establishes five (5) asbestos-related diseases\n   <strong>\n    (\"\n    <em>\n     Disease Levels\n    </em>\n    \")\n   </strong>\n   which have presumptive medical and exposure requirements\n   <strong>\n    (\"\n    <em>\n     Medical/Exposure Criteria\n    </em>\n    \")\n   </strong>\n   and specific liquidated values\n   <strong>\n    (\"\n    <em>\n     Scheduled Values\n    </em>\n    \")\n   </strong>\n   and one of which has a liquidated value for those claims that qualify as an Extraordinary Claim as defined in Section 5.4 below (\n   <em>\n    \"\n    <strong>\n     Maximum Value\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1655\">\n   The Disease Levels, Medical/Exposure Criteria, Scheduled Values and Maximum Value, which are set forth in Sections 5.3 and 5.4 below, have all been selected and derived with the intention of achieving a fair allocation of the Asbestos Trust assets as among claimants suffering from these different Disease Levels in light of the best available information considering the settlement history of the Debtors and the rights claimants would have in the tort system absent the bankruptcy. Except as set forth in Section 5.11 hereof, a claimant may not assert more than one Asbestos Claim hereunder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1656\">\n   Historically, Debtors Maremont and MEP have been subjected to thousands of personal injury and wrongful death claims asserting that they are liable for damages caused by exposure to asbestos-containing products that Maremont or its predecessor(s)-in-interest and certain successor-in-interest allegedly used, sold, manufactured, marketed, produced or distributed. Maremont manufactured, distributed, and sold aftermarket automotive products, including\n   friction products such as brake linings, disc pads, and clutch facings, and aftermarket mufflers. As defined in the Plan, the \"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Debtor Product Lines\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \" includes, among other products, all asbestos-containing products historically manufactured, sold, or distributed by, or branded with the name of or under a license granted by (a) any of the Debtors or any predecessor thereof or any subsidiary of any of the foregoing and/or (b) Nuturn Corporation or Ferodo America, Inc. as successors-in-interest to Maremont's Friction Products Business with respect to all of the Debtors' business lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1657\">\n   Because of the nature of certain of the Debtor Products Lines, the vast majority of asbestos-related claims asserted against Maremont and MEP were asserted by (1) professional auto mechanics who were allegedly exposed to the Debtor Product Lines while working as professional mechanics in the automotive industry (\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Occupationally Exposed Claims\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \"); or (2) individual auto enthusiasts who worked on maintenance and upgrades to automobiles at home (\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Shade Tree Mechanic Claims\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \"). Because of the nature of the claims pool and the limited resources of the Asbestos Trust, this TDP only provides for the payment by the Asbestos Trust of Asbestos Claims based on certain diseases. The Trustee shall supervise the review of filed Asbestos Claims with the goal of approving only those Asbestos Claims that provide evidence of the type of exposure that was required by Maremont for settlement of claims in the tort system. To that end, the claim forms will contain objective criteria to qualify for payment. For example, such forms will require detailed employment history with years of service and the Asbestos Trust may make reasonable inquiries of claimants and/or co-workers, friends and relatives as to the nature and extent of a claimant's exposure to the Debtor Product Lines. Affidavit guidelines will also be developed by the Asbestos Trust to be used by Shade Tree Mechanic Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1658\">\n   <strong>\n    2.2 Claims Liquidation Procedures.\n   </strong>\n   Except as set forth below with respect to Disease Level V Claims, Asbestos Claims shall be processed based on their place in the FIFO Processing Queue (as defined in Section 5.1(a)(1)) to be established pursuant to Section 5.1(a)(1) below. The Asbestos Trust shall take all reasonable steps to resolve Asbestos Claims as efficiently and expeditiously as possible at each stage of claims processing and arbitration, which steps may include, in the Asbestos Trust's sole discretion, conducting settlement discussions with claimants' representatives with respect to more than one claim at a time, provided that the claimants' respective positions in the FIFO Processing Queue are maintained and each claim is individually evaluated pursuant to the valuation factors set forth herein. The Asbestos Trust shall also make every reasonable effort to resolve each year at least that number of Asbestos Claims required to exhaust the applicable Maximum Annual Payments (as that term is defined in Section 2.4 below).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1659\">\n   The Asbestos Trust shall, except as otherwise provided below, liquidate all Asbestos Claims under the Expedited Review Process described in Section 5.3(a) below. Based upon the Debtors' claims settlement history, applicable tort law, and current projections of present and future unliquidated claims, the Scheduled Values for all Disease Levels have been established as set forth in Section 5.3(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1660\">\n   A Disease Level V (Mesothelioma 2) claim seeking to qualify as an Extraordinary Claim (as defined in Section 5.4(a)) and all Foreign Claims (as defined in Section 5.3(b)) may be liquidated only pursuant\n   to the IR Process (as defined in Section 5.3(b)(1)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1661\">\n   All unresolved disputes over a claimant's medical condition or exposure history shall be subject to binding or non-binding arbitration as set forth in Section 5.9 below, at the election of the claimant, under the ADR Procedures (as defined in Section 5.9(a)) that are to be established by the Asbestos Trust. Asbestos Claims that are the subject of a dispute with the Asbestos Trust that cannot be resolved by non-binding arbitration may enter the tort system as provided in Sections 5.10 and 7.6 below. However, if and when a claimant obtains a judgment in the tort system, the judgment shall be payable as provided in Section 7.7 below (subject to, as applicable, the Payment Percentage (as defined in Section 4.1 below), and the Maximum Annual Payments, Maximum Available Payment and Claims Payment Ratio provisions set forth in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 herein).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1662\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3 Establishment and Application of the Payment Percentage.\n   </strong>\n   The initial Payment Percentage (the \"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Initial Payment Percentage\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \") shall be 29.1%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Payment Percentage may thereafter be adjusted upwards or downwards from time to time by the Asbestos Trust, with the consent of the Trust Advisory Committee\n   <strong>\n    (\"\n    <em>\n     TAC\n    </em>\n    \")\n   </strong>\n   and the Legal Representative for Future Claims\n   <strong>\n    (\"\n    <em>\n     FCR\n    </em>\n    \")\n   </strong>\n   . After the Distribution Value as defined in Section 2.4 below for a Shade Tree Mechanic Claim or the liquidated value of an Occupationally Exposed Claim as defined in Section 5.3(a)(3) below is determined pursuant to the procedures set forth herein under the Expedited Review Process, IR Process, arbitration, or litigation in the tort system, the claimant shall ultimately receive a pro rata share of that value based on a Payment Percentage described in Section 4.2 below. The Payment Percentage shall also apply to all sequencing adjustments paid pursuant to Section 7.5 below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1663\">\n   The Payment Percentage may be adjusted upwards or downwards after a two (2) year re-evaluation period by the Asbestos Trust with the consent of the TAC and the FCR to reflect then-current estimates of the Asbestos Trust's assets and its liabilities, as well as the then-estimated value of then-pending and future claims. If the Payment Percentage is increased over time, claimants whose claims were liquidated and paid in prior periods under the TDP shall receive additional payments only as provided in Section 4.3 below. Because there is uncertainty in the prediction of both the number and severity of future Asbestos Claims, and the amount of the Asbestos Trust's assets, no guarantee can be made of any Payment Percentage of an Asbestos Claim's liquidated value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1664\">\n   <strong>\n    2.4 Asbestos Trust's Determination of the Maximum Annual Payment.\n   </strong>\n   After calculating the Payment Percentage, the Asbestos Trust shall create two models of cash flow, principal and income year-by-year to be paid over its entire life to ensure that all present and future holders of Occupationally Exposed Claims (\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Occupational Model\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \") and Shade Tree Mechanic Claims (\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Shade Tree Model\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \") (collectively, \"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Models\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \") are compensated at the Payment Percentage. In each year, based upon the Occupational Model of cash flow, the Asbestos Trust shall be empowered\n   to pay out the portion of its funds payable for that year to Occupationally Exposed Claims according to the Occupational Model (the\n   <strong>\n    \"Occupational\n    <em>\n     Maximum Annual Payment\n    </em>\n    \").\n   </strong>\n   In each year, based upon the Shade Tree Model of cash flow, the Asbestos Trust shall be empowered to pay out the portion of its funds payable for that year to Shade Tree Mechanic Claims according to the Shade Tree Model (the\n   <strong>\n    \"Shade Tree\n    <em>\n     Maximum Annual Payments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" and together with the Occupational Maximum Annual Payments, the \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Maximum Annual Payments\"\n    </em>\n    )\n   </strong>\n   . The Asbestos Trust's distributions to Occupationally Exposed Claims and Shade Tree Mechanic Claims for that year shall not exceed the applicable Maximum Annual Payment. All approved Shade Tree Mechanic Claims shall be paid at the end of each year and shall be paid the lesser of the pro rata share of the Shade Tree Maximum Annual Payment or the liquidated values established by the Asbestos Trust, subject to the Payment Percentage (\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Distribution Value\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \"). The Payment Percentage and the Maximum Annual Payments are based on projections over the lifetime of the Asbestos Trust. If such long-term projections are revised, the Payment Percentage may be adjusted accordingly, which will result in new Models of the Asbestos Trust's anticipated cash flow and a new calculation of the Occupational Maximum Annual Payment and the Shade Tree Maximum Annual Payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1665\">\n   Year-to-year variations in the Asbestos Trust's flow of claims or the value of its assets, including earnings thereon, will not mean necessarily that the long-term projections are inaccurate; they may simply reflect normal variations, both up and down, from the smooth curve created by the Asbestos Trust's long-term projections. If, in a given year, however, asset values, including earnings thereon, are below projections, the Asbestos Trust may need to distribute less in that year than would otherwise be permitted based on the applicable Maximum Annual Payments derived from long-term projections. Accordingly, the applicable Maximum Annual Payments for a given year may be temporarily decreased if the present value of the assets of the Asbestos Trust as measured on a specified date during the year is less than the present value of the assets of the Asbestos Trust projected for that date by the Models described in the foregoing paragraph. The Asbestos Trust shall make such a comparison whenever the Trustee becomes aware of any information that suggests that such a comparison should be made. If the Asbestos Trust determines that as of the date in question, the present value of the Asbestos Trust's assets is less than the projected present value of its assets for such date, then it will remodel the cash flow year-by-year to be paid over the life of the Asbestos Trust based upon the reduced value of the total assets as so calculated and identify the reduced portion of its funds to be paid for that year, which will become the \"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Temporary Maximum Annual Payments\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \" (additional reductions in the Maximum Annual Payments can occur during the course of that year based upon subsequent calculations). If in any year the Maximum Annual Payments were temporarily reduced as a result of an earlier calculation and, based upon a later calculation, the difference between the projected present value of the Asbestos Trust's assets and the actual present value of its assets has decreased, the Temporary Maximum Annual Payments shall be increased to reflect the decrease in the differential. In no event, however, shall the Temporary Maximum Annual Payments exceed the original Maximum Annual Payments. As a further safeguard, the Asbestos Trust's distribution to Occupationally\n   Exposed Claims for the first nine months of a year shall not exceed 85% of the Occupational Maximum Annual Payment determined for that year. To the extent the Occupational Maximum Annual Payment is reached in a given year, the Asbestos Trust may continue processing such claims, but shall delay issuing offers or releases until January 1 of the next year. If on December 31 of a given year, the original Maximum Annual Payments for such year is not in effect, the original Maximum Annual Payments for the following year shall be reduced proportionately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1666\">\n   The remaining portion of the Occupational Maximum Annual Payment (the \"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Maximum Available Payment\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \") shall be allocated and used to satisfy all previously liquidated Occupationally Exposed Claims subject to the Claims Payment Ratio set forth in Section 2.5 below; provided, however, that if the Occupational Maximum Annual Payment is reduced during a year pursuant to the provisions above, the Maximum Available Payment shall be adjusted accordingly. The Occupational Maximum Annual Payment shall apply to offers on all Occupationally Exposed Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1667\">\n   <strong>\n    2.5 Claims Payment Ratio.\n   </strong>\n   A Claims Payment Ratio has been determined which, as of the Effective Date, has been set at 90% for Category A claims, which consist of Asbestos Claims involving Disease Level IV) and at 10% for Category B claims, which are Asbestos Claims involving Disease Levels I-III. In each year, after the determination of the Occupational Maximum Available Payment described in Section 2.4 above, 90% of that amount shall be available to pay Category A claims and 10% shall be available to pay Category B claims that have been liquidated since the Effective Date; provided, however, that if the Occupational Maximum Annual Payment is reduced during the year pursuant to Section 2.4 above, the amounts available to pay Category A and Category B claims shall be recalculated based on the adjusted Occupational Maximum Available Payment. In the event there are insufficient funds in any year to pay the liquidated claims within either or both of the Categories, the available funds allocated to the particular Category shall be paid to the maximum extent to claimants in that Category based on their place in the FIFO Payment Queue described in Section 5.1(b) below. Claims for which there are insufficient funds allocated to the relevant Category shall be carried over to the next year where they shall be placed at the head of the FIFO Payment Queue. If there is a decrease in the Payment Percentage prior to the payment of such claims, such claims shall nevertheless be entitled to be paid at the Payment Percentage that they would have been entitled to receive but for the application of the Claims Payment Ratio. If, at the end of any calendar year during the first three years the Asbestos Trust is accepting claims, there are excess funds in Category A, because there is an insufficient amount of liquidated claims to exhaust the respective Maximum Available Payment amount for that Category, then the excess funds for that Category shall be rolled over and remain dedicated to Category A. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if, at the end of any calendar year following the third anniversary of the date the Asbestos Trust began accepting claims, there are excess funds available in Category B and insufficient funds in Category A to pay such Category's claims, then the Trustee may transfer up to a specified amount of excess funds (the \"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Permitted Transfer Amount\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \" as defined below) to Category A to cover the shortfall; provided, however, that the Trustee shall never transfer more than the amount of the Category A shortfall. The \"Permitted Transfer Amount\" shall be determined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1668\">\n   (a) the Trustee shall first determine the cumulative amount allocated to Category B based on the Claims Payment Ratio since the date the Asbestos Trust last calculated its Payment Percentage; (b) the Trustee shall then determine the cumulative amount that the Asbestos Trust estimated would be paid to Category B since the date the Asbestos Trust last calculated its Payment Percentage; (c) the Trustee shall then subtract the amount determined in (b) from the amount determined in (a), and the difference between the two shall be referred to as the \"Permitted Transfer Amount.\" The Trustee shall provide the TAC and the FCR with the Permitted Transfer Amount calculation thirty (30) days prior to making a transfer. If, at the end of any calendar year following the third anniversary of the date the Asbestos Trust began accepting claims, there are excess funds in either or both Categories because there is an insufficient amount of liquidated claims to exhaust the respective Maximum Available Payment amount for that Category, or, in a year where there was a transfer from Category B to Category A, if the amount transferred was less than the amount of excess funds, then the excess funds for the Category or Categories with excess funds shall be rolled over and remain dedicated to the respective Category to which they were originally allocated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1669\">\n   During the first nine months of a given year, the Asbestos Trust's payments to claimants in either Category shall not exceed the amount of any excess funds that were rolled over for such Category from the prior year plus 85% of the amount that would otherwise be available for payment to claimants in such Category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1670\">\n   In considering whether to make any amendments to the Claims Payment Ratio and/or its rollover provisions, the Trustee shall consider the reasons for which the Claims Payment Ratio and its rollover provisions were adopted, the settlement history that gave rise to its calculation, and the foreseeability or lack of foreseeability of the reasons why there would be any need to make an amendment.

In addition, the claimant with secondary exposure must establish that he or she is suffering from Disease Levels I-IV described in Section 5.3(a)(3) above, that his or her own exposure to the occupationally exposed person occurred within the same time frame as the occupationally exposed person was exposed to asbestos, asbestos-containing products, or conduct for which the Debtors have legal responsibility, and that such secondary exposure was a cause of the claimed disease.

In no event shall any Indirect Claimant have any rights against the Asbestos Trust superior to the rights of the related Direct Claimant against the Asbestos Trust, including any rights with respect to the timing, amount or manner of payment. In addition, no Indirect Asbestos Personal Injury Claim may be liquidated and paid in an amount that exceeds what the Indirect Claimant has actually paid the related Direct Claimant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1731\">\n   To establish a presumptively valid Indirect Asbestos Personal Injury Claim, the Indirect Claimant's aggregate liability for the Direct Claimant's claim must also have been fixed, liquidated and paid fully by the Indirect Claimant by settlement (with an appropriate full release in favor of the Asbestos Trust) or a Final Order (as defined in the Plan) provided that such claim is valid under the applicable state law. In any case where the Indirect Claimant has satisfied the claim of a Direct Claimant against the Asbestos Trust under applicable law by way of a settlement, the Indirect Claimant shall obtain for the benefit of the Asbestos Trust a release in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1732\">\n   If an Indirect Claimant cannot meet the presumptive requirements set forth above, including the requirement that the Indirect Claimant provide the Asbestos Trust with a full release of the Direct Claimant's claim, the Indirect Claimant may request that the Asbestos Trust review the Indirect Asbestos Personal Injury Claim individually to determine whether the Indirect Claimant can establish under applicable state law that the Indirect Claimant has paid all or a portion of a liability or obligation that the Asbestos Trust had to the Direct Claimant. If the Indirect Claimant can show that it has paid all or a portion of\n   such a liability or obligation, the Asbestos Trust shall reimburse the Indirect Claimant the amount of the liability or obligation so paid, times the then applicable Payment Percentage. However, in no event shall such reimbursement to the Indirect Claimant be greater than the amount to which the Direct Claimant would have otherwise been entitled. Further, the liquidated value of any Indirect Asbestos Personal Injury Claim paid by the Asbestos Trust to an Indirect Claimant shall be treated as an offset to or reduction of the full liquidated value of any Asbestos Claim that might be subsequently asserted by the Direct Claimant against the Asbestos Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1733\">\n   Any dispute between the Asbestos Trust and an Indirect Claimant over whether the Indirect Claimant has a right to reimbursement for any amount paid to a Direct Claimant shall be subject to the ADR Procedures provided in Section 5.9 below.

Indirect Asbestos Personal Injury Claims that have not been disallowed, discharged, or otherwise resolved by prior order of the Bankruptcy Court shall be processed in accordance with procedures to be developed and implemented by the Trustee consistent with the provisions of this Section 5.6, which procedures (a) shall determine the validity, acceptability and enforceability of such claims; and (b) shall otherwise provide the same liquidation and payment procedures and rights to the holders of such claims as the Asbestos Trust would have afforded the holders of the underlying valid Asbestos Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1735\">\n   <strong>\n    5.7 Evidentiary Requirements.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1736\">\n   <strong>\n    5.7(a) Medical Evidence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1737\">\n   <strong>\n    5.7(a)(1) In General.\n   </strong>\n   All diagnoses of a Disease Level shall be accompanied by either (i) a statement by the physician providing the diagnosis that at least ten (10) years have elapsed between the date of first exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and the diagnosis, or (ii) a history of the claimant's exposure sufficient to establish a 10-year latency period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1738\">\n   <strong>\n    5.7(a)(1)(A) Disease Level I.\n   </strong>\n   All diagnoses of Severe Asbestosis (Disease Level I) shall be based, in the case of a claimant who was living at the time the claim was filed, upon a physical examination of the claimant by the physician providing the diagnosis of the asbestos-related disease.

The Asbestos Trust may require the submission of X-rays, CT scans, detailed results of pulmonary function tests, laboratory tests, tissue samples, results of medical examination or reviews of other medical evidence, and may require that medical evidence submitted comply with recognized medical standards regarding equipment, testing methods and procedures to assure that such evidence is reliable. Medical evidence (i) that is of a kind shown to have been received in evidence by a state or federal judge at trial, (ii) that is consistent with evidence submitted to a Debtor to settle for payment similar disease cases prior to the Debtors' bankruptcy, or (iii) that is a diagnosis by a physician shown to have previously qualified as a medical expert with respect to the asbestos-related disease in question before a state or federal judge, using the same methodology or standard, is presumptively reliable, although the Asbestos Trust may seek to rebut the presumption. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this TDP, any medical evidence submitted by a physician or entity that the Asbestos Trust has determined, after consulting with the TAC and the FCR, to be unreliable shall not be acceptable as medical evidence in support of any Asbestos Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1741\">\n   In addition, claimants who otherwise meet the requirements of this TDP for payment of an Asbestos Claim shall be paid irrespective of the results in any litigation at any time between the claimant and any other defendant in the tort system.

Claims based on conspiracy theories that involve no exposure to asbestos,\n   asbestos-containing products, or conduct for which the Asbestos Trust has legal responsibility are not compensable under this TDP. To meet the presumptive exposure requirements of Expedited Review set forth in Section 5.3(a)(3) above, the claimant must show (i) for all Disease Levels, Debtor Exposure as defined in Section 5.7(b)(3) below; and (ii) for Severe Asbestosis (Disease Level I), Other Cancer (Disease Level II), or Lung Cancer (Disease Level III), the claimant must show six (6) months Debtor Exposure plus Significant Occupational Exposure to asbestos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1745\">\n   <strong>\n    5.7(b)(2) Significant Occupational Exposure. \"\n    <em>\n     Significant Occupational Exposure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" means employment for a cumulative period of at least five (5) years in an industry and an occupation in which the claimant (a) handled raw asbestos fibers on a regular basis; (b) fabricated asbestos-containing products so that the claimant in the fabrication process was exposed on a regular basis to raw asbestos fibers; (c) altered, repaired or otherwise worked with an asbestos-containing product such that the claimant was exposed on a regular basis to asbestos fibers; or (d) was employed in an industry and occupation such that the claimant worked on a regular basis in close proximity to workers engaged in the activities described in (a), (b) and/or (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1746\">\n   <strong>\n    5.7(b)(3) Debtor Exposure.\n   </strong>\n   The claimant must demonstrate meaningful and credible exposure to asbestos, asbestos-containing products, or conduct for which the Asbestos Trust has legal responsibility as described in this Section 5.7(b)(3)\n   <strong>\n    (\"\n    <em>\n     Debtor Exposure\n    </em>\n    \").\n   </strong>\n   That meaningful and credible exposure evidence may be established by an affidavit or sworn statement of the claimant, by an affidavit or sworn statement of a co-worker or the affidavit or sworn statement of a family member in the case of a deceased claimant (providing the Asbestos Trust finds such evidence reasonably reliable), by invoices, employment, construction or similar records, or by other credible evidence. The specific exposure information required by the Asbestos Trust to process a claim shall be set forth on the proof of claim form to be used by the Asbestos Trust. The Asbestos Trust can also require submission of other or additional evidence of exposure when it deems such to be necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1747\">\n   Evidence submitted to establish proof of Debtor Exposure is for the sole benefit of the Asbestos Trust, not third parties or defendants in the tort system. Except with respect to Disease Level 5, the Asbestos Trust has no need for, and therefore claimants are not required to furnish the Asbestos Trust with, evidence of exposure to specific asbestos products other than those for which the Asbestos Trust has responsibility, except to the extent such evidence is required elsewhere in this TDP. Similarly, failure to identify Debtor Product Lines in the claimant's underlying tort action, or to other bankruptcy trusts, does not preclude the claimant from recovering from the Asbestos Trust, provided the claimant otherwise satisfies the medical and exposure requirements of this TDP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1748\">\n   <strong>\n    5.7(b)(3)(A) Presumptive Occupations.\n   </strong>\n   Because of the nature of the Debtors' businesses, the Asbestos Trust shall consider that there is a limited universe of occupations in which claimants are likely to have been directly exposed to asbestos, asbestos- containing products, or conduct for which the Asbestos Trust has legal responsibility. Those occupations are automotive mechanics (the\n   <strong>\n    \"Presumptive Occupations\").\n   </strong>\n   The Asbestos Trust may add occupations to the Presumptive Occupations if the Trustee determines, with the consent of the TAC and FCR, that based\n   on an analysis of claims submitted to the Asbestos Trust establishing Debtor Exposure, claimants with such occupations are likely to have been directly exposed to asbestos, asbestos-containing products, or conduct for which the Asbestos Trust has legal responsibility. The Asbestos Trust may also remove occupations from the Presumptive Occupations if it determines that such occupations should not have been included.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1749\">\n   <strong>\n    5.7(b)(3)(B) Standard of Exposure.\n   </strong>\n   In order for a claim to be approved by the Asbestos Trust, the injured party must have worked in a Presumptive Occupation and must demonstrate to the Asbestos Trust's satisfaction that he or she worked directly with the Debtor Product Lines. When evaluating whether an injured party has demonstrated that he or she worked directly with the Debtors' Product Lines, the Asbestos Trust shall base its determination upon whether the circumstances of the injured party's exposure to the product are the same as those of claimants with respect to which the Debtors historically paid claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1750\">\n   <strong>\n    5.8 Claims Audit Program.\n   </strong>\n   The Asbestos Trust, with the consent of the TAC and the FCR, shall develop methods for auditing (i) the reliability of medical evidence, including additional reading of X-rays, CT scans and verification of pulmonary function tests, and (ii) the reliability of evidence of exposure to asbestos, including exposure to asbestos-containing products for which the Asbestos Trust has legal responsibility and occupational evidence (a claims audit program). The Asbestos Trust may hire independent third-parties to implement the audit programs. In the event that the Asbestos Trust reasonably determines that any individual or entity has engaged in a pattern or practice of providing unreliable evidence to the Asbestos Trust, it may decline to accept additional evidence from such provider in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1751\">\n   The Asbestos Trust shall utilize the services of a third-party claims processing facility (the\n   <strong>\n    \"Claims Processor\"\n   </strong>\n   ) to assist in the evaluation of claims submitted to the Asbestos Trust. The Asbestos Trust shall participate in a cross-trust audit program. Such cross-trust audit program shall include a comparison of claims filed with the Asbestos Trust against claims filed with all other asbestos trusts administered by the Claims Processor that participate in the cross trust audit program but in any case shall include no fewer than four other trusts. The filing of any claim with the Asbestos Trust, regardless of the treatment sought, shall constitute consent for each other asbestos trust participating in the cross-trust audit program to release to the entity overseeing the cross-trust audit program all information submitted to such other asbestos trust by or on behalf of the claimant pursuant to the provisions of the cross-trust audit program and to disclose the status of any such claim and the amount and date of any payment on the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1752\">\n   To the extent that the Asbestos Trust or the entity overseeing the claims audit program or cross-trust audit program believe that it is relevant, nothing herein shall preclude the Asbestos Trust or the entity overseeing the claims audit program or cross-trust audit program, in the Asbestos Trust's sole discretion, from reviewing or taking into consideration other claims filed in state court complaints or against trusts in addition to those trusts involved in the cross-trust audit program. Any claimant subject to the claims audit program or cross-trust audit program shall cooperate and, if requested, provide the Asbestos Trust or the entity overseeing the claims audit program or cross-trust audit program with authorization to obtain from\n   other asbestos trusts any information such claimant has submitted to such other asbestos trusts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1753\">\n   Further, in the event that an audit reveals that fraudulent information has been provided to the Asbestos Trust, the Asbestos Trust may penalize any claimant or claimant's attorney by rejecting the Asbestos Claim or by other means including, but not limited to, requiring the source of the fraudulent information to pay the costs associated with the audit and any future audit or audits, reordering the priority of payment of all affected claimants' Asbestos Claims, raising the level of scrutiny of additional information submitted from the same source or sources, increasing the filing fee for future claims submitted by such claimant or claimant's attorney, refusing to accept additional evidence from the same source or sources, seeking the prosecution of the claimant or claimant's attorney for presenting a fraudulent claim in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and seeking sanctions from the Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1754\">\n   <strong>\n    5.9 Arbitration.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1755\">\n   <strong>\n    5.9(a) Establishment of ADR Procedures.\n   </strong>\n   The Asbestos Trust, with the consent of the TAC and the FCR, shall institute binding and non-binding arbitration procedures (\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ADR Procedures\"\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ) for resolving disputes concerning whether the claimant's medical condition or exposure history meets the requirements of this TDP for purposes of categorizing a claim involving Disease Levels I-V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1756\">\n   In all arbitrations, the arbitrator shall consider the same medical and exposure evidentiary requirements that are set forth in Section 5.7 above.

The proof of claim form shall also include a certification by the claimant or his or her attorney sufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In developing its claim filing procedures, the Asbestos Trust shall make every reasonable effort to provide claimants with the opportunity to utilize currently available technology at their discretion, including filing claims and supporting documentation over the Internet.

This TDP has been prepared with the goal of simplifying the filing of claims, reducing paperwork by claimants, and reducing the cost of reviewing claims in an effort to maximize distribution to claimants, as well as ensuring the accuracy of such submissions. Accordingly, instead of collecting some or all of the claims information from a claimant or the claimant's attorney, the Asbestos Trust may, with the consent of the claimant or the claimant's attorney, obtain such information from electronic databases maintained by any other asbestos claims resolution organization. If requested by the claimant, the Asbestos Trust shall accept information provided electronically.

A claimant can also request that the processing of his or her Asbestos Claim by the Asbestos Trust be deferred for a period not to exceed two (2) years without affecting the status of the claim for statute of limitations purposes, in which case the claimant shall also retain his or her original place in the FIFO Processing Queue. During the period of such deferral, a sequencing adjustment on such claimant's Asbestos Claim as provided in Section 7.5 hereunder shall not accrue and payment thereof shall be deemed waived by the claimant. Except for Asbestos Claims held by representatives of deceased or incompetent claimants for which court or probate approval of the Asbestos Trust's offer is required, or an Asbestos Claim for which deferral status has been granted, a claim shall be deemed to have been withdrawn if the claimant neither accepts, rejects, nor initiates arbitration within one (1) year of the Asbestos Trust's written offer of payment or rejection of the claim.

The Asbestos Trust may impose a higher filing fee as set forth in Section 5.8 above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1766\">\n   <strong>\n    6.5 Confidentiality of Claimants' Submissions.\n   </strong>\n   All submissions to the Asbestos Trust by a holder of an Asbestos Claim, including a proof of claim form and materials related thereto, shall be treated as made in the course of settlement discussions between the holder and the Asbestos Trust, and intended by the parties to be confidential and to be protected by all applicable state and federal privileges and protections, including but not limited to those directly applicable to settlement discussions. The Asbestos Trust will preserve the confidentiality of such claimant submissions, and shall disclose the contents thereof only, with the permission of the holder, to another trust established for the benefit of asbestos personal injury claimants pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law, to such other persons as authorized by the holder, or in response to a valid subpoena of such materials issued by the Bankruptcy Court, a Delaware State Court, or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Furthermore, the Asbestos Trust shall provide counsel for the holder a copy of any such subpoena immediately upon being served; provided, however, that if a subpoena seeks records or information pertaining to more than fifty (50) claimants, the Asbestos Trust may instead first provide a copy of the subpoena to counsel for the TAC and the FCR and delay providing a copy of the subpoena to counsel for individual holders of Asbestos Claims until, in the Trustee's judgment, it appears likely that information or records relating to the holders may have to be produced in response to the subpoena. In such a case, the Asbestos Trust shall ensure that the notice that is provided to counsel for the holders allows such counsel sufficient time to object to the production. The Asbestos Trust shall on its own initiative or upon request of the claimant in question take all necessary and appropriate steps to preserve said privileges before the Bankruptcy Court, a Delaware State Court, or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and before those courts having appellate jurisdiction related thereto. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, with the consent of the TAC and the FCR, the Asbestos Trust may, in specific limited circumstances, disclose information, documents or other materials reasonably necessary in the Asbestos Trust's judgment to preserve, litigate, resolve, or settle coverage, or to comply with an applicable obligation under an insurance policy or settlement agreement; provided, however, that the Asbestos Trust shall take any and all steps reasonably feasible in its judgment to preserve the further confidentiality of such information, documents and materials, and prior to the disclosure of such information, documents or materials to a third party, the Asbestos Trust shall receive from such third party a written agreement of confidentiality that (a) ensures that the information, documents and materials provided by the Asbestos Trust shall be used solely by the receiving party for the purpose stated in the agreement and (b) prohibits any other use or further dissemination of the information, documents and materials by the third party except as set forth in the written agreement of confidentiality. Nothing in this TDP, the Plan or the Trust Agreement expands, limits or impairs the obligation under applicable law of a claimant to respond fully to lawful discovery in any underlying civil action regarding his or her submission of factual information to the\n   Asbestos Trust for the purpose of obtaining compensation for asbestos-related injuries from the Asbestos Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1767\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ARTICLE 7\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1768\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR LIQUIDATING AND PAYING CLAIMS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1769\">\n   <strong>\n    7.1 Showing Required.\n   </strong>\n   To establish a valid Asbestos Claim, a claimant must meet the requirements set forth in this TDP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1770\">\n   <strong>\n    7.2 Costs Considered.\n   </strong>\n   Notwithstanding any provisions of this TDP to the contrary, the Trustee shall always give appropriate consideration to the cost of investigating and uncovering invalid Asbestos Claims so that the payment of valid Asbestos Claims is not further impaired by such processes with respect to issues related to the validity of the medical evidence supporting an Asbestos Claim. The Trustee shall also have the latitude to make judgments regarding the amount of transaction costs to be expended by the Asbestos Trust so that valid Asbestos Claims are not unduly further impaired by the costs of additional investigation. Nothing herein shall prevent the Trustee, in appropriate circumstances, from contesting the validity of any claim against the Asbestos Trust whatever the costs, or declining to accept medical evidence from sources that the Trustee has determined to be unreliable pursuant to the Claims Audit Program described in Section 5.8 above or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1771\">\n   <strong>\n    7.3 Discretion to Vary the Order and Amounts of Payments in Event of Limited Liquidity.\n   </strong>\n   Consistent with the provisions hereof and subject to the FIFO Processing and Payment Queues and the Maximum Annual Payment, Maximum Available Payment and Claims Payment Ratio requirements set forth above, the Trustee shall proceed as quickly as possible to liquidate valid Asbestos Claims, and shall make payments to holders of such claims in accordance with this TDP promptly as funds become available and as claims are liquidated, while maintaining sufficient resources to pay future valid claims in substantially the same manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1772\">\n   Because the Asbestos Trust's income over time remains uncertain, and decisions about payments must be based on estimates that cannot be done precisely, they may have to be revised in light of experiences over time, and there can be no guarantee of any specific level of payment to claimants. However, the Trustee shall use his or her best efforts to treat similar claims in substantially the same manner, consistent with his or her duties as Trustee, the purposes of the Asbestos Trust, and the practical limitations imposed by the inability to predict the future with precision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1773\">\n   In the event that the Asbestos Trust faces temporary periods of limited liquidity, the Trustee may, with the consent of the TAC and the FCR, (a) suspend the normal order of payment, (b) temporarily limit or suspend payments altogether, (c) offer a Reduced Payment Option as described in Section 2.5 above and/or (d) commence making payments on an installment basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1774\">\n   <strong>\n    7.4 Punitive Damages.\n   </strong>\n   Except as provided below for claims asserted under the Alabama Wrongful Death Statute, in determining the value of any liquidated or unliquidated Asbestos Claim, punitive or exemplary damages, i.e., damages other than compensatory damages, shall not be considered or paid, notwithstanding their availability in the tort system. Similarly, no punitive or exemplary damages shall be payable with respect to any claim litigated against the Asbestos Trust in the tort system\n   pursuant to Sections 5.10 above and 7.6 below. The only damages that may be awarded pursuant to this TDP to Alabama claimants who are deceased and whose personal representatives pursue their claims only under the Alabama Wrongful Death Statute shall be compensatory damages determined pursuant to the statutory and common law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to the choice of law principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1775\">\n   <strong>\n    7.5 Sequencing Adjustment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1776\">\n   <strong>\n    7.5(a) In General\n   </strong>\n   . Subject to the limitations set forth below, a sequencing adjustment shall be paid on all Asbestos Claims with respect to which the claimant has had to wait a year or more for payment, provided, however, that no claimant shall receive a sequencing adjustment for a period in excess of seven (7) years, or for a period when the claim was deferred or withdrawn at the claimant's request. The sequencing adjustment factor shall be the one-year U.S. Treasury bill interest rate in effect on January 1 of the year in which the accrual of the sequencing adjustment commences. The rate of the sequencing adjustment shall be adjusted each January 1 to correspond to the one-year Treasury bill interest rate then in effect. The applicable sequencing adjustment shall be calculated based only on the value of the claim specified in Section 7.5(b) or (c) below, subject to the Payment Percentage; any accrued but unpaid sequencing adjustment shall not be included in such calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1777\">\n   <strong>\n    7.5(b) Unliquidated Asbestos Claims\n   </strong>\n   . A sequencing adjustment shall be payable on the Scheduled Value of any unliquidated Asbestos Claim, whether the claim is liquidated under Expedited Review, IR Process, or by arbitration. No sequencing adjustment shall be paid on any claim liquidated in the tort system pursuant to Section 5.10 above and Section 7.6 below. Sequencing adjustments on all such unliquidated claims shall be measured from the date of payment back to the earliest of the date that is one year after the date on which (a) the claim was filed against a Debtor prior to the Petition Date; (b) the claim was filed against another defendant in the tort system on or after the Petition Date but before the Effective Date; (c) the claim was filed with the Bankruptcy Court during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceeding; or (d) the claim was filed with the Asbestos Trust after the Effective Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1778\">\n   <strong>\n    7.6 Suits in the Tort System.\n   </strong>\n   If the holder of a disputed claim disagrees with the Asbestos Trust's determination regarding the Disease Level of the claim or the claimant's exposure history, and if the holder has first submitted the claim to non-binding arbitration as provided in Section 5.9 above, the holder may file a lawsuit against the Asbestos Trust in the Claimant's Jurisdiction as defined in Section 9.3 below. Any such lawsuit must be filed by the claimant in his or her own right and name and not as a member or representative of a class, and no such lawsuit may be consolidated with any other lawsuit. All defenses (including, with respect to the Asbestos Trust, all defenses which could have been asserted by a Debtor) shall be available to both sides at trial; however, the Asbestos Trust may waive any defense and/or concede any issue of fact or law. If the claimant was alive at the time the initial pre-petition complaint was filed or on the date the proof of claim form was filed with the Asbestos Trust, the case shall be treated as a personal injury case with all personal injury damages to be considered even if the claimant has died during the pendency of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1779\">\n   <strong>\n    7.7 Payment of Judgments for Money Damages.\n   </strong>\n   If and when a claimant obtains\n   a judgment in the tort system, the claim shall be placed in the FIFO Payment Queue based on the date on which the judgment became final. Thereafter, the claimant shall receive from the Asbestos Trust an initial payment (subject to the applicable Payment Percentage and the Maximum Annual Payment, Maximum Available Payment and Claims Payment Ratio provisions set forth above) of an amount equal to the greater of (i) the Asbestos Trust's last offer to the claimant or (ii) the award that the claimant declined in non-binding arbitration; provided, however, that in no event shall such payment amount exceed the amount of the judgment obtained in the tort system. The claimant shall receive the balance of the judgment, if any, in five (5) equal installments in years six (6) through ten (10) following the year of the initial payment (also subject to the applicable Payment Percentage and the Maximum Annual Payment, Maximum Available Payment and Claims Payment Ratio provisions above in effect on the date of the payment of the subject installment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1780\">\n   The total amounts paid with respect to such claims shall not exceed the relevant Scheduled Value for the appropriate Disease Level as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Section 5.3(b)(2)\n   </em>\n   above, and for an Extraordinary Claim involving one of those Disease Levels, the arbitrator shall not return an award greater than the Maximum Value for such a claim as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Section 53(b)(2)\n   </em>\n   above. Under no circumstances shall (a) a sequencing adjustment be paid pursuant to Section 7.5 or (b) interest be paid under any statute on any judgments obtained in the tort system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1781\">\n   <strong>\n    7.8 Releases\n   </strong>\n   . As a condition to receiving any payment from the Asbestos Trust, a claimant shall be required to execute the Asbestos Personal Injury Claimant Release attached hereto as Exhibit 1. In the case of an Indirect Personal Injury Claim, the Indirect Claimant. The Trustee may modify the provisions of the Asbestos Personal Injury Claimant Release with the consent of the TAC and FCR, provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this TDP, the Trustee may not modify any provision that would materially impact the rights and protections afforded to the Reorganized Debtors, the Non-Debtor Affiliates, the Settling Insurers and Representatives of the foregoing under the Asbestos Personal Injury Claimant Release without the written consent of Meritor and the Reorganized Debtors, including, without limitation, (i) the scope and the terms of the release of the Reorganized Debtors, the Non-Debtor Affiliates, the Settling Insurers, and the Representatives of each of the foregoing (each as defined in the Plan), (ii) the requirement that the Asbestos Trust obtain a properly-executed Asbestos Personal Injury Claimant Release from any claimant as a pre-condition to making a distribution to any such claimant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1782\">\n   <strong>\n    7.9 Third-Party Services.\n   </strong>\n   Nothing in this TDP shall preclude the Asbestos Trust from contracting with another asbestos claims resolution organization to provide services to the Asbestos Trust so long as decisions about the categorization and liquidated value of Asbestos Claims are based on the relevant provisions of this TDP, including the Disease Levels, Scheduled Values, and Medical/Exposure Criteria set forth above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1783\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ARTICLE 8\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1784\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     MEDICARE\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1785\">\n   <strong>\n    8.1 Medicare.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1786\">\n   (a) It is the position of the parties to the Trust Agreement that the Protected Parties will have no reporting obligations\n   in respect of their contributions to the Asbestos Trust, or in respect of any payments, settlements, resolutions, awards, or other claim liquidations by the Asbestos Trust, under the reporting provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y et seq. or any other similar statute or regulation, and any related rules, regulations, or guidance issued in connection therewith or relating thereto (\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     MSPA\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \"), including Section 111 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (P.

The Asbestos Trust, in its role as reporting agent for the Protected Parties, shall follow all applicable guidance published by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services of the United States Department of Health and Human Services and/or any other agent or successor entity charged with responsibility for monitoring, assessing, or receiving reports made under MMSEA (collectively, \"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CMS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   \") to determine whether or not, and, if so, how, to report to CMS pursuant to MMSEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1787\">\n   (b) As long as the Asbestos Trust is required to act as a reporting agent for any Protected Party pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.1(a) above, the Asbestos Trust shall within ten (10) business days following the end of each calendar quarter, provide a written certification to the party designated in writing by each Protected Party for which the Asbestos Trust is required to act as reporting agent, confirming that all reports to CMS required by Section 8.1(a) above have been submitted in a timely fashion, and identifying (i) any reports that were rejected or otherwise identified as noncompliant by CMS, along with the basis for such rejection or noncompliance, and (ii) any payments to Medicare benefits recipients or Medicare-eligible beneficiaries that the Asbestos Trust did not report to CMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1788\">\n   (c) With respect to any reports rejected or otherwise identified as noncompliant by CMS, the Asbestos Trust shall, upon request by a Protected Party for which the Asbestos Trust is required to act as reporting agent, promptly provide copies of the original reports submitted to CMS, as well as any response received from CMS with respect to such reports; provided, however, that the Asbestos Trust may redact from such copies the names, Social Security numbers other than the last four digits, health insurance claim numbers, taxpayer identification numbers, employer identification numbers, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, and dates of birth of the injured parties, claimants, guardians, conservators and/or other personal representatives, as applicable. With respect to any such reports, the Asbestos Trust shall\n   reasonably undertake to remedy any issues of noncompliance identified by CMS and resubmit such reports to CMS, and, upon request by a Protected Party, provide such Protected Party with copies of such resubmissions; provided, however, that the Asbestos Trust may redact from such copies the names, Social Security numbers other than the last four digits, health insurance claim numbers, taxpayer identification numbers, employer identification numbers, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, and dates of birth of the injured parties, claimants, guardians, conservators and/or other personal representatives, as applicable.

In the event the Protected Party informs the Asbestos Trust that it disagrees with the Asbestos Trust's decision not to report a claim paid by the Asbestos Trust, the Asbestos Trust shall promptly report the payment to CMS. All documentation relied upon by the Asbestos Trust in making a determination that a payment did not have to be reported to CMS shall be maintained for a minimum of six years following such determination.

Furthermore, following any permitted cessation of reporting, or if reporting has not previously commenced due to the satisfaction of one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(a) above, and if the Protected Party reasonably determines, based on subsequent legislative, administrative, regulatory, or judicial developments, that reporting is required, then the Asbestos Trust shall promptly perform its obligations under Section 8.1(a) and (b) above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1791\">\n   (f) Section 8.1(a) above is intended to be purely prophylactic in nature, and does not imply, and shall not constitute an admission, that any Protected Party, is, in fact, an \"applicable plan\" within the meaning of MMSEA, or that any Protected Party has a legal obligation to report any actions undertaken by the Asbestos Trust or contributions to the Asbestos Trust under MMSEA or any other statute or regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1792\">\n   (g) In the event that CMS concludes that reporting done by the Asbestos Trust in accordance with Section 8.1(a) above is or may be deficient in any way, and has not been corrected to the satisfaction of CMS in a timely manner, or if CMS communicates to the Asbestos Trust or any of the Protected Parties a concern with respect to the sufficiency or timeliness of such reporting, or there appears to a Protected Party a reasonable basis for a concern with respect to the sufficiency or timeliness of such reporting or non-reporting based upon the information received pursuant to Section 8.1(b), (c) or (d) above, or other credible information, then each Protected Party shall have the right to submit its own reports to CMS under MMSEA, and the Asbestos Trust shall provide in a timely manner to any Protected Party that elects to file its own reports such information as the electing Protected Party may require in order to comply with MMSEA, including, without limitation, the full reports filed by the Asbestos Trust pursuant to Section 8.1(a) above without any redactions.

Furthermore, until a Protected Party provides the Asbestos Trust with any necessary information regarding that Protected Party's identifying information that may be required by CMS's Coordination of Benefits Contractor to effectuate reporting, the Asbestos Trust shall have no obligation to report under Section 8.1 (a) above with respect to any such entity that has not provided such information and the Asbestos Trust shall have no indemnification obligation under Section 8.1 to such Protected Party for any penalty, interest, or sanction that may arise solely on account of the Protected Party's failure to timely provide such information to the Asbestos Trust in response to a timely request by the Asbestos Trust for such information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1794\">\n   (i) The Trustee shall obtain prior to remittance of funds to claimants' counsel or to the claimant, if pro se, in respect of any Asbestos Claim a certification from the claimant to be paid that said claimant has or will provide for the payment and/or resolution of any obligations owing or potentially owing under MSPA in connection with, or relating to, such Asbestos Claim and that the Protected Parties also are beneficiaries of such certification. The Asbestos Trust shall provide a quarterly certification of its compliance with the terms of the immediately preceding sentence to the party designated in writing by each Protected Party for which the Asbestos Trust is required to act as reporting agent, and shall permit reasonable audits by such Protected Parties, no more often than quarterly, to confirm the Asbestos Trust's compliance with this Section 8.1(i) during which Protected Parties may request copies of claimant certifications. For the avoidance of doubt, the Asbestos Trust shall be obligated to comply with the requirements of this Section 8.1(i) regardless of whether a Protected Party elects to file its own reports under MMSEA pursuant to Section 8.1(g) above.

Upon the payment by FFIC of the Settlement Amount (as defined in the FFIC Settlement Agreement), FFIC shall be a Settling Insurer under this Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-2333\">\n   and (iv) revises Section XII.C of the Plan to provide as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-2334\">\n   <em>\n    FFIC Settlement Agreement\n   </em>\n   . The terms and conditions of the FFIC Settlement Agreement are expressly incorporated into this Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-2335\">\n   (b) The Debtors shall submit to the Bankruptcy Court a proposed form order confirming the Plan, as revised, that shall include language in form and substance agreed to by the Parties: (i) approving this Agreement in its entirety, (ii) authorizing and directing the Debtors to perform their obligations under this Agreement, (iii) directing FFIC to perform its obligations under this Agreement, (iv) binding the Debtors' bankruptcy estates to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (v) designating FFIC as a Settling Insurer, and (vi) containing a provision that the Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction over any proceeding to enforce the provisions of this Agreement to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-2336\">\n   (c) It is a condition precedent to the Parties' obligations under this Agreement that authorized representatives of the Committee and the FCR indicate in writing that each consents to (i) Maremont's entry into this Agreement and (ii) the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-2337\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Reinsurance Claims/Limitations on Reimbursement Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-2338\">\n   (a) FFIC will be free to pursue reinsurance claims against any and all reinsurers or retrocessionaires regarding any consideration paid by FFIC in connection with this Agreement (as well as for other reinsured amounts such as, without limitation, FFIC's counsel fees). FFIC is free to allocate the Settlement Amount among the Policies in its sole discretion, and such allocation shall not be binding on Maremont in any other proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-2339\">\n   (b) Subject to the provision allowing them to pursue reinsurance claims that is set forth in Section 6.(a), FFIC will not otherwise seek reimbursement of the Settlement Amount from any other insurer (or such other insurers' Affiliates) that enters into a settlement with Maremont in which such other insurer(s) agree, specifically\n   as to FFIC or with respect to other Maremont insurers more generally: (1) not to seek any defense costs or indemnity payments from FFIC; and (2) not to assert a Claim for contribution, subrogation, or reimbursement against FFIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-2340\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Cooperation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-2341\">\n   (a) Each Party will use its best efforts to obtain the outcomes sought by this Agreement, and to take such steps and to execute such documents as may be reasonably necessary or proper to effectuate the purpose and intent of this Agreement and to preserve its validity and enforceability. In the event that any action or proceeding of any type whatsoever is commenced or prosecuted by any Entity not a Party hereto to invalidate, interpret, or prevent the validation, enforcement, or carrying out of all or any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties mutually agree represent, warrant, and covenant to cooperate fully in opposing such action or proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-2342\">\n   (b) Maremont agrees to undertake all reasonable actions and cooperate with FFIC in connection with FFIC's claims against its reinsurers and retrocessionaires relating to payment of the Settlement Amount, this Agreement, and/or Asbestos Personal Injury Claims. In particular, and without limiting other actions and cooperation that FFIC may request, Maremont will provide FFIC with a report once each quarter from the date that the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust begins processing claims that identifies (i) claimant name, (ii) date of alleged first exposure to a Maremont product, (iii) alleged injury, (iv) claim payment amount and (v) claim payment date for all claims processed through the Asbestos Personal Injury Trust (collectively, the \"Reporting Material\") until the total claim payments exhaust the Settlement Amount. Fireman's Fund shall keep all Reporting Material confidential, and Fireman's Fund shall not provide Reporting Material to any Entity other than its reinsurers, retrocessionaires, or reinsurance arbitrators solely for the purpose of obtaining reinsurance for any portion of the Settlement Amount. When providing Reporting Material to its reinsurers, retrocessionaires, or reinsurance arbitrators, Fireman's Fund shall advise the receiving Entity in writing to maintain the confidentiality of the Reporting Material and not to disclose such Material to any other Entity other than a reinsurer's retrocessionaires. Fireman's Fund shall not, and will confirm in writing with its reinsurers, retrocessionaires, and/or reinsurance arbitrators to which any Reporting Material will be provided, that they shall not, disclose any Reporting Material to any other Entity unless such Reporting Material is sought pursuant to a subpoena or other valid legal process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-2343\">\n   <strong>\n    8. Representations By Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-2344\">\n   The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement was bargained for and entered into in good faith and as the result of arms-length negotiations. This Agreement involves compromises of the Parties' previously stated legal positions, and the Parties expressly agree that at all material times they have been represented by counsel of their own choosing concerning the rights affected by this Agreement, the form and content of it, and the advisability of executing it. This Agreement does not reflect the Parties' views as to their rights and obligations with respect to matters or Entities outside the scope of this Agreement. This Agreement is without prejudice to positions taken by FFIC with regard to other insureds or claimants, and without prejudice to positions taken by Maremont with regard to other insurers. The Parties specifically disavow any intention to create\n   rights in third parties under or in relation to this Agreement. This Agreement is the jointly-drafted product of multi-lateral negotiations among parties of equal sophistication and bargaining power and thus shall not be interpreted for or against any Party notwithstanding statutes, rules, or doctrines that presumptively construe agreements or contracts against certain parties, and no provision of this Agreement shall be construed against FFIC because of its status as an insurance company or as having issued or allegedly issued the Policies to Maremont. This Agreement is not, nor shall it be construed as, an insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-2345\">\n   <strong>\n    9. Entire Agreement/Amendments to Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-2346\">\n   This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties. Except as expressly set forth herein to the contrary, this Agreement supersedes all prior written and oral agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to the matters provided for in this Agreement. No amendments or variations of the terms of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by all Parties hereto, or their successors or assigns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-2347\">\n   <strong>\n    10.
