INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The matter before the Court is the \"Motion for Payment of Outstanding Interest Pursuant to Judge Young's Order Dated August 3, 2018\" (the \"Motion for Pendency Interest\") filed by Stephen J. Kuzma, Russo &amp; Minchoff, and India L. Minchoff (the \"Lawyer Creditors\"). Through their motion, the Lawyer Creditors seek $ 155,749.54 in postpetition interest at the rate of 12 percent under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231 \u00a7 6C, the interest rate applicable to judgments in contract actions, on their claim from the commencement of the case to August 16, 2017 [sic], the date they state this Court confirmed the Third Amended Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization filed by Savvas V. Gianasmidis, (the \"Debtor\" or \"Gianasmidis\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor filed an Opposition to the Motion for Pendency Interest in which he acknowledged the Lawyer Creditors' entitlement to pendency interest, but contested the amount and the rate of interest on the claim. He argues that the rate of pendency interest to be applied to the Lawyer Creditors' claim should be the federal judgment rate, not the state statutory rate of interest on judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The issue presented is the rate and concomitant amount of interest the Lawyer Creditors should be paid in \"pendency interest.\" In other words, this Court must determine the interest rate applicable to the Lawyer Creditors' allowed secured claim during this Chapter 11 case between the petition date and the effective date of the Debtor's plan of reorganization. The issue is complicated due to a number of circumstances, including 1) the vacatur by the Massachusetts Appeals Court of the Lawyer Creditors' judgment during the pendency of the Chapter 11 case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Russo &amp; Minchoff v.

Mass. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court held a hearing on the contested matter on February 5, 2019 and directed counsel to file post-hearing briefs. Neither party requested an evidentiary hearing and the facts necessary to decide this contested matter are not in material dispute. The Court now makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND AND FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background and State Court Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following undisputed facts appear from the record of proceedings in this\n   case, as well as from the findings of the Massachusetts Appeals Court in an appeal involving the Debtor and the Lawyer Creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Russo &amp; Minchoff v. Gianasmidis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203524796\">\n    2016 WL 3524796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1-2. The Lawyer Creditors entered into two written contingency fee agreements, the first in 2009 and the second in 2011, for the provision of legal services to represent Gianasmidis in a lawsuit he commenced against Katini Palangas (\"Palangas\"), whom the Debtor alleged had received improper transfers of numerous real properties. The fee agreements provided for a contingency fee of 33 percent and 40 percent, respectively, based on the amount of recovery. Both fee agreements had dispute resolution clauses that provided that any dispute must be \"resolved exclusively through arbitration.\" In addition, the parties waived a jury trial and agreed that the arbitrators' award would be \"final, binding and conclusive\" on the parties. Neither fee agreement contained any provision for the accrual or payment of interest on any unpaid fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The action in which the Lawyer Creditors represented Gianasmidis was tried and a judgment was entered in favor of Gianasmidis in the sum of $ 1,375,001.00. Gianasmidis also recovered two properties on Farqhuar Street in Roslindale, Massachusetts. Because Palangas could not pay the judgment, the parties entered into a settlement agreement which provided for the transfer of numerous real estate assets to Gianasmidis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following execution of the settlement agreement, a fee dispute arose over the amount of the contingency fees that was due. The Lawyer Creditors filed an action in Suffolk Superior Court against Gianasmidis for breach of the fee agreements, to collect fees, and for injunctive relief for the purpose of restraining Gianasmidis from transferring assets. The Lawyer Creditors also filed ex parte motions for real estate attachments on the Debtor's property. The state court authorized the attachments in the sum of $ 800,000.00 in 2014 and the Lawyer Creditors properly recorded the attachments in the registry of deeds. The Lawyer Creditors also recorded notices of their attorney's liens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Gianasmidis failed to answer their complaint and the Lawyer Creditors moved for a default. Gianasmidis then filed a motion to set aside the default and to compel arbitration, as well as a petition for arbitration with the Massachusetts Bar Association. The Lawyer Creditors opposed both motions, although, according to the Appeals Court, the Lawyer Creditors initially agreed to arbitration with the Massachusetts Bar Association Legal Fee Arbitration Board (\"LFAB\"), which assigned an arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203524796\">\n    2016 WL 3524796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 n.4. The Superior Court, after a hearing, denied the motion to compel arbitration. It also denied Gianasmidis's motion to remove the default and scheduled a hearing on an assessment of damages. The Lawyer Creditors requested that the arbitration proceeding be dismissed, but the arbitrator denied the request. The LFAB scheduled the arbitration and, in response, the Lawyer Creditors filed a motion to enjoin the arbitration, which motion the Superior Court granted. Gianasmidis then moved for reconsideration, but the Superior Court refused to reconsider its ruling and, after an evidentiary hearing on the assessment of damages, entered judgment for the Lawyer Creditors against Gianasmidis in the sum of $ 1,527,931.30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Gianasmidis filed a notice of appeal, which the Lawyer Creditors moved to dismiss. After declining to dismiss the appeal, the Massachusetts Appeals Court considered the trial judge's implicit determination that Gianasmidis had waived arbitration. It rejected the Lawyer Creditors'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   argument that Gianasmidis had waived his right to arbitrate by defaulting and failing to timely seek an order compelling arbitration, reasoning that, despite the delay caused by Gianasmidis's failure to answer the complaint, the action had not proceeded to discovery and trial was not imminent. In light of the strong public policy in favor of the arbitration of disputes, it reversed the denial of the motion to compel arbitration as an abuse of discretion and reversed the Superior Court's judgment against Gianasmidis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Court Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Debtor filed a Chapter 13 petition on May 28, 2015. He moved to convert his Chapter 13 case to a case under Chapter 11. The Court granted his motion and his Chapter 13 case was converted to Chapter 11 on July 2, 2015. The Debtor is in the real estate business and manages rental properties. There has been extensive litigation between the Lawyer Creditors and the Debtor throughout the bankruptcy case, and an understanding of the reasons for Debtor's delay in obtaining confirmation of a plan of reorganization are relevant to the issue of the rate and amount of pendency interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the outset, the Lawyer Creditors moved to dismiss the Chapter 13 case on the ground that he did not satisfy the debt limitations for eligibility for Chapter 13 relief or, in the alternative, for relief from the automatic stay imposed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). After a hearing, the Court determined that the Debtor was not eligible for Chapter 13 relief, and afforded him an opportunity to convert his Chapter 13 case to one under Chapter 11. The Court also ruled that the Lawyer Creditors did not establish cause for relief from the automatic stay. As noted above, the Debtor filed a motion to convert his case to Chapter 11 which the Court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Debtor employed special counsel to pursue the appeal between the Debtor and the Lawyer Creditors in the Appeals Court. The Lawyer Creditors opposed the relief sought by the Debtor and requested sanctions against the Debtor's attorneys for filing pleadings in the Appeals Court. The Court granted the Debtor's motion for summary judgment with respect to the sanctions motion because the Lawyer Creditors failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Lawyer Creditors filed a Motion to Convert the Debtor's Chapter 11 Case to Chapter 7 on December 15, 2015. They argued in their motion that the Debtor had failed to fulfill his obligations as a debtor-in-possession and that he had failed to propose a plan of reorganization within a reasonable time. The Debtor opposed the motion to convert to Chapter 7, arguing that there was no cause for conversion and that he was making progress toward obtaining confirmation of a viable plan of reorganization. The Court held an initial hearing on the motion to convert, entered preliminary orders requiring the Debtor to file a plan and a disclosure statement by February 8, 2016, and scheduled the motion for an evidentiary hearing. The Court also established a deadline for the Debtor to object to the Lawyer Creditors' proofs of claim. The evidentiary hearing did not go forward, however, and the Court continued the motion to convert generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Lawyer Creditors filed three proofs of claim: 1) Attorney Stephen J. Kuzma filed Claim # 9 in the amount of $ 1,528,935.97 as a secured claim; 2) the Law Office of Russo &amp; Minchoff filed Claim #10 in the same amount as a secured claim; and 3) India Minchoff, Esq. filed Claim #11, again in the same amount as a secured claim. In the aggregate, the Lawyer Creditors' proofs of claim totaled approximately\n   $ 4.5 million and were filed as secured claims due to the recorded notices of liens on the Debtor's real properties, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20221%2C%20%C2%A7%2050\">\n    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, \u00a7 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as the real estate attachments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Debtor objected to the three proofs of claim, asserting, among other things, that the three claims were duplicative and excessive, and secured only to the extent of $ 800,000.00. The Court deemed the objections to claims to be contested matters and issued a scheduling order. The Lawyer Creditors filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to the allowance of their claims and a motion to stay discovery which the Debtor opposed. The Lawyer Creditors also sought to strike the Debtor's statement of disputed facts and requested this Court to abstain from litigating the claims objection because their claims were based on state law. In an order dated June 3, 2016, this Court stayed further proceedings on the Debtor's objection to the Lawyer Creditors' claims, the motion for summary judgment, and the motion to abstain pending a decision by the Massachusetts Appeals Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During the pretrial period of claims litigation, the Debtor, with Court authorization after notice and the opportunity for objections and higher offers, sold property in Roslindale and in Chelsea, Massachusetts and filed a plan of reorganization and disclosure statement. The United States trustee filed a limited objection to approval of the disclosure statement, as did several other secured creditors. Upon consideration of the objections, the Court ordered the Debtor to file an amended plan and disclosure statement. The Lawyer Creditors filed a motion for temporary allowance of their claims for plan voting purposes. They also filed an objection to confirmation of the Debtor's amended plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 13, 2016, the Lawyer Creditors filed a \"Motion for Allowance of Postpetition Interest (and Valuation of Collateral to the Extent Applicable) under Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code\" (the \"Interest Motion\"). On June 28, 2016, the parties notified this Court of the decision of the Massachusetts Appeals Court as noted above. On July 8, 2016, the Debtor filed an objection to the Interest Motion. The Court conducted a status conference on August 17, 2016 at which the Lawyer Creditors stated their intent to seek review of the Appeals Court decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\"). The Court directed them to file a status report when the SJC issued its ruling. The SJC, however, declined further review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Debtor, on September 19, 2016, filed a motion to compel arbitration of the Lawyer Creditors' claims. The Lawyer Creditors opposed the motion. The Debtor filed a motion to strike their opposition, and the Lawyer Creditors opposed that motion. After a hearing, this Court took\n   the matters under advisement. While those matters were pending, Attorney Minchoff filed a motion alleging that a private investigator employed by the Debtor, or his special counsel, harassed her. Special counsel objected, and the Court, after a hearing, entered an order ruling that it had no jurisdiction over that dispute and indicating that its ruling was without prejudice to Attorney Minchoff's pursuit of her claims in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This Court granted the Debtor's motion to compel arbitration, ruling that the parties were required to arbitrate their dispute based upon the plain language of the fee agreements. Thereafter, the parties arbitrated their dispute before three LFAB arbitrators. By notice dated January 24, 2017, the Lawyer Creditors and the Debtor reported to this Court that the Lawyer Creditors received an arbitration award on January 20, 2017 in the sum of $ 695,024.26 for their fees, and that, after deducting the sum of $ 48,269 which had been paid by the Debtor, $ 646,755.00 remained unpaid. The arbitrators' award made no provision for the payment of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Lawyer Creditors objected to further amendments to the disclosure statement and plan of reorganization proposed by the Debtor, and also moved for payment of the net proceeds of the Debtor's sale of real estate located at 4412 Washington Street in Roslindale in partial satisfaction of their claims. The Debtor and the Lawyer Creditors resolved these disputes, and the Debtor subsequently filed a Third Amended Disclosure Statement and Third Amended Plan of Reorganization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the meantime, the Lawyer Creditors amended the Interest Motion, seeking 12 percent preaward interest on their claims from the date of the filing of their complaint in the Superior Court, which, if allowed, would result in the payment of interest in the sum of $ 278,104.65. They also sought post-award interest at the rate of 12 percent in the sum of $ 36,994.38. The Lawyer Creditors maintained that their claims were based on state law, that the Debtor engaged in tactical delays to avoid his contractual obligations to pay their fees, and that the equities warranted application of the state law judgment rate of interest. They asserted the Debtor would receive a windfall if their claims did not accrue interest at the state law rate. The Debtor objected to the amended motion, arguing that 1) the Lawyer Creditors were not entitled to preaward interest because the arbitrators did not award interest; 2) the Lawyer Creditors were not entitled to post-award interest because the fee agreement did not provide for interest; and 3) even if interest were allowable, the Court should exercise its discretion to deny it because the Lawyer Creditors were responsible for the significant delays in resolving their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On July 12, 2017, the Court conducted a confirmation hearing on the Debtor's Third Amended Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization. The Lawyer Creditors and other secured creditors reported on the record that objections to confirmation had been resolved. The Court confirmed the Debtor's plan on July 17, 2017. On July 19, 2019, the Debtor filed a \"Notice of (A) Entry of Order of Confirmation; (B) Effective Date; and (C) Deadlines for Filing Administrative Expense Claims, Professional Fee Claims and Rejection Claims\" in which it set forth August 17, 2019 as the effective date of the Third Amended Plan of Reorganization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties agree that the Debtor paid the Lawyer Creditors the sum of $ 599,491.50 on May 24, 2017, and, on October 6, 2017, he paid them another $ 47,598.28, plus $ 338.78 in post-confirmation interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After a hearing on the Lawyer Creditors' amended Interest Motion, this Court allowed the Lawyer Creditors' motion in part and denied it in part on the record. This Court determined that the arbitrators' failure to include interest on the award did not preclude the assessment of interest as the LFAB rules provide that an arbitrator only decides the amount of the fee. This Court rejected the Lawyer Creditors' argument that the state law judgment rate of interest applied to their secured claim because their judgment had been vacated. Instead, the Court applied the federal judgment rate of interest from the date of the arbitration award. The Lawyer Creditors appealed this Court's order to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The District Court Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In his opinion dated August 3, 2018, Judge Young affirmed one aspect of this Court's decision, namely, that the Lawyer Creditors were not entitled to prepetition interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gianasmidis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526005\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/442/\">\n    318 F.Supp.3d at 449-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Young reversed and remanded with respect to two other rulings. He determined that this Court erred in deciding that pendency interest ran from the date of the postpetition arbitration award, ruling instead that the Lawyer Creditors were entitled to postpetition interest on their secured claim from the date of the commencement of the Debtor's bankruptcy petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He remanded for a recalculation of pendency interest from the petition date. Secondly, Judge Young remanded for reconsideration of the appropriate rate of pendency interest. Reviewing the provisions of \u00a7 506(b), and authority in the First Circuit and elsewhere, he noted that the rate of pendency interest is within the limited discretion of the court, and that Massachusetts law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, \u00a7 6C\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"automatically attaches to arbitration awards - -\n   <strong>\n    even when the award is silent on the issue.\"\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526005\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/442/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526005\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/442/\">\n    at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). Thus, he ruled that the Lawyer Creditors' claim under \u00a7 506(b) is \"presumptively determined by the applicable nonbankruptcy\n   law under which the agreement was made, but it is still subject to the Bankruptcy Court's 'limited discretion.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526005\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/442/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526005\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/442/\">\n    at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He ruled that this Court did not adequately explain its reasoning for applying the federal judgment rate of interest as opposed to the Massachusetts statutory rate of interest on judgments, and remanded for further consideration of the rate of pendency interest to be applied to the Lawyer Creditors' secured claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In their post-hearing filing, the Lawyers Creditors argue that the Massachusetts Attorney's Lien statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20221%2C%20%C2%A7%2050\">\n    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, \u00a7 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , gave them an inchoate lien which became choate when judgment entered. Citing\n   <em>\n    Zabin v. Picciotto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831439\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/73/141/\">\n    73 Mass.

The Lawyer Creditors submit that the Appeals Court in\n   <em>\n    Zabin\n   </em>\n   limited and distinguished its prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Craft v. Kane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659848\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/65/322/\">\n    65 Mass.

He points out that the arbitrators specifically denied the Lawyers Creditors' claim for preaward interest. He concedes, however, that Judge Young found that the Lawyer Creditors were entitled to pre-arbitration award interest on their claims under \u00a7 506(b). The Debtor further argues that because Massachusetts law prohibits courts from awarding interest when an arbitration award does not provide for it, and there is no contractual basis for preaward interest, the federal judgment rate of interest, not the 12 percent state law judgment rate, should apply as it more closely matches current market rates and furthers the objectives of the fresh start, citing\n   <em>\n    Wasserman v. City of Cambridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6502738\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/151/4/#p5\">\n    151 B.R. 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5-6 (D. Mass. 1993) (holding that the federal judgment rate established at 8.155%, rather than the statutory rate of 16%, had to be applied for postpetition interest on tax claim). The Debtor also argues in his supplemental brief that the attorney's lien statute does not provide a basis to award interest, citing\n   <em>\n    Craft v.

Thus, these courts ruled that contract rates, including default rates and state law rates, are not binding, and they rejected higher state law judgment rates of interest, opining that present value determinations based on current market conditions are more consistent with the reorganization purposes of bankruptcy and balanced the interests of the lien claimant and other creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The present case is unique in a number of respects. In the first place, the fee agreements, which were drafted by the Lawyer Creditors, do not provide for payment of interest on any unpaid fees, and, thus, the contracts themselves do not assist in determining the appropriate rate of pendency interest. Moreover, the attorney's lien statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20221%2C%20%C2%A7%2050\">\n    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, \u00a7 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not contain a provision for the payment of interest. The procedural history of the fee disputes in this case further complicates the issue of pendency interest due to the parties' disagreement on whether to arbitrate their claims, the entry of a default judgment by the Superior Court, the reversal of that judgment on appeal, the filing of inflated proofs of claim\n   by the Lawyer Creditors and the Debtor's concomitant objections, the ultimate arbitration award entered on July 20, 2017, and, finally, Judge Young's decision in which he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [T]he Lawyer Creditors would have been entitled under Massachusetts law to post-award interest accruing from the date of the award. In other words, even though the Lawyer Creditors did not have their award confirmed by the Superior Court, the underlying substantive law under which the Fee Agreements were entered would have entitled them to a 12% interest rate beginning on January 20, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    In re Gianasmidis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526005\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/442/\">\n    318 F.Supp.3d at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In view of these circumstances, the Court concludes that a blended rate of pendency interest is required to address the particular circumstances presented by the complicated chronology of litigation between Gianasmidis and the Lawyer Creditors, comply with Judge Young's decision, and balance the equities between the parties in the absence of any contract rate of interest in the fee agreements. The Court concludes that pendency interest in this case must have two components: 1) a rate of interest from the petition date of May 28, 2015 to the date of the entry of the arbitration award on January 20, 2017, and 2) 12% interest from the date of the arbitration award to the effective date of confirmation of the Debtor's plan of reorganization, i.e., August 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This Court rejects the Lawyer Creditors' contention that their secured claims entitle them to the state law rate of interest on judgments of 12 percent from the petition date. Although the Lawyer Creditors had a judgment against the Debtor as of the date of the commencement of his case, that judgment was reversed and vacated by the Massachusetts Appeals Court on June 28, 2016. The invalidation of the judgment precludes accrual of pendency interest at that rate until the arbitration award on January 20, 2017. As noted by the district court, there is no applicable contract provision in the agreements between the parties to assist in the computation of interest. Moreover, the arbitration proceeding was not concluded until approximately two years after the petition date, and Massachusetts law does not provide for pre-arbitration award interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gianasmidis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526005\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/442/\">\n    318 F.Supp.3d at 452-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Young ruled, however, that the Lawyer Creditors are entitled to pendency interest from the petition date to the confirmation date, a ruling that is binding on this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the first component of pendency interest, this Court concludes that a market rate of interest from the petition date to the date of the arbitration award (approximately 20 months) is an appropriate rate of interest based upon the equities and unique circumstances of this case. Prior to the arbitration award, the Lawyer Creditors had judicial and statutory liens arising from the filing of the notices of their attorneys' liens and the attachments authorized by the Superior Court. Much of the delay in the payment of Lawyer Creditors' claims was due to their refusal to arbitrate, despite the clear and unequivocal arbitration clause in the fee agreements. The Lawyer Creditors objected to arbitration in this Court from the inception of the bankruptcy case through late 2016, despite the clear contractual mandate to arbitrate. Their meritless objection to arbitration, which was required under the contracts they drafted, and the litigation tactics they employed by insisting that their default judgment should stand were largely responsible for the delay in the payment of their fees. Their inflated proofs of claim also contributed to claims litigation that led to delays in payment. The arbitration award was approximately half of the\n   amount of the amount of the Lawyer Creditors' proofs of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Thus, the Court rejects the Lawyer Creditors' contention that they are entitled to the state statutory judgment rate of interest from the petition date. Judge Young emphasized that neither the contract nor the arbitration award provided for interest.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526005\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/442/\">\n    318 F.Supp.3d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although \u00a7 6C of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231 provides for interest at 12 per cent from the date of the breach or demand, Judge Young reasoned that the Lawyer Creditors' prepetition judgment was vacated and, accordingly, there was no judgment upon which to apply the statutory 12 percent rate prior to the arbitration award.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526005\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/442/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526005\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/442/\">\n    at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

An award of pendency interest at the prime market rate in effect from the petition date to the date of the arbitration award fairly compensates the Lawyer Creditors for the loss of the use of their money during that period. This result is consistent with Massachusetts precedent interpreting attorney's liens. An award of interest on an attorney's lien is intended to compensate the prevailing party for the loss of use of funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zabin v.

As Judge Young ruled, the 12 percent interest rate set forth in Mass. Gen.

The Lawyer Creditors are entitled to interest at the state law judgment rate of 12 percent accruing after the award to the effective date of confirmation. Massachusetts law is clear that 12 percent interest is to be added to arbitration awards even when the award is silent as to interest in order to encourage swift obedience to arbitration awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court exercises its well-recognized discretion to use Massachusetts law to determine the Lawyer Creditors' postpetition interest under the unique circumstances of this case where the district court has ordered pendency interest from the petition date even though the award entered two years postpetition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In accordance with the foregoing and Judge Young's mandate, the Court shall enter an order allowing the Lawyer Creditors pendency interest on their secured claims from the petition date of May 28, 2015 to January 20, 2017, the date of the arbitration award, at the rate of 4 percent. The Court shall award them interest at the rate of 12% from the date of the arbitration award to August 17, 2017, the effective date of confirmation of the Debtor's Third Amended Plan of Reorganization, which will result in a blended rate of pendency interest. That rate of interest must account for the payments of principal and interest made by the Debtor on May 24, 2017 and October 6, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The Debtor's plan was confirmed on July 17, 2017.

Thus, the plain meaning of section 506(b) mandates that an over-secured creditor's claim shall be allowed interest from the date of the petition (provided of course that the creditor is over-secured at the time of the petition).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <em>\n     In re Gianasmidis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526005\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/318/442/\">\n     318 F.Supp.3d at 451\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Section 6C provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    In all actions based on contractual obligations, upon a verdict, finding or order for judgment for pecuniary damages, interest shall be added by the clerk of the court to the amount of damages, at the contract rate, if established, or at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date of the breach or demand.
