Because the grounds for dismissal apparently cannot be cured, the tentative ruling is to dismiss the SAC without leave to amend - this Court will address that issue with the parties, and any other procedural issues such as whether to defer issuing the order implementing this Memorandum Decision, at a continued hearing on April 9, 2019 at 2:00 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The lessees of record are Western States International, Inc. (\"Western\") and Tearlach Resources California, Ltd. (\"Tearlach\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD (adv. dkt. 36), pp. 3:7-10, 4:4-14, &amp; Ex. 2 &amp; 3 (BLM Leases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It is undisputed that the BLM Leases had a ten year term, and that term has expired. Although leases can be extended by continued production (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) ), it is undisputed that production ceased long ago: the SAC concedes that on September 6, 2013 Debtor gave notice of stopping production to the BLM. SAC (adv. dkt. 30, part 1) \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Leases also can be extended in certain other circumstances, including (as discussed in later sections of this Discussion) if wells are \"\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   \" of production in paying quantities. The parties dispute whether the BLM adequately provided notice, either pre- or postpetition, that it had determined there were no such wells and that, therefore, the BLM Leases had terminated by operation of law. But, solely for purposes of the next part of the discussion (part \"a\"), this Court presumes that the BLM did not provide any effective prepetition notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    a. As a matter of law, the SAC does not establish any violation of the automatic stay, and apparently the SAC cannot be amended to do so\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The SAC fails to state a claim for violation of the automatic stay of \u00a7 362(a). Construing the SAC in the light most favorable to Debtor, it alleges that Debtor had a sufficient interest in the BLM Leases as of the Petition Date that any subsequent attempt to terminate the BLM Leases constituted (a) an \"administrative, or other action or proceeding\n   <em>\n    against the debtor\n   </em>\n   \" that could have been commenced prepetition (\u00a7 362(a)(1), emphasis added) or alternatively (b) an \"act to obtain possession of\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   of the estate or of\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   from the estate or to exercise control over\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   of the estate\" (\u00a7 362(a)(3), emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But Debtor was not named in any proceeding by BLM, so there was no action \"against the debtor\" as required by \u00a7 362(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Log\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204774347\">\n    2010 WL 4774347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Bankr.

In addition, for purposes of interpreting both \u00a7 362(a)(1) and (a)(3) this Court notes that \"property\" of the estate is very broadly defined (\u00a7 541) and generally includes the debtor's own claims against third parties.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    and see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Ryerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6560376,655023\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/739/1423/\">\n    739 F.2d 1423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1425 (9th Cir. 1984) (bankruptcy estate includes rights such as \"choses in action and claims against third parties\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Windmill Farms, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306870\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/841/1467/#p1471\">\n    841 F.2d 1467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1471-72 (9th Cir. 1988) (ability to seek relief from forfeiture belongs to bankruptcy estate).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is also true that, according to the SAC, Western had transferred an interest in the BLM Leases to Debtor pursuant to a Joint Operating Agreement (the \"Agreement\").

That assertion has been disputed extensively in this and other\n   <em>\n    fora\n   </em>\n   , but it is at least plausible that this was the intent of the parties to the Agreement. Therefore, this Court assumes for purposes of the following discussion that Debtor had a contractual basis to assert an interest in the BLM Leases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nevertheless, as the SAC concedes (adv. dkt. 30, Ex. 1, \u00b6 13), any assignment or sublease of an oil or gas lease from the BLM is \"subject to final approval by the Secretary [of the Department of the Interior, acting through the BLM].\" 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 187a ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203106.7-4\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3106.7-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    and see\n   </em>\n   MTD (adv. dkt. 36) pp.3:11-4:3 &amp; 7:17-9:22.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   MTD (adv. dkt.36) p. 1, n. 1 (regardless whether a transfer is called an assignment or a sublease, both \"require the same application and approval,\" citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203106.7-4\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3106.7-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In other words, as of the Petition Date Debtor held a claim against Western, Tearlach, and a long list of other contenders for a partial interest in the BLM Leases. But, as against the BLM, Debtor had only an\n   <em>\n    expectancy\n   </em>\n   that if it applied to be recognized as a sublessee or assignee then the BLM\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   approve that transfer and thereby give Debtor rights in the BLM Leases that the BLM would recognize. That expectancy has never been realized - it remains only a possibility, not a property interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Debtor asserts confidence, based on its past operations and past approvals by the BLM, that it would be deemed \"qualified\" and that its bond would be considered adequate. Opp. to MTD (adv. dkt. 38) p. 9:6-23. But that is still only an expectancy, not a property interest (and this Court cannot presume that the BLM could not reasonably have a different view about whether Debtor is qualified, or what the bond amount should be).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Therefore, BLM's notice to the lessees of record (Western and Tearlach) was neither a \"proceeding\n   <em>\n    against the debtor\n   </em>\n   \" (\u00a7 362(a)(1), emphasis added) nor any \"act to obtain possession of\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   of the estate or of\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   from the estate or to exercise control over\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   of the estate.\" \u00a7 362(a)(3) (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re UAL Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8965154,8970515\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/775/\">\n    412 F.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 778 &amp;\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   (7th Cir. 2005) (\"Whether or not tax benefits are 'property' under the Bankruptcy Code's capacious definition, an ESOP's sale of stock does not 'obtain possession ... or exercise control' over that interest\" within the meaning of \u00a7 362(a)(3), even though the proposed sale could have an adverse effect on the debtor's interest in loss carryforwards) (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That notice is a certified mail letter from BLM to Western and Tearlach, with a date of February 23, 2017 stamped at the top, entitled \"DECISION; Lease Terminated by Cessation of Production.\" It states that the BLM Leases are \"declared terminated, effective January 19, 2017, due to the fact that both leases are in their extended term, held by production, and are no longer capable of producing in paying quantities,\" and that there is a right to appeal \"[w]ithin 30 days of receipt of this decision.\" SAC (adv. dkt. 30 Ex. 1, part 4) Ex. 19 at PDF p. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As Debtor notes, the Second Termination Notice does not have a typewritten date but instead has the date \"23 Feb 2017\" stamped on the letter.

But the disputes about delivery of the First Termination Notice and the Second Termination Notice run through the parties' other disputes that are addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Debtor has not established that its (alleged) status as an \"operator\" gives it any\n    <em>\n     property\n    </em>\n    interest in the BLM Leases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The SAC alleges that Debtor acted as an \"operator\" of the oil and gas\n   operations, and that it was recognized as such by the BLM. Although these assertions are not without doubt, this Court accepts them as plausible for purposes of this discussion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC (adv. dkt. 30, Ex. 1) \u00b6\u00b6 19-23, 27. Based on this alleged status as an \"operator,\" the SAC apparently asserts that Debtor had not just a contractual interest in the BLM Leases but an ownership interest that the BLM should have recognized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The SAC's grounds for these assertions are as follows. SAC Exhibit 8 is an email to Debtor, not from the BLM but from the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (\"ONRR\"), which apparently is another unit within the United States Department of the Interior. That email presumably involves one of the BLM Leases. It states in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   I understand you are presently operating [a lease]....\n   <em>\n    It does not appear that you are registered\n   </em>\n   in ONRR's system so I wanted to put you in touch with [a specified person who can assist with registration]. As an operator of a Federal oil and gas lease, Riverwood has reporting requirements and other responsibilities .... Please contact [the specified person] so she can help you get set up in our system .... [SAC (adv. dkt. 30, Ex. 1, part 3), Ex. 8, at PDF p. 14 (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   SAC Exhibit 9 is an email to the specified person at ONRR with what appears to be a form to register as a \"New Operator.\" SAC Exhibits 11 and 12 are emails and printouts from a website that purportedly show that Riverwood Energy LLC (Debtor's former name) is listed as an \"Operator\" and payor by ONRR. (Capitalization altered.)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   SAC (adv. dkt. 30, Ex. 1) Ex. 17 (amendment to LLC articles to change name).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   It is unclear if ONRR's apparent recognition of Debtor as an \"operator\" is the same as recognition by the BLM. But there is some independent evidence that the BLM itself may have recognized Debtor as an \"operator,\" although that also is not entirely clear. SAC Exhibit 14 include \"Sundry Notices\" from Riverwood Energy LLC regarding several wells (presumably involving the BLM Leases) that are stamped \"Operator\" and \"accepted for the record.\" (Capitalization altered.) Those stamps might (or might not) mean that Debtor was accepted by the BLM as an \"operator.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   But the BLM points out that there are different types of \"operator,\" and only some types of operator have any interest in the underlying leases.

The SAC asserts that Debtor \"perfected its security interest\" [ownership interest?] by (allegedly) registering with the BLM as operator, and \"the BLM Leases became undisputed [sic] property of the estate ....\" SAC (adv. dkt. 30, Ex. 1) \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.

That case involved a direct review, on appeal, of an agency's acts. It did not involve bankruptcy, so there was no automatic stay that would (allegedly) interfere with any retroactive determination that the BLM Leases were no longer capable of paying production.

The SAC alleges that the BLM's own handbook H-3107-1 instructs authorized officers (\"AOs\") that they cannot terminate a lease for cessation of production or for a determination that a well is not capable of production in paying quantities without giving notice to the \"operator.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC (adv.dkt. 30, Ex. 1, part 1) \u00b6\u00b6 9-16 &amp; 69.

[SAC (adv. dkt. 30, Ex. 1, part 4) Ex. 23, at PDF p. 25 (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, this Court concludes that under the plausible allegations in the SAC Debtor\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have been an operator; the BLM\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have been required to notify Debtor before terminating the interests of Western and Tearlach (the lessees of record); and the BLM\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have failed to do so. But assuming all those things were proven, that is not enough. Any violation by the BLM of its own procedures, a rule, or a statute, does not establish any violation of the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   part \"a\" of this Discussion, above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   If the BLM violated non-bankruptcy law or rules, perhaps Western or Tearlach could seek relief from the 60-day deadline regarding non-producing wells. Perhaps Western or Tearlach could also seek relief from any deadline to appeal the BLM's decision. Debtor might even have a contractual right and obligation to do those things on behalf of Western or Tearlach. But those are all remedies that must be sought from the BLM, or from courts with jurisdiction over the BLM's decisions, not from this Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    f. Debtor has not established that it has standing to assert any lack of notice to Tearlach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The SAC appears to allege that both the First Termination Notice and the Second Termination Notice were not delivered to Tearlach at the correct address. SAC (adv. dkt. 30, Ex. 1, part 1) \u00b6\u00b6 40-42 &amp; Ex. 18-21. That appears to be true.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   But Debtor is asserting its rights through Western, not Tearlach. So Debtor has not established that it has standing to object to any failure to provide notice to Tearlach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In addition, this Court takes judicial notice that Debtor has asserted that Tearlach no longer has any interest in the BLM Leases, in other proceedings before this Court. Accordingly, Debtor has not established that any lack of proper notice to Tearlach is relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    g. The SAC does not plausibly allege a lack of proper notice from the BLM to Western\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The SAC does not allege anything about delivery of the First Termination Notice to Western. Instead it alleges that delivery of the Second Termination Notice to Western was \"defective.\" SAC (adv. dkt. 30, Ex. 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 43. But, unlike the Tearlach address, Debtor does not allege that the Western address was incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The SAC seeks to raise plausible doubts about any notice to Western on other grounds. SAC Exhibit 22 appears to be a printout from the USPS website showing that the certified mail tracking number listed for Western on the Second Termination Notice is a duplicate, so the website provides no tracking information. SAC (adv.dkt. 30, Ex. 1, part 4), Ex. 22 at PDF pp. 22-23. But the same printout states that \"more details\" are needed to provide any tracking information, and it instructs the user to \"enter send date.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202028192\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is no allegation in the SAC that Debtor attempted to enter dates at or around February 23, 2017 (the date stamped on the Second Termination Notice) or dates at or around May 11, 2017 (the date when the certified mail records for Tearlach show receipt of the notice by the post office).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC (adv.dkt. 30, Ex. 1, part 4) Ex. 20 (at PDF pp. 17-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Therefore, it is questionable whether the SAC's assertion about a \"defective\" Second Termination Notice to Western is plausible. Nevertheless, this Court recognizes that the SAC and its exhibits do raise questions about the BLM's recordkeeping and mailing - the odd use of a date stamp on the Second Termination Notice; the apparent lack of any copy of the First Termination Notice; the apparent lack of any certified mail tracking numbers for the First Termination Notice; and the apparent errors in sending both notices to Tearlach at incorrect addresses. So it is plausible that a reasonably jury (or other finder of fact)\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   find from this circumstantial evidence that the Second Termination Notice was defective as against Western.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   That still leaves the First Termination Notice. The SAC does not actually allege any lack of delivery of the prepetition First Termination Notice to Western. To the contrary, the SAC appears to concede that the First Termination Notice was sent on August 29, 2016. SAC (adv. dkt. 30, Ex. 1, part 1) \u00b6 38, at p. 10:25-27 (\"The attached BLM Case Recordation report clearly shows that on 8/29/16, BLM sent a 60-day Written Order\") &amp;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202028192\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (adv. dkt. 30, Ex. 1, part 4) Ex. 18, at PDF p. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Accordingly, the SAC fails to dispute that the BLM Leases were terminated prepetition as to Western, which is the lessee through whom Debtor asserts any interest in the BLM Leases. That undermines Debtor's ability to state any claim for a subsequent violation of the automatic stay because if the BLM Leases were already terminated then the automatic stay could not have applied to protect those leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Perhaps Debtor could amend the SAC to allege that, based on circumstantial evidence, the First Termination Notice was not properly delivered. But that any such amendment would not cure the other failures by the SAC to state a claim, as discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    5. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   This Court will issue a separate order directing Debtor to file the SAC as a separate document (if Debtor has not already done so before this Court issues such an order). This Court also anticipates issuing a separate order implementing this Memorandum Decision by granting the BLM's MTD, and dismissing the SAC. The tentative ruling, to be addressed at the hearing on April 9, 2019 at 2:00 p.m., is that such dismissal will be with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Unless the context suggests otherwise, a \"chapter\" or \"section\" (\"\u00a7\") refers to the United States Bankruptcy Code,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    et seq.

Now the same thing has happened again with the SAC.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Perhaps Debtor's failure to file the SAC stems from the following events. Debtor and the BLM stipulated (adv. dkt. 30, the \"Stipulation\") that Debtor would \"have leave to\n    <em>\n     file\n    </em>\n    its [SAC]\" (emphasis added) and this Court's order (adv. dkt. 33) (a) approved that stipulation and (b) provided that, once the SAC was filed, it would relate back by being \"\n    <em>\n     deemed\n    </em>\n    \" filed as of the date of the filing of the Stipulation (emphasis added). Debtor might have misconstrued the latter provision as meaning that the SAC was \"deemed\" to be filed without actually being filed at all, which is incorrect. In any event, whatever the source of Debtor's confusion, it has failed to file the SAC and will be directed to do so by separate order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Debtor executed its Agreement with Western under its former name, Riverwood Energy LLC.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SAC (adv. dkt. 30, Ex. 1) Ex. 17 (amendment to LLC articles to change name).
