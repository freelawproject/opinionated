The present issues are due to environmental contamination resulting from the operation of Exide's lead-recycling facility in Vernon, California (the \"Vernon Facility\"). On June 10, 2013, Exide filed for bankruptcy in Delaware under chapter 11 (the \"Petition Date\"). On September 13, 2013, I entered an order setting December 9, 2013 as the bar date and applicable deadline for governmental units to file proofs of claims (the \"Bar Date\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 9, 2013, the District filed a proof of claim, alleging $ 38,915,000 in liquidated fines and penalties related to the Vernon Facility (the \"Original Proof of Claim\"). The Original Proof of Claim listed five\n   specific prepetition notices of violation (\"NOVs\") as the foundation for the alleged sum. The NOVs are alleged, in short, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 Failure to file two reports - One NOV alleging that Exide failed to submit its second 2011 semi-annual monitoring report and its 2011 annual compliance certification by applicable deadlines ($ 4,320,000)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 13-day emission exceedances - One NOV alleging that from Oct. 29 to Nov. 11, 2012, Exide exceeded the 30-day average lead emission standard of 0.15 micrograms/cm\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   at the MID monitor - one of the five air monitors at the Vernon Facility ($ 325,000)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 1-day emission exceedance-One NOV alleging that on June 14, 2012, Exide exceeded the standard by 0.003 micrograms/cm\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   ($ 25,000), did not thereafter begin daily air monitoring ($ 30,000), and failed to implement its compliance plan as a result of exceedance ($ 40,000)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Continuous negative pressure - Two NOVs alleging that Exide did not implement \"good operating practices\" because it did not maintain continuous negative pressure at the Vernon Facility ($ 34,175,000).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 16, 2014, the District filed a complaint for civil penalties against Exide in the Superior Court of the State of California, Los Angeles County, captioned,\n   <em>\n    People of the State of California, ex rel South Coast Air Quality Management District, a Public Entity v. Exide Technologies, Inc.\n   </em>\n   (respectively, the \"Original Complaint\" and the \"California State Action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Original Complaint asserts twelve causes of action and alleges entitlement to civil penalties of no less than $ 40,000,000. Upon receiving notice of the filing, counsel for Exide sent the following letter to counsel for the District:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Exide is in receipt of the complaint filed by the [District] in the Superior Court of the State of California against Exide seeking civil penalties for the sum of no less than $ 40 million in connection with Exide's Vernon secondary lead recycling facility... As you are aware, Exide filed for chapter 11 protection on June 10, 2013 and is currently a debtor-in-possession in that proceeding (the \"Bankruptcy Case\"). Filing of the Bankruptcy Case resulted in the imposition of an automatic stay pursuant to the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Complaint involves alleged penalties\n   <em>\n    virtually mirroring\n   </em>\n   those in the proof of claim filed in the Bankruptcy Case by [the District] and is clearly an attempt to collect from Exide. Thus, the Complaint and the Litigation violate the automatic stay. To avoid unnecessary expense in connection with this violation, Exide will consider entering into a stipulation permitting the Litigation to proceed provided that [the District] agrees that it will not seek to collect any awards that may be assessed in the Litigation absent further order of the bankruptcy court....\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After rounds of drafting and markups, the parties agreed to a stipulation allowing the District to move forward with the California State Action, which was approved by order dated March 6, 2014 (the \"Stipulation Order\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Prior to the Stipulation Order, on February 14, 2014, Exide had removed the California State Action to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Shortly thereafter, on March 14, 2014, the District filed a motion to remand the case to the Superior Court of the State of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, due to lack of diversity of citizenship (the \"District Remand Motion\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Underpinning the District's argument for remand was the contention that the penalties sought are, by their character, \"quasi-criminal,\" rather than \"civil\" penalties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the District noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The civil penalties sought here are... unique and substantial to California because they are quasi-criminal and can preclude California from bringing a criminal prosecution. Criminal prosecutions based on violations of California law can give California unique and substantial relief that is not available to the general public, namely, incarceration and criminal penalties. When the California Legislature decides that California's interest will be protected by allowing civil penalties to substitute for incarceration and criminal penalties, that judgment should be respected, and should be recognized to constitute unique and substantial relief. The statutory language regarding the interplay between civil penalties and criminal prosecution compels the conclusion that the California Legislature intended that either could vindicate California's interest in air pollution matters. Indeed, the Health and Safety Code explicitly requires that the same eight factors be used to determine civil penalties or criminal penalties, which shows that they are intended to vindicate the same interest....\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Persuaded by the District's arguments, the Court granted the District Remand Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 14, 2014, the same date as the filing of the District Remand Motion, Exide's Vernon Facility shut down for repairs and subsequently permanently ceased operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 7, 2014, the District filed an amended complaint in the California State Action (the \"First Amended Complaint\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The First Amended Complaint asserts sixteen causes of action and alleges entitlement to no less than $ 40,000,000 in civil penalties. Exide stipulated to the District's filing of the First Amended Complaint, but included the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Exide denies the allegations of the proposed First Amended Complaint, but recognizes the standard for granting leave to amend a complaint and its ability to challenge the First Amended Complaint subsequently in this litigation... the Parties agree that allowing Plaintiff to file the First Amended Complaint is not an admission by Exide of any allegation contained in the First Amended Complaint and that Exide reserves the\n   right to challenge the First Amended Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Shortly thereafter, on August 22, 2014, the District filed an amended proof of claim with the Court, which changed the District's claim from \"liquidated\" to \"unliquidated\" and incorporated by reference the First Amended Complaint (the \"Amended Proof of Claim\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 5, 2015, Exide filed its second amended disclosure statement with respect to its second plan of reorganization (the \"Disclosure Statement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 18, 2015, the District filed its second amended complaint in the California State Action (the \"Second Amended Complaint\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Second Amended Complaint asserts twenty causes of action and alleges entitlement to no less than $ 60,000,000 in civil penalties. Exide stipulated to the Districts filing of the Second Amended Complaint, including identical language to that contained in the stipulation to the First Amended Complaint's filing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 11, 2015, Exide entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United States' Attorney's Office (the \"NPA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the NPA, Exide admitted to knowingly violating, among others, numerous provisions under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Act and agreed to immediately and permanently close the Vernon Facility and work with the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (the \"DTSC\") to remediate the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, under the NPA, Exide agreed to the following costs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The direct costs of Exide's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement are estimated by the parties to be between approximately $ 108,000,000 and approximately $ 133,000,000. Facility closure and clean-up costs, including contamination in the Northern and Southern Residential Assessment Areas, is presently estimated to be approximately $ 50,000,000. Recycling of lead-acid batteries at the Facility generates cost savings for Exide for the raw goods that it uses to manufacture lead-acid batteries (for sale to retail consumers), including metallic lead and plastic needed to mold battery cases. The parties estimate that closure of the Facility will cost Exide between $ 15,000,000 and $ 38,000,000 on an annualized basis for the cost of metallic lead and case plastic that must otherwise be purchased from other market sources. Exide also acknowledges that it has invested approximately $ 35,000,000 since 2010, to upgrade and improve pollution control technology at the Facility. As a result of this Agreement, Exide must demolish and deconstruct such upgrades as part of its permanent closure of the Facility. In addition, Exide acknowledges that compliance with this Agreement will cost an additional $ 8,000,000 to $ 10,000,000 for other Facility closure related costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I approved the NPA on March 27, 2015 and entered a corresponding order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I confirmed Exide's fourth plan of reorganization (the \"Plan\") on March 27, 2015 (the \"Confirmation Order\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Confirmation Order established that the administrative bar date would be 30-days after the Plan's effective date. The Plan incorporated the following two provisions regarding the filing of and amendments to proofs of claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Article 10.4: EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE AGREED, ANY AND ALL PROOFS OF CLAIM FILED AFTER THE APPLICABLE DEADLINE FOR FILING SUCH PROOFS OF CLAIM SHALL BE DEEMED DISALLOWED AND EXPUNGED AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER NOTICE TO, OR ACTION, ORDER, OR APPROVAL OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT, AND HOLDERS OF SUCH CLAIMS MAY NOT RECEIVE ANY DISTRIBUTIONS ON ACCOUNT OF SUCH CLAIMS, UNLESS SUCH LATE PROOF OF CLAIM IS DEEMED TIMELY FILED BY A FINAL ORDER OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Nothing herein shall in any way alter, impair, or abridge the legal effect of the Bar Date Order....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Article 10.7: On or after the Effective Date, except as otherwise provided herein, a Claim may not be filed or amended without the authorization of the Bankruptcy Court or the Reorganized Debtor, and, to the extent such authorization is not received, any such new or amended Claim filed shall be deemed Disallowed in full and expunged without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court....\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Exide substantially consummated the Plan on April 30, 2015 (the \"Effective Date\") and emerged from bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 28, 2015, the District filed the third amended complaint in the California State Action (the \"Third Amended Complaint\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Third Amended Complaint contains 27 causes of action and alleges entitlement to no less than $ 80,000,000 in civil penalties. The Third Amended Complaint is the first iteration of the complaints that asserts causes of action regarding Exide's alleged misrepresentations and manipulation of emission testing data; the District bases these causes of action upon information uncovered in Exide's admissions of guilt under the NPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two days later, on May 30, 2015, the District timely filed an administrative expense claim in connection with the underlying civil penalties alleged in the evolving complaint (the \"Administrative Expense Claim\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Up until this point, Exide had stipulated to each of the District's complaint amendments, save for the reservation of rights contained in each. However, on June 3, 2015, Exide filed its motion for entry of an order (i) enforcing the plan injunction under the Confirmation Order and confirmed Plan and (ii) awarding costs and attorney's fees (the \"Motion to Enforce\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   After several related rounds of filings with the Court, on June 23, 2015, I entered an order resolving the Motion to Enforce, which consolidated the Discharge Motion, the Administrative Claims Objection, and the Relation Back Motion into one matter before the Court (the \"Resolved Motion to\n   Enforce\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of the Resolved Motion to Enforce, the parties agreed to stay the California State Action, pending this Court's disposition of the underlying legal issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the time between the entrance of the Resolved Motion to Enforce and now, the parties attempted to mediate through these legal issues, but, regrettably, were unsuccessful. Accordingly, the Court held oral arguments, and I subsequently took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Section 1141(d)(6) does not apply to the District's Penalties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the forefront is the District's contention that the penalties asserted in each iteration of the Complaint should be excepted from discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(6), which provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (6) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the confirmation of a plan does not discharge a debtor that is a corporation from any debt -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (A) of a kind specified in paragraph (2)(A) or (2)(B) of section 523(a) that is owed to a domestic governmental unit, or owed to a person as a result of an action filed under subchapter III of chapter 37 of title 31 or any similar State statute;....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The District argues that, based upon Exide's alleged misrepresentations, fraud, and fraud-like activities, Exide incurred penalties, constituting a \"debt\" under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). Therefore, the District asserts that, through the application of \u00a7 1141(d)(6), which applies to corporate debtors, its claim for penalties should be excepted from Exide's discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The District's argument fails because: (1) the District's claim falls within\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7), which is not excepted from a chapter 11 corporation's discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(6) ; and (2) the discharge exception for claims arising from fraud under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) is not applicable to the District's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The corporate discharge exceptions of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(6) does not include noncompensatory penalties that fall within\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(7).\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The District seeks to collect noncompensatory penalties for violations of its regulations.

Accordingly, Congress secured a broader discharge for debtors under Chapter 13 than Chapter 7 by extending to Chapter 13 proceedings some, but not all, of \u00a7 523(a)'s exceptions to discharge. See 5 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1328.01[l][c] (15th ed. 1986) (\"[T]he dischargeability of debts in chapter 13 that are not dischargeable in chapter 7 represents a policy judgment that [it] is preferable for debtors to attempt to pay such debts to the best of their abilities over three years rather than for those debtors to have those debts hanging over their heads indefinitely, perhaps for the rest of their lives\") (footnote omitted). Among those exceptions that Congress chose\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to extend to Chapter 13 proceedings is \u00a7 523(a)(7)'s exception for debts arising from a \"fine, penalty, or forfeiture.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Similarly, \u00a7 1141(d)(2) and (6) demonstrate Congress's intent to distinguish between individual debtors and corporate debtors when applying the \u00a7 523(a) exceptions to discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The District claims that, notwithstanding \u00a7 523(a)(7), its claims are excepted from discharge through \u00a7 1141 (d)(6)'s incorporation of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), which renders fraud-based claims nondischargeable. Exide argues that stretching \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) to include noncompensatory penalties and fines would cause \u00a7 523(a)(7) to be \"mere surplusage,\" contrary to the Supreme Court's \"deep reluctance to interpret a statutory provision so as to render superfluous other provisions in the same enactment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The District, however, argues that a more recent Supreme Court decision,\n   <em>\n    Husky International Electronics, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that \"[t]he term 'actual fraud' in \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) also encompasses forms of fraud, like fraudulent conveyance schemes, that can be effected without a false representation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   Court agreed that its inclusion of fraudulent conveyances in the term \"actual fraud\" of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) could cover the same conduct that exempts debts from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(4) or \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   Court noted that, despite some overlap, each subsection also covered distinctive types of claims, and therefore, \"given the clear differences between these provisions, we see no reason to craft an artificial definition of 'actual fraud' merely to avoid narrow redundancies in \u00a7 523 that appear unavoidable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether the District's claim could be exempted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) requires a separate analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The District's Claim does not fall within\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2)(A)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The District's Complaint alleges that the Debtors knowingly, willfully or intentionally emitted lead and arsenic in excess of permissible levels.

I agree with Exide that this matter is similar to the\n   <em>\n    Sabban\n   </em>\n   case.

Exide, however, directs the Court to the District Remand Motion and the District Remand Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   To support its efforts for remand of the California State Action, the District emphasized the criminal or \"quasi-criminal\" nature of its penalties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, the District succeeded in securing a remand by persuading the federal court that, while the District's penalties are nominally civil, they fulfill the same functions as a criminal enforcement action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Now, as Exide points out, the District has changed course and characterizes to its penalties as \"civil.\" Accordingly, Exide argues that judicial estoppel should apply and bar the District from recharacterizing the nature of its claims. Judicial estoppel applies when: (1) a party adopts a position clearly inconsistent with an earlier position; and (2) the party had succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create \"the\n   perception that either the first or the second court was misled.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   At oral argument, counsel for the District argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   There's a large difference between referring to something as quasi-criminal and criminal... if we had on the stand the other side's expert and they called him an expert and I called him a quasi-expert, I think no one in the world would fail to grasp the distinction there...

Those are both fair characterizations of civil penalties, but it doesn't make them into criminal-a judgment of criminal conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Counsel for Exide also referred back to the language of the District Remand Motion, which argued, in part, for the federal court's acceptance of the \"criminal\" or \"quasi-criminal\" nature of the District's penalties because the \"Health and Safety Code explicitly requires the same eight factors be used to determine civil penalties or criminal penalties, which shows that they are intended to vindicate the same interest....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Based upon the evidence in this record, I conclude that judicial estoppel applies and bars the District from now asserting its penalties are \"civil\" in nature, as opposed to either \"criminal\" or \"quasi-criminal.\" Accordingly, under the Third Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Tri-State\n   </em>\n   , the District's penalties are not entitled to administrative expense priority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Regardless of Whether the District's Penalties are Civil or Criminal, Third Circuit Law and Public Policy do not Support Administrative Expense Priority\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The District asks this Court to follow the Eleventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    N.P.

It is neither reasonable nor necessary for a commercial enterprise to violate criminal laws and endanger the public to preserve the estate or to conduct legitimate business operations, and we refuse the DER's invitation to hold otherwise. Rather, we believe Congress intended only for those 'actual necessary costs and expenses' that arise in the context of, or compensate for, legitimate business activity, or the losses resulting therefrom, to be treated as expenses of preserving the state, and accorded priority as an administrative expense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    N.P.

Rather, as stated above, Exide agreed to and has already spent tens of millions of dollars in an effort to demolish the Vernon Facility and remediate the property and surrounding neighborhood. Accordingly, Exide rightfully argues that\n   <em>\n    Conroy\n   </em>\n   is the quintessential example of Third Circuit law that reimbursement of actual costs to preserve the estate is an essential element for an administrative expense claim,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Tri-State\n   </em>\n   explains that administrative expense priority for noncompensatory fines is \"as unfair as it is impractical,\" since payment of the penalties does not compensate for any damages resulting from Exide's conduct; instead it merely takes money from the pockets of Exide's innocent and actually-harmed creditors rather than the alleged wrongdoer, Exide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Finally, denying administrative expense priority status to the District's penalty claims does not give Exide a financial incentive to violate emission standards. As a consideration for entering into the NPA, Exide was required to undertake closure and remediation projects with the DTSC, which is projected to cost Exide between $ 108,000,000 and $ 133,000,000 in direct expenses and lost revenue. Without analyzing whether these projected costs are sufficient to compensate for environmental damages, Exide certainly did not escape significant cost burdens through the bankruptcy process, nor will it thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The District's formulaic penalties do not serve to abate any identified environmental hazard, nor do they provide a benefit to the estate by bringing the property into compliance with public safety laws. Accordingly, whether the penalties are criminal or civil, they are not compensatory and, therefore, are not entitled to administrative expense priority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Violations Consisting of Postpetition Continuations of Prepetition Conduct are Not Afforded Administrative Expense Priority.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    N.P.

Further, the Vernon Facility ceased operations on March 14, 2014.

Certain allegations in the Original Complaint mirrored the allegations in the Original Proof of Claim (including a recitation of the five NOVs).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   (iii) On March 6, 2014, this Court entered a Stipulation and Agreed Order resolving the dispute between Exide and the District about the applicability of the automatic stay to the Original Complaint and permitted the District to proceed with the California State Court Action, \"provided, however, the District shall not seek to collect any money judgment entered in the Lawsuit absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   (iv) On August 7, 2014, the District filed the First Amended Complaint in the California State Court Action. Exide stipulated to allow the District to file the First Amended Complaint, but with an express reservation of rights to challenge the First Amended Complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   (v) On August 22, 2014 (nine months after the Bar Date), the District filed a purported \"amended\" proof of claim, which changed the amount of the Original Proof of Claim to an unliquidated amount and incorporated the claims asserted in the Original Complaint\n   and the First Amended Complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   (vi) On February 5, 2015, the Debtor filed the Second Amended Disclosure Statement with Respect to the Second Amended Plan of Reorganization of Exide Technologies (D.I. 3095), which this Court approved (D.I. 3092).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   (vii) On February 18, 2015, the District filed the Second Amended Complaint in the California State Court Action. Again, rather than require the District to proceed with a motion to leave to amend, Exide stipulated to allow the District to file the Second Amended Complaint but with an express reservation of rights to challenge the Second Amended Complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   (viii) On March 11, 2015, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California and Exide entered into the NPA, which was approved by this Court on March 27, 2015 (D.I. 3417).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   (ix) On March 27, 2015, this Court entered the Order confirming the Plan,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   (x) On April 30, 2015, the Debtor substantially consummated the Plan (the \"Plan Effective Date\") and emerged from chapter 11 as a newly reorganized company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   (xi) On May 28, 2015, the District filed the Third Amended Complaint for Civil Penalties and Injunctive Relief in the California State Court Action (the \"Third Amended Complaint\"), which asserts twenty-seven causes of action (as compared to twelve causes of action in the Original Complaint), and asked for penalties of not less than $ 80 million (as compared with not less than $ 40 million of penalties in the Original Complaint and the amount of $ 38,915,000 in the Original Proof of Claim).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   (xii) On June 15, 2015, the Reorganized Debtor filed a motion to enforce the plan injunction against the District, which was resolved by the Court entering an Order dated July 23, 2015, scheduling the filing of the motions discussed in this Opinion, including the Relation Back Motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The confirmed Plan provides that all proofs of claim filed after the applicable bar date are deemed disallowed and expunged as of the Effective Date, unless the late proof of claim was deemed timely filed by a final order the Bankruptcy Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   The confirmed Plan also provides that filing new claims or amending claims without authorization of the Bankruptcy Court or the Reorganized Debtor are also deemed disallowed and expunged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The District's Relation Back Motion asks this Court to determine that the District may pursue all prepetition claims asserted against Exide in the Third Amended Complaint. The District argues that its later filings amended the \"Original Allegations\" that were set forth in the Original Proof of Claim and the Original Complaint. However, only the Original Proof of Claim was filed prior to the bar date. I do not agree that Exide's stipulation to allow the litigation to proceed in state court equates to an agreement to amend the Original Claim with the Original Complaint. From the start, Exide objected to the District's pursuit of its claim in state court as a violation of the automatic stay, and agreed\n   to allow the litigation to proceed only as long as it was agreed that the District could not seek to collect any judgment entered in the lawsuit without seeking further order of the Bankruptcy Court. The facts indicate that Exide always intended that any further recovery would be subject to scrutiny by the bankruptcy court about whether any new claims should be allowed after the bar date. To be successful, the District must show that all of its claims in the Third Amended Complaint relate back to the Original Proof of Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The District's Relation Back Motion is based on Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   (1) An amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   (B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out - - or attempted to be set out - - in the original pleading.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \"[T]he decision to allow amendments to a proof of claim is within the discretion of the Bankruptcy Court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"An amendment to claim filed post bar date must be scrutinized to assure that it is not an attempt to file a new claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has determined that amendments to proofs of claim should be allowed when \"the purpose is to cure defects in a claim as originally filed, to describe a claim with greater particularity, or to plead new theories of recovery on facts set forth in the original claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 15(c)(1)(B) requires the amendment to relate back to the same \"conduct, transaction or occurrence\" asserted in the original pleading.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The touchstone for relation back is fair notice because Rule 15(c) is premised on the theory that 'a party who has been notified of litigation concerning a particular occurrence has been given all the notice that statutes of limitations were intended to provide.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The District argues that the common core of operative facts in its pleadings is the relation to \"Exide's unlawful release of lead and arsenic into the air during the course of its battery-recycling operations\n   in Vernon, California.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District relies, in part, upon a comparison between the case at hand and the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Miller v. American Heavy Lift\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shipping\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , a group of sailors filed complaints against the defendants, alleging damages for injuries caused by exposure to \"asbestos and hazardous substances other than asbestos.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   The representative for the plaintiffs' estates later amended the respective complaints, alleging that the decedents had suffered from leukemia as a result of exposure to benzene and benzene-containing products. Reversing the lower court, the Sixth Circuit held that the amended complaints' operative facts related back to the original pleading because the amended allegations \"fit comfortably within the claims of exposure to 'hazardous substances' that [were] alleged in the original pleading\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"[t]he original complaints in this case made clear that the deceased seamen had suffered latent injuries, based upon exposure to toxic substances on board Shippers' vessels, that resulted in their illnesses and eventual deaths.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the District analogizes the present circumstance to\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and argues that the operative facts - - lead and arsenic emissions at the Vernon Facility - - have remained steady.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Countering this assertion, Exide argues that the allegations contained in the Amended Proof of Claim are too distinct from those contained in the Original Proof of Claim's NOVs to allow any relation back. In support, Exide cites numerous cases that illustrate ways in which courts have denied relation back under Rule 15 when an amendment differs in time and type from the original.\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n   Particularly, Exide relies upon the Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Unroe\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Unroe\n   </em>\n   , the IRS timely filed a priority claim for 1982 taxes, and then, after the bar date, the IRS filed a second claim, which it styled as an \"amendment,\" asserting a priority claim for 1983 taxes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Seventh Circuit determined that the District Court erred in finding the requisite nexus between the 1982 and 1983 claims to allow relation back under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c), writing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   The IRS's position would permit the Service to file a claim for one tax year, and then, after the bar date, \"amend\" by right the claim to include any number of additional tax years. This would defeat the bankruptcy law's purpose of affording\n   the debtor, trustee and court timely notice of claims. Separate years imply separate tax claims under Bankr. R. 7015. Examples of amendments permitted under Bankr. R. 7015 would include correcting the amount of tax, penalties or interest claimed in a timely filed claim. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c) therefore does not rescue the tardy 1983 claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Ultimately, however, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the district court judge did not abuse his discretion in identifying factors that tilted the equitable balance in the IRS's favor and allowed the late filed claim, including the fact that the chapter 13 debtor originally included payment of the 1983 taxes in her plan in an amount that was greater than the IRS's late claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Although the relation back standards of Rule 15 are applicable when considering whether to allow the amendment of claim after the bar date, the analysis must be done in the context of the bankruptcy case. \"A creditor may not use the claims amendment process to circumvent the claims bar date.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    98\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The bar date is important to the administration of the case as it brings certainty to a debtor's case by enabling the debtor and its creditors to know the amount of claims which exist.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    99\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A bar date can be thought of as akin to a statute of limitations and must be followed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n   The importance of the bar date has been explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   The practical, commercial rationale underlying the need for a bar date are [sic] manifest. The creditors and bankruptcy court must be able to rely on a fixed financial position of the debtor in order to intelligently evaluate the proposed plan of reorganization for plan approval or amendment purpose. After initiating a carefully orchestrated plan of reorganization, the untimely interjection of an unanticipated claim, particularly a relatively large one, can destroy the fragile balance struck by all the interested parties in the plan. Given the time sensitivity of such financial undertakings, the consequent delay in reevaluation necessitated by the late allowance of the claim may often spell disaster to recovery, even where ultimate approval is forthcoming. These considerations and realities militate in favor of restraint and caution in allowing untimely claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Exide makes a strong public policy argument for the Court to be conscious of this issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Permitting untimely claims - especially under the district's interpretation, which arguably would permit it to continue to amend the state court complaint to assert increasing amounts and additional causes of action\n   <em>\n    ad infinitum\n   </em>\n   - would eviscerate the economic basis on which the Plan was negotiated and prejudice the Debtor's estate and its creditors....\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In this case, not only were most of the District's claims filed after the bar date, but the new claims in the Third Amended Complaint were filed after the Effective Date of the Plan, \"While it is not\n   impossible to amend a claim after a plan of [re]organization has been confirmed and rendered effective, a party must generally show good cause to do so.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other courts have determined \"\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   precludes post-confirmation amendments absent some 'compelling reason.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Exide argues that the District's \"new claims\" asserted after the Original Proof of Claim can be grouped into three categories: (i) new claims based on the NPA, (ii) new violations alleging attempts by Exide to conceal its emission levels from the District or other deceptive and dishonest conduct; and (iii) new violations that occurred on different dates or are based on different regulatory requirements than those included in the Original Proof of Claim. The Original Proof of Claim does not forewarn of potential future claims based on violations of different regulations or based on an expanded timeframe. It is not enough to link the District's new claims generally to \"Exide's unlawful release of two toxins.\" The circumstances of this case do not support a determination that the District's new claims arise out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as listed in the Original Proof of Claim, which was limited and specific.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Further, the damages asserted in the District's Third Amended Complaint more than double the amount in the Original Proof of Claim - - from $ 38 million to $ 80 million, plus unliquidated amounts. The District is not asserting increased damages based on the five specific NOVs in the Original Proof of Claim. There are new violations and claims for allegedly fraudulent behavior. There is nothing to indicate that Exide or its creditors had any reason to believe that the District's claim would increase by more than $ 40 million dollars after the bar date, much less after Plan confirmation and the effective date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Finally, the record before me does not establish any compelling reason so allow such drastic amendment after the confirmation and effective date of the Plan. The Bankruptcy Court should not be a haven for those who violate environmental laws and harm the community. However, the claims asserted in the District's Third Amended Complaint are largely noncompensatory penalties. Payment of penalties does not clean up property or otherwise benefit the community or the bankruptcy estate. Many of the District's new claims were made after Exide entered into the Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United States' Attorney's Office, in which Exide admitted to violating environmental laws and agreed to immediately and permanently close the Vernon Facility and work with the California Department of Toxic Substances Control to remediate the property. Neither Exide nor its creditors should be penalized for entering into that agreement,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the District's claims that were asserted post-bar date, post-Plan confirmation,\n   and post- Effective Date should not relate back to and amend the Original Proof of Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Discharge Motion will be denied; the Administrative Claims Objection will be sustained; and the Relation Back Motion will be denied.
