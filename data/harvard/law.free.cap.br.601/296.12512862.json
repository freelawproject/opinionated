Hoffman, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Jessica Venincasa commenced this case by filing a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on May 24, 2018. Thereafter, Lawson &amp; Weitzen, LLP (\"L &amp; W\") filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay pursuant to Code \u00a7 362(d) and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4001(a). L &amp; W, a law firm, sought relief for the sole purpose of releasing to itself funds of Ms. Venincasa's being held by L &amp; W in its clients' trust account (IOLTA account).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Joseph G. Butler, the chapter 7 trustee in this case, and Stewart Title Guaranty Co., Inc. (\"Stewart\"), a creditor, objected. At issue is whether L &amp; W enjoys an attorney's possessory or retaining lien in the funds it is holding in clients' trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts needed to decide this controversy are not in dispute. In October of 2009, pursuant to a written contingent fee agreement, L &amp; W undertook the representation of Ms. Venincasa with respect to her claims against certain family members\n   and affiliated business entities. L &amp; W was to be paid a fixed legal fee of one-third of any recovery by Ms. Venincasa on her claims, plus expenses. Litigation ensued in the Suffolk County Massachusetts Superior Court (the \"Family Litigation\") and in 2012, Ms. Venincasa and several defendants entered into a partial settlement agreement whereby Ms. Venincasa would receive $ 312,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before payment of the settlement proceeds could be effectuated, one of Ms. Venincasa's judgment creditors, Developers Surety and Indemnity Company, got wind of the deal and demanded that L &amp; W pay it the money. L &amp; W demurred, informing Developers that the settlement proceeds were subject to L &amp; W's attorney's lien, which was superior to Developers' claim. After some back and forth, L &amp; W agreed that when the money came in, L &amp; W would place it in escrow until the matter could be sorted out. L &amp; W subsequently deposited the settlement proceeds in its IOLTA account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July, 2012, without objection by Developers, L &amp; W released to itself $ 131,630.75 from the escrowed settlement proceeds-its one-third contingent fee of $ 104,166.67 plus expenses of $ 27,464.08. The $ 180,869.25 balance of the settlement proceeds remains in L &amp; W's IOLTA account and is the subject of L &amp; W's stay relief motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 23, 2017, in an action in the Worcester County Massachusetts Superior Court, Stewart obtained a permanent injunction against Ms. Venincasa enjoining her from \"transferring, encumbering, assigning, or otherwise disposing of her right to funds from or her interest in\" the Family Litigation or the Worcester Superior Court action to anyone other than Stewart.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to representing her on a contingent fee basis in the Family Litigation, L &amp; W performed legal services for Ms. Venincasa for which it charged her by the hour. L &amp; W billed Ms. Venincasa a total of $ 124,913.84 for these services. Ms. Venincasa never paid her bill but does not dispute it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   L &amp; W now wants to get paid. It seeks relief from the automatic stay pursuant to Code \u00a7 362(d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   so that it may release to itself $ 124,913.84 from the $ 180,869.25 in settlement funds remaining in its IOLTA account. L &amp; W asserts an attorney's possessory or retaining lien over the escrow funds to secure payment of Ms. Venincasa's unpaid legal fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The chapter 7 trustee and Stewart oppose the granting of stay relief to L &amp; W.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trustee and Stewart argue that the only attorney's lien available to L &amp; W was\n   the lien for its one-third contingent fee plus expenses, and that claim has been paid in full. L &amp; W, they maintain, is now just another general unsecured creditor of Ms. Venincasa's in this bankruptcy case and must wait in line with all her other general unsecured creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To properly evaluate the parties' positions, a brief overview of the nature of attorneys' liens will be helpful. Attorneys' liens generally divide into two classes: (1) general, possessory, or retaining liens; and (2) charging or special liens. L.S.

Justice Benjamin Cardozo, during his time on the New York Court of Appeals, illustrated in typically vivid language the two categories of attorneys' liens:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   There was a retaining lien on all papers, securities or moneys belonging to his client which came into his possession in the course of his professional employment ... This was a general lien for the entire balance of account. It was dependent, however, upon possession. There was also a charging lien, which bound a judgment recovered through the attorney's efforts. This lien was not dependent on possession. The very reason for its existence was to save the attorney's rights where he had been unable to get possession. It was a device invented by the courts for the protection of attorneys against the knavery of their clients, by disabling clients from receiving the fruits of recoveries without paying for the valuable services by which the recoveries were obtained ... But the reason for the existence of this lien suggests the limitation of its scope. It was not a lien for a general balance of account. It was a lien for the value of the services rendered in that very action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Matter of Heinsheimer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72284\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/214/361/#p364\">\n    214 N.Y. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20N.E.%20636\">\n    108 N.E. 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.Y. 1915) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Massachusetts law expressly authorizes an attorney's charging lien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20221%2C%20%C2%A7%2050\">\n    Mass.

In\n   <em>\n    Webber\n   </em>\n   , the SJC upheld a lower court's finding that regardless of whether an attorney had any right under the Massachusetts charging lien statute, the attorney had not acted \"unreasonably, maliciously, and without right\" in retaining a lodging house license he secured for his client. This finding, argues L &amp; W, suggests that an attorney may claim a possessory lien in Massachusetts. L &amp; W also invokes Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 255 \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 33, related to the dissolution of liens\n   on personalty, including those \"by attorneys at law upon books, papers, documents or other personal property\" as indirect proof that such liens may be available in Massachusetts. In addition, though not cited by L &amp; W, two decisions by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts suggest that Massachusetts courts might recognize attorneys' possessory or retaining liens under the right circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

That is because even if Massachusetts law were to recognize such liens, L &amp; W would not hold one on the settlement funds. In\n   <em>\n    Torphy v.

The Court focused on the fact that the stock certificates and bank books, though received by the attorney from his client \"in the course of their professional relationship,\" were to be held not by the attorney alone but \"for a special purpose which was inconsistent with the petitioner's claim of lien: a neutral depository to which neither counsel had exclusive access pending further order of the court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=257%20N.E.2d%20435\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   This is not an uncommon type of arrangement, partaking of the nature of a trusteeship, when the right to intangibles is disputed by parties.

Regardless of whether an attorney may claim a possessory or retaining lien in Massachusetts, the facts here are insufficient for a finding that L &amp; W possesses such a lien over any portion of the remainder of the settlement funds. Just as the petitioning attorney in\n   <em>\n    Torphy\n   </em>\n   placed the stock certificates and bank books in escrow in a safe deposit box pending final adjudication of the parties' rights, L &amp; W escrowed the settlement funds in its IOLTA account pending resolution of the competing claims to the funds.
