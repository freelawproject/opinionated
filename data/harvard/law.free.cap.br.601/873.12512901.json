Brown, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  The U.S. District Court remanded this matter for this Court to redetermine the amount of sanctions to be imposed on PHH Corporation (\"PHH\") for its violations of Bankruptcy Rule 3002.1 and Debtor Current Orders, with a focus on the scope of this Court's statutory and inherent authority to impose punitive sanctions. This Court has fulfilled that remand, based on the caselaw to which the District Court pointed, and a recent Supreme Court decision that affirmed the authority of bankruptcy courts to impose sanctions.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   Taggart v.

JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over these contested matters pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1334, and the Amended Order of Reference entered on June 22, 2012. The Court declares the issues raised in the contested matter in each of these cases, and on remand, to be core proceedings, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A), (B) and (O), over which this Court has constitutional authority to enter a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND DIRECTION FROM THE DISTRICT COURT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 12, 2016, this Court entered an Order granting the Trustee's motions to sanction PHH, disallowing PHH's post-petition charges, and directing PHH to pay sanctions of $275,000, $175,000 and $25,000, respectively, in the Gravel, Beaulieu, and Knisley cases, to Legal Services Law Line of Vermont (Gravel, docs. ## 82, 83; Beaulieu, docs. ## 99, 100;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Knisley, docs. ## 55, 56) (the \"Sanctions Decision\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 21, 2016, PHH filed a notice of appeal (doc. # 87). On December 18, 2017, the U.S. District Court (Crawford, J.) issued its decision vacating this Court's decision and remanding the matter to this Court (doc. # 104, the \"Remand Decision\"). Thereafter, the Debtors and Trustee filed an appeal of the District Court's Remand Decision, in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. That Court dismissed the appeal, finding the Remand Decision was not a final order (doc. # 109). Thus, this matter was once again before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the Remand Decision, the District Court observes that \"[t]he basis for the sanctions was the admitted violation of Bankruptcy Rule 3002.1\" (doc. # 104, p. 1), and PHH's violation of Debtor Current Orders in two of the three cases (doc. # 104, pp. 4, 5). The District Court described the scope of the appeal as limited: PHH's challenge to this Court's imposition of sanctions (in the amount of $225,000 in the Gravel case, $125,000 in the Beaulieu case, and $25,000 in the Knisley case\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). The District Court remanded the matter with instructions that this Court reconsider the amount of sanctions, focusing on this Court's authority to only impose sanctions that are \"short of punitive sanctions of the scope and type [this Court previously] imposed in these cases\" (doc. # 104, p. 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL ISSUES ON REMAND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The District Court remanded this matter to this Court to make a single determination: In light of PHH's violations of Rule 3002.1 and the Debtor Current Orders in these three cases, and consistent with the caselaw it highlighted, what sanctions are less than serious and, as such, within this Court's authority to impose?\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To fulfill that remand, and determine the appropriate amount of sanctions to impose on PHH for its misconduct in these cases, the Court analyzes six component legal issues: First, does this Court have the authority to impose punitive sanctions on PHH for its violations of Bankruptcy Rule 3002.1 and, if so, what is the source of that authority? Second, does this Court have the authority to impose sanctions on PHH for its violations of Debtor Current Orders and, if so, what is the source of that authority? Third, what guidance can be drawn from the decisions favorably cited by the District Court in its Remand Decision, as well as any pertinent Second Circuit or Supreme Court caselaw, as to the scope and size of punitive sanctions this Court is authorized to impose? Fourth, what weight should this Court assign to\n   factors such as PHH's corporate status, its substantial financial resources, and its prior violations of the same duties, in deciding what punitive sanctions are warranted here? Fifth, is there authority to adjust the caselaw-established caps defining what is a serious sanction, and what is less than a serious sanction, to reflect the passage of time and the present value of those dollar amount caps? Sixth, in the context of the particular facts presented in these cases, and the interest of justice, to whom should PHH pay the sanctions this Court imposes in each of these cases?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. FINDINGS OF FACT ESSENTIAL TO REMAND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Since, as the District Court observed, \"[t]he facts giving rise to [the instant] appeal were not in dispute before the Bankruptcy Court and are not challenged on appeal\" (doc. # 104, p. 2), the Court recites only those findings of fact that are essential to fulfilling the remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the Gravel case, this Court had entered an order on May 20, 2016, determining Mr. and Mrs. Gravel had cured all prepetition mortgage defaults and were current on all postpetition mortgage payments to PHH (a \"Debtor Current Order\"). That order declared\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   the debtors, by their payments through the Office of the Chapter 13 Trustee, have made all payments due during the pendency of this case through April 1, 2016,\n   <em>\n    including all monthly payments and any other charges or amounts due under their mortgage with PHH Mortgage Corporation\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (doc. # 74) (emphasis added). On May 25, 2016, five days after entry of the Debtor Current Order, PHH sent the Debtors a mortgage statement for the month of May 2016 which, contrary to the recently entered Debtor Current Order, asserted the Debtors owed PHH property inspection fees of $258.75. The Trustee filed a motion seeking an order finding PHH to be in contempt and imposing sanctions on PHH (doc. # 75). PHH opposed that relief, arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that this was a one-time error (doc. # 77). The Trustee vigorously disputed that assertion, pointing out that (i) PHH had sent out at least fifteen other mortgage statements that included postpetition fees and expenses without filing a single Rule 3002.1(c) notice, (ii) PHH had been chastised by another bankruptcy court for violating Rule 3002.1(c),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Owens\n   </em>\n   , 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 163 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. 2014), (iii) PHH had assessed improper charges in other cases in this District, and (iv) this Court had previously imposed a consensual sanction of $9,000 on PHH, in this case, based on PHH's repeated misapplication of mortgage payments and issuance of dozens of erroneous monthly mortgage statements to Mr. and Mrs. Gravel for over two years (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   doc. # 49). The Trustee claimed sanctions were warranted and necessary based on PHH's flagrant violation of both Rule 3002.1 and the Debtor Current Order in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The factual and procedural posture of the Beaulieu case is substantially similar to that of the Gravel case: On May 5, 2016, the Court entered a Debtor Current Order, determining Mr. and Mrs. Beaulieu had cured all prepetition mortgage defaults and were current on all postpetition mortgage payments due to PHH (case # 11-10281, doc. # 82). Notwithstanding entry of that Order, less than three weeks later, on May 25, 2016, PHH sent out a monthly statement that included old charges (an NSF fee of $30 and a property inspection fee of $56.25) - charges for which it had never sent a Rule 3002.1(c) notice. On June 14, 2016, the Trustee filed a motion for contempt and sanctions (doc. # 90, the \"Beaulieu Sanctions Motion\"), essentially articulating the same arguments\n   and seeking the same relief as in the Gravel Sanctions Motion, with regard to both PHH's failure to comply with Rule 3002.1 and PHH's violation of the Debtor Current Order. PHH filed opposition to the Beaulieu Sanctions Motion (doc. # 95), and the Trustee filed a response to that opposition (doc. # 96), both of which contained the same arguments they had made in the Gravel case. The facts of the Beaulieu case differ materially from the Gravel case in only three respects: (i) PHH charged postpetition fees to the Beaulieus' account on dates, and in amounts, that differed from the Gravels; (ii) PHH did not respond to the Trustee's motion for final determination before the Debtor Current Order was entered in Beaulieu; and (iii) PHH was not previously sanctioned in the Beaulieu case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   PHH issued incorrect mortgage statements in the Knisley case, as well, but there was no Debtor Current Order yet in this case. Therefore, the Trustee's motion for contempt and sanctions in Knisley was limited to PHH's failure to comply with Rule 3002.1 (doc. # 50, the \"Knisley Sanctions Motion\"). The Trustee alleged in this case that PHH issued a monthly mortgage statement on May 25, 2016 that included charges more than 180 days old ($246.50 in property inspection fees and $124.50 in late charges), without having filed the required and corresponding Rule 3002.1(c) notices. PHH opposed the Knisley Sanctions Motion (doc. # 51), and the Trustee responded to that opposition (doc. # 52), both of which set forth the same arguments made in the other two cases, with respect to PHH's Rule 3002.1 violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This Court found below, and the District Court left undisturbed, that PHH was in consistent violation of Rule 3002.1 for 25 months in each of the three cases, and sent 25 incorrect statements to each of the Debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is to say, on 75 separate occasions, PHH failed to detect that its borrower was current, or erroneously determined its borrower was in default, and issued a notice that contradicted the information its representative had filed with this Court, under penalty of perjury, and upon which the Court relied in issuing the two Debtor Current Orders in the borrowers' bankruptcy cases. As a direct result of PHH's inaccurate filings, on 25 occasions, each of the three Debtors received a notice that erroneously stated the Debtors were behind on their mortgage payments and likely caused those Debtors to worry that, notwithstanding their belief that they had made all required payments, their mortgage loan was in default and they were at risk of losing their home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The District Court also left undisturbed this Court's finding that PHH's conduct, in sending notices that incorrectly stated the Debtors were in default, violated the Debtor\n   Current Orders that had been entered in the Gravel and Beaulieu cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Likewise, the District Court left undisturbed this Court's determination of the factors to be considered when determining the amount of the sanctions, and this Court's findings with respect to each factor (doc. # 82, p. 14-16). In that regard, this Court had found (1) PHH had adequate notice of the Debtor Current Orders, (2) PHH had engaged in a pattern of the offending conduct, (3) PHH had previously been admonished twice and sanctioned once (in this Court) for sending incorrect statements, and (4) PHH's level of sophistication and available financial resources mandated a higher sanction than might be imposed on another party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As this Court indicated in its prior ruling, it is \"mindful of the need to limit the magnitude of the sanction to the amount necessary to deter future misconduct,\" and to fix the sanctions in amounts that is \"warranted, reasonable, and necessary to communicate to PHH the gravity of its violation of this Court's Debtor Current Order in this case, to punish the violation, and to deter PHH from violating court orders in the future\" (doc. # 82, p. 16). On remand, the task of this Court is to reformulate the sanctions, articulate the source of the Court's authority for the sanctions, and explain the basis for characterizing them as \"less than serious.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    V. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    THIS COURT'S AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS FOR VIOLATIONS OF RULE 3002.1 AND VIOLATIONS OF THE DEBTOR CURRENT ORDERS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the Remand Decision, the District Court examined the three sources of authority upon which this Court had relied in imposing sanctions on PHH, namely, Bankruptcy Rule 3002.1, this Court's inherent powers, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, this Court will begin with an analysis of those sources of authority, to ensure a determination that is congruent with the Remand Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Authority to Impose Punitive Sanctions for Violations of Rule 3002.1\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With respect to Rule 3002.1, the District Court pointed out there is no precedent for the imposition of punitive sanctions under this Rule and held \"[t]he authority conferred by Rule 3002.1(i) cannot exceed the scope of the substantive powers of the Bankruptcy Court\" and \"the Bankruptcy Court's order imposing sanctions pursuant to Rule 3002.1(i) exceeded the scope of the Bankruptcy Court's powers as delineated by statute and precedent\" (doc. # 104, p. 9). Based on these premises, it concluded the imposition of the $25,000 sanction in each case, for violating the Bankruptcy Rule requirements, \"exceeded the scope of [the Court's authority under] Rule 3002.1(i)\" (doc. # 104, p. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While the District Court observed that \"[t]he question of whether Rule 3002.1(i) authorizes the imposition of punitive sanctions appears to be a question of first impression, not just in the Second Circuit, but across the nation\" (doc. # 104, p. 8), it did not rule that Rule 3002.1(i) precludes the awarding of a punitive sanction as a form of \"other appropriate relief.\" This Court must determine the outer limits of bankruptcy courts' substantive, statutory,\n   and precedential authority to ensure that the sanctions it imposes under Rule 3002.1(i) do not exceed those limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Bankruptcy Rule 3002.1 went into effect in 2011, in order to protect the fresh starts of chapter 13 debtors by requiring the holders of claims secured by a debtor's principal residence to timely file a detailed notice setting forth all postpetition fees, expenses, and charges it seeks to recover from the debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. BANKR. P. 3002.1(c). As noted by the Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules, \" Rule 3002.1 ... assists in the implementation of \u00a7 1322(b)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The requirements of Rule 3002.1, in combination with the requirements imposed by Rule 3001(c), \"are designed to allow bankruptcy court determination of any questions regarding the status of a debtor's home mortgage during a Chapter 13 case, eliminating the possibility of unexpected deficiencies at the time the case closes.\" Eugene R. Wedoff,\n   <em>\n    Proposed New Bankruptcy Rules on Creditor Disclosure and Court Enforcement of the Disclosures - Open for Comment\n   </em>\n   , 83 AM. BANKR. L.J. 579, 584 (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Subparagraph (i) of Rule 3002.1 was added as an enforcement mechanism and may be invoked when a creditor fails to comply with the requirements of the rule, in language modeled after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37. This subparagraph identifies the penalty for failure to comply as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (i) FAILURE TO NOTIFY . If the holder of a claim fails to provide any information as required by subdivision (b), (c), or (g) of this rule, the court may, after notice and hearing, take either or both of the following actions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) preclude the holder from presenting the omitted information, in any form, as evidence in any contested matter or adversary proceeding in the case, unless the court determines that the failure was substantially justified or is harmless; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    award other appropriate relief\n   </em>\n   , including reasonable expenses and attorney's fees caused by the failure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   FED. R. BANKR. P. 3002.1(i) (emphasis added). Rules 3001(c) and 3002.1 were introduced, developed, and enacted concurrently; \"they employ the same enforcement mechanism for required disclosure,\" and \"are modeled after those for failure to make ordered discovery\" under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Wedoff,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 584. Indeed, \"the proposed sanctions most closely resemble the sanction available under Civil Rule 37(c)(1) for the failure to provide information required under the disclosure provisions of Rule 26(a)(3).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   PHH alleges that \"[n]one of the Committee reports or minutes contained any discussion concerning broad monetary sanctions intended to penalize creditors or act as a warning of the importance of complying with disclosure provisions\" (doc. # 127, p. 15). Citing this, and pointing to the modeling of Rule 3002.1 on the language of Federal Civil Rule 37, PHH argues\n   that any sanctions under Rule 3002.1(i) are limited to evidentiary exclusion of any improperly noticed fees or charges in any proceeding before the court, and attorney's fees incurred to enforce that exclusion (doc. # 127, p. 15). The same \"legislative history\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   upon which PHH relies, however, indicates first, the evidentiary exclusion to which PHH refers was already in Rule 3001\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the adoption of Rules 3001(c) and 3002.1 and, second, the addition of specifically enumerated sanctions in Rule 3001(c)(2)(D) and Rule 3002.1(i) were added with the intention of bolstering that preexisting exclusion remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2010 Committee Memo,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 9, at 12 (\"Currently, loss of the evidentiary effect of prima facie validity is the only sanction included in Rule 3001 for the failure to execute and file a [proof of claim] in accordance with the rules. The proposed addition of Rule 3001(c)(2)(D) was based on the Advisory Committee's belief that\n   <em>\n    stronger sanctions are required\n   </em>\n   to ensure greater compliance with the rule's requirements.\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   PHH also misconstrues the significance of the discretion afforded to courts pursuant to their authority to impose \"other appropriate relief.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. BANKR. P. 3002.1(i)(2). The Committee's notes indicate the members of the Advisory Committee supported a broad reading of \"other appropriate relief.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2010 Committee Memo,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 9, at 13 (\"[The court] may impose a sanction other than the preclusion of the introduction of evidence.\"). Judge Wedoff, an influential member of the Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules at the time Rule 3002.1 was drafted and future chair of that Committee, described the import of a bankruptcy court's ability to award \"other appropriate relief\" as an additional measure beyond the specifically enumerated relief of evidentiary preclusion and attorney's fees and costs:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [ Rule 3001(c)(2)(D) and 3002.1(i) ] employ the same enforcement mechanism for\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   required disclosure - generally, the potential for a creditor being barred from introducing at a later hearing the information that was not timely provided, as well as reimbursing the debtor for reasonable expenses and attorneys' fees,\n   <em>\n    with other relief in the court's discretion\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Wedoff,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 584 (emphasis added). Moreover, the caselaw construing former Bankruptcy \u00a7 304(b), which employed the same language as Rule 3002.1(i), also supports a broader reading of \"other appropriate relief.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Gee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121628\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/53/891/#p896\">\n    53 B.R. 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 896-97 (Bankr.

The scarcity of decisions discussing the subject of Rule 3002.1 sanctions is not surprising in light of the fairly recent implementation of that Rule. Despite the lack of controlling precedent, however, and based on the District Court's observation, this Court may be guided by caselaw that is pertinent to the scope of Rule 3002.1(i) sanctions, and properly classified as persuasive authority for a determination of the issue at bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Detroit Edison Co. v.

Relying on this narrower construction, the District Court held that while \"the statutory and inherent powers of the Bankruptcy Court are not sufficient to support [the] imposition upon PHH of $300,000 in punitive sanctions[,] ... [the Bankruptcy Court] may refer the matter to the district court\" or \"\n   <em>\n    take steps to enforce its orders short of punitive sanctions of the scope and type imposed in these cases\n   </em>\n   \" (doc. # 104, p. 16-17) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In effect, the District Court remanded to this Court the question of whether there are punitive sanctions that are (a) an appropriate punishment for PHH's violations, (b) within this Court's authority to impose, and (c) \"short of [the] punitive sanctions of the scope and type [it previously] imposed in these cases\" (doc. # 104, p. 17).

These decisions, however, do not articulate any criteria for how to recognize a mild versus serious sanction, or how to distinguish between them. In fact, they explicitly defer that question: In\n   <em>\n    Dyer\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit stated, \"we leave for another day the development of a precise definition of the term 'serious' punitive (criminal) sanctions,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Dyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9372648,9359407\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/1178/\">\n    322 F.3d at 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and in\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit affirmatively declined to decide \"what defines a 'serious' non-compensatory award of punitive damages because the $2.8 million awarded below is serious under any definition.\"\n   <em>\n    In re John Richards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240665,4073631\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/552/401/\">\n    552 F.

In the\n   <em>\n    Guariglia\n   </em>\n   case, for example, the Second Circuit identified, and then deferred addressing that crucial subject: \"We note also that there is a serious question as to whether the bankruptcy court would have had the authority to punish Guariglia for criminal contempt of its Order had the government first sought a determination by the bankruptcy court.

There are, however, other Second Circuit cases, albeit unrelated to bankruptcy disputes, which provide meaningful insight into how the Second Circuit might circumscribe the scope of \"serious sanctions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   To begin with, the Second Circuit has decided several cases focused on the notice requirements and enunciated the due process prerequisite for imposing punitive sanctions. It held the same notice is required whether the sanction to be imposed arises from a rule violation or a finding of\n   contempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Satcorp Int'l Group v. China Nat'l Silk Import &amp; Export Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7629679\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/3/#p5\">\n    101 F.3d 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5 (2d Cir. 1996) (\"Regardless of whether a sanction is premised on a finding of contempt, or is deemed justified under Rule 37 generally, the same amount of due process is due ... A district court cannot circumvent this mandate by choosing to characterize the sanction as something other than 'contempt.' \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Building on those notice requirements, the Second Circuit has held that while punitive damages are not inextricably linked to criminal contempt, a party facing substantial punitive sanctions is entitled to the same protections as a party threatened with criminal contempt:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   ... the consequences of an adjudication of criminal contempt are different from those flowing from the imposition of sanctions. The person found guilty of criminal contempt, unlike a person on whom sanctions have been imposed, now carries a criminal conviction on his record. Furthermore, possible punishments for contempt, unlike sanctions, include imprisonment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Nevertheless, sanctions and contempt raise certain similar concerns. Whether or not a finding of contempt is involved, unfairness and abuse are possible, especially if courts were to operate without any framework of rules or cap on their power to punish. In either case, the individual bears the risk of substantial punishment by reason of obstructive or disobedient conduct, as well as of vindictive pursuit by an offended judge. We conclude, notwithstanding the differences mentioned above, that\n   <em>\n    the imposition of a sufficiently substantial punitive sanction requires that the person sanctioned receive the procedural protections appropriate to a criminal case\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    We conclude that the imposition of a $10,000 punitive sanction on an individual (as opposed to a corporation or collective entity) requires such protections.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Mackler Prods., Inc. v.

Interestingly, in a footnote to this section of the decision, the Second Circuit points out it \"[did] not address a court's ability to levy\n   <em>\n    a modest punitive sanction\n   </em>\n   without the protections of criminal procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11826348\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/126/#p129\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 130 n. 2 (emphasis added). This sanctions analysis in\n   <em>\n    Mackler\n   </em>\n   is important to the issues at bar because the Second Circuit distinguishes there between \"a sufficiently substantial punitive sanction\" and something less than that, as well as between a sanction imposed on an individual and a sanction imposed on \"a corporation or collective entity.\" This suggests that a sanction it might classify as \"serious\" if imposed on an individual, could well fall into the category of \"modest\" if imposed on a corporation.\n   <em>\n    Mackler I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11826348\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/126/#p129\">\n    146 F.3d at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The gap, for purposes of the instant cases, is that the Second Circuit did not articulate what sanction amount would have triggered the need for these protections (or been \"serious\") if the target of the sanction had been a corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Taken together, the\n   <em>\n    Satcorp\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mackler\n   </em>\n   cases erect guideposts one could reasonably expect the Second Circuit to follow when determining whether a particular punitive sanction on a corporation is serious or modest.

THE NEW SANCTION ON PHH IN EACH OF THESE CASES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As directed in the Remand Decision, this Court issues this decision to impose sanctions on PHH that \"are short of punitive sanctions of the scope and type [it] imposed\n   [in its original Sanctions Decision] in these cases\" (doc. # 104, p. 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The first step is confirmation of the authority of a bankruptcy court to impose punitive sanctions on parties who violate court orders, under either its inherent powers or \u00a7 105 of the Bankruptcy Code. This authority is confirmed in the Supreme Court's recent decision on that point.\n   <em>\n    Taggart v. Lorenzen\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620115\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1795/\">\n    139 S.Ct. 1795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2019). In\n   <em>\n    Taggart\n   </em>\n   , the high court ruled a bankruptcy court may hold a creditor in contempt for that party's violation of an injunction order, and impose sanctions, including punitive sanctions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   if, using an objective standard, the court finds \"there is not a 'fair ground of doubt' as to whether the creditor's conduct might be lawful under the order.\"\n   <em>\n    Taggart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620115\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1795/\">\n    139 S.Ct. at 1804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court has already found, and the District Court has not set aside the finding, that PHH acted in violation of the Debtor Current Orders in the Gravel and Beaulieu cases. Thus, there is no fair ground of doubt here that PHH's conduct violated the Debtor Current Orders and, in the absence of any Second Circuit decisions to the contrary, this Court concludes it possesses the authority, under its inherent powers and \u00a7 105, to impose punitive sanctions on PHH for its violation of the Debtor Current Orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Next, the Court looks to the financial markers associated with PHH's violations to assess the gravity of its misconduct and discern the proper amount of sanctions. The District Court concluded the original sanctions were \"serious\" punitive sanctions based, in part, on two financial markers: the total amount of the sanctions imposed on PHH for its misconduct in all three cases ($375,000), and the small amount of the fees and charges PHH erroneously claimed due from the each of the Debtor-borrowers on the inaccurate statements PHH sent in violation of the Debtor Current Orders and Rule 3002.1 (ranging from $30.00 to $258.75) (doc. # 104, p. 2). The Remand Decision did not, however, limit this Court's discretion in reassessing the sanctions, and reformulating new, non-serious sanctions, to amounts that correlated directly to the amount of the charges on each incorrect statement. Based on the pertinent caselaw, this Court concludes the appropriate measure of the gravity of PHH's misconduct is not the sum of the amounts PHH claimed due on each statement, but rather the number of incorrect statements PHH sent, in violation of both Rule 3002.1 and the Debtor Current Orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In further response to the financial markers identified in the Remand Decision, the Court must determine whether to focus on the sum of the sanctions imposed in all three cases, or the sanctions imposed in each case individually, when assessing whether the sanctions it is now imposing are less than \"serious.\" None of the cases this Court has found addressing either the maximum amount of a non-serious sanction, or the appropriate sanction warranted for an analogous violation of Rule 37, indicate any basis for gauging the seriousness of a sanction by reference to sanctions imposed across multiple cases. To limit the sanction imposed on PHH in any one of the three cases, based on the fact that the sum of the sanctions imposed in the three cases crosses over into the zone of a \"serious sanction,\" would constitute\n   a windfall for PHH. The three cases are before the Court in a consolidated fashion solely as a result of the Court's decision to address the Trustee's motions in these cases simultaneously, in the interest of judicial economy, and for no reason that bears on the nature or gravity of PHH's malfeasance in each of these three distinct cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court evaluates the seriousness of each sanction it imposes in this decision on a case-by-case basis, independent of the size of any other sanction it imposes in this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Against that backdrop, the Court is charged with detecting where the line is that distinguishes a serious sanction from a non-serious sanction. It fulfills this charge, in accord with the Remand Decision, by following the guidance of the Sixth, Ninth, and Second Circuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Sixth Circuit, as expressed in the\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   case to which the Remand Decision points, makes clear that bankruptcy courts may impose \"mild\" punitive sanctions under \u00a7 105, and may not impose serious punitive sanctions, but makes this pronouncement without articulating the criteria that characterize a sanction as either \"mild\" or \"serious.\"\n   <em>\n    In re John Richards Homes Bldg. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240665,4073631\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/552/401/\">\n    552 F. App'x 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 415-16 (6th Cir. 2013). The only hint the Sixth Circuit gives as to how one can identify a serious sanction is its conclusion that a $2.8 million sanction against an individual is \"serious.\" Since the Sixth Circuit issued the\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   decision, a district court in that circuit affirmed a bankruptcy court's imposition of a punitive sanction in the amount of $5,000 against a corporation.\n   <em>\n    Franklin Credit Mgmt.

In the context of the facts of that case, and the other sums the creditor was ordered to pay, the district court found the $5,000 punitive sanction the bankruptcy court had imposed was \"mild.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280883\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/551/613/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280883\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/551/613/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   To comply with the\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   admonition not to impose a serious sanction on PHH, this Court is left to discern where the boundary between a mild and serious sanction lies in this case, which, based upon the Sixth Circuit continuum, is somewhere between $5,000 and $2.8 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Ninth Circuit caselaw also limits bankruptcy courts' authority to impose sanctions, holding they may impose only modest punitive sanctions. It, however, is rather vague about how to parse what distinguishes a modest sanction from a serious sanction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knupfer v.

Nev. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Finally, and most importantly, this Court draws on the guidance of the Second Circuit to ascertain what it identifies as the dollar amount floor of a \"serious sanction,\" how that floor may fluctuate depending on whether the party to be sanctioned is a corporation or an individual, and whether this Court may adjust the dollar limit on the floor that Court has set to reflect the dollar amount's present value. Although the Second Circuit has not enunciated the scope of a bankruptcy court's authority to impose punitive sanctions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   as this Court described above,\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Second Circuit has, in the context of other areas of the law, established solid guideposts as to what constitutes a \"serious sanction\" both with regard to individuals and corporations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mackler II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11231151\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/136/#p142\">\n    225 F.3d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2000). In 1989, the Second Circuit set the cap for a non-serious sanction, on a corporation, at $100,000 (or $205,531.30 in 2019 dollars).\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Inc. v. FilmOn.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143187\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/91/#p103\">\n    814 F.3d 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103-104 (2d Cir. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    Shangold v.

Appx. 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2008). Applying the detailed rationale of these cases, and the Second Circuit's determination that a party's financial circumstances should factor into the computation of what amount of damages is sufficient to deter, this Court concludes a sanction of less than $205,531.30 would be less than a serious punitive sanction on PHH, and appropriate if, given PHH's financial resources, the Court determines a sanction of less than that magnitude would not be effective in deterring future misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Starting with the premise that the District Court did not disturb any of this Court's factual findings it made with respect to PHH's violations of Rule 3002.1 and the Debtor Current Orders, and relying on the pertinent case law from the Sixth, Ninth and Second Circuits with respect to the scope of bankruptcy courts' authority to impose punitive sanctions, and the decisions from within this Circuit that broadly construe the arsenal of sanctions courts may impose for Rule 37-type violations, as well as the general guidance from the Supreme Court granting bankruptcy courts the authority to impose sanctions for injunction violations, this Court concludes that, based on the circumstances of, and violations by, this multi-billion dollar financial institution, the following sanctions each fall within the scope of a non-serious sanction and, therefore, are within this Court's authority to impose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In the Gravel case, the Court previously imposed a sanction of $200,000, based, in\n   large measure on the fact that it was PHH's second violation of an Order of this Court. The previous Order, entered in March of 2014 (doc. # 49), not only sanctioned PHH for sending the Debtors inaccurate mortgage statements, but also unambiguously declared the debtors were current as of that date:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   [The Trustee] having filed a Motion to Compel [PHH Mortgage] to correct misapplied mortgage payments disbursed to it by the trustee in this case and for sanctions arising from its failure during this case to correctly apply such payments, the trustee and PHH, by filing their consent to this order, have stipulated and agreed to the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   (1) Subsequent to the filing of the motion, PHH has taken steps to re-apply the misapplied mortgage payments, paid to it by the trustee, and\n   <em>\n    is now showing the debtor's mortgage payments, post-petition, as current\n   </em>\n   [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Sanctions Decision, doc. # 82, pp. 14-15 (quoting doc. # 49). PHH violated that Order and violated the Debtor Current Order entered thereafter (doc. # 74). Taking into account PHH's repeated contemptuous conduct, its substantial financial resources, and the limitations on this Court's sanctioning authority, it imposes a sanction of $150,000 on PHH for PHH's violations of this Court's Orders in the Gravel case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shangold v. Walt Disney Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=275%20Fed.%20Appx.%2072\">\n    275 Fed.

The Court also gives significant weight to the fact that PHH gave the Court emphatic assurances that the corrective measures PHH implemented as a result of the negotiations leading to its payment of a $9,000 sanction in 2014 would prevent precisely the sloppy or inattentive record keeping that underlies the instant violations. Moreover, although the Court is not entirely confident a $150,000 sanction will be sufficient to deter PHH from continuing to violate the Debtor Current Order in this case, it seems plausible that it will and nothing less would. With respect to the 25 incorrect notices, the Court reimposes the $25,000 sanction, finding it is the appropriate sanction for the repeated violations of Rule 3002.1(c). The sum of these two sanctions ($175,000) is consistent with the District's Court mandate to impose a less than serious sanction based on the Second Circuit's declaration that a serious sanction is one that exceeds $100,000 in 1989 dollars,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $205,531.30 in 2019 dollars.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This sanction amount reflects the fact that this was PHH's first violation of an Order in this case and is one-half of the corresponding sanction for violation of the Debtor Current Order in the Gravel case. The Court reimposes the $25,000 sanction, as the appropriate sanction for the 25 incorrect notices PHH issued in violation of Rule 3002.1. This total sanction of $125,000 is not \"serious\" or beyond this Court's authority to impose because it is below the Second Circuit's $100,000 cap (in 1989 dollars), adjusted for present value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twentieth Century Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1820988\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/882/656/#p663\">\n    882 F.2d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In the Knisley case, this Court imposes the same $25,000 sanction it previously imposed for PHH's 25 incorrect notices issued in violation of Rule 3002.1(c). There is nothing in the Remand Decision or the caselaw that convinces this Court that this sanction, in and of itself, is \"serious\" or beyond the authority of this Court to impose. Rather, it reflects the Court's broad authority under Rule 3002.1, as shown in the caselaw sanctioning violations of\n   Rule 37 (upon which Rule 3002.1 was modeled), to impose such other appropriate relief as is warranted under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nycomed US, Inc. v.

Because the Debtors did not present any evidence showing they suffered financial harm, and to avoid unjustly enriching the Trustee or the Debtors, the Court awarded the sanctions to \"Vermont's lead provider of\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   legal services in bankruptcy cases\" (doc. # 82, p. 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In the Trustee's Motion, the Trustee asks this Court,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to order payment of the full amount of the original sanctions to him, in four annual installments (doc. # 119, p. 1). While the Court has denied the Trustee's Motion, in most respects,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   doc. # 133, the Court finds the Trustee's request to \"conduct a new windfall analysis,\" in light of the entire record in these cases, and direct PHH to pay a portion of the sanctions to his office, rather than to pay it entirely to Legal Services Vermont (doc. # 119, p. 9), is within the Court's discretion on remand. The Trustee's arguments are compelling and, in light of the efforts the Trustee has made since entry of the Court's Sanctions Decision, justify a modification to the Court's original designation of payee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     1. PHH to Pay the Sanctions for Its Violations of Rule 3002.1 to the Trustee\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Court finds it appropriate and just to direct PHH to pay the Rule 3002.1 sanctions, of $25,000 in each of the three cases, to the Trustee, for several reasons. Although the caselaw on the question of awarding a chapter 13 trustee sanctions under Rule 3002.1(i) is undeveloped, at least one court considered the question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   , 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 5110 (Bankr. D.N.M. 2012). In\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   , the court declined the trustee's request for an award of reasonable expenses and attorney's fees under 3002.1(i)(2), but that was because it granted the creditor additional time to comply with its Rule 3002.1 obligations and ultimately declined to impose sanctions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at **10-12. While acknowledging the dearth of caselaw awarding\n   3002.1 sanctions to a trustee, the Court is guided by other sources of authority for this relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   First, the language of Rule 3002.1(i), and its contemporaneously enacted counterpart Rule 3001(c)(2)(D), do not contain the restrictive language found in \u00a7 362(k) that allows the award to be paid only to the injured individual debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 362(k)(1) (\"...an individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages, including costs and attorney's fees, and, in appropriate circumstances, may recover punitive damages.\"). Several courts, including this Court, have found that a trustee \"is not eligible to sue for damages pursuant to \u00a7 362(k)(1).\"\n   <em>\n    Sensenich v.

Rule 3002.1, by contrast, does not include this limitation, thus opening the door for courts to treat a trustee as an eligible recipient of Rule 3002.1 sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Second, there is an established body of caselaw demonstrating a court's authority to award sanctions to a chapter 13 trustee under Rule 3001(c)(2)(D), the companion sanction provision to Rule 3002.1(i).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Advisory Committee Minutes from Spring 2010 Meeting (in which the Reporter noted the sanctions provision under Rule 3002.1 \"was intended to parallel the sanctions provisions the Committee just reviewed and modified in Rule 3001(c)(2)(D), and said the changes to both provisions should be the same\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   In two instances, the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan has awarded the chapter 13 trustee sanctions under Rule 3001(c)(2)(D) for the costs and expenses incurred when creditors failed to submit the supporting information to a proof of claim, as required by Rule 3001(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Ball\n   </em>\n   , 2019 Bankr.

The bankruptcy court found that \"unexplained deficiencies and delays in filing a full and complete proof of claim did cause the Trustee to devote more attention than was usual to solve a rather straightforward issue of payment of real estate taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    Simerson\n   </em>\n   , 2018 Bankr.

LEXIS 179, at **6-7 (awarding $200 to the chapter 13 trustee). While these cases involved relatively minor, one-time infractions by creditors that were quickly resolved and thus did not merit large sanctions awards, the decisions establish a well-reasoned basis for awarding sanctions to a chapter 13 trustee for work performed in addressing Rule 3001(c) and Rule 3002.1 violations. This is in addition to those cases in which courts have awarded sanctions to trustees under Rule 37, on which 3002.1 was modeled, and under \u00a7 105 and their inherent powers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Haynes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269260\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/577/711/#p757\">\n    577 B.R. 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 757-58 (Bankr.

The Court remains convinced it is equitable, and serves the interests of justice, to direct PHH to pay the sanctions flowing from PHH's violations of the Debtor Current Orders,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the $150,000 sanction in the Gravel case and the $75,000 sanction in the Beaulieu case, to Legal Services Vermont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court reaches the following conclusions with respect to the six interlocking legal issues presented. First, this Court has the authority to issue punitive sanctions against PHH for its violations of Bankruptcy Rule 3002.1, in all three of these cases, based on the detailed explanations of the Rule's purpose and the intent of its drafters, as set out in the records of the Advisory Committee that formulated the Rule, and the court decisions which constitute persuasive authority regarding this question, in their analysis of analogous or similar language in Bankruptcy Rule 3001(c) and Federal Civil Rule 37. Second, this Court has authority to sanction PHH for its breach of the Debtor Current Orders in the Gravel and Beaulieu cases, pursuant to \u00a7 105(a) and its inherent powers. Third, the sanctions this Court imposes on PHH herein fall within the caselaw definitions of \"modest\" and \"less than serious\" sanctions, from the Second, Sixth and Ninth Circuits, i.e., the Circuits to which the Remand Decision directed this Court's attention. Fourth, that same caselaw provides a sound basis for this Court to take into account PHH's corporate status, the repetitive nature of its violations, and its relative wealth and ability to pay in setting the amount of the sanctions. Fifth, based on the well-established jurisprudence that assigns upper monetary limits to the various categories of sanctions germane to this\n   decision, as well as the more recent trial and appellate level decisions that adjust those dollar amounts to reflect present dollar value, this Court concludes it is proper to apply the monetary caps, adjusted to reflect their value in 2019 dollars. Sixth, the Court finds that although the chapter 13 Trustee has not documented the number of hours he or his\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   attorney have spent in addressing the myriad issues raised in these cases, it is clear that (a) their efforts shielded the Debtors from having to pay improper charges and from incurring the cost of legal actions that might have flowed from a failure to pay them, and (b) it was - and will continue to be - within the scope of the Trustee's duties to vigilantly monitor mortgage creditors' compliance with Rule 3002.1, and as such, it is fair to direct that portion of the sanctions allocable to PHH's violation of Rule 3002.1 ($75,000) to the chapter 13 Trustee. Analogously, the fact that the Debtors did not suffer financial harm when PHH violated the Debtor Current Orders in the Gravel and Beaulieu cases does not diminish the need to impose sanctions on PHH for punitive and deterrent purposes. It is most appropriate that PHH pay these sanctions ($225,000) to Legal Services Vermont, the premier provider of\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   legal services to the individuals who are most vulnerable to harm when a creditor fails to adhere to the injunctions in Debtor Current Orders, and most in need of protection from mortgagors who do not play by the rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Accordingly, and pursuant to its mandate on remand, the Court (1) reduces the combined sanction from $225,000 to $175,000 in the Gravel case, reduces the combined sanction from $125,000 to $100,000 in the Beaulieu case, and leaves intact the $25,000 sanction in the Knisley case; (2) directs PHH to pay the sanctions for violations of court orders,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $150,000 in the Gravel case and $75,000 in the Beaulieu case, to Legal Services Vermont; and (3) directs PHH to pay the sanctions for violations of Rule 3002.1,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $25,000 in each of the three cases, to the chapter 13 Trustee, as more fully described in the accompanying Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   This memorandum of decision constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law, and implementation of the Remand Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    ON REMAND FROM U.S. DISTRICT COURT, IMPOSING SANCTIONS ON PHH MORTGAGE CORPORATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   For the reasons set forth in the memorandum of decision of even date, the Court finds, first, it has the authority pursuant to the Rule 3002.1, pertinent caselaw, and its inherent powers, to impose punitive sanctions on PHH for its violations of Rule 3002.1 ; second, it has the authority, pursuant to \u00a7 105(a) and its inherent powers, to sanction PHH for its breach of the Debtor Current Orders in the Gravel and Beaulieu cases; third, there are specific dollar amount caps which set the outer limits of \"modest,\" or \"less than serious,\" sanctions; fourth, those caps may be adjusted to correlate to the present value of those dollar amounts; fifth, this Court has the authority to impose punitive sanctions on PHH for its Rule 3002.1 and Court Order violations, provided the amount of the sanction imposed in each case does not exceed the caselaw-defined cap for a non-serious sanction; and sixth, based on the facts and circumstances of these cases, it serves the interests of justice for PHH to pay the sanctions for its Rule 3002.1 violations to the chapter 13 Trustee and to pay the sanctions attributable to its violations of Debtor Current Orders to Legal Services Vermont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   (1) The following sanctions are imposed on PHH:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   (a) in the Gravel case, a sanction of one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000),\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   (b) in the Beaulieu case, a sanction of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   (c) in the Knisley case, a sanction of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   (2) (a) PHH shall pay to the chapter 13 Trustee the portion of each sanction imposed for PHH's violation of Bankruptcy Rule 3002.1 :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   (i) in the Gravel case, twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000),\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   (ii) in the Beaulieu case, twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   (iii) in the Knisley case, twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000),\n   <em>\n    within fourteen (14) days of entry of this Order\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   (b) PHH shall pay to Legal Services Vermont the portion of each sanction imposed for PHH's violation of Debtor Current Orders:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   (i) in the Gravel case, one-hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000), and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   (ii) in the Beaulieu case, seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   <em>\n    within fourteen (14) days of entry of this Order\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    In the interest of simplicity, all docket references in this decision cite to the Gravel case docket only;
