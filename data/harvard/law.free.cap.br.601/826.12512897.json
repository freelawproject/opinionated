DHS challenges this determination, arguing that \"[t]he bankruptcy court correctly found the QA Fee to be an excise tax\" but \"mistakenly concluded that the monthly QA Fee is imposed on a particular facility's net revenue for the month.\" (Dkt. 12, Appellant's Opening Br. at 3). Consequently, DHS asserts, the bankruptcy court's \"ruling must be reversed because the uncontroverted facts show that the QA Fee is not based upon a facility's net revenue\" and that \"the QA Fee rate is calculated based upon all the revenue of all the facilities subject to the QA Fee in [California.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The facility was eventually sold, effective July 31, 2014, and on September 4, 2014, debtor's Chapter 11 petition for reorganization was converted to one for liquidation under Chapter 7.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, all subsequent statutory references are to Title 11 of the United States Code and all subsequent \"Rule\" references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Claim 10-2 was accompanied by the Clausse Declaration, which explained the basis for Mr. Clausse's personal knowledge of DHS's calculation methodology and the relevant variables forming the basis for debtor's unpaid QA Fees.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Evid. 602 (personal knowledge requirement); Fed. R. Evid. 901 (authentication requirement). DHS's amended claim was necessary because the Trustee's counsel requested that DHS apply Medi-Cal payments owing to debtor as \"recoupment\" to post-petition debt (allocated greater priority as a \u00a7 502 administrative expense) instead of pre-petition debt. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 13-1, ER at 90) (Declaration of John Beshara, Chief of DHS's QA Fee Unit, General Collections Section). DHS agreed to do so, refunding $ 178,522.33 to debtor's estate and withdrawing its \u00a7 502 administrative expense claim, (Claim No. 16), of $ 315,364.32. This resulted in a substantial increase in pre-petition QA Fees owed, (Claim No. 10-2), from $ 192,793.85 to $ 446,609.20. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 13-1, ER at 90).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    In relevant part, \u00a7 507(a)(8)(E) provides that eighth priority is accorded to: \"an excise tax on - (i) a transaction occurring before the date of the filing of the petition for which a return, if required, is last due, under applicable law or under any extension, after three years before the date of the filing of the petition; or (ii) if a return is not required, a transaction occurring during the three years immediately preceding the date of the filing of the petition.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The Trustee responds that \"the QA Fee, if an excise tax, is clearly and unequivocally not 'on a transaction[.]' \" (Dkt. 15, Appellee's Br. at 15) (capitalization omitted). Because \"[s]killed nursing facilities provide long-term care to their patients, and do[ ] not engage in one-time or discrete transactions\n    with their patients[,]\" the Trustee asserts that \"QA Fees are not assessed on any discrete activity or transaction involving any particular patient, care or service.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 19). According to the Trustee, DHS \"wants to squeeze the QA Fee into an excise tax 'on a transaction,' but fails to identify what the transaction is.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The Trustee's assertions are unpersuasive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    During the hearing on the claim objection following remand, DHS's counsel explained that QA Fees were imposed on a \"per bed\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    basis:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n    MR.

WANG: So it -- for example, at a facility that has 50 beds for the month of January 2017 perhaps 50 beds get occupied. In February 20 beds gets occupied. So that multiplier is multiplied by the number of beds occupied for the month.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    THE COURT: Occupied. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    (BK Dkt. 519, January 4, 2017, Hearing Tr. at 23-24).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    DHS's characterization of QA Fees as being imposed on a \"per bed, per patient day\" basis was essentially uncontested. Indeed, the Trustee agreed with this characterization. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    BK Dkt. 480, Trustee's Opening Supp. Br. at 4) (describing QA Fees as \"recurring monthly charges which are based on a facility specific annual rate, multiplied by the number of occupied beds/residents per day each month\"). Nonetheless, the bankruptcy court found that QA Fees were not levied \"on a transaction,\" reasoning as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    QA Fees are not\n    <em>\n     based on the number of\n    </em>\n    meals,\n    <em>\n     beds\n    </em>\n    , changes of clothing, or any other service\n    <em>\n     provided to residents\n    </em>\n    . QA Fees are not assessed when a new resident enters a facility. Rather, the terms of the legislation provide - and DHS's proof of claim makes clear - that QA Fees are recurring fees based on a skilled nursing facility's net revenue.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    (BK Dkt. 491, Bankruptcy Court's Order of August 24, 2017, at 12) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The court respectfully disagrees with bankruptcy court's legal interpretation of the relevant California law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Marsh v.

The relevant California statute states that \"[t]he amount of the uniform quality assurance fee to be\n    <em>\n     assessed per resident day\n    </em>\n    shall be determined based on\n    <em>\n     the aggregate net revenue of skilled nursing facilities subject to the fee\n    </em>\n    [.]\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201324.21\">\n     Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 1324.21\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) (emphasis added). As both DHS and the Trustee agreed that the QA Fee was calculated based on the number of beds per day provided to a nursing facility's residents, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    BK Dkt. 480, Trustee's Opening Supp. Br. at 4), the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that\n    \"QA Fees are not based on the number of ... beds ... provided to residents.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    As DHS correctly notes, the \"QA Fee ... is a daily per bed charge\" that is highly \"analogous to the bed tax imposed by the hospitality industry[ ] at hotels and motels.\" (Dkt. 12, DHS Opening Br. at 14).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Moreover, the court's conclusion is strongly supported by the First Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Boston Regional v. Massachusetts Div. of Health\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9252160,9245983\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/51/\">\n     365 F.3d 51\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1st Cir. 2004), which, as DHS noted, is a factually \"indistinguishable\" case involving similar issues of law and expounded on those similarities.

While\n    <em>\n     Boston Regional\n    </em>\n    is not binding on this court or the bankruptcy court, it is highly persuasive authority for a number of reasons. It concerned \"materially indistinguishable\" facts - a state claim for unpaid health care provider taxes imposed to finance the state's share of Medicaid costs - and resolved a virtually identical question of law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Boston Regional\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9252160,9245983\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/51/\">\n     365 F.3d at 53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"At issue in this appeal is whether amounts owing by a debtor hospital under Massachusetts general law, chapter 118G, section 18, to a state fund known as the Commonwealth's Uncompensated Care Pool are properly considered to be 'excise taxes' enjoying priority in bankruptcy under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(8)(e).\").
