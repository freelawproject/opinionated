parties, a combination of strategic and financial investors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   early February, the Debtors received two informal indications of interest for the

</p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On January 24, 2018, the Debtors filed a motion for approval of bidding procedures for the sale of substantially all of the Debtors' assets (the \" \u00a7 363 Sale\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 31, 2018, the Court entered an Order approving the Bid Procedures Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other

Alden, Aero IP Group, and Aero Brand Group), submitted bids at the auction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   At approximately 7:15 p.m. on February 15, 2018, Aero IP Group submitted a bid for $ 20 million, which would eventually be selected by the Debtors as the back-up bid (the \"Aero IP Backup Bid\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On or about 8:00 p.m. at the auction, THL indicated that it wished to place a credit bid for the intellectual property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   For purposes of evaluating THL's credit bid, the Debtors' advisors prepared a document marked as Exhibit 14 to the Auction Transcript (the \"Auction Analysis\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   THL submitted a credit bid of $ 12,209,\n   519 (the \"Credit Bid\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of its credit bid, THL said it would leave behind the inventory and accounts

</footnotemark>\n   After the THL Credit Bid, during a recess of the auction, the Debtors asked THL to refrain from submitting further credit bids so as not to interfere with the active bidding of other cash bidders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   THL agreed to temporarily refrain from bidding, but reserved its right to resume credit bidding if other bidders did not bid

lasted through the night.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, the Debtors deemed Alden's bid as the highest and best bid for substantially all of the Debtors' assets for a cash purchase price of $ 26,175,000 (the \"Alden Bid\"), and the auction closed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 21, 2018, the Court entered an Order (the \"Sale

APA obligated the Debtors to continue operating in the ordinary course of business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   The APA also provided for a purchase price adjustment for working

dollar-for-dollar basis for accounts receivable and inventory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the Debtors, Alden, Polk and THL agreed to a purchase price reduction of $ 750,000 and a reduction of $ 450,000 in expenses resulting in overall net sale proceeds of $ 24,250,090.14 (the \"Sale Proceeds\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties further agreed to escrow an additional $ 910,097 from cash-on-hand to reimburse Alden to the extent Alden made certain scheduled payments that were included as part of the budget agreed upon by and

THL argues that the only DIP Priority Collateral sold in the \u00a7 363 Sale was the Debtors' accounts receivable and inventory. Therefore, THL claims, all remaining sale proceeds (after deducting the value of the accounts receivable and inventory) were generated from the sale of the Debtor's Intellectual Property (and goodwill associated with the Intellectual Property), which fall under the Term Priority Defined Collateral. THL argues that Polk has not adequately described any other assets with value that could fall within the Undefined Collateral Proceeds. So, THL claims that the solution to the allocation issue is to distribute the value of the accounts receivable and inventory to Polk, and to distribute the remaining \u00a7 363 Sale Proceeds (attributable to Intellectual Property) to THL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Polk argues, in response, that the Court must: (1) value all of the DIP Priority Collateral that was sold (consisting of accounts receivable, inventory, inventory deposits, books and records and general intangibles), then (2) value the Term Priority Defined Collateral that was sold (Intellectual Property), and then (3) determine that any remaining Sales Proceeds are \"Undefined Collateral Proceeds,\" which get distributed to Polk first, in accordance with paragraph 23(b)(v) of the Final DIP Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    Summary of Competing Valuations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   To value the assets sold at the \u00a7 363 Sale, THL and Polk offered expert testimony. Other valuations that are discussed by the parties include an analysis used by the Debtors to evaluate bids at the auction, as well as the allocation announced by the buyer, Alden, (over some protestation by secured creditors) at the end of the auction.

THL submitted expert testimony that the Intellectual Property had a value of at least $ 22.561 million as of the closing date of the \u00a7 363 Sale\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   THL's expert, David Peress, is an Executive Vice President at Hilco IP Services, LLC (\"Hilco\"), who has extensive experience valuing intellectual property assets, having participated in more than 200 such valuations in his career.\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors employed Hilco in 2014 and again in 2017 to assess the value of the Company's Intellectual Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2017, Hilco performed two different valuations - - an orderly liquidation value (\"OLV\") of the Intellectual Property at the Debtors' request, and a forced liquidation value (\"FLV\") at THL's request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n   In August 2017, Hilco completed reports estimating the Intellectual Property's value as of June 30, 2017 at an OLV of approximately $ 29.49 million and a FLV of approximately $ 17.32 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Peress testified that, generally, valuation reports are intended to be used prospectively and are reliable for business planning purposes for 12 months (although sometimes it may be appropriate to update\n   them earlier).\n   <footnotemark>\n    106\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the August 2017 Reports had conservative assumptions built into them, and based on his conclusions that \"deployment of the brand, and the engagement of the consumer with the brand - - the e-commerce business was still functioning, the social media sites were still functioning, [and] customer service was still being provided,\" Peress decided that the August 2017 Reports \"remained valid insofar as [they] addressed the four channels of revenue that the Debtors continued to engage in.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    107\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Peress then valued the Intellectual Property as of the closing date of the \u00a7 363 Sale by modifying the analyses in the August 2017 Reports in two ways, by: (i) removing the value attributable to the retail channel, and (ii) adjusting the analysis to reflect the appropriate standard of value, i.e., OLV, FLV or something in between. As described in the summary of his expert report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [T]he sale of the Intellectual Property took place under circumstances that had elements of both an orderly liquidation and a forced liquidation. Looking at those two poles and adjusting for the cessation of the use of the Intellectual Property in the retail channel, as of the Sale Date, the Intellectual Property had a value between $ 28.414 Million and $ 16.709 Million. In my opinion, the sale had more elements of an orderly liquidation than a forced liquidation; therefore, the value of the Intellectual Property as of the Sale Date was greater than $ 22.561 Million which represents that mid-point of the value range between an OLV and an FLV.\n   <footnotemark>\n    108\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In contrast, Polk's expert, James Donohue, valued the Intellectual Property at $ 12-$ 14 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    109\n   </footnotemark>\n   Donohue is a Vice President at Charles River Associates and has been valuing intellectual property for over twenty years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    110\n   </footnotemark>\n   To prepare his valuation, Donohue considered three well-accepted methods for valuing intellectual property, including the cost approach, the income approach and the market approach, but mainly focused on the income approach and market approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    111\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \"The income approach values assets based on the present value of the future income streams expected to come from the assets under consideration.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    112\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The future income stream from the asset may be quantified using a variety of approaches depending on the specific circumstances of each case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    113\n   </footnotemark>\n   In valuing intellectual property, one such approach - - known as the \"relief from royalty approach\" - - \"assumes that the asset's value can be measured by what the owner of the asset would otherwise have to pay in royalties if it did not own the asset and had to license the asset from a third party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    114\n   </footnotemark>\n   More specifically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   The relief from royalty approach therefore estimates revenues associated with intellectual property, applies a royalty on those revenues to determine an intellectual property income stream, subtracts applicable costs, and uses a capitalization rate to convert the resulting cash flow stream into a value.\n   <footnotemark>\n    115\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Donohue applied the relief from royalty approach to all of the Debtors' business channels, except Retail (which was not valued).\n   <footnotemark>\n    116\n   </footnotemark>\n   Donohue claimed that this approach is appropriate because the GBG Transaction provided a market comparable that included negotiated royalty rates for the same Intellectual Property during the relevant post-petition time period, which was very close to the environment that Alden faced in the \u00a7 363 Sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    117\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Donohue also used a market approach to test his income approach for valuing the Intellectual Property. Donohue describes the market approach as a way to value assets based on comparable transactions and notes that \"[w]hen considering potentially comparable transactions, it is necessary to evaluate the comparability of the transaction in terms of subject matter and timing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    118\n   </footnotemark>\n   He relied on three primary market indicators for this approach: two indications of interest made in February 2018 for Intellectual Property only (one for $ 10 million and one for $ 12-$ 14 million), and THL's credit bid at the \u00a7 363 Sale of $ 12.2 million for the Intellectual Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    119\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Peress claims that Donohue's income approach substantially undervalues the Intellectual Property. Although Peress used the relief from royalty approach to value the Intellectual Property in the Debtors' Wholesale Channel, he used variations of the income approach for the Debtors' other business channels - - specifically, Peress used a profit split methodology to value the E-Commerce Channel, and a discounted cash flow methodology for the Licensing and First Cost Channels.\n   <footnotemark>\n    120\n   </footnotemark>\n   Peress claimed that using a relief from royalty approach in the First Cost and Licensing Channels would result in an unreasonably lower value because it does not recognize the high profit margins in those channels.\n   <footnotemark>\n    121\n   </footnotemark>\n   Peress also noted that Donohue understated international revenues in the First Cost Channel because Donohue excluded license agreements that the buyer, Alden, did not assume. However, Peress asserts that Alden could still market the Aerosoles brand and generate business in those territories and, therefore, he claimed Donohue's approach was overly conservative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    122\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, while both experts used the relief from royalty method for the Wholesale Channel, Peress claims that Donohue's 5% royalty rate is too low.\n   <footnotemark>\n    123\n   </footnotemark>\n   Peress asserts that Donohue improperly relied on a range of royalty rates from the unconsummated GBG Transaction, and focused on the lower end of that range on the flawed assumption that the Debtors' wholesale customers were \"off price\" retailers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Peress also contends that Donohue's market approach is flawed. Peress described the two indications of interest that were made in February 2018, after the GBG Transaction collapsed, as unhelpful in a valuation because in a distressed context he will often \"have conversations with opportunistic buyers who float numbers that are either not helpful, low, or otherwise\n   not substantiated by the actual value.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    125\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the evidence shows that THL's credit bid was not a final offer\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, therefore, it is not a useful comparable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In response, Donohue contends that the flaws in Peress' analysis result in substantially over-valuing the Intellectual Property. Donohue's main contention is that Peress' June 8, 2018 Report (the \"Peress Report\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n   relies upon Hilco's August 2017 Reports, making only one adjustment to reflect the closing of the retail stores.\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n   Peress did not make any adjustment in his report for events that occurred after June 2017, including the Debtors' chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in September 2017, the GBG Transaction and proposed chapter 11 plan, GBG's termination of the GBG Transaction on the eve of confirmation in January 2018, or the \u00a7 363 Sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Peress Report did not update the financial data used in the August 2017 Reports (which relied on the Debtors' actual financial data through May 2017 and a one-month projection for June 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    130\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, Donohue asserts that updating the data as of December 2017 in the overall First Cost Channel shows a decrease in revenue from $ 9,707 million as of June 30, 2017 to $ 7,601 million as of December 31, 2017, which is a \"20 percent plus decline.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    131\n   </footnotemark>\n   Donohue also claims that compound annual growth rates (or \"CAGR\") used in the Peress Report's OLV and FLV calculations are flawed. For example, in the First Cost Channel, the August 2017 Reports apply a growth rate of 0% in the OLV, and a growth rate of -5% in the FLV, although Donohue's analysis of the Debtors' financials showed an actual growth rate for calendar year 2017 of -18.25% for that channel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    132\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, in the International Licensing Channel, the August 2017 Reports apply a growth rate of -2.5% in the OLV, and a growth rate of -7.5% in the FLV, while Donohue's analysis showed an actual growth rate of -33.08% in that channel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As often happens in a bankruptcy case, two qualified, experienced professionals have arrived at very different conclusions about the value of an asset. Section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code fixes the amount of a creditor's secured claim based on the value of the property that is subject to the creditor's lien.\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 506(a) further provides, in pertinent part, that \"value shall be determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of such property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \" 'proposed disposition or use' of the collateral is of paramount importance\n   to the valuation question.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Here, we do not have to wonder about the proposed disposition of the collateral; it was sold at the \u00a7 363 Sale. THL values the Intellectual Property at $ 22.561 million, although the total Sales Proceeds were $ 24,250,090.14. THL argues that those Sale Proceeds should be allocated among the Company's assets in equal proportion to their respective values (based upon THL's valuation of other assets which is discussed below) as follows: 82.76% of the Sale Proceeds (or $ 20.02 million) should be allocated to Intellectual Property; 5.14% (or $ 1.25 million) to Accounts Receivable, and 12.11% (or $ 2.94 million) to inventory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n   This position implies that the \u00a7 363 Sale resulted in a significant discount and the Debtors did not receive fair market value or reasonably equivalent value for the purchased assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n   Polk labels this as THL's \"Discount Theory\" and argues that it is inconsistent with the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the Sale Order, which was negotiated and agreed to by the parties, including THL. In particular, the Court entered the following findings of fact in the Sale Order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (i) The sales process engaged in by the Debtors and the Purchaser, including, without limitation, the Auction, which was conducted in accordance with the Bid Procedures and the Bid Procedures Order, and the negotiation of the AP A, was at arm's length, non-collusive, in good faith, and substantively and procedurally fair to all parties in interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   (ii) The form and total consideration to be realized by the Debtors under the APA constitutes fair value, fair, full and adequate consideration, reasonably equivalent value and reasonable market value for the Purchased Assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   (iii) The consideration provided by the Purchaser for the Purchased Assets pursuant to the APA (i) is fair and reasonable, (ii) is the highest and best offer for the Purchased Assets, (iii) will provide a greater recovery for the Debtors' creditors and estates than would be provided by any other practical available alternative, and (iv) constitutes reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration under the Bankruptcy Code and under the laws of the United States, and each state, territory, possession and the District of Columbia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The \u00a7 363 Sale was held pursuant to a fair and open process, other interested\n   parties were invited to - - and did - - participate in the auction, and the result represents fair and reasonable consideration for the time, place and manner of the \u00a7 363 Sale. I am unprepared to conclude otherwise. The auction result set the value of the collateral, and the issue now before me is to determine the appropriate allocation of those Sale Proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   When considered in light of the facts and circumstances of this case, I conclude that THL's valuation of the Intellectual Property is not the best assessment for this particular-purpose. Peress' Report adopted an appraisal exercise that valued the Intellectual Property as of June 2017 and did not consider certain significant and relevant data points that occurred after the August 2017 Reports, including the chapter 11 filings, the GBG Transaction, the collapse of the GBG Transaction, the transition to a quick \u00a7 363 Sale, and the result of the \u00a7 363 Sale. THL's valuation did not consider updated post-petition financial data. Although THL's expert adjusted the report by deleting any value attributed to the Debtors' Retail Channel, I agree with Polk's argument that this adjustment fails to consider how closing retail stores could impact other business channels, through lack of brand presence or interruption to consumer engagement. Moreover, the main variance between the two expert reports mostly centered on the First Cost and Licensing Business Channels. THL's valuation did not update the growth rates to reflect impairment of the business in those channels in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Polk's valuation, while more reliable for the purpose of allocating the Sales Proceeds, also suffers from some flaws resulting in a low value. Polk's market approach also skews too low by cherry-picking lowball offers and relying on THL's credit bid, which I've previously decided did not set the value of the Intellectual Property. For these reasons, I conclude that the high end of the Polk valuation ($ 14 million) is still too low. After reviewing the two appraisals together, I conclude that the appropriate amount of the Sales Proceeds that should be allocated to the value of the Intellectual Property is $ 15.6 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   However, this conclusion does not end the valuation of the Term Priority Defined Collateral. The parties amended the definition of Intellectual Property in the Final DIP Order to the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   The term \"\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Property\n   </em>\n   \" shall mean all intellectual and similar property of every kind and nature now owned or hereafter acquired by any Loan Party, including inventions, designs, Patents, Copyrights, Licenses (as defined below), Trademarks, Trade Secrets, Domain Names, confidential and proprietary information, including, without limitation, all trade secrets, technology, ideas, know-how, formulae and customer lists, any and all intellectual property rights in computer software and computer software products (including without limitation, source codes, object codes, data and related documentation), any and all design rights owned or used by such Loan Party, all other intellectual property rights of every description,\n   <em>\n    and in each case all goodwill associated therewith\n   </em>\n   , and with respect to the foregoing, any proceeds thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, any DIP Collateral to which the Intellectual Property is affixed or applied but does not otherwise constitute intellectual property in accordance with this definition shall not be deemed to be Intellectual Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   This revised definition includes \"all goodwill associated\" with the Intellectual Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   THL argues that it holds the lien against the Debtors' brand, which it claims is \"by far\" the most valuable asset of a footwear company like Aerosoles. I agree that the Term Priority Defined Collateral includes value allocated for goodwill associated with the Intellectual Property. However, I must first decide how to value the working capital assets - - or the DIP Priority Collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   (3)\n   <em>\n    The DIP Priority Collateral\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The DIP Collateral includes a rather exhaustive list of the Debtors' assets and property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DIP Priority Collateral is defined as \"all DIP Collateral other than Term Priority Collateral.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   THL argues that the only valuable DIP Priority Collateral that was sold in the \u00a7 363 Sale was the Debtors' inventory and accounts receivable. THL relied on the expert report and testimony of Steven J. Hazel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n   who ascribed a value of $ 3.3 million to the Debtors' inventory and $ 1.4 million to the Accounts Receivable, for a total DIP Priority Collateral value of $ 4.7 million as of the closing date of the \u00a7 363 Sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Polk, on the other hand, relied on the expert report and testimony of Henry F. Owsley,\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n   who remarked that the \"balance sheet book values of inventory and net receivables is a fair proxy for the value of these assets,\" and noted that the value of the Debtors' inventory and net receivables was $ 6.98 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n   His conclusion rests on recognizing the \u00a7 363 Sale as a going concern sale, Alden's comments in the sales transcript that it purchased the assets at face value, and finding no other reason to write-down the inventory and receivables.\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   Owsley also valued certain inventory deposits at 50% of \"face value\" (or $ 1,175 million), which Owsley determined accounted for the risk of acquiring the inventory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Owsley valued the working capital assets in the DIP Priority Collateral in the total amount of $ 8.155 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   At issue in the two appraisals is how to characterize the \u00a7 363 Sale. Owsley refers to it as a \"going concern\" sale,\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n   while Hazel notes that, in an auction setting, buyers seek to purchase working capital assets at a significant discount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both appraisers raise valid points. \"[W]hen assets are sold in bankruptcy as part of the business as a going concern, going concern value, as opposed to liquidation value, is appropriate under section 506(a)(1).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Here, the Debtors' assets were not liquidated in a rapid, piece-meal fashion. Instead, the assets were sold together in an orderly process, that included (i) marketing the company by Piper Jaffray, (ii) entering into an arms-length asset purchase agreement with a stalking horse bidder, (iii) holding an auction under approved bidding procedures that included a competitive bidding environment, and (iv) resulting in the fair, reasonable and adequate consideration for those assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time, it cannot be overlooked that this particular \"going concern\" sale was held in a expeditious fashion after the proposed chapter 11 plan failed, which attracted the interests of value-oriented investors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both appraisers recognized that the concept of going concern versus liquidation is not a binary \"either/or\" situation; instead, a company's status appears on a spectrum between the sale of a true, financially healthy going concern business and a forced liquidation - - with an orderly liquidation somewhere in between.\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n   I review the working capital asset appraisals, then, in this light, noting that Owsley's appraisal is too light on analysis, whereas Hazel's pen is a little too sharp for this situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Owsley valued the Debtors' net accounts receivable at their book value of $ 1.86 million and he saw no reason to further discount them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hazel, on the other hand, adjusted the book value of the net accounts receivable based on their age and collectability and valued the accounts receivable at $ 1.4 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n   The net book value for the receivables includes adjustments based upon \"charge backs\" and \"doubtful accounts\" for aged accounts receivable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hazel, however, applies a 10% discount on the current receivables to account for \"potential accuracy problems\" because people have just received the invoices and, ultimately, there will be a bad-debt analysis and the amount may not be 100% collectible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hazel also applies a 100% reduction (or, rather, no value) for receivables over 60 days, noting that, in his experience, people valuing receivables \"don't ascribe a value to AR over 60 days. Banks don't do it. Manufacturing companies don't do it. Buyers don't do it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n   While 1 find Hazel's testimony informative and helpful, his valuation skews too far below the adjustments already made in the net accounts receivable book value. Therefore, I conclude that the appropriate value allocated to the Debtors' accounts receivable is $ 1.6 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The two appraisers' opinions vary most with respect to inventory. The first issue is whether the inventory deposits have any value at all. The inventory deposits represent deposits for inventory ordered from foreign manufacturers. Hazel determined that the inventory deposits had no value to the buyer, citing the possibility that the foreign manufacturers or agents might not honor the contracts and deliver the inventory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n   Owsley, on the other hand, recognized the risk by applying a 50% reduction\n   to the $ 2.35 million book value for the inventory deposits, valuing them at $ 1,175 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the end of the auction, Alden attributed $ 1.15 million for the inventory deposits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    164\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, I conclude that the inventory deposits had some value and should be valued at $ 1.15 million for purposes of the allocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Owsley again used the Debtors' book value in his appraisal to determine that the Debtors' inventory should be valued at $ 5.12 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    165\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hazel analyzed the inventory and valued it at $ 3.3 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hazel testified that he analyzed the age and seasonality of the inventory, as well as the obsolescence of fashion-type inventory, such as footwear, in which trends can change quickly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    167\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hazel adjusted the inventory by discounting the value as follows: 100% discount for pre-2017 inventory; 75% discount for spring 2017 inventory (when the Debtors had issues with a new sourcing agent); 50% discount for fall 2017 inventory due to aging; 30% discount for spring 2018 and forward inventory due, in part, to the issues arising from impairment of existing sales channels.\n   <footnotemark>\n    168\n   </footnotemark>\n   The value allocated to the Debtor's inventory should be in an amount between the Debtors' book value and the Hazel valuation, with less discount for the current inventory. I conclude that the appropriate valuation for the inventory should be $ 4.5 million. Accordingly, the value allocated to accounts receivable, inventory and inventory deposits is rounded up to $ 7.25 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   (4)\n   <em>\n    Residual Value\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   If the Sales Proceeds of $ 24.25 million are allocated $ 15.6 million to Intellectual Property and $ 7.25 million to the working capital assets, this leaves a Sales Proceeds balance of $ 1.4 million to be allocated between THL and Polk. Polk, relying on its experts, argues that this residual value represents goodwill related to the value to the buyer of maintaining business continuity through the company's books and records, workforce, contractual relationships, vendor relationships and customer relationships.\n   <footnotemark>\n    169\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Donohue's expert report, he explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   The amount paid to acquire an ongoing enterprise beyond the value associated with individual assets is often referred to as goodwill. Goodwill from a financial reporting perspective is an asset representing the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Assets such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, land, equipment, deposits, trademarks, patents, domain names, noncompetition agreements, databases, software, leases, licenses, backlog, customer contracts, customer lists, customer relationships and license agreements would all be considered assets that can be individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill would therefore be the value paid to acquire a business beyond the values\n   associated with these types of individual assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    170\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Polk claims that the remaining Sales Proceeds are either general intangibles that are part of the DIP Priority Collateral, or Undefined Collateral Proceeds that must be distributed to Polk pursuant to the subordination agreement set forth in paragraph 23(b)(v) of the Final DIP Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Not so fast, argues THL. As discussed above, the Final DIP Order amended the definition of Intellectual Property specifically to include all goodwill associated with the Intellectual Property. And THL asserts that any part of the Sale Proceeds attributable to goodwill arises from or is associated with the Intellectual Property which, in addition to Patents, Copyrights, Licenses and Trademarks, also includes items like trade secrets, technology, ideas, know-how, formulae and customer lists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    171\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, THL claims that the goodwill associated with Intellectual Property cannot be considered Undefined Collateral Proceeds because it falls within the Term Priority Defined Collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   THL's expert, Hazel, asserted that the \u00a7 363 Sale was a \"bargain purchase,\" in which the value of the assets exceeded the purchase price and, therefore, goodwill is negative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    172\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, if the value of the assets is determined to be less than the purchase price, Hazel agreed that one could conclude that the buyer paid for goodwill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Here, I have decided that the value of the hard assets is less than the purchase price. I agree with Owsley that, under these circumstances, this sale tends more toward a going concern sale than a forced liquidation. Black's Law Dictionary defines \"going concern value\" as \"[t]he value of a commercial enterprise's assets or of the enterprise itself as an active business with future earning power, as opposed to the liquidation value of the business or its assets. Going concern value includes, for example, goodwill.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    173\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \"Typically, goodwill is created when the price paid for the acquired company exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired minus the liabilities assumed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    174\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his expert report, Hazel notes: \"[t]he International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms defines 'goodwill' as an 'intangible asset arising as a result of name, reputation, customer loyalty, location, products and similar factors not separately identified.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    175\n   </footnotemark>\n   Peress agreed\n   <footnotemark>\n    176\n   </footnotemark>\n   and also defines \"Goodwill Value\" as \"[t]he value attributable to the elements of intangible assets above the identifiable tangible and intangible assets\n   employed in a business.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n   A rationale for creating goodwill has been described as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   Often (though not always), the amount paid for assets above the fair value of those assets represents the value to the acquirer of owning those assets. Thus, goodwill is often created as a result of a buyer's expectations to benefit from controlling the target company, synergies and other economic benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Polk argues that, in this case, the going concern value arises from acquiring items such as books and records or an experienced workforce. THL's expert, Hazel, asserts that, in the context of a bankruptcy auction, a buyer would not assign value to items such as books and records or the workforce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also testified that, in his experience, goodwill is not associated with assets such as inventory or accounts receivable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, it makes sense that the majority of any going concern value arises from goodwill attributed to the Debtors' Intellectual Property, or as Hazel notes, \"[t]he Company's IP - - patents, copyrights, licenses, trademarks, etc. - - are the very assets that inherently increase in value when valued as part of a going concern.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    181\n   </footnotemark>\n   As pointed out in a hypothetical on Donohue's cross-examination, if the buyer purchased the working capital, Intellectual Property, synergies and business processes, but changed the name of the products and no longer used the brand \"Aerosoles,\" the value of those purchased assets likely would be impaired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    182\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   THL specifically intended that the definition of Intellectual Property in the Final DIP Order ensure that its collateral captured any goodwill value. The record before me establishes that the lion's share of the residual value is not \"unidentifiable\" assets, but identifiable as goodwill associated with the Intellectual Property. I conclude, therefore, that $ 1.2 million of the residual value from the \u00a7 363 Sale should be allocated to goodwill associated with the Intellectual Property, which is part of the Term Priority Defined Collateral belonging to THL. The remaining $ 200,000 is allocated to general intangibles, which fall within the DIP Priority Collateral belonging to Polk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   (5)\n   <em>\n    Reallocation of THL's Adequate Protection Payments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In Polk's objection to THL's Allocation Motion, Polk argues that the adequate protection payments made to THL during the Debtors' case must be reallocated because THL is undersecured. A creditor's right to receive adequate protection payments is calculated at the time adequate protection is sought.\n   <footnotemark>\n    183\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Final DIP Order includes a finding of fact that, as of the petition date, THL was an oversecured creditor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    184\n   </footnotemark>\n   Circumstances changed rapidly throughout the course of this troubled case. The record does not explain when THL's claim was no longer oversecured or whether it matters. If THL was no longer entitled to apply adequate protection payments to interest and post-petition\n   costs, then THL would apply such payments to reduce its principal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    185\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record before me does not contain sufficient evidence to determine when, if at all, THL's adequate protection payments should be reallocated to principal payments. Polk's request for reallocation of adequate protection payments is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   (6)\n   <em>\n    The Adversary Proceeding\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In the Joint Pretrial Memorandum, the parties stipulated that \"[p]ursuant to the Lender Allocation set forth in the Lender Agreement, as of the closing of the 363 Sale ... on March 6, 2018, THL owed Polk $ 1,991,162.25 (the \"Lender Reimbursement\").\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    186\n   </footnotemark>\n   The same filing states that the \"parties dispute whether THL must pay the Lender Reimbursement prior to the resolution this allocation dispute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    187\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In the Adversary Proceeding Complaint, Polk claims that paragraph 2(f) of the Lender Agreement provides that the Lender Reimbursement must be paid immediately following consummation of the \u00a7 363 Sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    188\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attached to the Complaint are three letters: (i) a letter dated April 2, 2018 from Polk's counsel to THL's counsel requesting immediate payment of the Lender Allocation; (ii) THL's counsel's response dated April 3, 2018 stating that the Final DIP Order provides that the Sale Proceeds are to be held in an escrow account pending agreement or decision by the Court, and further noting THL is committed to continuing discussions with Polk about the appropriate allocation of the Sales Proceeds; and (iii) Polk's counsel's response dated April 4, 2018, arguing that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   Section 2(f) of the Lender Agreement is clear: THL's obligation to pay the Closing Amount to Polk 33 is an independent obligation of THL separate and apart from any obligations, issues, disputes, or provisions relating to the distribution of the sale proceeds pursuant to the order approving the 363 Sale. Thus, pursuant to Section 2(f) of the Lender Agreement, the Closing Amount [Lender Allocation] is due and payable to Polk 33. If THL refuses to make the payment immediately, Polk 33 will seek to enforce all rights and remedies, including an order from the Bankruptcy Court compelling such payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    189\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   I agree that the plain language of the Lender Agreement is clear: THL sought to improperly tie resolution of the Lender Agreement issues to the Sale Proceeds allocation issues. However, THL's agreement to pay the Lender Allocation was not properly conditioned upon release of the Sale Proceeds. Polk did not control payment of the Sale Proceeds. THL refused to pay Polk the Lender Allocation upon closing of the \u00a7 363 Sale, thus breaching its obligation under the Lender Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In the Complaint, Polk seeks judgment in the amount of the Lender Allocation, plus (i) pre-and post-judgment interest thereon, and (ii) attorney's fees and expenses\n   incurred in connection with the adversary proceeding. The Lender Agreement provides that it \"shall be governed by and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of law principles.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    190\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   New York law provides that \"[i]nterest shall be recovered upon a sum awarded because of a breach of performance of a contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    191\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In an action at law for breach of contract, 'prejudgment interest is recoverable as of right.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    192\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[S]tatutory interest under New York law accrues as simple interest at a rate of 'nine per centum per annum.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    193\n   </footnotemark>\n   New York law further provides that prejudgment interest \"shall be computed from the earliest ascertainable date the cause of action existed, except that interest upon damages incurred thereafter shall be computed from the date incurred.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    194\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   THL's obligation to pay the Lender Allocation was not dependent upon resolution of the issues regarding allocation of the Sales Proceeds. THL breached its agreement to pay its share of the expenses arising from continued operation of the Debtors and the \u00a7 363 Sale. Pursuant to New York law, Polk is entitled to recover pre-judgment interest on the unpaid Lender Allocation from the closing date of the \u00a7 363 Sale through the date this matter was taken under advisement (August 29, 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    195\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Polk also asked to recover attorneys' fees associated with the adversary proceeding. \"Under New York law, attorneys' fees are treated as the ordinary incidents of litigation, and may not be awarded to the prevailing party unless authorized by agreement between the parties, statute, or court rule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    196\n   </footnotemark>\n   Polk does not identify any such contract provision, statute or rule that would provide a basis for an award of attorneys' fees in this case. The request for recovery of attorneys' fees is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, I conclude that the allocation of the Sales Proceeds should be $ 16.8 million to the Term Priority Defined Collateral, $ 7.45 million to the DIP Priority Collateral.

Also relevant to this discussion, Donohue noted that Black's Law Dictionary defines \"goodwill\" as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-324\">\n    A business's reputation, patronage, and other intangible assets that are considered when appraising the business, esp. for purchase; the ability to earn income in excess of the income that would be expected from the business viewed as a mere collection of assets. Because an established business's trademark or servicemark is a symbol of goodwill, trademark infringement is a form of theft of goodwill. By the same token, when a trademark is assigned, the goodwill that it carries is also assigned.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-325\">\n    <em>\n     Goodwill\n    </em>\n    , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    JX 64 at 14 \u00b6 27.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"177\">\n   <p id=\"p-326\">\n    JX 66 at 44.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"178\">\n   <p id=\"p-327\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Shaked,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    note 174, at 298.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"179\">\n   <p id=\"p-328\">\n    JX 69 at 6; Tr. 6/29/2018 at 260:8-260:24 (Hazel).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"180\">\n   <p id=\"p-329\">\n    Tr. 6/29/2018 at 265:19-266:16 (Hazel).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"181\">\n   <p id=\"p-330\">\n    JX 69 at 8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"182\">\n   <p id=\"p-331\">\n    Tr. 7/13/2018 at 186:8-187:10 (Donohue).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"183\">\n   <p id=\"p-332\">\n    <em>\n     Fremont Fin.
