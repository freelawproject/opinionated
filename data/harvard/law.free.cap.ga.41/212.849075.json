The instrument contains the following words: \u201cI give and devise unto them (his three sons) and their heirs, the following property, all my estate, both real and personal, consisting of lands, money and evidence of debt, horses, cattle, hogs and all other stock of all descriptions that I may die possessed of, to them and their heirs,\u201d etc.:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AK2\"><em>Held, </em>That this was a testamentary paper and not a deed; that no present interest in the property was conveyed under i.t, but only such of the described property as the maker of the instrument should die possessed of was conveyed by it. If he was possessed of all the property mentioned in the instrument at the time of his death, then it would have passed under it if legally executed, but if he was not possessed of all, or any of the described property at the time of his death, then none of it would have been conveyed to his three sons. The instrument conveys only such of the described property as the maker thereof \u201cmay die possessed of.\u201d No present interest in the property was conveyed to the sons, and until the death of the maker of the instrument, no one could know what portion of the property described therein he would die possessed of; consequently, the instrument conveyed only such portion of the described property as he might be possessed of at the time of his death, and is in law a testamentary disposition of the property, to take effect at the death of the maker of the instrument.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">Construction of Contracts.

Wynn of the second part, his heirs and assigns, to be his at my death and the death of my wife, Elizabeth Wynn.\u201d Wynn <em>v. </em>Wynn, 112 Ga. 214, 37 S. E. Rep. 378. In this case, the court said: \u201cThe record in this case presents a single question for decision: Is the paper therein contained a deed or will? While the question is single, it is by no means simple. The paper was in form, except as hereinafter alluded to, a warranty deed, and was executed in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom was a justice of the peace. The only language in the instrument which would not ordinarily be found in a warranty deed -was that quoted in the headnote. There have been many cases before this court in which the question to be determined was whether the paper under consideration was a deed or will. In .the following cases the instruments, though having some of' the characteristics of a deed, have been held to be testamentary in character: Hester <em>v. </em>Young, 2 Ga. 31; Mallery <em>v. </em>Dudley, 4 Ga. 52; Cravy <em>v. </em>Rawlins, 8 Ga. 450; Symmes <em>v. </em>Arnold, 10 Ga. 506; Johnson <em>v. </em>Yancey, 20 Ga. 707; Brewer <em>v. </em>Baxter, 41 Ga. 212; Arnold <em>v. </em>Arnold, 62 Ga. 628; Sperber <em>v. </em>Balster, 66 Ga. 317; Blackstock <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 67 Ga. 768; Johnson <em>v. </em>Sirmans, 69 Ga. 617; Ward <em>v. </em>Campbell, 73 Ga. 97; Barnes <em>v. </em>Stephens, 107 Ga. 436, 33 S. E. Rep. 399. In the following cases the papers were declared to be deeds: Moye <em>v. </em>Kittrell, 29 Ga. 677; Johnson <em>v. </em>Hines, 31 Ga. 720; Daniel <em>v. </em>Veal, 32 Ga. 589; Dismukes <em>v. </em>Parrott, 56 Ga. 513; Williams <em>v. </em>Tolbert, 66 Ga. 127; Youngblood <em>v. </em>Youngblood, 74 Ga. 614; White <em>v. </em>Hopkins, 80 Ga. 154, 4 S. E. Rep. 863; Seals <em>v. </em>Pierce, 83 Ga. 787, 10 S. E. Rep. 589; Worley <em>v. </em>Daniel, 90 Ga. 650, 16 S. E. Rep. 938; Owen <em>v. </em>Smith, 91 Ga. 564, 18 S. E. Rep. 527; Goff <em>v </em>Davenport, 96 Ga. 423, 23 S. E. Rep. 395; Guthrie <em>v. </em>Guthrie, 105 Ga. 86, 31 S. E. Rep. 40; Gay <em>v. </em>Gay, 108 Ga. 739, 32 S. E. Rep. 846.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>WARNER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The only question presented on the argument of this case is, whether the paper writing set forth in the record is a deed or testamentary paper. The Court below held it to be a deed, and that is assigned for error here. A paper having the formalities of a deed may, notwithstanding, be a will. In determining whether an instrument be a deed or a will, the Court will not consider what the maker believed it to be, but what, in point of law, it is. The intention of the maker as to the character of the estate conveyed, is the criterion by which the Court will determine whether a given paper is a deed or a will, and if the intention gathered from the whole paper is, that the estate is not to pass, or the instrument to take effect until his death, it is a will and not a deed. Hester v. Young, 2d Kelldy\u2019s Reports, 31. The paper writing set forth in the record, conveys only such of the described property as the maker thereof \u201cmay die possessed ofno present interest in the property was conveyed to the three sons, and until the death of the maker of the instrument, no one could know what portion of the property described therein he would die possessed of. Consequently, the instrument conveyed only such portion of the described property as he might be possessed of at the time of his death, and is, in law, a testamentary disposition of the property, to take effect at the death of the maker of the instrument, and if legally executed, may be proved as such in the proper Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Let the judgment of the Court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
