January Term, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-8\">Towner brought ejectment against Bugg. He showed by his deed and by his oath, that in 1855 he bought the lot, had been in possession from that date up to 1863, when he left the country, leaving Bugg, as his slave, in possession, with a promise to Bugg that no wages would be required from him if he would keep intruders off the place, keep it in good order and pay Towner\u2019s taxes till his return; that Bugg did not pay the taxes, nor keep said place in good order, and when \u25a0he returned, after emancipation, refused to give him possesr sion. It came out in evidence that Bugg furnished part of the, money which paid his price when Towner bought him. The defense offered to show by Bugg and by admissions of Towner, that Bugg\u2019s former master was dead and Bugg was about to be sold and begged Towner to buy him, let him re^ pay the price and then be actually free, though nominally Towner\u2019s slave; that Towner agreed to this, bought him and Bugg repaid the price, and that Towner agreed to buy this place for Bugg, let Bugg pay for it, and to hold the title for Bugg\u2019s benefit, and that Bugg did so pay for it and had oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>cupied it as his own. All this testimony was ruled out, upon the ground that while Bugg was a slave he could not make a contract. The plaintiff had a verdict for the premises in dispute. Bugg moved for a new trial, because of the rejection of said evidence. The *case hung fire, but finally a new trial was refused, and that it assigned as error. \u25a0 The only description of Towner\u2019s deed in the bill of exceptions, was this: \u201cPlaintiff then offered deed from Zemula Walker, dated December, 1855, to Walker Towner, made by attorney-in-fact, Joseph Burch. The power and the deed both offered and admitted by the Court in evidence, the deed being to the land in dispute.\u201d The certificate to the bill of exceptions was in the usual form. But the brief of evidence had never been agreed to by counsel, and the Judge had approved it in these words only: \u201cI cannot be supposed to recollect the testimony (after a year\u2019s time) given in before me on the trial, yet I believe .this brief is correct in substance. I know that all testimony going to prove a contract with a slave, as to freedom and purchasing land with proceeds of his labor, was ruled out by me on the trial.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the writ of error, because said deed was not copied in the bill of exceptions, and because the Judge had not certified that the evidence was correctly set forth.

He could not set up the illegal contract to_ recover profits realized thereunder, nor could the agents set up the illegal contract for the purpose of defeating a recovery by the principal of the money deposited with them, and which was held by them. It did not matter whether the money sued for by the principal was the identical money furnished by him, or whether the agents_ deposited the money so furnished in bank with other deposits of theirs, and used such money for filling margins for futures and afterwards replaced them to the credit of the principal. The question is, whose money is it, the agent\u2019s or the principal\u2019s? Nor does this stand in the position of an executed contract in which both parties are in pari delicto. \u201cNor do (McDougald <em>v. </em>Barnard), 3 Ga. 171; (Bugg <em>v. </em>Towner), 41 Ga. 315; (Puckett <em>v. </em>Roquemore), 55 Ga. 235, (Heineman <em>v. </em>Newman), 55 Ga. 262, (Thompson <em>v. </em>Cummings), 68 Ga. 124; (Cunningham <em>v. </em>National Bank, 71 Ga. 400, and the same case decided January 12, 1886, (National Bank <em>v. </em>Cunningham, 75 Ga. 366), collide with this judgment.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A5J\">delivering the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">By the Act of 1818, Cobb\u2019s New Digest, page 991, every will, deed, contract, agreement or stipulation, or other instrument in writing, or by way of parol, whether by way of trust or otherwise, made for the purpose of effecting or endeavoring to effect the manumission of any slave or slaves, either directly, by conferring or attempting to confer freedom on such slave or slaves, or indirectly, or virtually, by allowing and securing, or attempting to allow or secure to such *slave or slaves, the privilege of working for himself, free from the control of the owner, or enjoying the profits of his labor, are declared to be \u25a0utterly null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">In this case, the defendant sought to attack the deed which was the foundation of plaintiff\u2019s title, by showing that it was made in aid of a contract between plaintiff and defendant, by which plaintiff, for a consideration, undertook to emancipate the defendant, who was then his slave, in this State, and' to locate \u25a0 him upon the tract of land in dispute, which defendant alleges was paid for with his money, and the deed taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>in the name of the plaintiff for his use and benefit, in furtherance of this illegal design. If such was the fact, and the defendant was placed in possession of the land by the plaintiff, with intent to evade the law and carry out the illegal purpose, we hold that the Courts of this State, under the rule repeatedly announced by this Court, will not aid plaintiff to recover the possession of the land from the defendant. If the defendant\u2019s version of the case is correct, the parties were engaged in an 'illegal transaction, in violation of the laws arid public .policy of this State, in existence at that time. And it makes not difference whether the illegal transaction is malum prohibitum or malum in se. In neither case will the Courts of this State interfere to grant relief to either party. But they will leave the parties where they find them, no matter whether the illegality of the contract appears from the plaintiff\u2019s case, or is set up by way of defense. See Howell, administrator, v. Fountain et al., 3d Georgia, 182; Cary <em>v. </em>Smith, 11th Georgia, on page 547; and Alford <em>v. </em>Burke, 21st Georgia, 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">It is objected that the defendant should not he heard, to set up the illegality of the transaction for his own benefit. The reply is, that Courts sustain such a defense, not for the sake of the defendant, but upon general principles of public policy. In Holman v. Johnson, Cowper 343, Lord Mansfield uses the following language, which has heretofore been approved and adopted by this Court, as a' correct statement of the rule on this subject:</p>\n<p id=\"AWn\">\u201cThe objection that a contract is immoral or illegal, as *between plaintiff and defendant, sounds at all times very ill in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his sake, however, that the objection is ever allowed, but it is founded on general principles of policy, which the defendant has the advantage of, contrary to real justice, as between him and the plaintiff, by accident, if I may so say. The principle of public policy is this, ex dolo malo non oritur actio. No Court will lend its aid to a man upon an illegal or an immoral act. If from the plaintiff\u2019s own statement, or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the transgression of a positive law of this country, then the Courts say he has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the Court goes, not for the sake of the defendant, but because it will not lend its aid to-such a plaintiff. So if the plaintiff and defendant should change sides and the defendant were to bring his action against the plaintiff, the latter would then have the advantage of it, for where both are equally at fault, potior est conditio defendentis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The object of the rule is to discourage discountenace all illegal and immoral transactions, which violate sound public policy, and not to aid or favor either party. And we see no good reason why the defendant should not be heard to set up this defense to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s action. It matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>not how the fact is brought to the attention of the Court; whenever it is ascertained, the law denies its aid to either party, it leaves them where it finds them, it closes its temples against them, and says, your \u201cpoluted hands shall not touch the pure fountains of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">We hold that the Court erred in this case, in ruling out the evidence, offered by the defendant, to show that this purchase was in fact made for his benefit, while he was a slave, and that the land was paid for in whole, or in part, by his money, and that he was placed 'in possession by the plaintiff in furtherance of such illegal transaction. We do not know how far the evidence, if admitted, would have gone to establish these facts; but, if it had been sufficient, we hold that plaintiff had no right to the assistance of the Court to recover the possession of the premises from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
