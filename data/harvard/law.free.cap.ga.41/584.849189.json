Shaw &amp; Son as their property, they having, as they alleged, purchased said cotton in pursuance of an agreement between them that the claimants should furnish provisions and supplies to enable the defendant in fi. fa. to make a crop for the year 1866. The claimants did not attempt to enforce any lien upon the cotton under the provisions of the Code, if, indeed, they could have done so in this case. The jury found the property subject, and a motion made for a new trial on several grounds, which was refused by the Court:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b476-10\"><em>Held, </em>That there was no error in the Court below in refusing to continue the case to .enable the defendant to open the judgment on the statement of facts presented by the record, there being no affida-' vit showing such a statement of facts as would have authorized the judgment to have been opened.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b476-11\">CHARGE OF COURT\u2014NEW TRIALS\u2014EVIDENCE.\u2014The Court charged the jury, \u201cthat, if they should believe from the evidence, that the claimants under their contract with Hendry, had the right <em>to </em>demand the eight bales of cotton, and that Hendry was bound to deliver the same to him, in that case they should find for the claimants\u201d:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b476-12\"><em>Held, </em>That the charge of the Court, in view of the facts of the case, was quite as favorable to the claimants as they had a right to demand, and the evidence being conflicting on some of. the main points involved, there was no error in the Court below in refusing to grant the new trial upon any of the grounds stated therein\u2014the rejection of the evidence was not sufficient, for had it been admitted, it could not have changed the result under the law applicable to the facts of the case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-13\">Lien. Relief. Before Judge Harrell. Randolph Superior Court. May Term, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-14\">On the 12th of May, 1866, Gunn obtained a judgment against Alexander B. Hendry. The fi. fa. issued thereupon was levied upon eight bales of cotton, as the property of Hendry, in November, 1866, and A. Shaw &amp; Son claimed the same. Subsequently, the fi. fa. was levied upon certain seed cotton, and Hendry filed his affidavit under the Relief Act to open and scale said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>When the claim case was called for trial, claimants moved *to continue it till the matter of scaling the judgment should be tried. The motion was overruled. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then read in evidence the fi. fa.; proved that said eight bales were part of the crop raised by Hendry in 1866, and were, at the date the levy, in the hands of Hen-dry\u2019s warehouseman, and closed. The claimants and Hendry then testified, that, in the Spring of 1866, Hendry, having land and laborers, was unable to carry on his farm, and verbally agreed with Shaw &amp; Son that if they would furnish him and his laborers with sufficient supplies to carry on said farm, they should have the crop made, so far as necessary to repay them, and Hendry should have the excess, if any; that, pursuant to this arrangement, they furnished supplies, etc., amounting to $1,025 00; that Hendry made twenty-one bales of cotton that year, paid off his laborers, and, by consent of Shaw &amp; Son, sold part of the crop to another person, to whom Hendry owed an account for' supplies, at thirty cents per pound, and got all over his account in cash, and appropriated it tO' his own use; and that, after said levy, Hendry consented that they should take said eight bales at twenty-six cents per pound, in settlement of said account, and the account had been settled in that way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">They proposed to testify that the laborers were about to leave Hendry because of his inability to pay them, and that this was prevented only by .Shaw &amp; Son pledging themselves and their store to the laborers for their wages. But the Court ruled out this evidence. The- Court charged the jury, that if they believed, from the evidence, that claimants, under their contract with Hendry, had the right to demand the eight bales of cotton, and that Hendry was bound to deliver the same to him, they should find for the claimants. The jury found the property subject to said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-7\">Claimants moved for a new trial, upon the grounds, that the Court erred in refusing the continuance and in rejecting said offered testimony, and because the verdict was contrary to said charge, against the law, and strongly and decidedly against the weight of the evidence. The Court refused a new trial and error is assigned on \u2022 said grounds.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-8-pl-split\">*E. t\u00ed. Platt; B'. S.
