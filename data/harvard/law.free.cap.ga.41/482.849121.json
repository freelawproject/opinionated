Arrest of Judgment. Before Judge Harrell. Webster Superior Court. September Term, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-8\">Lydia Brightwell was tried for arson in said Court, upon an indictment which charged her with burning an out-house \u201con the 17th of May,\u201d 1870, without stating whether she did so in the day time or night. The jury returned a verdict of \u201cguilty.\u201d Her counsel moved to arrest the judgment because the indictment did not show, nor did the verdict find, whether the burning was in the day time or in the night. The court overruled the motion, and that is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-9\">Hawkins &amp; Burke, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A48\">cited sec. 4310 et seq., and said punishment of arson in day and night time was different.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AUlQ\">*S.

The record ought to show that the defendant is convicted of the offense for which he is sentenced. But this is not the case here. The punishment for \u2018 arson of an outhouse, not in a city or town, is from two to seven years: Revised Code, section 4313. There is no provision that arson in the night shall be punished for any different period.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">It is true section 4318 of the Code provides that \u201carson in the day time shall be punished for ,a less period than arson in the night time.\u201d But' what is this but a rule for the exercise of the -discretion of the Court in selecting the point between two and seven years where he will fix the sentence. In every case it is the duty of the Judge to consider, in fixing the penalty, all the circumstances of mitigation or aggravation. And in this case it is his duty to consider whether the offense was done at night or in the day. This is only one of the circumstances for the consideration of the Judge, and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>not one of the ingredients of the -crime. It stands upon the footing of a charge of murder, based on circumstantial evidence, or of a battery committed under strong provocation. In neither of such cases need the indictment show the peculiarity of the case. It is matter for the Judge alone, and even with him it is only a rule for the exercise of his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
