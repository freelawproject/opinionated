Rebellion. Before Judge Schley. Chatham Superior Court. July, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\">The Mayor and Aldermen of Savannah held the note of Margaret O\u2019Bryne et al., for $6,502 17, dated the 23d of May, \u00cd867, due one day after date, and secured by a mortgage upon realty. They sued upon the note and sought to foreclose the mortgage. So much of the pleadings and incidents of the trial as are necessary for our purpose are as follows: Said note as to $4,232 55 was void, because it was given in settlement of certain amounts assessed against defendants by plaintiff during 1861, 1862, 1863 and 1864, which faxes were assessed for the purpose on plaintiff\u2019s part of aiding and encouraging the then existing rebellion against the United States; and further, that the taxes of those years was used for said purpose, of which the parties had notice when said note was made. By consent the causes were tried together.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8u\">^Plaintiffs read in evidence the note and mortgage. The late city attorney testified that plaintiff neither levied any tax for carrying on said war, nor had increased its taxes or rates of taxation because of the war, and other wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>nesses testified to the same. Plaintiff also introduced evidence to show the basis of settlement which produced said note. It showed that of the consideration of said note, $4,232 55 was for taxes on defendants\u2019 real estate during 1861, 1862, 1863 and 1864, and the balance was for ground rents due the city. Defendants paid no taxes during the war.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\">For the defendant the evidence on this question was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\">A witness said: The printed volume submitted and produced by plaintiff under notice from defendants contain the official reports of the Mayor and Treasurer of the City of Savannah for the years 1861, 1862 and 1863. During these years plaintiff appropriated money to build batteries, to obstruct the Savannah river against the approach of the .forces of the United States, .for the entertainment of Confederate troops, and to carry on a city store established to keep down the price of provisions. Another witness said: During those years plaintiff appropriated money -for the entertainment of Confederate troops, building batteries, obstructing the river against the advanc\u00e9 of United States forces, and the support of a city store and a passport office. Do not know what the purpose of the passport office was, but a passport office is not kept here in times of peace. The amount of money needed for the support of the city would have been no less if these appropriations had not been made, for the money would have been spent for something else.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-9\">Defendants then read in evidence the following portions of the printed reports of the Mayor and Treasurer for the years 1861/ 1862 and 1863, and of the manuscript book containing the Treasurer\u2019s report for 1864:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-10\">MAYOR\u2019S REPORT FOR 1861.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-11\">The expense attending our police organization this year, including the payment for their horses, $45,696 26.

In this promise there was nothing illegal because there was no law against usury when it was made; but this is precisely a case where the consideration was void in part but good in part. The good part, the righteousness of paying back the money, borrowed always was a good consideration to support a promise to pay that money so borrowed and the lawful interest thereon. We hold it good for that purpose and not illegal in any respect, so as to sustain the plea that the whole new contract, made at a time when there was no law at all against usury, was entirely void.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Atq\">delivering the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">\u25a0 1. The city of Savannah as a municipal corporation, has only such power of taxation as is granted to it by the sovereign authority. The right of taxation inheres in the sovereign: 2 Blac. Com., 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">During the existence of the Confederate government,, while the city, as is shown by this record, supported that government against the government of the United States, and the State Government formed part of the Confederacy engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>in conducting war against the government of the United States, the city could claim no grant from the State, as one of the United States, to assess a tax for any purpose. Whatever powers she had while engaged in the war against the United States, under, and in aid of the government of the Confederate States, she derived from the State as a member of that government. Her legal government had been displaced, and she was controlled by a government whose authority depended uppn the success of the armies of the government to which it adhered, and under which it exercised its powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">2. A de facto government, able to maintain its supremacy by its arms, may exercise the power of taxation, and its subjects are bound to obey its laws and pay the tax assessed, as they are unable to resist its authority. It does this by virtue of its exercise of sovereignty while it is supreme. But after it has assessed a tax, if it is overthrown before the tax is collected, and the power of the rightful sovereign is re-established, the tax will not be enforced; as the rightful government will not execute the laws of the government de facto, in imposing burdens, by taxation, for its own support upon the subjects of the government de jure.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">3. In such case we hold that those who were not compelled to pay the tax, during the existence of the government de facto, are no longer liable for it, after the gov-eminent by *which it was imposed has ceased to exist. And those who paid the tax have no remedy, as they can look alone to the government which received it for redress, and that has passed away and can afford none.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">4. As the plaintiffs in error are not now liable to the city of Savannah for any tax assessed by her, during the period while the de facto government of the State and city adhered to the Confederate government, and aided in the war against the government of the United States, a promissory note, given in consideration, of such supposed liability, is void for want of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">5. The note sued on in this case is founded upon two distinct considerations, which, as the record shows, are clearly severable. One is the tax assessed by the de facto government of the city during the war. The other, an amount due the city for ground rent, by contract made prior to the war, and for the tax imposed by the rightful government since the war. The precise amount of war tax, and the exact amount of ground rent and legal tax are clearly ascertainable by reference to the record. A contract may be either entire or severable. In the former, the whole contract stands or falls together. In the latter, the failure of a distinct part, does not void the remainder. The character of the contract in such case is determined by the intention of the parties. See Revised Code, section 2683.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">We hold that the Court should have instructed the jury in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>this case, to deduct the amount of the tax assessed during the war, and to find for the city the amount due for ground rent and for tax assessed by the city authorities since the restoration of legal government over the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
