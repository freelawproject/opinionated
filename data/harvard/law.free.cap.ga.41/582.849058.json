The Court refused to quash iff A iurv was empanelled, Foster was tried and convicted. His counsel moved an arrest of judgment upon said ground and upon others not passed upon here. His refusal to quash the indictment or to arrest the judgment on said grounds, is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-10\">Hood &amp; Kiddoo, John T.

State, 100 - Ga. 361, 28 S. E. Rep. 120, the court said: \u201cIf both parties to the criminal act are married, each is guilty of adultery; if both are single, each is guilty of fornication; if one is married and the other single, each is guilty of adultery and fornication. The act which is now embraced in the section quoted was construed as above indicated in the case of Wasden <em>v. </em>State, 18 Ga. 264, where it was held that a single person who had been guilty of illicit sexual intercourse with a married person was properly indicted for adultery and fornication. In the case of Foster <em>v. </em>State, 41 Ga. 582, it was held that a man and woman charged with one of the offenses named in this section could not be indicted jointly. While Judge McCay in the opinion does say, \u2018One may be guilty of adultery and the other of fornication,\u2019 the question of the form of the indictment was not involved in this case, except so far as related to the provision which required that the two offenders should be separately indicted. Therefore, there was nothing in Foster\u2019s case which is in conflict with Wasden\u2019s case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b475-12\">McCAY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">Section 4460 of the Revised Code, prescribing the penalty for adultery and fornication, or adultery or fornication, distinctly provides that the defendants shall be \u201cseverally\u201d indicted. It is a distinct offense in each. In fact, one may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>guilty of adultery and the other of fornication; and though the punishment is the same,- yet the law, as well as the lexicographers, 'give a distinct name to each offense. Indeed, the moral guilt of the one married is greater than that of the one unmarried. Whether the distinct provision of the Code requiring several indictments is wise or not, is immaterial. \u201cIta lex scripta est,\u201d is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Nor is the waiver of an indictment a waiver of this objection. The presentment must also be several. The form in the Code is the same, whether the grand jury indict or present: Section 4535, Revised Code. We think the demurrer ought to have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
