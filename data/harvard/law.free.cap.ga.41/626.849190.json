Certiorari. Witness. Before Judge Johnson. Muscogee County. Chambers, May, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-8\">Fogarty sued McCardle as administrator of BrassillS' uppn an open account for $31 25, in a-.Justice\u2019s Court. All the items of the account were for medicines furnished to various *persons (we suppose members of -deceased\u2019s family) except five, which were for visits, prescription and medicine, and amounted to $18 50. The account was made out# in favor of \u201cN. J. Fogarty, M. D.,\u201d and against \u201cthe estate of Thomas Brassill.\u201d McCardle, in person, pleaded in writing that said account \u201cis unjust in all particulars\u201d and that \u201cFogarty never was known in this city as a medicial doctor.\u201d The Justice suggested that said pleas were informal, and proposed to draw them in form, and thereupon wrote out what he called the general issue, but put nothing in it denying Fog-arty\u2019s right to charge as physician. Supposing it was all right, the trial was had under said pleading.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-9\">Fogarty then testified that his said services and medicines were worth the sums charged therefor in said account, and that the account was correct. Upon cross-examination, he denied that he had stated to McCardle that he charged nothing for the medicine charged at $2 00 in said account, and said if such thing occurred it applied to some other article gotten by deceased himself. He admitted that he was not licensed as a physician, but said he was a licensed apothecary. McCardle then testified that Fogarty did tell him that he charged nothing for said item charged at $2 00. The Justice- gave judgment against McCardle, as administrator, for the full amount of said account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-10\">A certiorari in proper form, etc., stating the foregoing facts, was presented to Judge Johnson, asking a reversal upon the grounds that said account did not exhibit any indebtedness of said intestate in his lifetime, nor any of said administrator as such; because Fogarty was allowed to testify in his own behalf ; because under Fogarty\u2019s admission he was not entitled to any recovery on said account, and because he had no right to a iud&lt;nnent for said $2 00. Judge Johnson refused to sanction the certiorari, and that is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-11\">Moses &amp; Downing, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACO\">said Fogarty was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>not a competent witness: Code, sec. 3798; 37th Ga.
