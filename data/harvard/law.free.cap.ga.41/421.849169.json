This was allowed.</p><p id=\"b343-11\"> APPELLATE PRACTICE\u2014ERROR TO INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT.\u2014\u201cShortly before the act of 1870 it was held by this court that interlocutory rulings on injunctions, not being final judgments within the meaning of \u00a7 4250 of the Code, could not be brought here at all by a separate writ of error whilst the main cause was pending below. (Nacooche Hydraulic Min. Co. <em>v. </em>Davis,) 40 Ga. 309; (McCree <em>v. </em>Americus,) 41 Ga. 411; (Sparks <em>v. </em>Maxwell,) 41 Ga. 421; (Glass <em>v. </em>Clark,) 41 Ga. 544. The act of 1870 met these decisions by putting an end to all ex parte injunctions and providing for temporary restraining orders in urgent cases until a hearing could be had after notice to the defendant. The hearing provided for was to take place in conformity to the rules of law already existing for granting and dissolving injunctions; that is, what had previously been two proceedings now became one, and whatever showing the 'defendant might formerly have made by answer, affidavits, etc., on a motion to dissolve, was not to be made in resistance to the granting of the injunction. The complainant was to come in with all he could urge in favor of Jhe application, and the defendant with all that he could oppose to it, and thus a full and complete hearing was to be had. Either party was allowed to take up the decision for review in the manner pointed out by section of the Code 3213, to be heard as directed by that and the succeeding section. But we look in vain through the act of 1870 for any separate proceeding to dissolve an injunction, or any right to a writ of error thereon under that act.\u201d Kaufman <em>v. </em>Ferst, 55 Ga. 352.</p><p id=\"b343-12\">\u201cSection 5526 of the Civil Code expressly declares: \u2018No cause shall be carried to the supreme court upon any bill of exceptions, so long as the same is pending in the court below, unless the decision or judgment complained of, if it had been rendered as claimed by the plaintiff in error, would have been a final disposition of the cause, or final as to some material party thereto.\u2019 In the case at bar, it appears only that an interlocutory hearing has been had in the court below, resulting in the granting of a temporary injunction. In no sense was the judgment thus rendered a final disposition of the case, as to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>tiff in error or as to any other \u2018material party thereto. Johnson <em>v. </em>Stewart, 40 Ga. 167; Nacooche Hydraulic Min. Co. <em>v. </em>Davis, 40 Ga. 309; McCree <em>v. </em>Americus, 41 Ga. 411; Sparks <em>v. </em>Maxwell, 41 Ga. 421; Glass <em>v. </em>Clark, 41 Ga. 544. There has been no legislation, since the decision of the cases just cited, which would authorize us to treat as final such a judgment as that now under review; and as it is not proper subject matter for a \u2018fast\u2019 writ of error, the case must be disposed of under' the law and the rules of practice as understood and followed before the policy of allowing certain classes of cases to be speedily \u2022 brought to this court was adopted: It is quite clear that even had the judge granted the motion to dissolve the injunction, as the plaintiff in error <em>insists </em>should have been done, the cause would still .have been left \u2018pending in the court below.\u2019 \u201d Smith <em>v. </em>Willis, 107 Ga. 795, 33 S. E. Rep. 667.</p><p id=\"b343-13\">Note\u2014This is changed by act of 29th of October, 1870. For the practice is such matters see said Act. (R.)</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
