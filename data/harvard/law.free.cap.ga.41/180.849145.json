April Term, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-10\">In June 1863, Gause gave Rushin a promissory note for $362 50, for the purchase of certain land in said county. Rushin sued Gause upon it and obtained judgment on the 10th of October, 1866. The fi. fa. issued upon said judgment was, on the 29th of October, 1869, levied hpon said land. Before this levy Gause had been adjudged a bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>rupt, under the Act of Congress of the 2d of March, 1867, his schedule filed with his petition for such discharge included s\u00e1id land, and the land was, by his assignee in bankruptcy, regularly laid off and assigned to him as exempt from his debts. He met said levy by an affidavit that it was illegal because said land had been so executed. Rushin did *not prove his debt in bankruptcy, but relied on the lien of said judgment. Upon these facts the Court held that said levy was illegal and dismissed it. That is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-7\">J. T.

Section 2013 of the Revised Code, exempts certain real estate from levy and sale as the homestead of the debtor, but makes no exception in favor of a debt due for the purchase-money, as does our Constitution of 1868. The debtor takes the exemption under the law by which it is granted to him. That law did not make it liable to be sold for the purchase-money, and in our judgment it is not so liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">It is not worth while to repeat the arguments which establish that the \u201cCode\u201d became the law on the 1st of January, 1863, even as to those clauses which altered the previous laws. The Act of December 19th, 1861, can be sustained as a valid Act, and by that Act the Cpde, as such, is made the law. The provisions in the Code were, without doubt, intended to repeal all the former exemption laws inconsistent with what was there provided. And the Act of. 1843, except-, ing debts due for the purchase-money, is clearly inconsistent with that broad provision of the Code which exempts the property from sale under any judgment. The ^bankrupt Act discharges the debtor from all debts save those therein specially excepted, and this is not one of the exceptions; and the presumption of law is, that the Bankrupt Court saw to it that all the requisites necessary to make its judgment binding, had been complied with. The fact that the plaintiff saw fit not to prove his debt, cannot help him unless, perhaps, he was the owner of a specific lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
