The Act of 30th November, 1860, which provided for the suspension of the Statute of Limitations during the suspension of specie payment by the Banks, (which fact of the Suspension of the Banks, was to be made known by the proclamation of the 'Governor,) did not suspend the Statute of Limitations from the date of that Act, but from the date of the Governor\u2019s proclamation, which was made on the 18th of December, 1860* proclaiming the fact that the Banks had suspended specie payments, in accordance with the terms and provisions of that Act.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b95-8\">Statute of' Limitations.

Plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>attorney then offered to prove, by a witness, that said Banks, or some of them, suspended specie payments before the 15th of December, 1860. Defendant\u2019s counsel objected upon the ground that the date of said suspension was fixed by said proclamation. The objection was sustained. The evidence being closed, the Court charged the jury that the Statute of Limitations was suspended in this State, on the 18th of December, 1860, and that if they believed that more than six years elapsed from the maturity of said note, up to the 18th of December, 1860, they should find, for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">The jury found for defendants.

Counsel for defendants in error, moved to dismiss the bill-of exceptions, because said proclamation was not copied in the bill of exceptions. The Court (Brown, C. J. dissenting,) overruled the motion upon the ground that it was a matter of which judicial notice would be taken.

Even if the doctrine announced in that case can be said to have any application to one like the present, the decision rendered, therein is not binding as authority for the reason that Chief Justice Brown dissented therefrom.\u201d Western, etc., R.

Both t questions depend on the construction of *the Act\u2019 of the General Assembly of the 30th November, 1860. That Act authorized the banks to suspend specie payments until the 1st of December, 1861. The- 4th section of that Act provides, that in the event of suspension of specie payment by any of the banks of Savannah, Augusta, and Atlanta, that fact shall be made known by the proclamation of the Governor. The proclamation of the Governor,' announcing the fact .of suspension, in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Act, is dated on the 18th day of December, 1860. The Act further provides, that the Statute of Limitations shall cease to run against any debt during the suspension of said banks. At what time, did the banks legally suspend specie payment, under the Act, so as to legally suspend the running of the Statute of Limitations ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>In our judgment, the statute was legally suspended from running, from the time the fact of suspension of the bank was legally made known by the proclamation of the Governor, on the 18th day of December, 1860, as required, and directed by that Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In Brian v. Banks, 38th Georgia Reports, page 300, the question now made, was not involved or considered, nor was the attention of the Court called to it on the argument of that case; although, it is stated in general terms, in giving a history of the several Acts suspending the running of the Statute of Limitations in the written opinion, \u201cthat the Act of 1860 suspended the running of the Statute of Limitations for one year.\u201d The Act of 1860, according to the construction which we now give to it, (and which we should then have given to it, had our attention been called to the question, as being in any way material in that case,) does not suspend the running of the Statute for one year, but only from the 18th day of December, 1860, until the first day of December, 1861, lacking about eighteen days of bein^ one whole year. According to the construction which we have given to the Act of 1860, there was no error in the Court below in rejecting the evidence offered, or in the charge of the Court to the jury. \u25a0 .</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Let the judgment of the Court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
