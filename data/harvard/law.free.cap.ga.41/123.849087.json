November Term, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Jones sued Elizabeth Hatcher, as executrix of Samuel Hatcher, and Allen C. McGehee, upon a promissory note for $1,500 00, made the 28th of January, 1860, due 1st November, 1860, by Porter Ingram, to Hatcher &amp; McGehee, and by them endorsed in blank. McGehee pleaded the general issue, that said Hatcher &amp; McGehee was a firm, engaged solely in selling slaves, and that said endorsement was made outside of said business, without McGehee\u2019s knowledge or consent, or subsequent ratification, and that the consideration of said endorsement was a slave. Mrs. Hatcher filed no plea. On the trial plaintiff\u2019s attorneys read said note as evidence, and closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AjB\">*Defendant\u2019s counsel introduced said McGehee, who testified that the consideration of said note was a slave; that he was a member of said firm; he did not know the note was sold, but supposed it to be lost; that Ingram came, at the maturity of the note, and paid it off to him in Confederate money, and since the surrender, Ingram told him Jones held said note, with the firm\u2019s endorsement on it; that he after-wards saw Jones, in 1865, and Jones said that said firm sold him a slave, he was dissatisfied because the slave ran away, and, in November, 1860, took the slave to Hatcher, and Hatcher endorsed said note, and delivered it to him, Jones, and Hatcher took back the slave.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\">In rebuttal, plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered the testimony of plaintiff-, taken by Interrogatories, in which he testified that he got said note about the 1st of March, 1860; that he holds it as guardian of E. S. Jones, a minor; that he bought it from Hatcher &amp; McGehee, at ten per cent, discount, paying therefor bank bills which belonged to said minor; that both of the firm were present when he made the payment, and endorsed the note only because Jones did not know Ingram\u2019s ability; that one Cobb, an employee of the firm, was also present; that nothing was said to him as to the consideration of said note, and he did not know what was its consideration, and that he did not remember the conversation which McGehee had testified to. This testimony was objected to because Hatcher was dead. The objection was overruled and the testimony was read.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-6\">The Court charged the jury that if the consideration of the endorsement was a slave, they should find for defendants; but if the firm had sold Jones a slave, and Jones had some objection to the slave, and a difficulty arose, and the firm took the slave back, by way of compromise, and in consideration of the firm\u2019s liability, incurred in selling said slave, endorsed said, note, they should find for plaintiff. The jury found for the plaintiff. Defendant\u2019s counsel say that the Court erred in admitting Jones\u2019 testimony, and in said charge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Blanford &amp; Thornton.

The reason for excluding a party whose opponent is dead, is evidently because he cannot be confronted by the other party. In this case the witness is called to testify to facts occurring between him and the survivor of the partnership. The sole reason for the exception here fails. The party is living, with whom the contract was made, and is not only ready to confront his opponent, .but, as the fact is, he has been sworn. It would be unfair to admit McGehee and exclude Jones. It would be using the exception for the very purpose it was intended to prevent, to-wit: letting in a party as a witness, when it was impossible that his opponent could' tell his tale.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The spirit of the law is to throw down the old barriers, except in cases where each -party cannot be met by his opponent. We think the intention of the law is best met, in a case like his, by letting both parties be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
