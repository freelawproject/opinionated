It is not sufficient to state in the bill of exceptions that certain deeds were introduced in evidence, giving the names of the grantors and grantees, dates, and attesting witnesses, and stating that the deeds covered the premises in dispute. It is a copy, not an abbreviation of the written evidence which the rule of court requires; and a plaintiff in error cannot, by an ex parte abbreviation, claim a compliance with the law. Rule 10 of Supreme Court, (Code 1882, p. 13-57); (Pridgen <em>v. </em>Duel,) 41 Ga. 420; (Pounds <em>v. </em>Hanson,) 64 Ga. 668; (Colquitt <em>v. </em>Solomon,) 61 Ga. 492, 495; (Lee <em>v. </em>Porter,) 63 Ga. 345; (Parker <em>v. </em>Dowdy,) 58 Ga. 439.\u201d McMillan <em>v. </em>Davis, 71 Ga. 866.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion><p id=\"b342-6\">BIEL OF EXCEPTIONS\u2014EVIDENCE MUST BE INCORPORATED OR ATTACHED\u2014IDENTIFICATION BY SIGNATURE OF JUDGE.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014'Rule tenth requires a brief of the oral and a copy of the written testimony in the case shall be incorporated in the bill of exceptions, or be attached thereto, as an exhibit; and, in the latter case, it shall be identified as true by the signature of the Judge thereupon, and for failure to comply with this rule the bill of exceptions will be dismissed.

Duer, Ordinary of !said county, claiming in his affidavit $370 82.\u201d He answered that as Ordinary he owed Martin $200 00, but as an individual he owed him *nothing,- nor had any of his effects. Pridgen\u2019s counsel moved to enter judgment against Duer, as Ordinary, for $200 00, but the Court would not allow it and discharged the garnishee, Pridgen\u2019s counsel sued out a bill of exceptions, to correct this error.
