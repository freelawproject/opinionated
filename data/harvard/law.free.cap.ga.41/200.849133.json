Walker sued him upon said note and procured \u25a0 a judgment against him on the 29th of May, 1866. On the 25th of January, 1870, the fi. fa. issued upon said judgment, was levied upon Spires\u2019 property. At February Term, 1870, of said Court, Spires\u2019 counsel moved to set aside said levy, because said note was given for slaves. The parties were at issue thereupon. Walker\u2019s counsel admitted that, the consideration of said note was slaves. No other evidence was offered. Walker\u2019s counsel insisted that he had a rieht to have the jury pass upon the legality of said levy. Spires\u2019 counsel objected upon the ground that, the admission of Walker\u2019s counsel ousted the jurisdiction of the Court, and the jury had nothing to try. The Court allowed the case argued before the jury. Argument* concluded, the Court charged the jury, that the section of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Constitution of Georgia, of 1868, denying jurisdiction to the Courts to enforce any fi. fa. founded upon a debt, the consideration of which was slaves or the hire thereof, was in conflict with the Constitution of the United States and void. He was requested to charge the jury, that under said admission they should find that the consideration of the debt on which this fi. fa. was founded was slaves. He refused so to charge. The jury returned a verdict as follows: \u201cWe, the jury, sustain the levy.\u201d Thereupon the Court ordered said fi. fa. to proceed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-4\">Spires\u2019 counsel sued out a writ of error upon the grounds that the Court erred in allowing argument before the jury, and in allowing them to pass upon said issue, after said admission, and in charging as he did, refusing to charge as requested, and in ordering the fi. fa. to proceed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-5\">Frank H.
