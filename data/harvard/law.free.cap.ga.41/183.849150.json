April Term, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\">Maxey averred that Bell, of Morgan county, was executor of' James Maxey, deceased, was mismanaging said estate in the particulars specified, and was of doubtful solvency, and that Bell was also testamentary guardian of James Maxey\u2019s daughter and son, aged respectively nearly fourteen and nearly ten years, \u201cthat said children are unwilling to remain in the custody of said guardian,\u201d that he was not a proper ^person to have the custody of the minors, \u201chis religious creed being that usually denominated Universalism.\u201d He prayed that the Ordinary of Oglethorpe county should compel Bell to give security as executor, and that he be removed from said guardianship.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-9\">By consent, the cause was appealed to the Superior Court. In that Court the petition was amended by striking its grounds as put, and averring in lieu, as follows: Petitioner is own uncle of said minors, is a Baptist of long and good standing; Bell is, and long has been \u201can infidel of the order usually denominated Universalists, who deny the gospel, and profess to believe that all will finally be saved;\u201d testator professed the same belief, and was consequently a sympathizing friend to Bell, advised with him as to his will; Bell wrote the .will; it specifically directs as to the management of his property, but says nothing as to the management 'of his children, except that they be educated as well as their means will allow, \u201cand be brought up to habits of industry, and (have) the principles of morality and a sense of moral obligation instilled into their minds.\u201d The property is small; one person should be guardian of both the property and the wards; they can be more comfortable and more cheaply educated on their father\u2019s place, under petitioner\u2019s charge, (especially as that is near to a school and several Christian Churches,) than at Bells. The prayer was for Bell\u2019s removal from the guardianship, apd petitioner\u2019s appointment in his stead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-10\">The petition, as amended, was demurred to generally.

It has for years been the settled law of this State, that men shall not be molested for their religious opinions. The Constitution of 1861 and 1865, each added, \u201cnor prohibited from holding any public office or trust on account of his religious opinions:\u201d Constitution 1865, Article I, section 5. By' a play upon the word \u201creligious,\u201d some orthodox people did not admit that this protected one who had opinions which they did not think were \u201creligious.\u201d This very proceeding calls Mr. Bell an \u201cInfidel,\u201d of the sect of Universalists, with intent, we suppose, to put him out of the protection of the Constitution, as one whose opinions could not be classed as religious. But without doubt, even the Constitution of 1861 and 1865, mean, by this, opinions upon matters relating to the relation between man and his Maker. But our present Constitution gives broader language. After using the language of the Constitution of 1861 and 1865, Article 1, Section 6, it adds another clause: Section 12, Article 1, is in these words: \u201cNo person shall be molested for his opinions, or be subject to any civil or political incapacity, or acquire any civil or political advantage in consequence of such opinions.\u201d This cuts at the root of the whole matter\u2014leaves not a single link of the old chain by which, for so many centuries, men have tried to bind in fetters the human mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">In Georgia, a man may think as he pleases upon any subject, religious, philosophical or political, and is not, for that, under any civil or political disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">The office of guardian is a public trust, and these clauses *declare no man incapacitated for that trust, by reason of his opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">If men act badly, lead lives rendering them unfit to have the rearing of children, we will not say that the Courts may not interfere. But over men\u2019s opinions, bv the laws of Georgia, we have no jurisdiction, and we think this is a wise provision. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
