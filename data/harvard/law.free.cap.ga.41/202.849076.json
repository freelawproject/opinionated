The land was sold by the executors in 'December, 1858. In April, 1866, Lane, the purchaser of the land, borrowed from Thrasher $3,600.00, and executed a mortgage on the land to T., to secure the payment of the money. 'On the trial of the cause the Court charged the jury, that, at their\" option, the cestui que trusts might follow their fund where-ever it could be traced, or ratify the use made of it by the trustee, and that if a portion of said land was brought with their funds, they could follow the funds so invested, and the trustee could not create a lien on the trust estate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-5\"><em>Held, </em>That this charge of the Court, in view of the evidence contained in the record, was error; that a mortgagee, to the extent of his interest in the land mortgaged, stands upon the same footing as any other bona fide purchaser without notice of the trust, and that the Court should have so charged the jury; the more especially, as this principal of the law was distinctly recognized and adjudicated by this Court between these same parties, in the case reported in 37th Georgia Reports, 392, ordering the injunction granted to restrain Thrasher, the mortgagee, from enforcing' his mortgage against the land to be dissolved.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-6\">CONTINUANCE\u2014TRAVERSE OF SHERIFF RETURN\u2014APPEARAN'CE.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark>\u2014From the facts disclosed by the record, there was no error in the Court below in refusing the motion for a continuance for the purpose of allowing Lane to traverse the return of the sheriff as to the service of the bill on him, or in refusing to allow the sheriff\u2019s return of service to be traversed after the defendant, Lane, had appeared in the cause as a defendant, and participated in the litigation.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-7\">Trusts and Trustees. Purchaser. Notice. Before Judge Robinson. Morgan Superior Court. May Adjourned Term, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AP16\">*This cause was before this Court before: See Thrasher et al., v. Partee and wife, 37th Georgia Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>ports, 392, where the bill and answers of Thrasher are fully reported. The sheriff returned on the 8th of June, 1867, that the bill was served on Lane by leaving a copy at his most notorious place of abode. On the 2d of September, 1867, Lane filed a traverse, averring that the paper so left by the sheriff was not a copy, but only a few detached sheets, being part of a copy of the bill. When the cause was called for trial, Lane\u2019s counsel objected to going on until said traverse was disposed of. Counsel for complainants produced from the Clerk\u2019s office the answer of Lane to the bill and the amended bill. The answer to the original bill had not been sworn to or signed by Lane, nor had the Clerk ever entered it as filed in his office. And Lane\u2019s counsel stated that he did not put said answers in the Clerk\u2019s office, but supposed they were in his own office, and burnt when his office was burnt, and had been preparing to make other answers, and that he never intended to file said answers till after the said traverse was disposed of; that the cause was returnable to September term, 1867; was not entered upon the docket or reached and called till this term. Lane\u2019s answer to the amended bill was drawn by Mr. Thrasher, one of defendants, Thrasher\u2019s solicitors, and appeared to have been sworn to and prescribed by Lane on the 9th of September, 1868. Upon this showing, as stated in the bill of exceptions, the Court ordered the trial to proceed without regard to said traverse. (The trial began on the 21st. of May, 1869, and the record shows that the original answer of Lane was sworn to and attested by the Clerk of said Court on the 19th of May, 1869.) Lane answered that he received as such guardian some slaves and $17,168 87, his notes, i. e., one held by Stallings before he died,) which was not over $2,800 00, but as Lane remembered, was for about $1,400 00,) and his notes given to the executors for land and other property bought at the sale, were received by said executors as cash, were charged against him as cash, and was so regarded and treated in his returns *to the Court of Ordinary; that he did not invest the money in the purchase of land or other property, but purchased the land and some other property, at said executors\u2019 sale, more than twelve months before his appointment and qualification as guardian, and gave his individual note for said property, and the executors delivered him the other property add conveyed by deed the lands to him in his individual capacity; after his appointment and qualification, upon settling with the executors, he received his said notes from them as cash paid to him as guardian; that he did not owe Stallings when he died for any land, but had paid him for all the land he had ever bought of him; owed him said note for money borrowed and spent for another purpose; that regarding said land as bona fide his own, he borrowed the money from Thrasher and gave him a mortgage on said lands and another tract which he owned before Stallings\u2019 death, to secure its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>payment. He admitted the insolvency of his securities, and virtually admitted that he was insolvent. The other parts of his answer are not material. Upon the trial, after the reading of the bill and answers and amendments to each, complainant introduced \u201cthe records of the Court of Ordinary of said county, containing receipt of Andrew J. and Thomas J. Stallings, executors of William Stallings, by Dawson B. Lane, guardian, for negroes, of the aggregate value of $8,750 00, also for the sum of $17,183 44, as part of the distributive share coming to William and Emma Lane, dated April 2d, 1860.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-4\">Thomas J. Stallings testified that he was one of said executors, and at the sale Lane bought the land in dispute and gave his note for it, and personal property then bought; that he bid off the land at $8,7'68 25; that Lane was appointed by the will of Stallings as guardian of William, (now dead,) and Emma, (Now Mrs. Partee,) and it was understood at and before the sale that the property purchased by Lane should go as part of the share of said William and Emma, and the amount mentioned in said receipt shown by the said records is correct; that on the settlement, Lane\u2019s note was given up and his receipt was taken for said note as so *much cash; the note was Lane\u2019s individual note, and the deed was made to Lane individually and not as guardian. He further testified that Lane did not give bond as guardian because he was appointed by the will, but learning that this was error, he notified the Ordinary, who required Lane to give bond, and Lane appealed to the Superior Court, where the Ordinary\u2019s judgment was sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-5\">The insolvency of Lane\u2019s sureties and the death of said William while an unmarried minor, having been shown, complainants closed their case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-6\">The defendants relied solely upon their answers. They requested the Court to charge the jury that \u201cunless complainants showed that Thrasher had notice of the trust (if any) in the land, he must recover the amount of his mortgage fi. fa. The Court refused so to charge, but on the contrary charged that, at their option, the cestui que trusts might follow their fund wherever it could be traced, or ratify the.use made of it by the trustee, and that if a portion of said land was bought with their funds, they could follow the funds so invested and the trustee could not create a lien upon the trust estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-7\">The jury found $19,800 00 against Lane as guardian, and that Thrasher\u2019s lien was good against the land owned by Lane in Stalling\u2019s life-time, but that Thrasher had no lien on the land bought by Lane at said executor\u2019s sale, and that a writ of possession issue in favor of complainants for said last named lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-8\">Counsel for defendants moved for a new trial upon .the ground that the Court erred in urging the cause to trial before submitting Lane\u2019s traverse of the return of service to trial, in charging as he did and in refusing to charge as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>quested, and because the verdict was contrary to law, etc. Some other points were made upon the charge, but as they are not passed on, they and the parts of the charge applicable to them \u00e1re omitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-5\">The Chancellor refused a new trial, and that is assigned as error on said grounds. It was sent up to December Term, 1869, of this Court. When it was called, counsel for defendant in error moved to dismiss the writ of error upon the Aground, that the bill of exceptions was not certified till more than thirty days after the refusal of a new .trial, and that without any explanation of the lapse of .time; and because the evidence was not embodied in the bill of exceptions. The Court dismissed it upon the first ground without passing upon the last.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-8\">Subsequently the cause was re-instated. See Lane v. Robenson, Judge. The cause being called at this term, the motion to dismiss was again urged on said second ground. It was objected that it was res ad judicata. The Court held that it was not, as that point was not passed upon. The objection was, that the records of the Court of Ordinary, used as evidence below, were not copied or otherwise showu in the bill of exceptions, except as quoted ante. This evidence, as therein stated and here quoted, was in the, words of the agreed brief of the evidence, and the counsel had agreed in writing on said brief, that it \u201cis a correct brief of the evidence produced.\u201d The Court refused to dismiss, holding that counsel was estopped by said agreement from urging said objection.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-9\">B.

Court below, is the overruling the motion for a new trial. In our judgment there was no error in the refusal \u2022 of the Court to continue the cause for the purpose of allowing Lane to traverse the return of the sheriff, as to the service of the bill on him, or in refusing to allow the sheriff\u2019s return of service to be traversed at the trial term of the case, after Lane had appeared in the cause as a defendant, and participated in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The Court was requested to charge the jury, \u201cthat unless complainants showed that Thrasher had notice of the trust, (if any,) in the land, he must recover the amount of his mortgage fi. fa.\u201d The Court refused so to charge, but on the contrary charged the jury, \u201cthat at their' option, the cestui que trusts might follow their fund wherever it could be traced, or ratify the use made of it by the trustee, and that if a portion of said land was bought with their fund, they could follow the fund so invested, and the trustee could not create a lien upon the trust estate.\u201d In view of the facts of this case as shown by the record, we are of the opinion, that the Court below erred in not charging the jury as requested, and in the charge as given to the jury in relation to this branch of the case. Thrasher claimed to be a bona fide mortgagee of the land from Lane, who had the legal title thereto, for a valuable consideration, without any notice of the trust which the complainants were seeking to enforce against the land. A bona fide mortgagee, to tlje extent of his interest in *the land mortgaged, stands upon the same footing as any other bona fide purchaser without notice of the trust, and the Court should have so charged the jury, the more especially as this principle of the law was distinctly recognized and adjudicated by this Court between the same parties, in the case reported in 37th Georgia Reports, 392, ordering,, the injunction granted to restrain Thrasher, the mortgagee, from enforcing his mortgage against the land to be dissolved. Let the judgment of the Court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
