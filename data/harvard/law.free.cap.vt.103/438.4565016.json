He now appeals from a taxation of costs made by our clerk at Bennington. The disputed items in the taxation are six in number, aggregating $18. Five of these are for \u201cterm fee and travel,\u201d allowed at $3 per term; the other is for \u201cattorney fee\u201d at the May Term, also allowed at $3.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-18\">Subject to the qualification pointed out by Mr. Justice Taylor in <em>Comstock\u2019s Admr. </em>v. <em>Jacob, </em>89 Vt. 510, 96 Atl. 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>which does not affect the question here presented, costs are taxable only by force of the statutes. <em>In re Jacobs, 87 </em>Vt. 454, 89 Atl. 634. It is so in criminal cases. 15 C. J. 317; <em>State v. Guyer, </em>91 Vt. 290, 295, 100 Atl. 113; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaines </em>(U. S.), 25 L. ed. 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The only statutory provisions regarding the taxation of term fees, travel fees, or attorney fees, are found in G. L. 7435. But this section obviously refers to civil eases only. It specifies the items that are to be taxed in favor of the \u201crecovering party.\u201d It cannot be that the Legislature intended by the use of this term to include the State in criminal cases. In such cases, the State does not \u201crecover.\u201d If successful, it <em>prevails.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\n<em>The items specified are, therefore, unwarranted and are expunged from the taxation.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
