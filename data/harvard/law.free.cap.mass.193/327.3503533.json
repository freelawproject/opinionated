He avers that the first three of these assessments were collected from some person to him unknown, and that the last five were paid by him under protest. The respondent filed a general demurrer to this petition ; and the case comes before us on the petitioner\u2019s appeal from an order of the Superior Court dismissing his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">These assessments appear to have been laid under St. 1897, c. 419, now R. L. c. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 27. We find no averment in the petition upon which it can be contended that the assessments were not levied in compliance with the provisions of this statute; and- its constitutionality, as applied to occupied estates in the central portion of a large city, has been affirmed upon careful examination by this court. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>173 Mass. 71. The mere averment that the lot opposite the petitioner\u2019s estate is unoccupied, belongs to two owners, and is divided in the middle by a fence, is in no sense equivalent to an averment that the petitioner\u2019s estate is not an occupied estate within the central portion of a large city. No attempt has been made to quash any of these assessments by a petition for certiorari. R. L. c. 192, \u00a7 4. No abatement has been made by the assessors under R. L. c. 26, \u00a7 27. No attempt has been made by petition for mandamus or otherwise, to compel action by the boards of aldermen or by the assessors upon any proceedings taken by the petitioner before them. Nor is the question presented whether the petitioner could treat the non-action of the boards of aldermen upon his petitions as a refusal by them to give him any relief; and whether he could thereupon obtain redress under the provisions of R. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 77, 78. Apart from the difficulties stated in the memorandum of the judge of the Superior Court,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and assuming with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>out intimating that the petitioner could find a way of getting over these difficulties by amendment, we see no ground upon which the petition can be maintained. Accordingly the order of the Superior Court dismissing this action must be affirmed; and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The second case is an action of contract, in which the plaintiff\u2019s declaration reads as follows: \u201c And now comes the plaintiff in the above entitled action, and says that the defendant is indebted to him in the sum of five hundred and eighty-three dollars and forty-four cents, with costs, to wit: That, in open court, on the second day of December, 1903, at Haverhill; and on the sixteenth day of June, 1904, at Salem; and on the thirtieth day of November, 1904, at Lawrence, the defendant confessed to making a forcible entry upon the plaintiff\u2019s close, in June, 1885, and to appropriating sixty square feet or one tenth of the plaintiff\u2019s front yard for sidewalk use; and the defendant continued the said adverse possession up to the eighteenth day of May, 1905, and, without protest, assessed and collected taxes against the said land throughout the said adverse possession and has refused to give the plaintiff any compensation. And the plaintiff claims sufferance rents for the seven thousand two hundred and ninety-three days, which the defendant detained the said land, at the rate of eight cents per day, with court costs.\u201d The defendant demurred to this declaration on the grounds that the plaintiff\u2019s grievance was the taking of land for the purpose of a highway and the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was by petition for the assessment of damages; that there was no allegation of an agreement, expressed or implied, necessary to establish the relation of landlord and tenant; that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was for forcible entry by the defendant upon the plaintiff\u2019s land and appropriating a part thereof as a sidewalk, and for such wrongful acts an action of contract does not lie; and that no cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>known to the law was set forth. A further alleged cause of demurrer, that it appears from the declaration that the cause of action did not accrue within six years before the suing out of the plaintiff\u2019s writ, need not be considered; for it is settled that this is a defence which should be taken by answer and not by demurrer. <em>Sawyer </em>v. Boston, 144 Mass. 470, 472. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>7 Met. 227, 229. It is for this reason that, if a new promise or other new matter is relied upon to remove the bar of the statute, the declaration is properly upon the original cause of action, and the new matter may then be shown in reply to a plea of the statute of limitations. <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Penniman, </em>8 Mass. 133. <em>Way </em>v. <em>Sperry, </em>6 Cush. 238, 241.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b356-9\">\n<em>W. S. Hodgdon, pro se.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b356-10\"><em>6-, M. Gr. Nichols, </em>for the defendant, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">It is manifest, however, that the facts alleged in the declaration show nothing more than a trespass upon the plaintiff\u2019s land, followed by a continued unlawful possession thereof for nearly twenty years.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> As the plaintiff does not aver any express contract by the defendant to pay him for the use of this land and does not set out any facts from which such a promise could be implied, it requires no citation of authorities to show that this action cannot be maintained as brought. If, as was suggested in the plaintiff\u2019s brief, though not averred in his declaration, his land was taken by eminent domain for the construction of a sidewalk, be was given full redress under the statutes now embodied in R. L. c. 48. If he has lost this right by his own delay in enforcing it, he cannot resort to the remedy sought in this action. <em>Lancy </em>v. Boston, 185 Mass. 219, and cases there cited. Accordingly the defendant\u2019s demurrer properly was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">If in the opinion of the plaintiff, any amendment of his writ or declaration would enable him to maintain his action, he must apply to the Superior Court for the necessary permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Accordingly, upon the pleadings before us, the order of the Superior Court sustaining the demurrer and ordering judgment for the defendant must be affirmed; and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\"> The memorandum was made by <em>Bell, </em>J., and the portion referred to was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">\u201c Mo. 4885 is a petition asking the repayment of certain assessments for street watering alleged to be illegal and paid under protest. Such assessment could only be abated by the assessors on the recommendation of the aldermen. R. L. c. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 26,27. If as he alleges the aldermen have refused to give him a hearing on his petition for abatement, they have done him a wrong, but whether that refusal has made the assessment void, cannot be determined in this proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">\u201c Although the defendant has not expressly taken that objection, the proceedings in this form cannot be sustained and no judgment could be founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>on them. R. L. c. 167, \u00a7 15 requires such actions to be begun by writ. While St. 1887, c. 383 was in force the action could have been begun by petition but that act was omitted from the Revised Laws on the recommendation of the commissioners and expressly repealed. R. L. c. 227.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u201c Whether by amendment the defect can be remedied, I do not express an opinion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\"> The date of the writ was June 26, 1905.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
