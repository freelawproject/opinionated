The declaration as amended was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-3\">\u201c And the plaintiff says that on the sixteenth day of February A. D. 1903, the defendant made a written contract with the plaintiff, a copy of which is hereto annexed and marked \u2018A,\u2019 (together with a copy of article second of section third of the defendant\u2019s by-laws, which is marked \u2018B,\u2019) by which the defendant agreed to employ and did employ the plaintiff as the selling agent of the defendant to sell all the lumber that was to be cut and sawed from the timber on a certain tract of land owned by the defendant and known as the Tucbahoe plantation, situated in Screven County in the State of Georgia for which the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff a commission of 5% on the f. o. b. shipping point prices on all the lumber thus sold by him and shipped by the defendant and in addition the defendant agreed to pay all necessary travelling expenses of the plaintiff; and the plaintiff agreed to and did become the said selling agent for the defendant under the terms of said contract. That the defendant. has already cut and sawed a large amount of lumber from timber on said tract which lumber is in shipping condition and is now cutting and sawing lumber from said timber, and intends to continue cutting and sawing said timber until all of the timber on said plantation has been cut and sawed into lumber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\">\u201cAnd the plaintiff has always been and is ready and willing and able to sell all of said lumber thus cut and sawed and to be cut and sawed from said timber on said Tuckahoe plantation in accordance with the terms of said contract and has repeatedly notified the defendant of his readiness and ability to carry out all the terms of said contract incumbent upon him to perform, but the defendant refuses to allow him to carry out his part of said contract and denies the existence of said contract and has notified the plaintiff that it would not require his services as selling agent for said lumber. That before said denial of the existence of said contract and said notification by the defendant to the plaintiff that it would not require his services as said selling agent the plaintiff relying upon said contract consumed much time and went to great expense in arranging and negotiating with purchasers for the sale to them of said lumber when the same would be in shipping condition, and had rendered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>great amount of service to the defendant for the purpose of carrying out said contract and had expended large sums of money in placing the defendant in a position to operate and saw said timber into lumber in order that the same would be in shipping condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-3\">\u201c And the plaintiff says that the amount of timber upon said Tuckahoe plantation which was included under the terms of said contract would produce about thirty million feet of lumber and that the plaintiff was, is and always has been ready and willing and able to sell the same at market prices in accordance with said contract, and that by the refusal of the defendant to perform the part of said contract incumbent upon it to perform the plaintiff has suffered great damage, to wit; in the sum of twenty-five thousand (25,000) dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-4\">The instrument marked \u201cA\u201d annexed to the declaration was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\">\u201cIn consideration of one dollar ($1.00) and other valuable considerations, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, we, the Southern Coast Lumber Company, a company duly incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine, with principal office in Boston, Mass., hereby make the following contract with Harry H.

Bradlee.\u201d (Seal)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-7\">The article of the by-laws marked \u201c B \u201d was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-8\">\u201c Section 3.

The judge overruled the demurrer, and, being of the opinion that the questions raised by the demurrer ought to be determined by this court before any further proceedings in the trial court, reported the case to this court for such determination.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-12\"><em>W. W. Towle (F. K. Linscott </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-13\"><em>F. B. Thayer (T. K. Lothrop, Jr., </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b407-14\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqXe\">We are of opinion that this demurrer must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">The plaintiff\u2019s first contention is that in and by the writing declared on the defendant impliedly agreed that the plaintiff should have the right to sell all the lumber sawed by it on the tract of land owned by it, called the Tuckahoe plantation, mentioned in that writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">In giving a construction to the writing here in question, the form into which it was put by the parties is of great if not vital importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>It is in form an appointment or the recital of an appointment of the plaintiff as the defendant\u2019s agent for the sale of the defendant\u2019s lumber, followed by an agreement as to the compensation to be made for such sales (and ending with a reference to one of the by-laws of the defendant corporation) by which the plaintiff\u2019s appointment is in terms made revocable at the pleasure of the defendant\u2019s directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\">The statement in such an instrument that the plaintiff is the defendant\u2019s agent \u201c for the sale of all the lumber that will or may be sawed\u201d on the tract of land in question cannot be construed to be an implied agreement on the part of the defendant, which is broken by the defendant if the plaintiff\u2019s authority is revoked by the defendant\u2019s directors (in pursuance of the bylaw referred to), before he has sold all the lumber in question. That statement must be construed to be what it purports to be, namely, a provision as to what the agency is so long as it continues in force. It probably was inserted, as suggested by the defendant\u2019s counsel, to make it plain that the plaintiff\u2019s agency extended to all kinds of lumber sawed from the plantation in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In our opinion, by the true construction of this contract the appointment of the plaintiff was revocable at the pleasure of the directors of the defendant corporation, and the agreement made was an agreement as to the nature of his agency and as to the compensation to be paid to him while the agency was in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The conclusion to which we have come is supported by <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Merchants Ins. Co. </em>118 N. Y. 484, cited by the plaintiff. We have examined all the other cases cited by him and find nothing in them to the contrary. Our conclusion is also supported by the construction given to the written agreements in question in the following cases: <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Hassard, </em>113 Mass. 187; <em>Coffin </em>v. Landis, 46 Penn. St. 426; <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>73 Ill. 318; <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Warfield, </em>23 La. Ann. 395; <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>5 Q. B. 175; <em>Aspdin </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>5 Q. B. 671; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Sayles, </em>Dav. &amp; Mer. 579; <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Great Northern Railway, </em>9 Exch. 507. See also in this connection <em>Busell Trimmer Co. </em>v. <em>Coburn, </em>188 Mass. 254; <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Whitcomb, </em>5 Bing. 34; <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>9 Ad. &amp; El. 693; <em>Chicago &amp; Great Eastern Railway </em>v. Dane, 43 N. Y. 240; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>New York Ins. Co. </em>148 N. Y. 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s second contention is that if that be the true construction of the writing declared on he is entitled to recover (1) for what he did before his appointment was revoked in setting on foot negotiations which resulted in sales, and (2) for expenses incurred by him in his agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The difficulty with this contention is that he has not alleged that he did set on foot any such negotiations or that he incurred any such expense. The breach alleged is \u201c That before said denial of the existence of said contract and said notification by the defendant to the plaintiff that it would not require his services as said selling agent the plaintiff relying upon said contract consumed much time and went to great expense in arranging and negotiating with purchasers for the sale to them of said lumber when the same would be in shipping condition, and had rendered a great amount of service to the defendant for the purpose of carrying out said contract and had expended large sums of money in placing the defendant in a position to operate and saw said timber into lumber in order that the same would be in shipping condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The entry must be <em>Order overruling demurrer reversed; demurrer sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
