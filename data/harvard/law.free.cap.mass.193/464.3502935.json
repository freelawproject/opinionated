Before the empanelling of the jury, and before the trial of the case, the defendant filed and made two motions to quash the indictment, each of which was denied by the judge; and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-7\">At the trial the Commonwealth called as a witness one Mitchell, who testified that he was a police officer of the city of Boston, and that on May 9, 1906, in consequence of information and instructions received from his superior officer, he went to a room in a building on Tremont Street, in Boston, where he found the defendant seated at a desk, between two and three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and had a conversation with her. Against the objection and subject to the exception of the defendant, this witness was allowed to state the conversation, it appearing from his testimony that it was at the time and place of this conversation that the card above mentioned was given by the defendant to the witness. A part of this conversation was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-8\">\u201c I asked if the doctor was in, and she said,1 No.\u2019 She says, <em>\u2018 </em>What do you want ? \u2019 I said, \u2018 I want to see the doctor.\u2019 She says, 6 What do you want to see him for ? \u2019 I says, \u2018 I don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>think I ought to tell you; it is about a female trouble.\u2019 4 Well,\u2019 she says, 4 that is what I am here for.\u2019 So she came over to the desk and sat down, and I sat down in the chair along side of her, and she asked me what it was, and I told her. I says, 61 know a girl that is in trouble.\u2019 I says,41 understand this is a place to have those things taken care of.\u2019 She says, 4 How far along is the girl ? \u2019 I says, 4 Three months.\u2019 She says, 4 That is a pretty delicate period for an operation.\u2019 She says,4 We have the best\u00bb nurses at our hospital.\u2019 And she said, 4 If we take this case we will guarantee satisfaction.\u2019 She says,4 It will cost you $100.\u2019 Then she asked if the girl was a healthy girl. I said, 4 Yes.\u2019 She says, 4Where does she live?\u2019 I says, 4In Chelsea.\u2019 She says, 4 You bring her here and I will take her to the hospital.\u2019 She says,4 First, I will have to find out whether we have room in the regular hospital, and if we haven\u2019t we take them sometimes to a private hospital.\u2019 I says, 4 Where is that hospital ? \u2019 She says, 4 It is up town, about twenty minutes\u2019 ride from the' Boylston Street subway, on the electric cars.\u2019 Then I asked her if she had any cards, .and she opened a drawer at the desk and she took out this card, and I saw several other cards of the same kind in there at the time. She passed me that one. She says,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">4 Now we are very careful whom we give those cards to.\u2019 4 Because,\u2019 she says, \u2018you know there used to be some places like this in this building before, and if the inspectors knew it they would raid us.\u2019 She told me that they did intend to have a front room, but on account of the previous raids there they thought a back room would be better. She asked me then to have the girl at the office, or at the Boylston Street subway at one o\u2019clock on the following day, and she would take her to the hospital.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">The witness also testified to another conversation with the defendant on the next day at the same place. He testified that there were on the desk some envelopes addressed to physicians ; and that the defendant said there were cards in these envelopes and that the only people she sent those cards to were physicians.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">Against the objection and subject to the exception of the defendant the card which the defendant gave to the witness was introduced in evidence by the government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-8\">The witness also testified that after further conversation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the defendant, a sergeant of police came in with a squad of police officers. He then testified, \u201cThe sergeant asked her who I was, and she said I was a friend of hers. He- asked her what my name was, and she said my name was Sidney Cole. He asked her where I lived, and she said that I lived out in Newton. He asked her where she got acquainted with me, and she told him at a social party, about two months previous. He asked her then what the envelopes were on the desk, and she said they were directed to doctors. He opened some of them while I was there, but he stood back to me and I couldn\u2019t tell what lie took out of them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-5\">On cross-examination the witness admitted that the essential parts of the statements and representations made by him in the conversations were untrue and were made for the purpose of getting information in regard to the business that was carried on in the place, and that he wanted to find out what the place was for, and did not care how many statements \u201c he made which were untrue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-6\">Asked in cross-examination with reference to the card above referred to, he testified as follows: \u201c Q. That is the only card you got? A. That is the only one I got from her. \u2014 Q. And that is the only card that you saw her deliver to anybody ? A. That is the only card that I saw her deliver.-\u2014Q. And you asked her for it ? A. Yes, sir. \u2014 Q. And before you asked her for it you told her the condition of this alleged friend of yours ? A. Yes, sir. \u2014 Q. And the statements you made up to the time you got the card you know weren\u2019t founded on facts, isn\u2019t that true? A. Yes. There was no facts. \u2014 Q. And you made this statement for the purpose of getting possession of the card, isn\u2019t that right ? A. I told the story for to get what information I could. \u2014 Q. And to get possession of the card ? A. Anything, yes, anything that would be evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-7\">At the close of the witness\u2019s testimony the defendant requested that the evidence of the card be stricken out and withdrawn from the consideration of the jury. The judge refused the request.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-8\">The sergeant of police, called as a witness by the Commonwealth, testified to some of the same facts, and, against the objection and exception of the defendant, was allowed to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>scribe the room and its contents, and to testify to what articles he found in searching the premises with a search warrant. A police officer, who accompanied the sergeant, testified in regard to a number of envelopes addressed to physicians containing cards similar to the one delivered to the witness Mitchell, which he found in searching the desk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked for certain rulings which were refused by the judge, but these have become immaterial, because the exceptions to their refusal were not argued and therefore were treated by the court as waived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-7\"><em>H. W. </em>James, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-8\"><em>M. J. </em>Dwyer, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b494-9\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARE\">Because guilty knowledge of its contents is not specifically averred, and only the general allegation appears that she <em>\u201c </em>knowingly \u201d distributed a circular or advertisement, the defendant\u2019s first contention is that no criminal offence has been described, and the motions to quash should have been granted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>12 Cush. 499. Compare <em>Rosen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>161 U. S. 29; <em>Price </em>v. <em>United States, </em>165 U. S. 311. But the indictment follows the language of R. L. c. 212, \u00a7 16, as amended by the St. of 1905, c. 316, as to the first of the offences created and defined, and under R. L. c. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 29, the crime charged may be set forth in the words used in the statute, with a general averment that the defendant committed the act, which obviates any further technical description of an evil intent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>2 Allen, 173, <em>180. Commonwealth </em>v. Lavery, 188 Mass. 13, 16. If there was any uncertainty as to the particulars of the offence further information would have been furnished upon the defendant\u2019s motion if otherwise the charge had not been plainly and substantially stated. R. L. c. 218, \u00a7 39. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>184 Mass. 320. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>187 Mass. 581. This course was not taken, and the indictment being sufficient the motions were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">The defendant\u2019s further contention is that in substance the entire testimony introduced by the Commonwealth was incom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>petent. While the acts made criminally punishable are distinct from the crime of procuring an abortion, evidence describing the rooms with their furnishings, the envelopes addressed to physicians containing similar cards, and the defendant\u2019s statements relating to the origin of her acquaintance with the officer to whom she had given the card described in the indictment, was properly admitted, not only as being descriptive either of the defendant\u2019s place of business, or of her employment, but also as indicative of her guilty knowledge of the contents of the card. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Devaney, 182 Mass. 33, 36. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Bond, 188 Mass. 91, 93, 94. It is true that mere possession of this card was not a crime, for the offence charged is its distribution or circulation as a paper conveying information where operations were performed for the purpose of procuring the miscarriage of pregnant women, but if intentionally handed to a patient who was seeking such treatment the offence would have been complete, and this equally would be true if the receiver was inquiring as to similar aid in behalf of a proposed patient. The weight of the defendant\u2019s argument, therefore, is that because it was procured by false representations there was no proof either of distribution or of circulation. Generally solicitation to commit a crime to which the party solicited yields, does not exonerate the wrongdoer, or exempt him from prosecution, and under the statute it is the circulation or distribution with guilty knowledge which is made unlawful, although patients may not be obtained. The intention with which it is put out is the controlling element, and if the defendant issued the card as an advertisement containing the information sought this would be a violation of the statute. If from a desire to obtain patronage she chose to rely upon the officer\u2019s statements rather than\" to require any corroboration before acting upon them such conduct would neither lessen her criminal responsibility, nor render his testimony incompetent if the jury were satisfied that it was delivered voluntarily with a criminal purpose, which was clearly and accurately explained in the instructions given. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Dana, 2 Met. 329. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>157 Mass. 460, 461. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Tibbetts, 157 Mass. 519. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>189 Mass. 457, 468. Foster\u2019s Crown Cases, 129. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 C. &amp; K. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The requests for rulings not having been argued must be treated as waived, and no error of law appearing the order denying the motions to quash must be affirmed and the exceptions overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
