Writ dated April 14, 1904.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-4\">At the trial in the Superior Court before <em>White, </em>J. the following facts were shown by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">Payson Avenue is a public way in the town of Easthampton and crosses at grade the tracks of the defendant. On the morning of January 25, 1904, the plaintiff with his daughter left home about twenty minutes before seven o\u2019clock for the purpose of carrying his daughter to her work in the Glendale Mill in Easthampton. The plaintiff\u2019s house was from a mile and a quarter to a mile and three quarters from this crossing. Upon their way they picked up one Strangford, who seated himself on the right hand side of the sleigh, the daughter being upon the left and the plaintiff, who was driving, being seated between them. About seven o\u2019clock, about ninety feet before reaching the crossing, the plaintiff drove across a spur track, the horse travelling at the rate of about six miles an hour. Near the gate tender\u2019s house there was a large bank of snow which appeared to have been thrown from the track and from the path leading from the gate tender\u2019s house to the tracks. The plaintiff was driving in an easterly direction and this pile of snow slanted in that direction. Lying upon the slanting or easterly side of this pile of snow, and within the limits of the highway, were a number of mail bags. These bags were not visible to a traveller on Payson Avenue travelling in an easterly direction until he was directly opposite them. When the sleigh reached the point where the mail bags lay, the horse snorted, leaped to one side and ran ; the occupants of the sleigh were thrown out and the plaintiff was injured. It further appeared that the mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>bags arrived afc twenty-five minutes before seven o\u2019clock, and were in the highway at seven o\u2019clock, and it was agreed that the bags were in the custody and under the control of the defendant during all that time and thereafter until delivered at the post office. It further appeared that the horse was a gentle, docile, safe mare, who had no bad habits, and that during all the time the plaintiff had possessed her she never before or after-wards had shied, plunged or run away, or ever had attempted to do any of these things.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-4\">The plaintiff was asked how far the bags were from the sleigh path, and said \u201cI should judge from what I could see when I went by they were not more than three feet from the track.\u201d Strangford testified that \u201c the mail bags were three or four feet from the sleigh path and five or six feet back from the railroad track.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s daughter testified \u201c The mail bags were about four feet from the sleigh track. The sleigh, when the mare lurched, was in the sleigh track.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-6\"><em>JH. L. </em>Shaw, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-7\"><em>J. 0.

There was also evidence of the due care of the plaintiff, and that the horse was ordinarily gentle and well broken. The case therefore should have been submitted to the jury. <em>Bemis </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>162 Mass. 342, and cases therein cited. <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>93 Maine, 46, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">At the argument before us it was stated by the counsel for the defendant that the place where the bags lay was also within the limits of the railroad location, but since that does not appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>on the record and the plaintiff did not agree that the case should be treated by us as though that statement were true, we have' not considered what difference, if any, in the law of the case would be made by such a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
