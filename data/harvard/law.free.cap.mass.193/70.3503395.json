Writ dated January 14, 1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-13\">At the trial in the Superior Court before Bell, J. the following facts appeared in evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-14\">Before the accident the defendant had been awarded a contract which provided for the construction of a masonry arch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>bridge over the Nashua Eiver near the village of West Boylston. The plaintiff was the resident engineer in charge of this and all other work at West Boylston growing out of the construction of the Wachusett reservoir, and it was his duty to inspect all the work as it progressed, and to inspect and approve the materials used. As a preliminary to the construction of the masonry work of the stone arch provided for in the contract it became necessary for the defendant to erect a derrick near the point where the arch was to stand, and the injury to the plaintiff occurred while the derrick mast was being put in position by the employees of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-4\">During the forenoon of the day of the accident the plaintiff, in the performance of his duties, had been inspecting the work in neighboring localities. His first work in the afternoon was to go with one McCauliff, the nephew and representative of the defendant, to show him where suitable sand and gravel might be had, the inspection of sand and gravel being one of the plaintiff\u2019s duties under the contract. The plaintiff then returned with McCauliff to the vicinity of the arch, and there met one Allen, a masonry inspector in the employ of the metropolitan water and sewerage board, and began telling him where suitable sand and gravel could be secured. While the plaintiff and Allen were talking, McCauliff left them and went to the point where the employees of the defendant were engaged in putting up the derrick, and shortly after went to the place where the hoisting engine had been placed. The work of putting up the derrick was in charge of one Goodrhue, a foreman in the defendant\u2019s employ. The plaintiff and Allen first stood at a distance of about one hundred and fifty feet from the point where the defendant\u2019s employees were engaged in putting up the derrick. The mast of the derrick, to the top of which five guy ropes were attached but which was not secured at the bottom, had been raised by means of another derrick standing near by until the foot of the mast dropped into the socket of the foot block, but in such a way that the mast listed slightly from the vertical position. After the mast had been raised to the position described above, the plaintiff and Allen approached somewhat nearer, the plaintiff still explaining to Allen what was to be done and the directions he had just given to McCauliff with reference to sand and gravel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>The plaintiff testified that after talking with Allen his next duty was to inspect the work being performed by three laborers of the Commonwealth who were engaged in preparing the foundation for the bridge at a distance of some twenty-five or thirty feet from the hoisting engine and that after he and Allen had walked a short distance toward the bridge they sat down on the westerly end of the derrick boom, sixty-nine feet long, which was lying near by and was supported by timbers. This boom was about fifteen or eighteen feet away from the foot block, and it was about twenty-five feet from the foot block to where the Commonwealth laborers were working. While the plaintiff and Allen were sitting on the boom and discussing the way in which the work was to be done, the defendant\u2019s foreman, Goodrhue, gave the order \u201c Just take a strain; raise it a little \u2014 just an inch,\u201d and immediately thereafter the mast was raised clear of the foot block and swung toward where Allen and the plaintiff were sitting. Allen ran in one direction and the plaintiff in another. It all happened in an instant, and the plaintiff only had time to jump over the boom and take about two steps when the mast of the derrick struck the boom, knocking him down and breaking his leg.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">The plaintiff testified that he was somewhat familiar with the raising of derricks and knew that it was a little dangerous, but that he thought that this derrick mast was substantially in place when he took his position on the boom, although he saw the defendant\u2019s servants prying the foot block. The only warning given was by the words <em>\u201c </em>Just take a strain; raise it a little \u2014\u25a0 just an inch,\u201d and these statements were made immediately one after another.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\">Derrick experts testified that \u201c Give it a strain \u201d had a particular meaning among men familiar with the operation of derricks, and that it meant just to tighten the ropes, to put the power of the hoister through the ropes so as to relieve the pressure, and that it did not mean to lift the mast entirely out of the foot block, as was done in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">While the plaintiff was in the hospital, where he went immediately after his injury, he signed at the request of his superior officer, Charles E. Wells, the department engineer for the metropolitan water and sewerage board, who explained to him that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>was simply a matter of form and something the Commonwealth required from its employees whenever and however they were injured, the following paper:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">\u201cMetropolitan Water and Sewerage Board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">\u201c Reservoir Department.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">\u201c Clinton, September 21,1904.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">\u201c To whom it may Concern: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">\u201c In consideration of receiving my pay while absent from duty on account of injury received while working at West Boylston Arch, and of being indemnified for necessary hospital expenses or doctor\u2019s bills, \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-10\">\u201c I hereby agree to make no claim against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on account of said injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-11\">\u201c Edwin T.

There was a verdict for the plaintiff and the case is here on exceptions by the defendant to the refusal of the presiding judge to give certain instructions that were requested. The instructions requested were in substance that oh all the evidence the plaintiff could not recover, that he was not in the exercise of due care, that he assumed the risk, that he was a mere volunteer or licensee, and that a certain release given by the plaintiff to the Commonwealth operated as a bar to his recovery in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Without reviewing it in detail we think that there was evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant. There was testimony tending to show that there should have been guys on the bottom of the derrick or that it should have been steadied by hand, and the jury were warranted in finding, if they did so find, that the accident was due to failure on the part of those in charge of the work of setting up the derrick to use one or the other of these precautions. The jury might also have found that there was negligence on the part of the engineer in regard to the manner in which he operated the engine. One witness testified that he, the engineer, \u201c opened the throttle of the engine; he gave it a yank; didn\u2019t intend to pull it out so far; ... if just a strain had been taken, no trouble would have happened. An excessive yank caused the trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">It could not be ruled as matter of law that the plaintiff was a mere volunteer or licensee, or that he was not in the exercise of due care, or that he assumed the risk. The defendant concedes that the plaintiff rightfully entered on the premises where the defendant\u2019s men were setting up the derrick. If the jury believed the plaintiff, as they must have done, he was there in the performance of duties required of him by the nature of his employment under the contract between the defendant and the Commonwealth, and therefore was not a volunteer or licensee. And the jury properly could have found, and no doubt did find, that in sitting down on the boom, as he and Allen did, the plaintiff had no reason to apprehend any danger from the derrick, and therefore was not wanting in the exercise of due care, and did not assume the risk of the accident which occurred. <em>Mahar </em>v. <em>Steuer, </em>170 Mass. 454. <em>McMahon </em>v. McHale, 174 Mass. 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The remaining question relates to the effect of the paper signed by the plaintiff agreeing, in consideration of receiving his pay while absent from duty and being indemnified for hospital expenses and doctors\u2019 bills, to make no claim upon the Commonwealth for the injury. We assume in favor of the defendant that the paper, though not under seal, operated as a release of any claim which the plaintiff had against the Commonwealth. It is well settled that a release of one of several joint tortfeasors will operate as a bar to a recovery against the others. But in order to have that effect we think that the party to whom the release is given must be one against whom an action would or might lie, and that a claim has been made for or on account of the alleged tort. It is not necessary that it should appear that he was in fact liable <em>(Leddy </em>v. Barney, 139 Mass. 394), or that there should have been concert of action amongst the alleged joint tortfeasors. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>5 Allen, 29. A gift from one of the joint tortfeasors will not operate to bar a recovery against the others. <em>Leddy </em>v. <em>Barney, supra. </em>There must be something in the nature of a claim on the one hand, and of possible liability under the rules of law applicable to the matter on the other, in order to render the release a bar to recovery against other joint tortfeasors. In the present case no action could have been maintained against the Commonwealth for the alleged injury. <em>Murdock Parlor Grate Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>152 Mass. 28. It was not legally answerable in tort to the plaintiff or to any one, and besides, no claim was made by the plaintiff against the Commonwealth. What was received by the plaintiff from the Commonwealth must be regarded therefore as in the nature of a gift or gratuity, and not as something paid in satisfaction of an injury for which it was or might be liable according to established rules of law, or of a claim made upon it by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
