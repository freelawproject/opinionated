Words, </em>\u201cImprovements.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b205-10\">The lease of a farm for three years, containing no restriction as to its assignment, gave the lessees the right to purchase the premises at any time during the term at their option, at a different price named for each of the three years. The lessees covenanted <em>\u201c </em>to make all repairs needed or required by them to revert to the owners,\u201d and also \u201c to make improvements on said premises to the value of at least $1,000 during said term and to leave the same therein at the end of said term if they do not purchase the premises.\u201d Within three months the lessees assigned the lease to a corporation organized for the purpose of selling poultry, which took possession of the premises and erected and occupied certain poultry buildings. Neither the original lessees nor their assignee attempted to exercise the option to purchase the premises. There was a default in the payment of rent, and the lessors brought a summary process against the lessees for possession of the premises and recovered judgment. The assignee voluntarily vacated the premises while the summary process was pending. A creditor of the assignee attached the poultry buildings as its property, obtained judgment, sold the buildings on execution and purchased them at the execution sale. In a suit in equity brought by the lessors against the purchaser at the execution sale to enjoin him from removing the buildings from the plaintiffs\u2019 land, it was <em>held, </em>that the covenant in the lease, to make improvements on the premises during the term and to leave such improvements thereon at the end of the term if the lessees did not purchase the premises, ran with the land and was binding on the assignee of the lease; therefore that the buildings upon their erection became part of the realty and no title passed to the defendant under the execution sale, and the plaintiffs were entitled to a decree.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-11\">Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court on August 4, 1905, by the owners of a farm of about fifteen acres situated on both sides of Malden Street in Worcester, praying for an injunction to restrain the defendant from removing certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>poultry buildings from the premises of the plaintiffs which had been attached and levied on by the defendant as personal property of the Park Villa Farm Company, a corporation, and had been purchased by the defendant at the execution sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-5\">An interlocutory injunction was issued and the case was referred to \u00e1 master. Later the case was heard by <em>Stevens, </em>J. upon the master\u2019s report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-6\">The following facts were found by the master:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-7\">On July 15, 1903, the plaintiffs, while owning a fruit and. vegetable farm in Worcester, executed and delivered a lease thereof to H. S. Park, T. H. Clarkson and C. R. Macomber for the term of three years from the first day of August, 1903. A copy of the lease is printed below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-8\">On October 3,1903, the lessees, Park, Clarkson and Macomber executed and delivered an assignment of the lease to the Park Villa Farm Company, a corporation established under the laws of the State of Maine. A copy of the assignment also is printed below. The plaintiffs were not parties to this assignment, made no agreement <em>to </em>accept the corporation as their tenant in lieu of the original lessees, and made no release of the tenants named in the lease therefrom or from any covenant contained therein. The Park Villa Farm Company was incorporated on August 24, 1903, for the purpose of raising and selling poultry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-9\">Under the assignment the Park Villa Farm Company took possession of the leased premises and erected structures thereon for carrying on its business. All of these buildings were constructed of spruce with spruce rafters; the roofs were covered with spruce boards and roofing paper. They all stood upon posts sunk in the ground, except an incubator building which was on a stone foundation and under which was a cellar. The heating apparatus was in this cellar and pipes extended to the brooding houses. All of these buildings were erected by the Park Villa Farm Company, with the knowledge of the lessors while that company was the assignee of the lease, with the intention and for the purpose of carrying on the business of that corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-10\">Default having been made in the payment of the rent reserved in the lease, the lessors, the plaintiffs in this suit, began an action of summary process against Park, Clarkson and Mac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>omber in the Central District Court of Worcester, to recover possession of the leased premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-5\">In that action Park, Clarkson and Macomber appeared by counsel and filed an answer. The plaintiffs recovered judgment against them for possession of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-6\">No execution for possession issued in the case, the Park Villa Farm Company having voluntarily vacated the premises during the pendency of the action. None of the buildings erected by the corporation ever were removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-7\">Under a contract with the Park Villa Farm Company the defendant in this suit sold and delivered to that corporation the building paper which was used in the construction of the buildings. The corporation did not pay him for it, and on November 4,1904, he began an action against the corporation in the Central District Court of Worcester to recover damages for nonpayment of his claim and attached the poultry buildings as the property of the corporation. On June 9, 1905, he recovered judgment against the corporation; on June 12, 1905, execution issued; on July 5,1905, the buildings were levied on and on July 31, 1905, they were sold on execution and were purchased by the judgment creditor, the defendant in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-8\">The lease referred to above was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-9\">\u201c This indenture, made the fifteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and three.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-10\">\u201c Witnesseth, that we, Mary F.

Oct. 3rd. 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-8\">\u201c We hereby assign, set over and transfer to the Park Villa Farm Company, a corporation duly organized by law and having a place of business in Worcester, Mass, the within lease and all rights and benefits to be derived therefrom and subject to all the conditions and covenants by the lessees to be performed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-9\">\u201cH. S. Park. T. H. Clarkson. C. R. Macomber.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-10\">The defendant asked the judge to rule as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-11\">1. The covenant in said lease, to wit, \u201c and said lessees agree to make improvements on said premises to the value of at least one thousand ($1,000) dollars during said term and to leave the same therein at the end of said term if they do not purchase the premises,\u201d is a personal covenant, does not run with the land, is binding upon the lessees only, and the assignees of the lease are not bound by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-12\">2. The acceptance of the assignment by the assignee corporation not being in writing, cannot be proved or is not enforceable as against it, because of the statute of frauds. [Not argued.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-13\">3. The buildings seized upon execution and sold at execution sale to the defendant Stone are personal property, and the buildings were in law in possession of the attaching officer from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>time of the attachment, divested the title of the debtor corporation and operated as a transfer of title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-5\">4. The corporation which placed the buildings on the land for its purposes as assignee of the lease, had the right to remove them within a reasonable time not only as against the lessee but also as against' the lessor after vacating the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-6\">5. The agreement of the lessees to have improvements on the land is merely a covenant collateral to the land, does not concern the thing demised, and the assignee of the lease should not be charged with such agreement; that equity will not enforce an affirmative covenant not running with the land against the assignee of the lease whether he had notice of the covenant or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-7\">6. The plaintiffs are estopped by the ejectment proceedings brought in December, 1904, from claiming that the lessees were not in possession prior thereto. The rights of the defendant Stone are as of November 5, 1904, when the attachment was made, a month before the ejectment proceedings were instituted. [Not argued.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-8\">7. The plaintiffs have been guilty of laches in bringing this suit. [Not argued.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-9\">8. The buildings placed on the land by the corporation were trade fixtures and removable as such, under the principles of law which apply thereto and the corporation which erected them had the right to remove them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-10\">9. Upon the pleadings and the master\u2019s report, as a matter of law, the finding should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-11\">The judge refused to rule as requested by the defendant, and entered a decree for the plaintiffs. The defendant alleged exceptions. He also appealed from the decree, but insisted \u201c upon his exceptions rather than his appeal.\u201d The points raised by the refusal of the requests numbered 2, 6 and 7 were not argued.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-12\"><em>W.

This instrument by apt words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>demised a farm of about fifteen acres, with the buildings, for the term of three years at a fixed rental, with an agreement that the lessees might purchase the premises at a price to be adjusted in amount according to each year of their occupation. The usual covenants were inserted, which included an agreement by the lessees \u201c to make all repairs needed or required by them,\u201d which at the end of the term were <em>\u201c </em>to revert to the owners.\u201d At the close of this recital the following provision appears: \u201c said lessees agree to make improvements on said premises to the value of at least one thousand . . . dollars during said term and to leave the same therein at the end of said term if they do not purchase the premises.\u201d While inartificially expressed the language employed was sufficient to create a binding obligation as no precise form of technical words is required to create a covenant, but corresponding expressions, or a clear manifestation of such an intention are all that is required. <em>Trull </em>v. <em>Eastman, </em>3 Met. 121,124. And it is evident that the lessees expressly charged themselves with the performance of a promise to increase the value of the property to this amount, which also must be understood as forming part of the consideration for the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The corporation, however, to which the lessees assigned their estate was not a party, and would not be bound to its performance except by privity of estate, but in general covenants defining the manner in which the demised premises shall be enjoyed or dealt with run with the land and bind the covenantee. They also bind an assignee as to his rights in the real estate, even where assigns are not named, when the beneficial act to be performed relates solely to increasing the value of the premises as they exist at the date of the lease. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>19 Pick. 449. <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>19 Pick. 459, 462. <em>Patten </em>v. Deshon, 1 Gray, 325, 329. <em>Easterby </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>6 Bing. 644. <em>Vyvyan </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>1 B. &amp; C. 410. <em>Congleton </em>v. <em>Pattison, </em>10 East, 130. <em>Spencer\u2019s case, </em>5 Coke, 16 a. The word \u201c improvements \u201d is of broad signification, covering not only repairs and additions to buildings in existence at the time of the demise, but also new buildings subsequently erected, and if in this covenant assigns are not again mentioned they are named in the preceding habendum. <em>South Congregational Meeting-house </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Gray, 407, 408. <em>Kabley </em>v. <em>Worcester Gas Light Co. </em>102 Mass. 392, 394. <em>Haven </em>v. Adams, 8 Allen, 363. <em>Daggett </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>128 Mass. 167. <em>Schenley\u2019s </em>appeal, 70 Penn. St. 98, 102. <em>Stockett </em>v. Howard, 34 Md. 121. <em>Low </em>v. <em>Innes, </em>4 DeG., J. &amp; S. 286. It is then a question of construction whether the immediate parties intended to define and control only their personal obligations, or whether they also intended by this covenant to bind whomsoever might succeed to their respective estates, and this question must be determined from the language and purpose of the entire instrument. <em>Duncklee </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>151 Mass. 408. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>163 Mass. 564, 568. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Pocasset Manuf. Co. </em>180 Mass. 130, 132. <em>Hollywood </em>v. <em>First Parish in Brockton, </em>192 Mass. 269. <em>Masury </em>v. <em>Southworth, </em>9 Ohio St. 340. <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Hands, </em>44 Ch. D. 503, 517, 518. Upon the acceptance of the assignment the assignee succeeded not only to the burdens but to the benefits attached to the leasehold, among which was the right to buy the premises, found in the covenant of the lessors, which ran with the land and could have been enforced by the corporation. <em>Van Horne </em>v. <em>Crain, </em>1 Paige, 455. <em>Hagar </em>v. <em>Buck, </em>44 Vt. 285. By engaging to make improvements upon the conditions named, while enhancing the value of \u25a0the reversion, the lessees also would receive the beneficial use of the buildings during the remainder of the term as well as increasing the value of the premises for the betterment of themselves, or their assigns, if ultimately either elected to purchase, with the further benefit of a fixed rebate to the purchaser of the rent which had been paid for the preceding months. These various provisions when taken in connection with the silence of the lease as to any restriction prohibiting the lessees from assigning their estate, which included the right to acquire the fee by purchase, leads to the reasonable conclusion that the covenanting parties intended that all the covenants regarding the manner in which the demised premises should be used and enjoyed, or improved by the lessees, should not only bind them personally as to their interest in the premises, but also those who by assignment might succeed to their estate. <em>Hollywood </em>v. <em>First Parish in Brockton, ubi supra. </em>Upon the delivery of the assignment the corporation entered into possession and erected and occupied the buildings, which, because of this covenant, upon their erec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tion at once became part of the realty. During the pendency of a suit by the plaintiffs to recover possession, the corporation without having taken advantage of the option to purchase abandoned the premises before the expiration of the term, and as neither at the time of the attachment nor of the levy of the execution were the buildings the personal property of the judgement debtor, the defendant acquired no title at the sale. <em>Westgate </em>v. <em>Wixon, </em>128 Mass. 304, 307. <em>Aldrich </em>v.
