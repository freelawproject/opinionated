It appeared that the plaintiff hauled all the wood that the defendant had cut and ready at a certain time, and was paid for it, that, there being no more wood ready at that time, he went to another job, and afterwards returned and hauled more wood for the defendant, for which the defendant refused to pay him until all the wood on the lot had been hauled away. <em>Held, </em>that, even if the contract was an entire one to haul all the wood upon the lot, the defendant by his breach of the contract having prevented full performance on the part of the plaintiff, the plaintiff was entitled to recover on a <em>quantum meruit </em>the fair value of the work done by him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b303-11\">The findings of fact of a judge sitting without a jury will not be revised unless it is made to appear that they were unwarranted by the evidence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-13\">Contract on an account annexed to recover compensation for hauling wood for the defendant in November, 1905.

The defendant further testified that there were choppers on the lot all the time, sometimes one or two and sometimes seven or eight; that in October when there was wood cut and made ready on the lot the defendant asked the plaintiff. to finish the lot and the plaintiff said he would as soon as he finished the job he was then on; that the plaintiff took up the work again; that when the plaintiff came to the defendant for money the'defendant declined to pay him until he finished the lot, on the ground that the plaintiff had left the bottoms of the piles and because the defendant had heard the plaintiff was to leave the job. The defendant testified- that one dollar a cord was a fair price for hauling the entire lot. In answer to the question of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, \u201c Did you tell Allen Tarbox that you owed Bailey and would have to pay him ?\u201d the defendant replied, <em>\u201c No, </em>sir. I told him I owed him for wood hauled, I supposed there was some value there due him.\u201d When asked \u201c And you still think there is some value there due him ? \u201d he replied, \u201c Certainly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to rule : 1.

The declaration is upon an account annexed. The plaintiff contended that the defendant made an oral contract, under which the plaintiff was to haul for the defendant some wood from the lot where it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>cut to a coal yard, for which the defendant was to pay the plaintiff one dollar per cord. The plaintiff hauled all the wood which the defendant had cut and ready for him in September, 1905, and was paid for it. There being no more wood ready at the time he went to another job, returning to work upon the defendant\u2019s lot in November of the same year. The defendant refused to pay anything for this work until all the wood upon the lot had heen hauled away, hence this action. In the Superior Court, where the case was heard without a jury, the judge found as a matter of fact that the agreement was that the plaintiff should haul all the wood at the price of one dollar a cord, the defendant to cut it and have it ready for him; that the agreement made no provision for deferment of payment until all the wood was hauled, that the plaintiff performed his part of the contract as far as he could, and that there was a breach of the contract on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The bill of exceptions does not purport to disclose all of the evidence, but the testimony of the defendant abundantly justifies the findings made by the judge who heard the case and the verdict rendered by him. The prayers presented by the defendant were all immaterial, in view of the testimony of the defendant and the facts found. Even if the contract as originally made was entire, to haul all the wood upon the lot, yet it was broken by the defendant without fault on the part of the plaintiff, and under these circumstances the latter is entitled to recover on a <em>quantum meruit </em>the full value of the work done by him. The defendant cannot be permitted to set up a contract, the performance of which he himself has prevented, as a bar to paying the plaintiff his fair compensation. <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>128 Mass. 232. <em>DeMontague </em>v. <em>Bacharach, </em>187 Mass. 128. But even if the facts were not so clearly against the defendant, we could not attempt to pass upon the weight and effect of the evidence and revise the finding, provided there were facts and circumstances upon which the finding might be based, nor unless it appeared that it was unwarranted by the evidence. <em>Wylie </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>170 Mass. 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
