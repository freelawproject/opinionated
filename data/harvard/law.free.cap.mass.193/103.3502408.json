The judge refused to give this ruling, either in form or substance, and submitted the case to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $300. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-6\"><em>W.

Co. </em>160 Mass. 131; <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Overman Wheel Co. </em>174 Mass. 455, and cases therein cited,) and that he was negligent in his duty to the plaintiff in permitting the carriage to be moved without taking some steps to ascertain where the plaintiff was and, if necessary, to give him notice in time to save himself. Such findings are sufficient to maintain the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The plaintiff under the statute upon which the third count is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>based did not assume the risk of this carelessness of L\u2019Heureux. \u201c The risk which the workman assumes by virtue of his contract Of employment does not include the risk arising from the negligent act of a superintendent.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>City Coal Co. </em>172 Mass. 324, 327, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
