Writ dated March 6, 1906.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-12\">The declaration alleged that the defendant on December 26, 1905, operated a steam railroad through Newburyport and for a lo.ng time previous to the injuries complained of had maintained a station in Newburyport at which its trains stopped, for the purpose of taking on and letting off persons rightfully upon its trains; that contiguous to and adjoining the station was a bridge spanning Merrimac Street in that city, which was constructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>without railings, barriers, lights, warnings or safeguards; that between the outer rail of the track and the girder of the bridge there was a piece of timber running lengthwise with the bridge and extending about two inches above its surface ; that beyond this timber planks were laid at an angle with the surface of the bridge, sloping upward and outward to the girder, so that they formed an inclined plane running the whole length of the bridge, joining the girder in such a way as to cause a person walking beyond the outer rail to pitch forward toward and over the girder, and that this condition could not be observed owing to the darkness at the time of the accident to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, who, when walking along the bridge, was thrown to the street below and was killed; and that the defendant negligently failed to furnish suitable lights and safeguards upon the bridge and negligently caused its cars to be stopped on the bridge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-4\">The further material allegations in the declaration were that the \u201c plaintiff\u2019s intestate was a duly appointed and qualified officer of the watch and constable for criminal service in said Newburyport, doing his duty as such, and wearing his uniform; that on or about said date and in the night-time, the defendant, by its servants and agents, stopped one of its trains at or near its station in said Newburyport for the purpose of allowing persons rightfully to board its said train and alight therefrom, in such a manner and place as to cause the rear of said train to stand upon or beyond the aforesaid bridge of the defendant over said Merrimac Street; that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, acting as an officer and constable aforesaid, and in the performance of the duty delegated to him under the instructions of a superior officer, and upon information received by him, and upon his belief that criminals were escaping on said train from said Newburyport, and for the purpose of apprehending said criminals in the performance of his duty as said officer and constable, and for the purpose of examining certain persons abroad whom he had reason to suspect of an unlawful design, boarded said train and walked through one or more cars thereon toward the rear of said train and to or beyond the bridge aforesaid ; that he found one of said suspected persons in said car; that, accompanied by said suspected person, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate then alighted and walked away from said train, toward said station upon said bridge; . . . that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>rightfully upon said train under an implied invitation from the defendant; that said defendant had accepted as passengers on its said train during the night-time a person or persons whom the plaintiff\u2019s intestate had reason to suspect of some unlawful design.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-3\">The defendant demurred to the declaration.

See R. L. c. 11, \u00a7 223; c. 46, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 13; c. 52, \u00a7 8; c. 57, \u00a7 93; c. 66, \u00a7 5; c. 75, \u00a7 128; c. 91, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 123, 134; c. 100, \u00a7 86; c. 108, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 17, 23; c. 111, \u00a7 260; c. 166, \u00a7 2; c. 204, \u00a7 20; c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 109, 121; c. 212, \u00a7\u00a7 36,46, 47, 53, 58, 60, 62, 74, 80; St. 1906, c.403, amending R. L. c. 212, \u00a7 53; c. 214, \u00a7\u00a72, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The vital allegations are that, being informed and believing \u201cthat criminals were escaping on said train from said Newburyport,\u201d he went aboard for the purpose of \u201capprehending said criminals \u201d and \u201c examining certain persons abroad whom he had reason to suspect of an unlawful design.\u201d \u201c Criminals \u201d is a word of broad significance, and includes those who may have committed the most trifling infractions of a penal statute, as well as those guilty of the most heinous offences. It obviously describes a large number of persons, whom a constable would have no right to arrest without a warrant. The other statement of purpose, for which the entry upon the train was made, was to perform the duty required under R. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2, relating to watch and ward. The justification, which this statute might afford, reaches only to the watch in the examination of \u201call persons abroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>whom they have reason to suspect of an unlawful design.\u201d It has been strongly argued, in behalf of the defendant, that, in view of the history of this statute, it should be construed to apply only to those persons who are walking abroad. See statute passed October 19, 1652; 3 Mass. Col. Rec. 282; Prov. St. 1699-1700, c. 10; 1 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 381; St. 1796, c. 82; Rev. Sts. c. 17, \u00a7 4; Prov. St. 1712-13, c. 4; 1 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 699; Commissioners\u2019 Report, c. 23, \u00a7 4; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners, </em>139 Mass. 559, 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Without passing upon this question, it is enough for the purposes of the present case to determine that one, who has become a passenger upon a steam railroad train and has placed himself in the carriage of the common carrier, cannot be said to be \u201c abroad.\u201d Therefore, the constable was at most a mere licensee. The allegations of the declaration place him upon a quite different basis than was the plaintiff in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>135 Mass. 116, where the police officer, in the execution of his duty, was injured by reason of a violation of statute on the part of the owner of the building. This case is also distinguishable from <em>Learoyd </em>v. <em>Godfrey, </em>138 Mass. 315, where the police officer had been expressly invited upon the premises, and, in addition to the invitation, went for the purpose of suppressing a breach of the peace. The particular circumstances in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>152 Mass. 513, and <em>Finnegan </em>v. <em>Fall River Gas Works, </em>159 Mass. 311, were such as to warrant the finding of an implied invitation on the part of the owner to enter the premises where the injuries were received. It is not alleged here that the defendant had failed to perform any statutory obligation incumbent upon it, which is a further fact distinguishing it from <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>135 Mass. 116. There was not even the implied invitation on the part of the defendant for the constable to enter the train, which might possibly be held to exist if a theft or other crime was being committed upon the train. Nor are the plaintiff\u2019s rights any stronger, if indeed they are as strong, as those of a fireman entering upon property for the purpose of protecting it from destruction. Yet it has been held in other jurisdictions that under such circumstances the person entering has only the rights of a licensee. See <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>143 Ill. 182; <em>Beehler </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>18 R. I. 563; <em>Kohn </em>v. <em>Lovett, </em>44 Ga. 251; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>Woods </em>v. Miller, 30 App. Div. (N. Y.) 232; <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>136 Ind. 431. The case made out by the declaration is somewhat like <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>188 Mass. 536, where the defendant was exonerated, the plaintiff having only the rights of a licensee. The defendant owed him no duty- to keep its premises in a safe condition, and in such a case could not be held liable ordinarily, unless there was some recklessness or wanton misconduct on the part of itself or its servants. As was said by Mr. Justice Barker, in <em>Redigan </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>155 Mass. 44, at page 47, \u201c The general rule is, that a bare licensee has no cause of action on account of dangers existing in the place he is permitted to enter, but goes there at his own risk, and must take the premises as he finds them. . . . l\u00edo duty is cast upon the owner to take care of the licensee, or to see that he does not go to a dangerous place, but he must take his permission with its concomitant conditions and perils, and cannot recover for injuries caused by obstructions or pitfalls.\u201d See <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>180 Mass. 504; <em>Byrnes </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>181 Mass. 322; <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>183 Mass. 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
