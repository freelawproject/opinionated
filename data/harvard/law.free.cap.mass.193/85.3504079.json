Writ dated November 4, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-7\">At the trial in the Superior Court before Pierce, J. it appeared that on the day of the accident the plaintiff with two other workmen was employed under the direction of O\u2019Brien in painting a barn and house, that O\u2019Brien helped the three men to rig the staging on the barn, which consisted of the extension ladder doubled up suspended from the roof by two ropes. On the ladder was a long board on which to place the pots of paint. Having rigged the staging, O\u2019Brien told the three men to paint the barn which was about twenty-four feet wide, and went away.. The plaintiff painted in the middle and the other two painters at .either end. Having painted the barn with one drop of the ladder the men, without the assistance of O\u2019Brien, proceeded to rig the ladder in the same way on one end of the house, also about twenty-four feet wide. O\u2019Brien came by and examined the hooks to see that they were properly fastened to the roof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>and proceeded to another job. Having finished this end of the house with one drop of the doubled up ladder, the three men proceeded to move the staging to the back of the house, which was wider, being twenty-eight feet wide. They decided to paint the back with one drop, and in order to do this extended the ladder by pulling it out. O\u2019Brien was not there at the time. The plaintiff was painting in the middle, and according to his testimony the other two men \u201c were right near the ropes.\u201d Suddenly the ladder gave way and the plaintiff fell and was injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\">A part of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was as follows: \u201c There were three men on the ladder when we painted the barn, and also when we painted the house. We had painted the four sides of the barn and had painted one end of the house and were painting the back of the house when the ladder broke. There were three men on the ladder. I worked in the middle and a man on either side. The ladder was rigged in the same way when it broke as it was when we were painting before on the house and barn, except that the side of the house where we were painting when the ladder broke was wider, and the ladder had to be pulled out more. When we began to paint the house, O\u2019Brien was there and helped to tie the ropes, and he said when we finished painting that end, we could move onto the side of the house and paint, but O\u2019Brien was not there when the ladder was put on the side where it broke, and took no part in putting up the staging at the place where it fell, because he had gone away, as soon as we began to paint the end of the house. We had used this ladder painting on other jobs in this same way. When the ladder is pulled way out, it is thirty-four feet long, and when it is not it is twenty feet long. It was stretched out to a length of twenty-six feet so that the ends of the ladder overlapped each other, when we were painting on the side of the house when it broke. The ropes were attached to the ladder about three or four feet from either end.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\">Other material facts, including the previous experience of the plaintiff and the weight of the three painters on the ladder, are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-7\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to rule that upon all the evidence in the case the plaintiff was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>entitled to recover, and that the verdict must be for the defendant. The judge refused to rule as requested, and submitted the case to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of #3,000; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-5\"><em>O. Q. Milton, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-6\">&lt;7. <em>H. Blood, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b114-7\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABD\">We do not find it necessary to consider whether one of the defences set up by the defendant is made out as matter of law, namely, that a stronger ladder or ladders were furnished by him and were accessible for use by the plaintiff, for we are of opinion that if the ladder in question had been the only ladder furnished there is no evidence that the defendant was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">It is not pretended that the ladder made an insecure staging when used as it was used while O\u2019Brien was present, that is to say, without its being extended at all. We say while O\u2019Brien was present for we assume that he might have been found to be a superintendent so far as liability on that ground under the statute goes\u00bf and to be the person to whom the defendant left the matter of stagings so far as liability at common law and under the statute as to safe appliances and safe ways, works and machinery are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">What caused the accident here complained of was drawing the ladder out to a length of twenty-six feet at least, and putting on it three painters, whose aggregate weight was assumed to have been four hundred and ninety pounds, in order to paint the side of the house in one \u201c drop \u201d in place of keeping the ladder doubled up, as it was when O\u2019Brien was present, and painting the side of the house in two \u201c drops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">The plaintiff, to use his own words, was a painter of twenty years\u2019 experience, who had painted on stages all that time, had constantly used stages of all kinds on the outside of buildings, and had used extension ladders \u201clots of times.\u201d The ladder was of spruce, with side pieces approximately two by three inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">The case therefore comes to this: Was it negligence on the defendant\u2019s part to leave the plaintiff and his fellow workmen to paint the house with this ladder as a staging, without telling them not to extend the ladder if all three of them, with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>average weight of over one hundred and sixty pounds each were to use it as a staging ? That it would be dangerous to do so is in our opinion a fact within the knowledge of a painter of twenty years\u2019 experience, who was conversant with the use of extension ladders as stagings.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\">The case belongs to the same class as <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Eastman Freight Car Heater Co. </em>176 Mass. 135. See also <em>Adasken </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>165 Mass. 443; <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Hand, </em>168 Mass. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The plaintiff has asked us to hold that he had a right to go to the jury because in the course of his testimony he said \u201cWe had used this ladder painting on other jobs in this same way.\u201d His argument is that from this isolated statement the jury could have inferred that the same three men had used the ladder extended and that this was known by the defendant. We are of opinion that taken as an isolated piece of testimony the jury would not be warranted in drawing those inferences. Moreover, as the evidence went in, this statement is shown by the testimony preceding and following it to refer to the use of the ladder as a staging, not to its use as a staging when drawn out, with three men upon it weighing on an average one hundred and sixty pounds apiece. If the plaintiff intended to go to the jury on this theory he should have developed it more in evidence than he did by eliciting this statement in the connection in which it was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
