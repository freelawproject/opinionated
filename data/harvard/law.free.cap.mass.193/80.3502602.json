Holland died on April 3, 1903; Frank H.. Holland, her executor, in May, 1905, sold seventy-five shares of the American Bank Note Company, of the par value of $50 a share, then standing in the name of Hannah A. Holland and originally in the name of Henry Holland, and being a part of his estate received by her, for the sum of $5,387.10 and deposited the proceeds thereof, viz., said sum of $5,387.10, in the Quinsigamond National Bank of Worcester, and later in the Worcester Trust Company as a separate and distinct fund.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-6\">The statement in the brief for the appellant in regard to the will of Henry Holland, which is referred to in the opinion as not bringing that will before this court, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-7\">\u201c Henry Holland by will, a copy of which appears in the case of Ball v. Holland, 189 Mass. 369, and which counsel agree may be referred to, gave to his widow, Hannah A. Holland, the right to use for her support and the support and education of his minor children the principal of his property, and bequeathed the income thereof to her absolutely.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-8\"><em>A. M. Taft f J. B. Scott, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-9\"><em>H. L. Parker, </em>for the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed of the estate of Henry Holland.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-10\"><em>W. Thayer &amp; H. W. Cobb, </em>for Charles E. Holland.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b108-11\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANv\">The only question of law presented here is whether an executor acquires title to shares of stock belonging to the estate of his testator by wrongfully transferring them into his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">It is elementary law that an owner does not lose his property in a chattel by a wrongful conversion of it by another. The owner may at his election hold the wrongdoer for damages or retake the chattel owned by him. This is plainly stated in <em>Glaspy </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>135 Mass. 435, cited by the appellant together with <em>Choate </em>v. <em>Arrington, </em>116 Mass. 552, and <em>King </em>v. Ham, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>6 Allen, 298. There is nothing in any of these eases which supports the appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">There is no ground for the argument that the executrix bought the stock in question of herself. The transfer to herself unexplained is of itself a wrongful conversion. But the fact is put beyond a doubt by the statement in the account that the executrix \u201c appropriated and converted to her own use all the remainder of the estate \u201d not spent by her. It' is apparent from the statement of the items in the decree of the Probate Court making up the \u00a77,628.33 in question that this covers the shares of stock here in question. We do not mean to intimate that if she had undertaken to buy the stock of herself the sale could not have been avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">What remedy or remedies the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>may have, based on the subsequent sale by the executor of the executrix or otherwise, is not now before us. See in this connection <em>Sewall </em>v. Patch, 132 Mass. 326. All that we now are called upon to decide and do decide is that the shares of stock in question were the property of the estate of Henry Holland at the date of the decease of his widow, the executrix of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The statement in the brief for the appellant that the will of Henry Holland which appears in <em>Ball </em>v. Holland, 189 Mass. 369, may be referred to cannot be entertained by the court. A case not passed upon by the single justice who entered the decree appealed from cannot be substituted by agreement of counsel. The question before us is the correctness of the decree of the single justice. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>182 Mass. 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">In our opinion the appeal is frivolous, and the entry must be <em>Decree </em>affirmed, <em>with double costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
