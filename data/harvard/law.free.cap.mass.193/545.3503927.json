Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 20. The defendant contends that it was taxed properly by the assessors of the defendant city, under the first clause of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">The history of this clause (Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 20, cl. 1) is stated in <em>Hittinger </em>v. <em>Westford, </em>135 Mass. 258, and in <em>Boston Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>137 Mass. 332. As stated in those cases, the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the original act (Prov. St. 1753-54, c. 10, \u00a7 3; 3 Prov. Laws, 693) was enlarged by St. 1821, c. 107, and St. 1839, c. 139, when, so far as the substance of the act goes, it was put into its present form. The question here is whether the language then adopted is broad enough to reach this case. The defendant relies on the fact that stocks and bonds are goods, wares and merchandise within the statute of frauds. <em>Tisdale </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>20 Pick. 9. <em>Somerby </em>v. <em>Buntin, </em>118 Mass. 279. But it does not follow from that that they are goods, wares and merchandise within Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 20, cl. 1, where they are coupled with the words \u201c other stock in trade,\u201d and with the requirement that the \u201c owners hire or occupy manufactories, stores, shops, or wharves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In <em>Boston Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>137 Mass. 332, this court held with great hesitation that a pawnbroker\u2019s shop was within this clause of the act. But to hold that a banker and broker\u2019s office is within the act would be taking a decided step beyond the step taken in that case. The business carried on by a banker and broker is not the kind of business which is carried on in a shop or store and the capital employed therein is not usually or properly spoken of as \u201c goods, wares, merchandise, and other stock in trade \u201d or either of them. For these reasons the first clause of Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 20, does not in our opinion apply in the case at bar. The capital of the plaintiff used in his business as a banker and broker was taxable under Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 20, in the town of Wenham where he had his home.' See <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>187 Mass. 168. See also in this connection <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Portland, </em>81 Maine, 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
