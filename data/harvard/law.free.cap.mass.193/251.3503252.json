If' upon inquiry of any of the persons named or any other person who knows anything about the work done or materials furnished there appears to you to be anything wrong in regard to any bill, I will submit the matter to Mr. Cook for explanation ; if he does not satisfactorily explain it you will of course be at liberty to take any action that you think best for the interests of your client.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-16\">\u201c As to the insurance Mr. Cook says that he has already submitted to you the gross amount of insurance carried on the property and the premiums paid; but he is willing, if you care to do so, to allow one of the leading insurance agents of the city, \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>L.

The court heard the evidence of the parties which was both oral and written. The case was argued by counsel. It appeared to the court from the whole evidence that the plaintiffs prior to bringing the suit had ample opportunity to examine all the itemized bills in detail, and that the names of the insurance companies were immaterial as long as they were sound companies; and thereupon, upon consideration thereof, it is</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">\u201c Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the defendant render to each of the plaintiffs a detailed statement of all insurance upon each piece of property belonging to the plaintiffs under the defendant\u2019s control and charge, including the premiums paid therefor from April 10, 1905, to June 11, 1906, save and except the names of the companies. No costs to be allowed to either party.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-8\">The plaintiffs appealed \u201c from the decree of the court in refusing to order the defendant to render to the petitioners the names of the insurance companies in which the defendant carries the insurance upon the property belonging to the plaintiffs and of which he, the defendant, is their agent.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-9\"><em>J). R. Radovsky, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-10\"><em>A. J. Jennings, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b281-11\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkrA\">Under the agreement between the parties the defendant while authorized to act as their agent also was given an irrevocable power for a term of five years to manage their property consisting of improved real estate, accounting to each of the plaintiffs for one third of the rents, after retaining in his discretion such sums as might be required for the disbursements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>enumerated in the instrument. The bare relation of principal and agent may be insufficient to maintain a bill in equity by the principal for an accounting unless the account is so complicated that it cannot conveniently be stated or settled at law, but the fiduciary character of the relations created by this agreement constituted the defendant, who has accepted the appointment, a trustee. R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 3, cl. 6. <em>Badger </em>v. McNamara, 123 Mass. 117. <em>Pratt </em>v. Tuttle, 136 Mass. 233. <em>Brown </em>v. Corey, 191 Mass. 189. <em>Makepeace </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>4 DeG., J. &amp; S. 649. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>188 Mass. 163, 165. By his acceptance it then became his duty faithfully to administer the property, to keep accounts of all expenditures, and to render an account to the plaintiffs at reasonable times with full information as to all details of his management. The bill charges that in addition to the statement contained in the accounts rendered the plaintiff's requested that the amount of insurance procured and placed on each parcel of the estate, might be further itemized by including the rates paid, and the names of the companies which issued the policies. The presiding judge having found that these corporations were solvent declined to. order the defendant to disclose their identity.' No satisfactory reason, however, appears why this information should not be given. The plaintiffs were entitled to a full discovery, which was not limited to the financial soundness of the insurers, to be determined by the opinion of their agent, although this opinion, upon his testimony alone, was confirmed by the court. It was the money of the plaintiffs that had been paid, and they had a right fully to explore the entire field of their agent\u2019s operations for the purpose of ascertaining whether the disbursements charged had actually been made, and this would include the premiums paid for insurance to companies of which the defendant was the local agent, and in which as far as possible he had placed the insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In a suit in equity a finding of fact upon conflicting evidence, especially where the credibility of witnesses is involved, will not be reversed on appeal even if all the evidence is reported unless clearly wrong. <em>Poland </em>v. <em>Beal, </em>192 Mass. 559. <em>Harvey-Watts Co. </em>v. <em>Worcester Umbrella Co., ante, </em>138. This rule of practice, however, has no application in the present case, for the finding of financial soundness did not involve a finding that the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ant was not obliged to account further by stating the names of the companies. Such a conclusion is in the nature of a ruling of law, which for the reasons given cannot be sustained. The decree of the Superior Court must be reversed, and the case is to stand for further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
