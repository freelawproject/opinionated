Writ dated September 13, 1904. The first count alleged that the defendant on September 7, 1904, charged the plaintiff with the crime of adultery by words spoken of her substantially as follows: \u201c Ward (meaning the plaintiff\u2019s husband) has sold half of his wife to Legeyt (meaning Warren Legeyt) hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">The second count alleged that the defendant on September 9, 1904, charged the plaintiff with the crime of adultery by words spoken of her substantially as follows: \u201c She (meaning the plaintiff) is nothing but a damned whore anyway.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">The third count alleged that the defendant on September 9, 1904, charged the plaintiff with the crime of adultery by words spoken of the plaintiff substantially as follows : \u201c You (meaning Warren Legeyt) use (meaning commit adultery with) her (meaning plaintiff) one half the time and Ward (meaning the plaintiff\u2019s husband) half the time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">No special damage was alleged. The defendant\u2019s answer contained a general denial and alleged a privileged communication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-8\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>DeOourcy, </em>J. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence showed that on September 7, 1904, the defendant asked one Hayes, who at the time \u2022 was with the defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s witness, the question set out in the first count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. The witness testified that the defendant said \u201c Is Warren Legeyt boarding there ? \u201d and the witness said \u201cHe is coming there to-night,\u201d and that then the defendant wanted to know if Mr. Ward had not sold half his wife to Mr. Legeyt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-9\">The words set out in the second and third counts of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, according to the plaintiff\u2019s witness, Warren Legeyt, were uttered to Legeyt, who was alone at the time with the defendant, on September 9,1904. Legeyt testified that the defendant was standing on the sidewalk when he drove up to him and asked him what he was saying about Mrs. Ward and himself; that after some conversation which did not concern the case the defendant said \u201c that Ward had sold me half his wife to pay me for committing perjury in the Roper case. He said that I used her half the time and that Ward used her half the time. He said she was nothing but a damn whore.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-10\">The defendant, who was about eighty-eight years of age, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>denied ever having uttered any of the words set forth in the different counts of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, but admitted that on September 7, 1904, he did ask Hayes \u201c If Legeyt had bought one half of Ward\u2019s wife.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to rule that the plaintiff could not recover on the first and third counts. The judge refused to rule as requested, and the defendant excepted. The defendant then asked the judge to instruct the jury that if the defendant said, \u201c Has Legeyt bought one half of Ward\u2019s wife,\u201d the plaintiff could not recover for the words set forth in the first count of her declaration. The judge refused to give this instruction and the defendant excepted. The judge submitted in writing to the jury this question: \u201cDid the defendant in his conversation with Hayes use the language set forth in the first count?\u201d The jury answered \u201cyes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-6\">The judge submitted the case to the jury on\" all the counts with instructions to which no exception was taken. The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $550; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-7\">&lt;7. <em>JE. Tapper, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-8\"><em>I). I. Walsh T. L.

At the close of the evidence, the defendant requested rulings that the plaintiff could not recover upon the first and the third counts. He also asked for a specific ruling as to the effect of certain words which the defendant testified that he spoke instead of those alleged in the first count. By an answer to a question, the jury found that the defendant used the language set forth in the first count. On this ground the defendant\u2019s exception to his request for the specific ruling must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">The question presented by the other two requests is a very different one from that which would arise if the defendant had demurred. The defendant having failed to demur and having gone to trial upon the issues raised by the pleadings as they stood, it is not now open to him to raise the point that the first and third counts do not set out a good cause of action. Although the declaration may not set out a cause of action by reason of a failure to state sufficient circumstances to show the sense in which the words were spoken, this objection can be taken only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>on demurrer. After verdict, it is only open to the defendant to argue that upon all the evidence the words were spoken under such conditions as not to amount to the charge of a crime. <em>Chace </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>119 Mass. 387. Many of the cases cited by the defendant arose upon demurrers and are therefore of little weight upon the question now open for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\">Taking into account all the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, there was enough to warrant the jury in finding that the words were spoken in such a sense as to amount to a charge of adultery. It is of no consequence that the statement was put in the form of a question. Insidious and harmful insinuations may often be conveyed under the cover of an inquiry. If it is open to the defendant now to question the sufficiency of the proof as to the plaintiff being a married woman <em>(Oulighan </em>v. Butler, 189 Mass. 287), there was enough to warrant a finding that she was so reputed, and this, in the absence of any other evidence, was all that was required of the plaintiff. 1 Greenl.
