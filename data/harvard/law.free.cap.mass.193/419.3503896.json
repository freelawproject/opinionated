He found that the plaintiff had no personal interest in the transaction, but acted merely at the request and for the benefit of A. Wilbert Starratt and William A. Woodman, both of Boston. The lots in Dorchester were owned of record by Woodman, who held title thereto for the benefit of himself and Starratt in equal shares, and these lots of land were at the time of the making of the contract, and on June 12, 1905, of a fair market value of $3,100. The Revere property was owned by the defendant Annie Kehoe, and at the time of the making of the agreement consisted of fifty-nine hundred and sixty-four square feet of land on the Boulevard, so called, at Revere, bounded on the rear by a street known as Ocean Avenue, upon which land there was in the front a frame building with two stores on the first floor and four tenements above. On the rear of the land was a frame building known as the Nickel Palace, designed for theatre and other amusement purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-12\">The auditor found that at the time of the making of the agreement and on June 12, 1905, the land was of a fair market value of $10,000, and that at the time of the making of the agreement the buildings thereon were of a fair market value of $9,000. On the night of June 3, 1905, these buildings on the premises of the defendant Annie Kehoe at Revere were wholly destroyed by an accidental fire and were not rebuilt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-13\">The facts as to demand and refusal of performance are described sufficiently in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The case was heard upon the auditor\u2019s report by <em>Aiken, </em>0. J. He admitted against the objection of the defendants the evidence of Starratt as to his interest in the contract for exchange and in the Dorchester land. He found as a fact that the defendants before the fire never knew of any one being interested in the agreement other than the plaintiff Hawkes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\">The defendants asked for eleven rulings, of which the sixth and seventh, relating to insurance money, were given by the Chief Justice. The other rulings requested, which were refused by him, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\">1. Upon all the evidence the plaintiff cannot recover in this action on either the first or the second count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\">2. That the plaintiff was never ready or able to carry out or \u2022 perform his part of the agreement declared on, and cannot recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-8\">3. That the fact that one Starratt assumed to act for the plaintiff without the defendants\u2019 knowledge or consent and without any transfer of the agreement on the part of the plaintiff does not enable the plaintiff to maintain this action by any acts of Starratt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-9\">4. The plaintiff being wholly irresponsible financially and unable to carry out his part of the agreement declared on cannot maintain this action, if made use of as an irresponsible man to sign the agreement by other parties who knew his irresponsibility, and never informed the defendants thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-10\">5. If this action could be maintained by the plaintiff by reason of any acts of Starratt shown in the evidence the inability of Starratt on June 12, 1905, to pay the money agreed upon except upon a mortgage of the defendant\u2019s property at that time tentatively made, prevents the plaintiff from recovering in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-11\">8. There is nothing in the agreement whereby the plaintiff can recover from the defendant by reason of the building upon the premises of the defendants being accidentally destroyed by fire before the termination of the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-12\">9. The accidental destruction by fire of the building on the defendants\u2019 land excused both the defendants and the plaintiff from the performance of the written agreement declared on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-13\">10. The written agreement declared on was made by the plaintiff and the defendants upon the implied condition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the buildings upon the defendants\u2019 land should be in existence at the time of performance, and their accidental destruction by-fire before even any attempt at performance of the agreement on the part of the plaintiff renders the defendants not liable in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\">11. The plaintiff upon all the evidence cannot recover on the second count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">The Chief Justice found that the plaintiff was entitled to damages from the defendants for failure to convey the premises in the condition in which they were at the date of the signing of the agreement, reasonable use and wear thereon excepted, and that they were not excused from performance thereof by reason of the fire; and found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover of the defendants the sum of S3,900. He found for the plaintiff in that amount with interest; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-7\"><em>H Dunham, (B. B.

But it is equally well settled that where from the nature of the contract it appears that the parties must from the beginning have contemplated the continued existence of some particular specified thing as the foundation of what was to be done, then, in the absence of any warranty that the thing shall exist, the contract is to be construed not as a positive contract, but as subject to an implied condition that the parties shall be excused in case before breach performance becomes impossible from the accidental perishing of the thing without the fault of either party. Gray, J. in <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Calnan, </em>107 Mass. 514, 516, quoting <em>Taylor </em>v. Caldwell, 3 B. <em>&amp; </em>S. 826. The same doctrine has been affirmed in other decisions of this court. <em>Butterfield </em>v. <em>Byron, </em>153 Mass. 517, and cases there cited. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>186 Mass. 518. <em>Marvel </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>162 Mass. 399. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>See also <em>The Tornado, </em>108 U. S. 342, 351, 352; <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>47 N. Y. 62; <em>Krause </em>v. <em>Board of School Trustees, </em>66 N. E. Rep. 1010; <em>Dow </em>v. <em>State Bank, </em>88 Minn. 355; <em>Vogt </em>v. <em>Hecker, </em>118 Wis. 306; <em>Krell </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>[1903] 2 K. B. 740; <em>In re Hull, </em>[1905] 1 K. B. 588. The misfortune which has occurred releases both parties from further performance of the contract and gives no right to either to claim damages from the other. <em>Eliott </em>v. <em>Crutchley, </em>[1903] 2 K. B. 476; <em>S. C. </em>[1904] 1 K. B. 565. We need not stop to consider the different rules which have been laid down in England and in this Commonwealth as to the right of either party, in such event, to recover for payments made or services rendered or materials supplied to the other before further performance has become excused. See the cases cited <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The plaintiff contends, however, that\u00bb the rule which we have now stated does not apply to cases like this. He argues that in this Commonwealth, where a contract is made for the future conveyance of land with buildings standing thereon, with no provision as to the contingency of the buildings being destroyed by fire before the time appointed for the conveyance, the loss by such a fire falls wholly upon the vendor. <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Calnan, </em>107 Mass. 514. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>20 Pick. 134. From this he deduces the conclusion that the purchaser in such a case has a right either to require the vendor to make a conveyance of the land with compensation for the loss of the buildings, as in <em>Phinizy </em>v. <em>Guernsey, </em>111 Ga. 346, or to hold the vendor in damages for failing, though by reason of his inability, to convey the estate, including both land and buildings, as he had agreed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">We need spend no time upon the numerous cases in England and in this country which the industry of counsel has brought to our notice as to the rights of parties to such agreements upon a total or partial destruction of the buildings by fire. See the cases collected in 29 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Law, (2d ed.) 712 <em>et seq., </em>and in Ames, Cases in Eq. Jur. 228, note 2. We are of opinion that in this Commonwealth, when, as in this case, the conveyance is to be made of the whole estate, including both land and buildings, for an entire price, and the value of the buildings constitutes a large part of the total value of the estate, and the terms of the agreement show that they constituted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>important part of the subject matter of the contract, it is now settled by the decision in <em>Wells </em>v. Calnan, 107 Mass. 514, that the contract is to be construed as subject to the implied condition that it no longer shall be binding if, before the time for the conveyance to be made, the buildings are destroyed by fire. The loss by the fire falls upon the vendor, the owner; and if he has not protected himself by insurance, be can have no reimbursement of this loss; but the contract is no longer binding upon either party. If the purchaser has advanced any part of the price, he can recover it back. <em>Thompson </em>v. Gould, 20 Pick. 134, 138. If the change in the value of the estate is not so great, or if it appears that the buildings did not constitute so material a part of the estate to be conveyed as to result in an annulling of the contract, specific performance may be decreed, with compensation for any breach of agreement, or relief may be given in damages. <em>Kares </em>v. Covell, 180 Mass. 206. <em>Davis </em>v. Parker, 14 Allen, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">It is true, however, that the principle just stated would not be applicable to an agreement which contemplated and provided for the event which has happened, \u2014 if, that is, in such a case as this, the vendor has made himself answerable for the continued existence of the buildings. <em>Allyn </em>v. <em>Allyn, </em>154 Mass. 570. The agreement in this case provides that the defendants shall convey to the plaintiff a certain parcel of land \u201c and the buildings thereon,\u201d and that the premises at the time of delivering the deeds are to be <em>\u201c </em>in the same condition in which they now are, reasonable use and wear of the buildings thereon alone excepted.\u201d The plaintiff contends that these words were inserted for his protection <em>(Tripp </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>180 Mass. 122, 126); that they constitute a part of the contract, and are not to be ignored; and that they are no less applicable when the buildings have been totally consumed than would be the case if they simply had been mutilated by tenants or charred by a small fire. And lie claims that the exception of \u201c reasonable use and wear of the buildings \u201d furnishes an additional reason for holding that injury by inevitable accident is not excepted. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>136 Mass. 377, 378. Accordingly he contends that he has a right to hold the defendants in damages for their failure to convey to him the estate with the buildings in the same condition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>they were in at the date of the contract. <em>Combs </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>3 Bibb, 51. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>Spencer, 544. <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Bedout, </em>40 Ind. 114. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Hymer, </em>18 Ky. L. R. 639. But of these cases <em>Combs </em>v. <em>Fisher </em>simply decides that after the vendor has recovered a judgment at law against the purchaser upon bonds given for the price for land and buildings, thus affirming the contract, the latter may in equity have his damages from the previous destruction of the buildings set off against such judgment. In <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Bedout </em>the defendant had put himself in the position of a lessee, and it is pointed out in <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Calnan, </em>107 Mass. 514, 517, 518, that cases in which a lessee is held to pay rent or make repairs notwithstanding the destruction of the buildings during the term are not applicable here. In <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Hymer </em>there was an express covenant by the vendor to keep the house in good repair. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>the only one of these cases which fully supports the plaintiff\u2019s position, was rested mainly upon the authority of cases as to tenants, which we have seen not to be applicable here. There is here no express agreement on the part of the vendors war, ranting the continued existence of the buildings on their land, and no provision relative to their destruction by fire, as there was in <em>Allyn </em>v. <em>Allyn, </em>154 Mass. 570. The agreement seems rather to have been based upon the assumption that its subject matter, land and buildings, would continue in existence until the time should arrive for the making of the conveyance and to provide against any change in their condition while so existing being made or allowed by the vendors to the possible detriment of the purchaser. The parties contemplated this continued existence as the foundation of their agreement. It is as if in the case of <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>47 N. Y. 62, there had been inserted in the agreement a stipulation that the seller would not allow the cotton therein mentioned to become wet by salt water or depreciated in quality from other causes, but would deliver it in sound condition. All the reasoning in the opinion of the court in that case would remain unaffected and the decision must have been the same. In <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Coupland, </em>1 Q. B. D. 258, the contract was for the future sale of certain potatoes, to be \u201c good and marketable ware \u201d ; and this contract was held to be subject to the implied condition that the parties should be excused if before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>breach performance b\u00e9came impossible from the perishing of the potatoes without default of the contractor. This case must stand in the same way as if a large and material part of the land had been swallowed up by an earthquake or some other convulsion of nature, perhaps leaving the buildings standing on what land was left; for <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Calnan, ubi </em>supra, has settled the rule in this Commonwealth that the destruction of the buildings is not to be distinguished from the loss of a material part of the land. All the arguments based upon this stipulation of the contract would be as applicable then as now; evidently they could not then avail, and they cannot avail now.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We need not- consider the question whether it appeared that the plaintiff, having made no actual tender of performance and having no other ability to pay the necessary money than stated in the auditor\u2019s report, had put himself in a condition to maintain the action. Apparently, if the defendants had adopted the plaintiff\u2019s view, and had offered to make a conveyance to him with compensation for the loss.of the buildings, he could not have obtained the money upon the proposed mortgage, for his arrangement with the intended mortgagor was based upon the\" contingency of the defendant\u2019s premises being conveyed in the condition in which they were when the agreement was signed. See <em>Foternick </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>184 Mass. 187; <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Harwood, </em>139 Mass. 133, 135; <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>Kyle, </em>137 Mass. 189; <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Holcomb, </em>105 Mass. 280, 285; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Doggett, </em>2 Allen, 439, 441; <em>Buttrick </em>v. <em>Holden, </em>8 Cush. 233; <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Leach, </em>11 Pick. 151, 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The demurrer was rightly overruled. The first count simply sets out the agreement and avers that the plaintiff was ready and willing to carry it out and so notified the defendants, but they \u201cflatly refused\u201d to perform on their part. The second count avers in substance that the fire which destroyed the buildings was due to the defendants\u2019 negligence; and it also, like the first count, contains an averment that the defendants flatly refused to perform their agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The order overruling the demurrer must be affirmed ; and because of the failure to grant the first of the defendants\u2019 requests for instructions, the exceptions must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">\n<em>Bo ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
