The findings of such master fully sustained the bill of review. And' a decree was entered in favor of the Bank finding that such Bank was the sole owner of the warrants issued to the treasurer of the town of Cicero, that the amount of the warrants had been paid to the receiver, Zimmer, of the firm of J. J. Morrison &amp; Co. &amp; O\u2019Brien, and that the Bank was entitled to rec\u00e9ive from Zimmer the sum of $2,208.50, being the proceeds of the warrants less the receiver\u2019s costs of $760.70, leaving a balance due of $1,447.80.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b194-10\" pgmap=\"194\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b194-11\" pgmap=\"194(28) 195(74)\">1. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1236<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when appellant cannot complain of decree. Where certain complainants abandoned an original bill for an accounting and dissolution of a partnership, and prosecuted their suit for the sole purpose of determining whether a hank was entitled to certain warrants purchased from a third person who had obtained them from a member of the partnership, they could not be heard to claim, as a basis for a reversal of decrees entered on a bill of review, that there was no proof by which the court could determine the share of a member of the partnership in its assets.</headnotes><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-5\" pgmap=\"194\">The decree entered on the same day in favor of George I. O\u2019Brien found that the bill of complaint in the original cause should be dismissed for want of equity; that George I. O \u2019Brien should receive from the receiver the sum of $808.80 and the sum of $534.21, less his share of the receiver\u2019s costs, and that the balance of $798.63 was the amount in the hands of the receiver and represented the interests of George I. O\u2019Brien in the effects of the copartnership firm of J. J. Morrison &amp; Co. &amp; O\u2019Brien. The decree also found that O\u2019Brien\u2019s interest was assigned to J. B. O\u2019Connell and ordered that O\u2019Connell recover the sum of $798.63 from the receiver and $544.38 from the original complainants.

Equity, \u00a7 582*\u2014what relief is proper on hill of review. Where decrees entered on a bill of review sought to terminate a receivership of a partnership by dismissal of the original bill under which the receiver was appointed, it was proper and equitable to require proceeds of warrants in the hands of the receiver to be paid to a bank from which the warrants were received, and it was also equitable and proper to decree that money received from a partner be returned to such partner or his assignee, after deducting a share of the expenses of the receiver.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b195-6\" pgmap=\"195\">4.
