Proceeding by William Leisteko against Harry Smith and H. S. Boberts by distress warrant to recover three hundred dollars claimed to be due as rent for certain land described. The warrant was served by seizing certain chattels, and a summons was issued and served on each of the defendants who thereafter gave bond releasing the chattels from the levy. The defendants filed a plea of the general issue and a notice of certain set-offs. At the trial the court directed a verdict for the defendants, which was rendered. A motion for a new trial was denied and the defendants had judgment. To reverse the judgment, plaintiff prosecutes a writ of error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b336-9\" pgmap=\"336\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Alg\" pgmap=\"336\">1.

A distress warrant is a suit at law for rent and, is governed by the common rules of pleading and by our Practice Act, except that the distress warrant stands as a declaration.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AsW\" pgmap=\"336\">2.

Notwithstanding joint liability has not been denied by plea, the evidence must show that each defendant is liable in order to entitle the plaintiff to a judgment against any one of them in an action ex contractu.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ASXC\" pgmap=\"336\">4. Pleading, \u00a7 400*\u2014effect of plea of set-off on issue of joint liability. In a suit at law against several defendants alleging a joint liability for a debt, the fact that the defendants filed a plea of set-off does not obviate the necessity of proving- them all liable where they also pleaded the general issue.</headnotes><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b336-5\" pgmap=\"336\">A former judgment against the landlord was before the Appellate Court in Leisteko v.

Where in a suit against two defendants jointly for rent, the plaintiff, after having closed his case without proving the debt was still unpaid and without any evidence to prove that one of the defendants owed anything, asked leave to reopen his case for the purpose only of proving that the alleged sum was still unpaid, held that the court did not err in refusing leave.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"APB\" pgmap=\"337\">6.

In a suit at law against several defendants alleging a joint liability for a debt, and all are served with process, the plaintiff in order to recover, must prove a case against all the defendants or else he must dismiss as to those whom he cannot prove liable and amend his declaration by striking out so much thereof as charges that the dismissed party was liable; otherwise, if he fails to prove a case against any one of the defendants, his suit fails.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
