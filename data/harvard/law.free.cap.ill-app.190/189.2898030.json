Jen\u00e9 purchased the equity of redemption after the bill was filed and became a party to the suit later.

A pleading filed by a second mortgagee for the appointment of a receiver and for rents and profits, after the sale of the premises under a foreclosure decree of a first mortgage, which does not ask for an accounting or foreclosure, is a mere motion paper or petition.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b212-6\" pgmap=\"212\">2.
