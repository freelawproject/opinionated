Physicians and surgeons, \u00a7 22<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence shows unskilful treatment. Where a fourteen-year-old boy was injured by an iron radiator falling on his leg, and the greater weight of evidence was that a reliable diagnosis of the injury could not be made without an X-ray picture, and that a surgeon made an erroneous diagnosis by mere manipulation, and gave the limb such treatment that a surgical operation was thereafter necessary, a verdict against such surgeon was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AyW\" pgmap=\"439\">2.
