Action, \u00a7 15<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when demand not prerequisite. In an action to recover a balance of a bank deposit alleged to be due, where the evidence tends to show that defendants refused plaintiff\u2019s request for a pass book, statement of his account or return of his checks and that they denied that any balance .was due him, proof of a formal demand for the deposits is not necessary.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AaR\" pgmap=\"461\">2. Evidence, \u00a7 259*\u2014when books not of original entry inadmissible. A ledger of a bank which is not a book of original entry, but is made up in part of entries from books of original entry, is inadmissible in evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A-l\" pgmap=\"461\">3. Evidence, \u00a7 259*\u2014when book containing summary from book of original entry inadmissible. In an action by a bank depositor to recover the balance of his deposit, certificates of deposit issued by the bank are prima facie evidence of deposits, and a ledger which does not contain the original entries but is made up of entries from other books, and the entries in which show, in many instances, not the true amounts of the transactions but their net results, is inadmissible.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ASa\" pgmap=\"461\">4. Damages, \u00a7 246*\u2014when remittitur proper. Where the verdict of the jury shows that either they made a mistake in the addition of the items claimed or included interest which was not claimed, a remittitur will be entered for the excess.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aqe\" pgmap=\"461\">5. Appeal and ebbob, \u00a7 1523*\u2014when error in giving instruction harmless where objection applies to those for both sides. Where the instructions given on behalf of defendant are open to the same objection as those given on behalf of plaintiff, defendant cannot be heard to complain thereof.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-3\" pgmap=\"461\">Green &amp; Palmer, for appellee; Oris Barth, of counsel.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b461-11\" pgmap=\"461\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
