Partnership, \u00a7 279<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when judgment against surviving partner payable out of firm assets. Where a note was given by a partnership and after the death of one of the partners it was reduced to judgment against the surviving partner alone, held that the indebtedness expressed in the note did not merge in the judgment so as to become an individual debt of the surviving partner, and thus prevent him, when settling up the business of the partnership, from paying the claim out of the firm assets.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Asx\" pgmap=\"619\">2.
