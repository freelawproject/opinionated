W.

Plaintiff\u2019s evidence also shows that Newbanks took the note for the purpose of negotiating it to one Stone, who called up Adam Helmick and asked him if the note was genuine, and that the latter told him that it was. Stone then sold the note to plaintiff. There was other evidence tending to show that Adam Helmick asked -for an extension of time when the note became due. The evidence of defendants tended to show that neither of them signed the note nor ratified their signatures.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-6\" pgmap=\"510\">Ingham &amp; Ingham and W.
