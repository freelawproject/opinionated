Goan against Michael J. Goan, charging extreme and repeated cruelty and praying for the custody of two of their three male children. The defendant denied the charges of cruelty and alleged that the complainant had been guilty of habitual drunkenness for more than two years, that she was not a fit person to have the custody of the children, and praying for a divorce and custody of the children. In her cross-bill the complainant denied the defendant\u2019s charges. The cause was heard before a chancellor and the court entered a decree in favor of the defendant, dismissing the complainant\u2019s bill for want of equity, dissolving the bonds of matrimony, giving defendant the custody of the children and requiring him to pay $12 per month as alimony to Mrs. M. J. Walsh for the benefit of complainant, and also to pay $35 as solicitor\u2019s fees to complainant. A petition to vacate the decree was filed and denied, and defendant appealed.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b656-5\" pgmap=\"656\">Effie Seeds Wellner, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b656-6\" pgmap=\"656\">No appearance for appellee.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b656-10\" pgmap=\"656\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
