Where a person claimed to have made a deposit of-$158.50 in a bank but received a credit for only $128.50, and produced a deposit slip from which it appeared that a mistake occurred in adding the amount of $57 to $71.50 so as to make a total of $158.50, and the evidence was conflicting as to whether the \u201c5\u201d in the item of $57 was written by the plaintiff or by the teller, held that the finding of the trial court that such figure was written by the teller was manifestly against the weight of the evidence, there being good ground for believing the contrary, wherefore a new trial would be ordered.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\" pgmap=\"81\">Error to the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.
