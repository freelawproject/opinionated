Where it appeared that the owner and purchaser of property were brought \u2022together through an agent in June, 1912, when the sale was effected, and plaintiff had submitted the property to the same party about April, 1911, but negotiations for its sale ceased after September, 1911, and plaintiff never disclosed the name of the prospective purchaser to the owner or his agent, nor the name of the owner to the prospective purchaser, though requested to do so, and the prospective purchaser did not accept the terms submitted by the plaintiff, the evidence is held to show that the negotiations between the plaintiff and the purchaser were abandoned and that the plaintiff\u2019s efforts were not the procuring cause of the sale such as to entitle him to recover commissions.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
