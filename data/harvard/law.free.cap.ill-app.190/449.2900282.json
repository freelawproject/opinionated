In an action to recover for grain which plaintiff claims was sold to defendant and defendant claims was received for storage in its elevator and burned without its fault, an instruction to the jury to consider how much grain the defendant had in the elevator at the time it was burned, which does not direct that they shall first find whether the contract was one df storage or of sale,- is improper.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AOGz\" pgmap=\"472\">3.

Where, in an action to recover for grain, plaintiff claims that the grain was sold to defendant and defendant claims that it was received by it for storage in its elevator and while so stored was burned without its fault, it is error to instruct that, \u201cthe' defendant has pleaded as one of his defenses that the corn in question was stored in the elevator and not sold as claimed by the plaintiff; before you will be justified under the law to find for the defendant on that issue, you must believe from the greater weight of the evidence that defendant has shown that it, the defendant, used .reasonable care and diligence to protect the corn from loss by fire.\u201d</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-4\" pgmap=\"472\">A.
