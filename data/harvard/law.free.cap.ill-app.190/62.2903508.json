Borg, summons being served on Kawin &amp; Company as garnishee. The garnishee was indebted to Borg in the sum of $1,100, which was the amount of the verdict in a suit brought by Borg against Kawin &amp; Company, in which Borg was represented by Walter Miller, an attorney. Walter Miller filed an intervening petition in this garnishment proceeding, claiming a lien on the amount recovered because of a contract whereby Borg was to pay him one-sixth of the amount realized for his services. A copy of such contract with a notice of a claim for attorney\u2019s lien was served on Kawin &amp; Company in compliance with the statute (Hurd\u2019s Bev. St., cli. 82, \u00a7 55, J. &amp; A. 611). On the trial the court sustained the claim for lien and ordered the sum of $183.33, the amount awarded to the attorney, to be paid into court until its further order, and judgment was entered for the plaintiff for the balance of the fund owing from the garnishee. From such judgment the plaintiff appealed.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b85-7\" pgmap=\"85\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b85-8\" pgmap=\"85\">1.
