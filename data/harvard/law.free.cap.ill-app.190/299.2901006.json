Bruner, Fred Luhrsen, William Flanigan, Fred Weber and J. W. Conard in assumpsit. Service was had upon all of the defendants except J. W. Conard. An attorney entered the appearance of all the defendants. A declaration was filed in the name of John McAndrews, plaintiff, against the defendants. It contained two counts. The first count alleged that Bruner was the treasurer of Drainage District No. 4 in Iroquois county, and filed an instrument which was accepted by the drainage commissioners of said district, by which Bruner obligated himself to account for all moneys that came to his hands as such treasurer, and the other defendants obligated themselves for such moneys; that plaintiff contracted with the commissioners of said district to excavate certain ditches and the district agreed to pay him certain sums therefor on the monthly estimates of the engineer for the district, and that ten per cent, of the estimate for each month was to be withheld as security for the completion of the work and be paid to plaintiff when the work was completed and accepted; that plaintiff dug the ditches, received estimates and received ninety per cent, thereof from time to time and that Bruner as treasurer withheld ten per cent, of each of said estimates at the time; that the amount so withheld belonging to plaintiff amounted to $1,158.25, and that plaintiff never received that sum from any one; that he completed his contract and the work was accepted by the district and the sum so withheld became immediately due and payable to plaintiff; that said sum came to the hands of Bruner as such treasurer and his duty required him to pay it to plaintiff when the work was completed and accepted, and that, though often requested, he had not paid it. The second count contained like allegations and set out said treasurer\u2019s bond in haec verba, showing it to be an instrument under seal and showing it not signed by defendant, Conard. This count also alleged an assessment made and collected to pay for said excavations, and that the money came to the hands of said treasurer and that plaintiff had a lien upon said funds in the possession of said treasurer to the amount of all estimates allowed in his favor; that the treasurer paid out of said funds divers amounts upon other claims and indebtednesses of the district and left no funds with which plaintiff could be paid. The defendants demurred specially and generally to said declaration and said demurrer was sustained and plaintiff elected to abide by the declaration, and defendants had a judgment in bar. To reverse the judgment, plaintiff appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b322-8\" pgmap=\"322\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b322-9\" pgmap=\"322\">1.
