The declaration charged defendant with a violation of its duty under clause 4 of section 21 of the Miners\u2019 Act (J. &amp; A. 7495) in substance, as follows:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-11\" pgmap=\"621(77) 622(82)\">That on a certain day the defendant was operating a coal mine in the county of Saline in which there were entries, and one entry in particular being the second north entry off of the main east entry; that plaintiff was employed by defendant in said mine as a machine runner, operating a machine undercutting coal in said entry. That it was the duty of defendant to employ a competent mine examiner and cause him to visit said mine and make a careful examination of all places where plaintiff was expected to pass or work, observe whether there were any unsafe conditions in the rooms or roadways, and when any unsafe condition was observed in a working place to place a conspicuous mark thereat as notice to all men to keep out, and report his findings to the mine manager; said examination to be made each morning before permitting the men to enter the mine to work therein.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-5\" pgmap=\"622\">That on said day plaintiff was running a machine in the said entry, and therein was a pile of gob four feet wide, three feet high, extending from the right rail of the track in said entry to the right rib of coal, located about eight feet from the face of the coal; that said gob formed an unsafe condition in plaintiff\u2019s working place in that lumps of coal could roll therefrom into the frame of said machine, and also by reason of its being located so near the face of the coal as not to leave a clear space sufficient between the pile of gob and the face of the coal for the reasonably safe operation of said machine; that said unsafe condition could have been discovered by said mine examiner upon a reasonably careful examination on the morning of the day of the injury.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-6\" pgmap=\"622\">That defendant wilfully failed to cause said examiner to visit and inspect plaintiff\u2019s said working place and observe said unsafe condition and place a conspicuous mark thereat as a notice to plaintiff to keep out, and report his findings to the mine manager, and make a daily report in a book kept for that purpose. That defendant failed to cause the mine manager to visit and examine said working place on that morning or as often as practicable for some time prior thereto and failed to see that said dangerous place was properly marked and danger signals displayed thereat.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-7\" pgmap=\"622(28) 623(64)\">That while the plaintiff was operating the machine at his working place in the usual course of his employment on the day aforesaid by reason of defendant\u2019s wilful failure aforesaid, a lump of coal rolled off of said pile of gob into and through the frame of said machine and came in contact with plaintiff\u2019s foot, threw him, against and into the bits of said machine and his leg was cut off about four inches below the knee and otherwise injuring him, and alleging damages in the amount of $1,999.99.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AHq6\" pgmap=\"623\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AgiK\" pgmap=\"623\">1.

In an action for personal injuries sustained by a miner alleged to have been caused by failure of the mine examiner to mark a pile of gob as dangerous, held that the question whether the violation of the statute was the proximate cause was properly submitted to the jury, and that the verdict for plaintiff was sustained by the evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A2N\" pgmap=\"623\">2.
