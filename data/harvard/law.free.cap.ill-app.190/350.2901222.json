The evidence showed that Paradee was the son-in-law of defendant; that defendant orally guaranteed payment of goods furnished to Paradee; that such goods were sold and charged to Paradee and a note taken in payment of the account and transferred to a bank of which plaintiff was president; that defendant indorsed such note, but after maturity the bank took another note of Paradee without indorsement and surrendered the original note, and that the bank had judgment against Paradee on the last note. A jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $38.35, on which judgment was rendered, and the defendant appealed.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-8\" pgmap=\"372\">Chafee &amp; Chew, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-9\" pgmap=\"372\">E.
