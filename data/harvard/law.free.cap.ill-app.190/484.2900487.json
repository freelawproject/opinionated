A. Stewart against the Chicago, Bloomington &amp; Decatur Railway Company to recover the value of a horse killed by one of defendant\u2019s cars upon its right of way. The declaration charged that it was the duty of defendant to keep and maintain suitable and sufficient cattle guards to prevent animals from going upon the right of way, and that it negligently failed to keep and maintain such suitable and sufficient cattle guards, as provided by statute, at the point where plaintiff\u2019s horse passed over and upon the right of way. The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff for two hundred and fifty dollars, and also allowed attorney\u2019s fees to the amount of twenty-five dollars. To reverse the judgment entered on the verdict, defendant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b507-9\" pgmap=\"507\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Alpc\" pgmap=\"507\">1.
