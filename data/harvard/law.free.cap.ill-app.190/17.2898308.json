Fellows-Kimbrough against Chicago City Railway Company for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff in a collision between street cars. To reverse a judgment entered on a verdict in favor of plaintiff for thirty-seven hundred and fifty dollars, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-4\" pgmap=\"40\">The facts relating to the accident are as follows: Thirty-fifth street in Chicago runs east and west, and Indiana avenue north and south, and where they intersect the street car lines of the defendant cross each other at right angles. On the day of the accident plaintiff was riding on an eastbound Thirty-fifth street car. As it was crossing Indiana avenue a car coming from the south on Indiana avenue did not stop to permit the Thirty-fifth street ear to pass safely but ran into it knocking it partly off the track. Defendant conceded that under the circumstances the Indiana avenue car should have stopped at the south cross walk and have permitted the Thirty-fifth street car to make the crossing with safety. The explanation of this failure to stop was that although the motorman on the Indiana avenue car attempted to stop it at the usual place by turning the controller handle, which would shut off the electrical power, his attempts were unavailing by reason of a defect in the mechanism in the controller box. The particular defect is said to have been that one of the \u201cfingers\u201d which are fastened to the \u201cterminals\u201d in the controller box was bent so as to prevent the turning of the controller handle. It also appeared there was another device connected with the car called a canopy switch which might have been used by the motorman to stop the car in case the controller failed to work. It was located over the head of the motorman and one of its purposes was automatically to turn off the electric power when there is an overload of electric current. It could also be operated by turning a switch handle which shut off the power when for any reason the mechanism of the controller box failed to turn off the current. This device was the means by which the motorman finally brought the car to a stop.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b41-6\" pgmap=\"41\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b41-7\" pgmap=\"41\">1.
