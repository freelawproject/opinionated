Appeal and error, \u00a7 1734<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when former decision is law of case. A holding on a prior appeal that evidence failed to sustain a charge of negligence is not binding on a subsequent appeal where the evidence is materially different.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b202-5\" pgmap=\"202\">2. Master and servant, \u00a7 161*\u2014what duties of master cannot he delegated. The duty of inspection of appliances is on the master and cannot be delegated.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b202-6\" pgmap=\"202\">3. Master and servant, \u00a7 123*\u2014what are duties as to safe place of work. A master is bound to furnish a servant with a safe place in which to work, and noncompliance with this duty is not one of the ordinary risks assumed by the<footnotemark>-</footnotemark> servant</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b202-7\" pgmap=\"202\">4. Master and servant, \u00a7 123*\u2014what is extent of master\u2019s duty as to place of work. The duty of the master to furnish a safe place of work is continuing, and if the place- is. made unsafe by reason of the master\u2019s negligence without the servant\u2019s knowledge, the master is liable for the injury.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b202-8\" pgmap=\"202\">5. Master and servant, \u00a7 447*-\u2014when servant may rely on care of master. A servant may assume that a master has provided a safe place of work, unless he has notice of the danger or the unsafe condition is obvious, in which case he assumes the risk.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b202-9\" pgmap=\"202\">6. Master and servant, \u00a7 714*\u2014what is question for jury. In an action for injuries sustained by a servant, the question whether wire on a street car was out of order when such servant took charge of the car was for the jury, the defect not being apparent, and since .the evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding of negligence the. verdict would not be interfered with.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b202-10\" pgmap=\"202\">7. Master and servant, \u00a7 777*\u2014when instruction not misleading. In an action for personal injuries, an instruction that the jury was not bound to consider the evidence evenly balanced when twp \u2022witnesses contradicted each other, but that the surrounding facts might be considered, was not erroneous as misleading or as invading the province of the jury.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b202-11\" pgmap=\"202\">8. Master and servant, \u00a7 807*\u2014ivhen instruction as to assumed risk not erroneous. In an action for personal injuries, an instruction that a servant is not bound to inspect appliances but may \u25a0assume that they are safe, and that such servant is- only bound to take notice of such defects as actually come to his knowledge, oj would be disclosed by ordinary care, and- applying such rules to the evidence, was not misleading or inapplicable.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b202-12\" pgmap=\"202(21) 203(32)\">9. Master and servant, \u00a7 790*\u2014what facts' may he assumed in instruction. In an action by a servant for personal injuries, where there was no controversy that a defect in a street car existed at the time of the injury, such defect could he assumed to exist in an instruction as a fact.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b203-4\" pgmap=\"203\">10. Damages, \u00a7 110*\u2014when verdict not excessive. A verdict of five thousand dollars for personal injuries held not excessive, or the result of passion of prejudice, or improper argument of counsel.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
