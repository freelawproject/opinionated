When they came in sight of a signal light placed upon a pile of rock they were compelled to drive on defendant\u2019s car track. When they were just ready to turn onto the track the street car was from 800 to 1,000 feet south of them. The horses at that time were moving at the rate of from three to three and one-half miles per hour, and just as the horses were going on the track the street car was about 300 \"feet south of the rock pile. The team had gone far enough to go around the rock pile and the driver had turned them off the track when the rear end of the .wagon was struck by the street car going north with such force as to demolish the wagon and break the back of one of the horses. The declaration alleged the plaintiff\u2019s servants were using all care and caution for the safety and care of the horses; charged the defendant with negligence in failing to equip the motor car with a good and sufficient headlight so that objects on the track in front of the car could be seen by its motorman. That the car was negligently running at a high rate of speed, to wit, thirty miles per hour, and that it failed to give reasonable or proper warning to plaintiff\u2019s servants of its approach.</p><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b518-8\" pgmap=\"518\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AmYF\" pgmap=\"518(41) 519(61)\">1.
