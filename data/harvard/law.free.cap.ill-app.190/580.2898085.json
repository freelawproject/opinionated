Complainant\u2019s petition and two other petitions were filed in that court for a lien against the same property and the suits were consolidated for hearing. Three separate appeals were taken from the decree, two of which have been previously considered by the Appellate Court. See Builders Supply &amp; Coal Co. v. Eggmann, ante, p. 572; Moorehead v. Eggmann, ante, p. 578. A full statement of the facts leading up to the construction of the improvement, the filing of the petitions and the views of the Appellate Court as to questions of law concerning the transaction, and the decision on that appeal to the effect that the parties furnishing labor and materials were original contractors and not subcontractors, governs in considering the questions raised on this appeal.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-9\" pgmap=\"602\">Appellant in this case claimed a lien for lumber and mill work furnished on a contract with Crutchfield and made proof of his claim, but the court found against it on the theory that it was a subcontractor and had not filed the notice of its lien as required by law.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-10\" pgmap=\"602(47) 603(10)\">Appellee urged that the subcontractor\u2019s notice was not given in time and that the notice served upon him and set out. in appellant\u2019s petition as a part thereof claimed a balance of $815.13, when the amount should have been $654.66? and that this excess in the claim constituted a fraud in law making the whole claim nugatory.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b603-8\" pgmap=\"603\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Adp\" pgmap=\"603\">1.

The fact that a notice for a lien and also the petition contained an item, for which no lien could be allowed, held not to render the whole claim void, where it appeared that the claimant believed he had a right to include it and that there was no attempt to perpetrate a fraud.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A3V\" pgmap=\"603\">2.
