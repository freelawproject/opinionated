In an action for rent, where the evidence was conflicting as to what was said and done between the lessor and lessee and their agents as to the surrender of the premises and the making of a new lease for another 'flat, the questions were for the jury, and the verdict would be sustained when not manifestly against the weight of the evidence.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-6\" pgmap=\"375\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Sangamon county; the Hon.

Leaverton against John A. Myers to recover for four months\u2019 rent under a lease. It appeared that the defendant was occupying a flat under a renewal of a lease, that he vacated the premises, and that the suit was for two hundred dollars for the rent for the four months after such vacation. There was also evidence that the plaintiff failed to make certain repairs and repudiated an agreement to make such repairs, and that the plaintiff failed to have noise caused by tenants in an upper flat discontinued, causing discomfort to the defendant\u2019s wife, who was ill. The defendant\u2019s plea alleged the surrender of the premises and the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the same. The jury found the issues for the defendant and judgment was rendered in his favor, whereupon the plaintiff appealed.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-10\" pgmap=\"375\">Smith &amp; Friedmeyer, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-11\" pgmap=\"375\">Gillespie &amp; Fitzgerald, for appellee.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b375-15\" pgmap=\"375\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
