Plaintiff brought an action in the Municipal Court against defendant Hale as maker and Winchester and Loveless as indorsers of a promissory note for one thousand dollars, dated November 23, 1913, and payable four months after date. Hale in his affidavit of defense did not state that any fraud or circumvention was used in obtaining his signature, but only that false and fraudulent representations were made to him as to the consideration for the note, and that in fact there was no consideration for it. The court instructed the jury that the plaintiff claimed that he was an innocent holder before maturity for a valuable consideration; \u201cthat this meant that he was a purchaser of the note before due for a valuable consideration, and with no knowledge of any defect in the title or any want of consideration or of any fraud in the transaction prior to the purchase; * * * that plaintiff was not entitled to recover if they believed from the evidence that the note was given without any consideration, and that there was fraud and circumvention at the time the note was made; * * * that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff and he must show by a preponderance of the evidence every material part of his case.\u201d The jury found the.issues for the defendants. Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied and from a judgment of nil capiat the plaintiff prosecutes this appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-7\" pgmap=\"38\">Cavender, Kaiser &amp; Wermuth, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-8\" pgmap=\"38\">Beach &amp; Beach, for appellee.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b37-12\" pgmap=\"37\">See minois Notes Digest, Veis.

Fraud must relate to the execution of the note and not to the consideration on which it is based.
