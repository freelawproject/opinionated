Kelly against Stary M. Hakes to recover possession of a mare and two colts. Upon a trial without a jury the court found that plaintiff was entitled to possession of the mare and the defendant entitled to the possession of the colts. The court entered judgment on the findings apportioning the costs between plaintiff and defendant and ordered a writ of retorno hdbendo for the \"return of the colts. To reverse the judgment, plaintiff appeals, and the defendant assigns cross-errors that the court erred in awarding possession of the mare to plaintiff and in apportioning the costs, and in taxing any costs against defendant.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-8\" pgmap=\"232\">James L.
