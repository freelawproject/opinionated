From a judgment for $1,749.90, in favor of the plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-12\" pgmap=\"307(111) 308(35)\">Plaintiff was an unmarried Russian, twenty-three years of age, who had been in the country about three years and employed by the defendant in the same grade of employment for one year, earning wages amounting to $509.95. On January 23, 1913, he sustained an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, and he was unable to do any work until July 25, 1913. As a direct result of the injury his right arm was amputated two-thirds of the way from the elbow to the wrist. A subsequent amputation was necessary resulting from blood poisoning, and - although it caused much sickness and pain, his general health was good at the time of the trial, when there was still some soreness in the stump, which promised to become serviceable in from three to six months from the date of the hearing.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b308-7\" pgmap=\"308\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b308-8\" pgmap=\"308\">1.

If 5449) the time on which to compute recovery is practically seven and one-half years, the rate is $709.95 a year, the amount to be earned on that basis is $3,824.53, half of which is $1,912.26,- a finding of the court for $1,749.90, which was reached by deducting from the sum of $1,912.26, what in the opinion of the court plaintiff would be able to earn in some suitable employment or business after the accident in that period of seven and a half years, and adding to the amount so obtained the sum due under clause b; and whatever defendant might be found liable for on the doctor\u2019s bill of $225, stipulated to be reasonable, will not be disturbed by an Appellate Court, as it is peculiarly a case where the judgment of the trial court, who had the man before it, should stand, unless clearly wrong, since the question of probable future earnings leads into the field of conjecture and speculation.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-4\" pgmap=\"308\">Ralph P.
