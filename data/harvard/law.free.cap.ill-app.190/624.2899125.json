Madden for criminal conversation. The declaration consisted of two counts. The first count alleged that defendant, contriving and wickedly intending to injure plaintiff and to deprive him of the society and assistance of Lucinda Schiller, the wife of plaintiff, on to wit, June 1, 1913, and on divers other days between that day and the commencement of this suit in said Jasper county, wrongfully and wickedly debauched and carnally knew the said Lucinda Schiller, then and there being the wife of plaintiff, and thereby the affection of the said Lucinda Schiller for plaintiff was then and there alienated and destroyed, and also by means of the premises the plaintiff has from thence hitherto wholly lost and been deprived of the society and assistance of the said Lucinda Schiller, the said wife, in his domestic affairs, which said plaintiff ought during that time to have had, and otherwise might and would have had. The second count in the same form alleges seduction. Damages were alleged in the sum of ten thousand dollars. The defendant filed the plea of not guilty. Upon the trial there was a verdict and judgment in favor of plaintiff for one thousand dollars. To reverse the judgment, defendant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b646-9\" pgmap=\"646\">Albert E.

Husband and wife, \u00a7 285*\u2014sufficiency of evidence. In an action for criminal conversation with plaintiB\u2019s wife, evidence held sufficient to prove a charge of seduction by defendant without any connivance on the part of plaintiB.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AJx\" pgmap=\"647\">5. Husband and wife, \u00a7 290*\u2014when erroneous admission of evidence harmless. In a suit for criminal conversation with plaintiB\u2019s wife, the admission of declarations and promises of the wife made to plaintiB that her conduct in the future would be proper, held improper but not reversible error, where there was direct evidence to prove the charge of seduction and no claim that the damages were excessive.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AyP\" pgmap=\"647\">6. Husband and wife, \u00a7 289*\u2014admissibility of evidence. In a suit for criminal conversation with plaintifi\u2019s wife, evidence ofiered on behalf of defendant of adulterous conduct of plaintiB is competent, not as a bar to the action but in mitigation of damages.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AUB\" pgmap=\"647\">7.
