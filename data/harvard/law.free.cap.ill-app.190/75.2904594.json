In the meantime, the Supreme Court, in People v. Federal Securities Co., 255 Ill. 561, decided that the State Board of Equalization had no power to assess the capital stock of a corporation for mercantile purposes, but that the assessment should be made by local assessors. At a subsequent appearance before said Board, plaintiff\u2019s attorney called its attention to said decision and to the fact that defendant was a corporation organized for mercantile purposes, and, because the Board did not assess defendant\u2019s stock, plaintiff claims that it thereby saved defendant $252 and is entitled to fifty per cent, thereof. It appeared that in the previous year said Board assessed defendant\u2019s stock and the tax levied thereon was $252. To reverse a judgment in favor of defendant, plaintiff brings error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-13\" pgmap=\"98\">Henry J.
