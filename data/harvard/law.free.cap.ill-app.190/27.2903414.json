It was not known where. Plaintiff afterwards received a writing signed by Hiram Brown, addressed: \u201cTo whom it may concern,\u201d purporting to give authority to \u201cMessrs. Marshall &amp; C'o.\u201d to gain possession of such furniture \u201cas they are entitled to under'the terms of a chattel mortgage.\u201d Afterwards she was notified by one W. L.

She went to Mr. Barth\u2019s house and found there some articles of ordinary household furniture. She left them there, taking away only a picture, which was not levied upon by the attachment writ. She further testified that \u201cI do not know of my own knowledge that the articles found at Mr. Barth\u2019s house in Maywood which I have described are the same articles described in the mortgage as contained in \u2018Apt. D-l\u2019 of 404 So. Ashland Blvd. I never saw them before I went to Mr. Barth\u2019s house.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b50-8\" pgmap=\"50\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b50-9\" pgmap=\"50(49) 51(40)\">1.
