The case was submitted to the jury on two counts in the declaration. One count was based upon a violation of clause \u201cb\u201d of section 24 of the Miners\u2019 Act (J. &amp; A. j[ 7498). The other was a common-law count averring an unsafe place to work, a negligent order of defendant\u2019s foreman and plaintiff\u2019s reliance upon the promise made by the foreman of want of danger, etc. Both counts alleged that defendant had rejected the terms and provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1911 (J. &amp; A. j[j[ 5449 et seq.). To the declaration defendant filed the plea of general issue. Plaintiff had verdict and judgment for three thousand dollars and a motion for a new trial was overruled. To reverse the judgment, defendant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b625-8\" pgmap=\"625\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AXdu\" pgmap=\"625\">1.

Under the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1911 (J. &amp; A. mi 5449 et seq.), where an employer files the proper notice rejecting the provisions of the act the notice stands as a negative election until it is withdrawn, and the fact that the employer does not give a further notice, sixty days previous to the first day of the following year, does not automatically constitute an election by him to accept the provisions of the act.</headnotes><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b625-4\" pgmap=\"625\">Defendant urged as ground for reversal: That defendant was operating at the time of the injury under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1911; that the court erred in admitting certified copies of letters and notices to the Secretary of State of Illinois, and to the State Bureau of Labor Statistics; that defendant was not deprived of its common-law defenses; that the court erred in instructing and refusing to instruct the jury and in rejecting evidence offered by defendant.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-5\" pgmap=\"625\">Denison &amp; Spiller and John M.
