Suchwe understand to be the settled doctrine of the Circuit Court of this District. And this is no unsatisfactory evidence of what the law is. <em>An acquiescence of many years in a course of decision involving private rights should not be changed except upon the clearest ground of </em>error.\u201d</headnotes>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\">Vincent Kino, <em>Foreman.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Judgment for the petitioner on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The following assignment of error to the above judgment was referred to the Supreme Court of the United States :</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">First. There is error because the removal of Moses Bel! from Alexandria county to Washington county, in the District of Columbia, as stated in the special verdict, did not entitle him to his freedom under any law in force in said District.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Second. Moses Bell being over 45 years of age at the time-of such removal, was incapable by the laws in force in said Washington county of receiving his freedom by or through any act or acts of his master or owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Third. That said removal of Moses Bell is not an importation according to the true intent and meaning of the laws in force in Washington county aforesaid. Bank of Alexandria <em>vs. </em>Dyer, 14 Peters, 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">Fourth. That such removal, even if it would have been illegal previous to the year 1812, was legalized and allowed by act of Congress of the 24th of June, 1812. See 14 Peters, 142, and Lee <em>vs. </em>Lee, 8 Peters, 49, which cases show how unsettled the law is on these points, and how desirable a decision is for citizens of the District whose daily transactions may be within the operation of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
