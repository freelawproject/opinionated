This primciple applied to the case of property stolen in one State and carried into another State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\"> In this case the unanimous opinion the of courtafBrmingtheca.se of Collins was, that the offence charged is the receiving the goods, knowing them to have been stolen.
