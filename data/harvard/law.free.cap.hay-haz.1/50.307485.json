Mudd, and my neice Emily Mudd, children of my sister Mary Mudd, Baptist, Elias, Henry, his wife and four children, and Nancy, for the use and benefit of my sister Mary Mudd, during her life.\u201d That the testator supposing he had not sufficiently provided in his will for the said complainants executed a bill of sale conveying to the said defendant absolutely fourteen negro slaves ; among said slaves were some of those left to the complainants in- the will. That the said bill of sale was not intended by the said testator to transfer the negroes for the benefit of the said defendant, but rather for the benefit of Mary Mudd during her life, and after her death for the benefit of these complainants.

The defendant states further that to avoid a family quarrel he compromised with the said legatees and received five of the negroes. That he holds one of the negroes as guardian under the will. That he sold one of the negroes that he received under the compromise, but he intended at the time to substitute in the negro\u2019s stead another of equal value and considered the substitute as the property of the complainants. That he submits the matter to the court alleging that his affairs are embarrassed and the rights of the infants are endangered and has heretofore hesitated as to what course he should pursue.
