That he did not see what particular money it was, but saw that it was paper money; that witness did not know who was the man referred to as \u201c that fellow and that he had not heard Pye making said exclamation or saw Pye and Roach dividing money on any other occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The United States proved by Lambert S. Beck that he was employed by Adams to arrest Pye and Roach on a charge of swindling ; that he saw Roach with others at the house of Spencer Day, near the railroad depot; that Roach, as soon as he saw witness, ran away; that Pye was then pointed out to witness as if apparently hiding from him ; that witness seized him, and before witness told him what he was arrested for, Pye said he did not know Adams, had never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>seen him and that he was at home when Adams was robbed of his money in the stable; That Pye denied that he had any money at all. Witness searched him at the magistrate\u2019s office and found upon him a five dollar note said to be of a broken bank, and a few copper coins ; that witness took him . to jail; that Pye then declared that he had no other money whatever <em>; </em>that witness searched him and found between his drawers, which were very tight and tied below, and his flesh, some Rails-money, witness thinks a two-dollar note and a one-dollar note ; that when they dropped from him on the floor, he very slyly and quickly slipt his foot over them ; witness enquired how he came by them, and he gave no account; that they were the same kind of money which Adams had sworn he had lost. Witness further proved that Mrs. Riley\u2019s is very near the stable where the money was lost; that Pye and Roach and others were in the habit of frequenting Mrs. Riley\u2019s, but their principal rendezvous was at Spencer Day\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The United States further proved by Robert Dali, that a a two-dollar Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad order, which witness produced on the trial, and a one-dollar order of the same money, which was not produced, were found on the prisoner in the manner stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The United States further proved by the said Adams, that after the cards were produced as aforesaid, and before the said Roach applied to the prosecutor, Adams, for a loan of money as aforesaid, he had endeavored to.induce the said prosecutor to join in the game or to stake some money by way of bet thereupon, but that the said prosecutor positively refused to do so, and said he knew nothing about gambling and would not risk any money upon it ; that subsequently, upon the application of the said Roach, the said prosecutor willingly loaned him the railroad orders as aforesaid, as a loan of money, thinking Jeff a pretty clever fellow, confidently trusting he would repay the said loan to him however the game might result, or whether he lost or won thereupon.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Whereupon, the prisoner, by his counsel, prayed the court to instruct the jury, that upon the evidence so offered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u25a0the United States, if believed to be true, the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal; which instructions the court refused \u2022to give ; and the defendant excepts, and prays the court to sign and seal this bill of exception, which is done accordingly, this 26th March, 1842.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">JAMES DUNLOP.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">On hearing the argument of the counsel for the defendant and of the attorney for the United States, the court reversed the judgment of the criminal court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
