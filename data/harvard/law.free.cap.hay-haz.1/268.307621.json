There being no parties litigant before the Court, the general rule, that the original papers filed in a suit shall not be withdrawn without leaving attested copies, does not seem to be applicable to the present case. There is no person who can claim any right to have the papers retained, and we can see no use in retaining them. If, however, any person desires to have copies of any of them before they -are withdrawn, the Court will permit such copies to be taken at the cost of the persons requiring the same, and for that purpose the papers will remain as they are until the 29th day of this month, on or after which day the papers filed by Mr. Tochman with his an\u00e1wer as aforesaid may be withdrawn by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">By order of the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
