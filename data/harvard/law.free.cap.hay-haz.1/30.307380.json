Somerville $12,000, ; for the purpose of paying this debt Lee conveyed, on the 19th day of June, 1829, an estate situated on the Potomac river, called Pope\u2019s Creek, to Somerville, for $20,000, as stated in the deed of conveyance. On the same day Lee covenanted with Somerville, reciting the sale, that $8,000 was yet unpaid, but was not to be paid before the expiration of seven years ; that he would look to the land sold as the sole means of obtaining the said sum of $8,000. At the earnest request of Lee, Somerville drew a draft on his father-in-law in Baltimore, Maryland, in favor of Lee, for $1,000, payable in one year. These transactions, viz., executing the deed, the covenant, and the draft, transpired on the 19th day of June, 1829. On the 20th of June, Somerville executed a deed of trust, reciting that he was indebted to Henry Lee in the sum of $8,000 ; and to secure this debt executed a debt of trust to C. C. Lee, as trustee, conveying the same estate as was conveyed in the deed from Lee to Somerville, to said trustee. That $7,000 had been conceded as having been paid, and was credited on the note secured by the said deed of trust. t</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The only controversy was as to whether the draft of $1,000 should be credited as part payment of the $8,000, or not. The complainant claimed that it was to be credited when the amount was received, and it having been received, it ought to be credited. The defendant held that it was no part of the $8,000, that the draft was drawn by Somerville before the deed of trust was executed, and could not have been received as part of the amount stated in the deed of trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\">A letter was exhibited from Henry Lee to Somerville in which was recited a letter from C. C. Lee, that he (Somerville) claimed that the $1,000 should be credited on the amount due, but referred him to his brother, C. C. Lee, who was his attorney, having his power of attorney to do what he should think right and proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-5\">The deposition of one of the justices of the peace who were present at the execution of the deed of trust and witnessed its execution, and being one of the justices of the peace before whom the deed was acknowledged, was offered as evidence, and it was allowed to be given notwithstanding the objection of the defendant, who contended that it was an attempt to contradict a deed by parol testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-6\">He deposed as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-7\">\u201c I understood from both Lee and Somerville that the sum of $8,000 was the only sum to be paid by Somerville. The sum Lee owed Somerville was $12,000, and $20,000 was the price required for the Pope\u2019s Creek estate. The $1,000 was an after matter, and insisted on after the deeds were executed, and the whole business stopped. Somerville said he could not raise it, but he would consult Mr. Truman, his father-in-law, and find out whether he would permit him to draw on him for it, and that the $1,000 was in part of the $8,000, and not an additional $1,000 ; that after the deeds were executed Mr. Lee said he could not do without $1,000 to bear his expense to Algiers, which he said must be advanced out of the $8,000 I understood from both the parties the demand of the $1,000 was made and negotiated as proposed; that it was to be in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>part of the $8,000 when paid ; no other sums were ever spoken of.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-4\">F.
