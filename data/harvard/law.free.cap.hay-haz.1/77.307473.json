The said witness, on cross-examination, testified that plaintiff did not at the time of - making such statement point out the extent of his claim, and did not point out the <em>locus in quo </em>as part of his land, and was not then standing on the low ground covered by the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The defendant objected to the admissibility of the above evidence so offered to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The plaintiff proved by one Pairo, that about thirty years ago he, Pairo, married the aunt of the plaintiff, and knew the land, and heard plaintiff\u2019s father claim it from that time until his death as his, but never knew the plaintiff\u2019s father to claim it while on the land, except once or twice when there was an enclosure of about four acres; but who put it up or who worked it witness did not know ; at that time plaintiff\u2019s father, while standing in said enclosure, said he owned about five or six acres there, and both witness and plaintiff\u2019s father went away together, leaving no person in the house or in the enclosure, and he never heard of any adverse title to the said property.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The plaintiff also proved by one Beall, that from 1833 to the bringing of this suit, the plaintiff paid taxes upon the property in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">To the admittance of the said evidence the defendant objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The court overruled the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">In the cross-examination of said Beall, the defendant, by its counsel, asked him how he knew that plaintiff had paid the taxes for the property in dispute, and he said he knew it was for said property because he was one of the assessors and had assessed the same; that said assessment was entered in the books of the Corporation of Georgetown, and was copied from the description of a former assessment to plaintiff\u2019s father, but witness did not survey the land, and does not know that the description given of it in said assessment would include the land in dispute, although he was one of the assessors and went upon the land to view it, and assessed the whole land which Douglass possessed, as well as more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>land than he possessed, all of which was assessed to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\">The defendant, by its counsel, moved to exclude the evidence of the payment of taxes upon the ground that the best evidence is not produced to show that the taxes were assessed for the property in dispute, and that the witness\u2019 knowledge is based upon the written assessment and the \u2022description therein given, but the court refused to exclude the said evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The jury found for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages at $570, with interest from April 28, 1842.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The defendant, by its counsel, moved the court for a new trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Because the verdict of the jury was against the law and the evidence of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Because the damages found were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Because the court erred in the law of the case in refusing the instructions asked by the defendant, and in admitting illegal testimony.</p>\n<judges id=\"b88-9\">The court, Thurston, J., absent, overruled the motion for a new trial.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
