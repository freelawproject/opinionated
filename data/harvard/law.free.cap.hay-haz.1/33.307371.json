It was also attempted to be shown that the usage of the city established such a <em>right; </em>and several of the most experienced and skillful builders, and some of the oldest citizens, were examined upon that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-16\">Sec. 4, Building Regulations, No. 1, October 17th, 1791:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQC\">tc That the person, or persons, appointed by the commissioners to superintend the buildings, may enter on the land of any person to set out the foundation and regulate the walls to be built between party and party as to the breadth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>and thickness thereof, which foundation shall be laid equally upon the lands of the persons between whom such party walls are to be built, and shall be of the breadth and thickness determined by such person proper; and the first builder \u25a0shall be reimbursed one moiety of the charge of such party wall, or so much thereof as the next builder shall have occasion to make use of, before such next builder shall anyway use or break the wall.
