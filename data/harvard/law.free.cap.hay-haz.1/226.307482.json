If the jury shall believe from the evidence that the contract given in evidence was abandoned by mutual consent of the parties before being completely executed without any reservation by the plaintiff at the time of any claim'against the defendant beyond the stipulated rate of compensation for the work actually excavated by the plaintiff, and that the defendant had paid him the full price at that rate before the institution of this suit, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">2. And if the jury shall further believe from the evidence, that the plaintiff only excavated 4240 yards, part of the 8000 yards mentioned in the contract given in evidence, and that he was prevented by the defendant from excavating the residue of the said quantity without his consent, and that, in fact, before such act of the defendant, if such act be found by the jury, the said residue or as much in the proposed line of excavation or any other equally satisfactory to the defendant had been excavated by a freshet in the river; then the plaintiff is not entitled to charge the defendant with the quantity excavated by the freshet as if made by him, and, although the jury shall find that the plaintiff was prevented from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>excavating said residue as aforesaid, the true measure of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled under the circumstances is not the gross contract price of said residue at 35 cents per cubic yard, but is the fair and reasonable profit, if any, that the jury shall find from the evidence that the plaintiff would have made by excavating said residue over and above the expense to him of making such excavation. Judge Cranch dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">3. And if the jury shall further find from the evidence, that the defendant has already paid the plaintiff any sum of money over and above the contract price of the work actually excavated by him, then such sum of money is in such case to be deducted from any allowance of profits as aforesaid.
