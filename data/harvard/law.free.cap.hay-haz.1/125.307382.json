Motion overruled and judgment entered upon the verdict. This case was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, on exceptions, where the judgment of the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Court was ordered to be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings. See 4 Howard, 131.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AZLy\">Note. \u2014 Mr. Justice Woodbury, in delivering the opinion of the court, in \u00bfHoward, 143, said: \u201cThe declaration is an action on the case,, sounding in tort. It sets out no contract except by way of inducement, made by Mr. Franklin, the predecessor in office of the defendant, and it then proceeds to make the gist of its complaint a wrongful and injurious neglect and refusal by the defendant to furnish a copy of certain laws to the plaintiff, as had been agreed by Franklin. We are required to take this view of the declaration, not only by the avermentsin it, but by both the present and past positions of the counsel for the-plaintiff, that it was intended to be founded on a misfeasance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"Azu\">The plea, however, instead of being \u2018not guilty,\u2019 as was proper in such case, is <em>non assumpsit, </em>and the plaintiff below, not demurring thereto, nor moving for judgment notwithstanding such a plea, joined issue upon it, and the verdict of the jury conforms to the plea and issue.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"AIL\">And on page 147 he said: \u201c In Patterson <em>vs. </em>United States, 2 Wheaton, 224, Judge Washington lays down the whole law precisely as we view it in respect to a verdict varying materially from the issue, and which principle applies equally well to a plea varying from the substance of' the declaration.\u201d</headnotes>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
