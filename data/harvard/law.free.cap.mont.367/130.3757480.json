(HSG) appeals the First Judicial District Court\u2019s order denying its motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment in favor of Lewis and Clark County Planning and Zoning Commission and Lewis and Clark County Board of Commissioners (collectively, \u201cthe County\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b62 <em>1.

We affirm in part and remand as to the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">\u00b66 The establishment of local zoning districts is governed by statute in Montana. A district may be created in one of two ways-by citizen petition to the board of county commissioners under \u00a7 76-2-101, MCA, known as \u201cPart 1 zoning,\u201d or directly by the board of county commissioners under \u00a7 76-2-201, MCA, known as \u201cPart 2 zoning.\u201d This case involves Part 1 zoning. HSG challenges the County\u2019s decision to adopt a citizen-initiated proposal to configure a zoning district that favors residential uses and prohibits mining.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">\u00b67 HSG owns approximately 421 acres located north of East Helena, Montana. In June 2008, HSG obtained a permit from the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to mine gravel on 110 acres of its property. Those 110 acres are not at issue in this case. Before DEQ granted the permit, a group of citizens living north of East Helena submitted to the County a petition seeking to create Special Zoning District Number 43 (District 43). The proposal delineated an area which encompassed the property owned by HSG and its purpose was: \u201cto accommodate and protect the use of single-family dwelling units and associated agricultural land uses while promoting and preserving the rural residential atmosphere of the area and enhancing the aesthetic character and property values of the area.\u201d It proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>to prohibit industrial and mining activities in the district, including any sand and gravel operations to be performed by HSG on the remaining 311 acres of its property. The petition was signed by approximately seventy percent of the property owners within the proposed district.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\">\u00b68 The statutory provisions for Part 1 zoning authorize the board of county commissioners, \u201cwhenever the public interest or convenience may require,\u201d to create a planning and zoning district \u201cupon petition of 60% of the affected freeholders,\u201d unless \u201c50% of the titled property ownership in the district protest the establishment of the district within 30 days of its creation.\u201d Section 76-2-101, MCA (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AvG\">\u00b69 On April 1,2008, following a public meeting, the Lewis and Clark County Board of Commissioners (the Board) voted to create District 43. HSG commented during the meeting that the petition constituted \u201cillegal gerrymandering\u201d because \u201c[t]he district borders have been specifically and unreasonably drafted to benefit the petitioners\u201d; no protest, however, was filed by fifty percent of the land owners within thirty days of the Board\u2019s approval of the district. Thus, on May 8, 2008, the Board adopted a resolution creating the boundaries of District 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b610 The matter proceeded to the Lewis and Clark County Planning and Zoning Commission (the PZ Commission), which is statutorily required to adopt a development pattern for the new district and authorized to recommend regulations to the Board to implement the development pattern. Sections 76-2-104 and -107, MCA. On June 4, 2008, the PZ Commission held a hearing in which it solicited public comments regarding the development pattern and regulations proposed by the petitioners. HSG reiterated the concerns it had raised at the earlier meeting and submitted a proposal recommending that sand and gravel mining operations be authorized within the district under a conditional use permit. In order to provide the county attorney\u2019s office with additional time to analyze the legal issues raised by HSG, the PZ Commission continued the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u00b611 On June 11, 2008, the county attorney\u2019s office informed the PZ Commission that it needed additional evidence on two issues \u2014 (1) whether the proposed development pattern and regulation complied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>with the Growth Policy, and (2) how the proposed zoning compared with existing uses surrounding and within the district. The PZ Commission directed planning staff to create a report on the two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\">\u00b612 The staff report, prepared on June 18,2008, described the broader transitional area in which District 43 is located as being \u201ccharacterized by a range of residential and rural residential development,\u201d though it noted the existence of two operational gravel mines in the area. The report was made available to the public and, on June 30, 2008, the PZ Commission reopened its June 4 hearing in order to discuss the report\u2019s findings. The Commission received numerous public comments, including comments from HSG. The PZ Commission met on July 1, 2008, to consider the development pattern and regulations for District 43. In discussing the public input they had received, the Commissioners stated that it was a \u201cdifficult decision.\u201d The regulations were adopted and referred to the Board for approval. The Board held a public meeting on July 3, 2008, during which it again received comments from HSG and other members of the public. The Board then tabled the matter for a week and, on July 10, 2008, approved the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b613 In July 2008, HSG filed a complaint in the First Judicial District Court, alleging that the County had adopted a zoning pattern and regulations that improperly prohibited HSG from mining sand and gravel on its property. The District Court considered cross-motions for summary judgment on whether the County had improperly adopted the zoning pattern and regulations creating District 43, and whether the County\u2019s zoning decision constituted a taking of HSG\u2019s property. The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of the County on both issues. It reasoned that the zoning regulations substantially complied with the growth policy and that they did not single out HSG for disparate treatment because \u201cthe County\u2019s prohibition on sand and gravel operations applies to all of the land within [District 43], not only to the property owned by HSG.\u201d The District Court also concluded that HSG did not have an established property right in its ability to apply for a mining permit because \u201cDEQ does not lack \u2018all discretion\u2019 \u201d in granting and denying such permits and thus \u201capproval of the permit is not \u2018virtually assured.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00b614 We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision on motions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>summary judgment, applying the same Mont. R. Civ. P. 56(c) criteria as the district court. <em>Ternes v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>2011 MT 156, \u00b6 18, 361 Mont. 129, 257 P.3d 352. Summary judgment is appropriate when, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Ternes, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab--\">\u00b615 When reviewing a zoning decision, we \u201cgive deference to the decisions of the local board.\u201d <em>Town &amp; Country Foods, Inc. v. City of Bozeman, </em>2009 MT 72, \u00b6 14, 349 Mont. 453, 203 P.3d 1283. Our review is limited to the question whether the zoning authority abused its discretion. <em>Town &amp; Country Foods, </em>\u00b6 13. To constitute an abuse of discretion, the zoning authority\u2019s decision must be based on information that is \u201cso lacking in fact and foundation that it is clearly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Town &amp; Country Foods, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>Flathead Citizens for Quality Growth, Inc. v. Flathead County Bd. of Adjustment, </em>2008 MT 1, \u00b6 32, 341 Mont. 1, 175 P.3d 282). If the validity of the legislative classification for zoning purposes is \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d then the legislative judgment of the zoning board controls. <em>Mack T. Anderson Ins. Agency v. City of Belgrade, </em>246 Mont. 112, 120, 803 P.2d 648, 652 (1990) (quoting <em>Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 U.S. 365, 387-88, 47 S. Ct. 114, 118 (1926)).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b616 <em>1. Whether, in adopting the zoning pattern and regulations prohibiting mining in a special district, the County abused its discretion by failing to consider existing land uses or to ensure substantial compliance with the Growth Policy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b617 Under \u00a7 76-1-605, MCA, zoning regulations adopted by a local governing body in an area covered by a growth policy must \u201cbe guided by and give consideration to the general policy and pattern of development set out in the growth policy ....\u201d Section 76-1-605(1)(c), MCA. The statute also provides that \u201c[a] growth policy is not a regulatory document\u201d and \u201c[a] governing body may not withhold, deny, or impose conditions on any land use approval or other authority to act based solely on compliance with a growth policy ....\u201d Section 76-1-605(2)(a)-(b), MCA. In considering the degree to which zoning regulations adopted by the local authority must conform to the growth policy, we have held that the standard is \u201csubstantial compliance.\u201d <em>Little v. Bd. of Co. Comm\u2019rs, </em>193 Mont. 334, 353, 631 P.2d 1282, 1293 (1981) (determining whether a Part 2 zoning decision was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>substantial compliance with master plan); <em>Heffernan v. Missoula City Council, </em>2011 MT 91, \u00b6 74, 360 Mont. 207, 255 P.3d 80 (holding that, following the 2003 revisions to statutes governing growth policies and planning boards, \u201cthe \u2018substantial compliance\u2019 standard still applies\u201d). We apply the substantial compliance standard to zoning regulations adopted under Part 2, as seen in <em>Little, </em>and also those adopted under Part 1. <em>See Bridger Canyon Property Owners\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Planning &amp; Zoning Comm\u2019n, </em>270 Mont. 160, 170, 890 P.2d 1268, 1274 (1995) (stating that \u201cthe propositions established in <em>Little </em>are applicable\u201d to Part 1 zoning).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\">\u00b618 HSG argues that the zoning regulations do not substantially comply with the Growth Policy because the zoning board \u201cdisregard[ed] the actual use of the land.\u201d HSG points out that the County\u2019s staff report, made at the PZ Commission\u2019s request, noted the existence of five gravel pits in and around the transitional area encompassing District 43. The County nonetheless classified the area as \u201crural residential.\u201d HSG thus contends that the County asked for, but did not \u201cactually [use the] additional information in any meaningful way.\u201d It contends this case is comparable to <em>Ash Grove Cement Co. v. Jefferson County, </em>283 Mont. 486, 943 P.2d 85 (1997), where we held that the zoning board had implemented regulations that conflicted with existing uses. The County maintains that, despite the existence and operation of multiple gravel pits in and around the area, the current land use is \u201cprimarily residential\u201d and that <em>Ash Grove </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\u00b619 We agree with the County that this case differs from <em>Ash Grove. </em>In that case, the Jefferson County Board of Commissioners had adopted a master plan for Jefferson County that included the obj ective of inviting \u201ccontinued mineral exploration, extraction and refinement\u201d and classified the area surrounding Ash Grove\u2019s quarries and cement plant as \u201cMining: Active Surface\u201d and \u201cMining and Industrial: Intensive Mineral Processing and Industrial Uses.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Ash Grove, </em>283 Mont. at 489-90, 943 P.2d at 87-88. The commissioners then adopted a citizen-initiated local vicinity plan that was intended to amend the master plan and to supersede it as to any inconsistencies. <em>Ash Grove, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>283 Mont. at 498, 943 P.2d at 93. The local plan contrasted starkly with the existing master plan-it described Ash Grove and its surroundings as having a \u201cunique rural residential character\u201d and failed to include existing mining and industrial uses. <em>Ash Grove, </em>283 Mont. at 490-91, 943 P.2d at 88. We concluded that the local plan failed to substantially comply with the master plan and was not a proper amendment to the master plan because it \u201cdisregards the actual use of the land to which it purports to apply <em>...\u201d Ash Grove, </em>283 Mont. at 499, 943 P.2d at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\">\u00b620 In this case, the special zoning district does not purport to amend the Growth Policy, but-as permitted under Part 1 zoning-to create specific zoning requirements within the area already defined by the Growth Policy. The creation of District 43 is expressly contemplated by Montana law, unlike the local vicinity plans in <em>Ash Grove, </em>that were authorized by the master plan itself and failed to comply with Part 1 zoning requirements. <em>Ash Grove, </em>283 Mont. at 489, 943 P.2d at 87. The relevant version of the Lewis and Clark County Growth Policy was adopted in February 2004, four years before HSG obtained its mining permit from DEQ for the 110 acres. It states the following county-wide policy objectives, among others: \u201c[sjupport the continuation of farming and ranching operations,\u201d \u201c[ejncourage in-fill development of urban and transitional areas already committed to development!,]\u201d and \u201c[p]rovide more predictability for property owners and the development community regarding appropriate changes in land use ....\u201d The Growth Policy indicates that the Helena Valley Planning Area \u201cis facing considerable growth and development pressure.\u201d Unlike Jefferson County\u2019s master plan, the Growth Policy seeks to strike a balance between agricultural and residential use; it does not mention mining and industrial uses as a priority for the Helena Valley, but suggests mining should be focused in the valley\u2019s rural areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u00b621 The Growth Policy defines three \u201curban\u201d areas, two \u201cspecial use areas,\u201d and three \u201ctransitional areas,\u201d with the remaining lands of the Helena Valley designated as rural areas. HSG\u2019s property lies within one of the three \u201ctransitional areas,\u201d which the Growth Policy defines as containing \u201clow-density development and community services (schools, parks, fire protection, neighborhood, commercial, etc.) and having the potential to \u201caccommodate additional infill development.\u201d Specifically, HSG\u2019s property and District 43 are located within Transitional Area F (Area F), which the Growth Policy describes as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmI\">... characterized by a range of residential development (urban <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>density, mobile home parks, ranchette density), a small commercial hub (Wylie Drive and Canyon Ferry Road), two gravel resource extraction operations, designated 100-year floodplains, and irrigation facilities. Portions of the area are zoned for residential and ranchette uses, but a majority of the area is not zoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-3\">The county\u2019s staff report, prepared in June 2008, provided a similar description:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">Area F is generally characterized by a range of residential and rural residential development (including a few mobile home parks), a small commercial hub located at the junction of Wylie Drive and Canyon Ferry Road, two existing gravel resource extraction operations both located west of Wylie Drive, three fire stations serviced by either the Eastgate Rural Fire District or the East Helena Valley Fire District, two elementary schools ... and two community parks .... The Area is also comprised of various commercial and/or industrial uses that include, but are not limited to the following: a number of storage unit operations, manufacturing businesses, automobile/boat storage, ... day care center(s), a sign and graphic business(es), a meat packing and processing facility or facilities, and other various businesses and operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Other land uses noted in the report include two water treatment plants, agriculture, and churches. Though the majority of Area F remains unzoned, as it was at the time of the 2004 Growth Policy, the report identified two special zoning districts in addition to District 43-LaCasa Grande, designated as residential, neighborhood commercial, and public lands and institutions, and T-L Ranch Acres, a \u201crural residential District that does not contain any specific zoning designations.\u201d Regarding District 43, the report stated that \u201c[t]he proposed development pattern/regulations are very similar to a combination of both La Casa Grande and T-L Ranch Acres.\u201d These descriptions of Transitional Area F support the County\u2019s determination that the existing uses were primarily residential and that the proposed zoning pattern and regulations for District 43 did not conflict with such existing uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b622 The County acknowledges that the existence of gravel pits in and around Area F made its decision a \u201ccloser call.\u201d This is reflected in the Commissioners\u2019 statements during the PZ Commission\u2019s July 1, 2008 meeting. In deciding whether to adopt finally the zoning pattern and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>recommend the proposed regulations to the Board, the Commissioners stated that they had \u201creceived a volume of compelling testimony from both sides\u201d and that their decision was \u201cdifficult.\u201d However, the balance tipped in favor of adopting the regulations. Commissioner Hunthausen stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-3\">[T]he growth policy indicates to me that gravel pits are most appropriate in rural areas and less appropriate in urban and transitional areas and especially this transitional area where the residential character of that area has pushed in and encroached!;] it\u2019s very much upon this portion of the transitional area. So it seems to me if we were consistent with the growth policy that we would support this transitional area being kept in a residential type of growth pattern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Commissioner Murray pointed out that, although the Growth Policy acknowledged that two gravel pits were present in Area F at the time the Growth Policy was adopted, this did not mean that gravel pits must be allowed in transitional areas, since \u201c[m]ost if not all zoning districts have existing non-conforming uses in them.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 76-2-105, MCA (allowing continuation of existing non-conforming uses).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\u00b623 The County notes accurately that this Court may reverse its decision only where it is \u201cso lacking in fact and foundation that it is clearly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Town &amp; Country Foods, </em>\u00b6 13. Having thoroughly reviewed the information upon which the County based its decision, we conclude that it considered existing uses in Area F and District 43 and its determination that the prevailing use was residential was not clearly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b624 Additionally, HSG argues that the zoning district was designed by petitioners with the specific intent of preventing HSG from mining its property. Montana Contractors Association filed an <em>amicus </em>brief warning this Court of the dangers of such \u201cblatant gerrymandering\u201d and underscoring the negative economic impact that would result from the relocation of mining operations away from developing areas where demand for gravel is highest. HSG and <em>amici </em>contend that the petitioners deliberately drew the district boundary so that fifty percent of the property owners would not protest its establishment. The County agrees that \u201cthe citizens who petitioned for the creation of [District 43] initiated the process with the main purpose of stopping HSG from mining on its property,\u201d but maintains that the County \u201cdid not act with that same purpose.\u201d We agree with the County. Regardless of what motivated the petitioners to initiate the Part 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>zoning process, the record demonstrates that the County heard and considered public comments from both sides at all stages of its decision-making process. The Commissioners\u2019 own comments indicate that they were careful to make their decision based on compliance with the Growth Policy and the existing uses within the district, rather than based on HSG\u2019s proposed mine expansion.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\">\u00b625 During the PZ Commission\u2019s July 1 meeting, Deputy County Attorney Sealey advised the Commission that its decision was not to be \u201cbased on Helena Sand &amp; Gravel\u2019s pit,\u201d but on \u201cthe growth policy and whether gravel pits generally belong in transitional areas and whether gravel pits belong in this particular transitional area [and] this particular district.\u201d Voting in favor of adopting the regulations, Commissioner Hunthausen stated, \u201cmy decision is not about Helena Sand &amp; Gravel. It\u2019s not about this particular gravel pit. It\u2019s about in general ... is it consistent with the growth policy and is this the direction that we want to head as a county.\u201d Prior to adopting the zoning pattern, Commissioners made statements on the record expressing their preference for comprehensive zoning and acknowledging the need for gravel mining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">Chairman Tinsley: This is a classic example of why we need comprehensive zoning. We need gravel to build our highways. We need gravel to do construction yet all of the gravel ground is covered by residential housing because there was no zoning.... This is a textbook case of why zoning is necessary and what we have been pushing and talking about as long as I\u2019ve been a county commissioner....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">Commissioner Hunthausen:... I would just echo what you said[,] that comprehensive zoning is the way to do this. This is probably not the most efficient and effective way to zone an area.... This is a difficult position [for] us to be put in[,] for a local business to be put in[,] and for residents to be put in. If we can plan our valley ahead of time and work to lay it out in a way that works for most of us most of the time[,] then I think we have a much better process and a way to go in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b626  HSG\u2019s complaint about \u201cgerrymandering\u201d relates more to the effects of Part 1 zoning than it does to the County\u2019s decision that the zoning district was acceptable in consideration of existing uses and the Growth Policy. HSG is not challenging the constitutionality of zoning by citizen petition. The consequences of Part 1 zoning decisions such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>as this one understandably are difficult for affected landowners. However, the Legislature expressly has authorized zoning by citizen petition and HSG acknowledges that \u201c[t]his Court does not sit as a super-legislature or super-zoning board.\u201d <em>Town &amp; Country </em>Foods, \u00b6 14. The County followed the Part 1 requirements in adopting the zoning district. The Growth Policy and staff report prepared by the County provided information upon which the County reasonably relied in determining that District 43 lies in an area that is characterized by residential development as the prevailing use. Even if this zoning classification was \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d we must defer to the legislative judgment of the zoning board. <em>Mack T. Anderson Ins. Agency, </em>246 Mont. at 120, 803 P.2d at 652. Thus, applying appropriate deference to the zoning authority, we cannot conclude that the County\u2019s decision to adopt the zoning pattern and regulations for District 43 was clearly unreasonable and an abuse of discretion. <em>Town &amp; Country Foods, </em>\u00b6 13. \u00b627 <em>2. Whether the County\u2019s adoption of zoning regulations prohibiting sand and gravel mining constitutes illegal reverse spot zoning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\">\u00b628 HSG argues that the County\u2019s decision to adopt the zoning pattern and regulations proposed by the petitioners constituted illegal reverse spot zoning. HSG cites to federal precedent that defines reverse spot zoning as \u201ca land-use decision which arbitrarily singles out a particular parcel for different, less favorable treatment than the neighboring ones.\u201d <em>Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 132, 98 S. Ct. 2646, 2663 (1978). While this Court \u201chas never considered or adopted a \u2018reverse\u2019 spot zoning analysis\u201d per se, we have considered spot zoning in a number of cases. <em>Liberty Cove, Inc. v. Missoula Co., </em>2009 MT 377, \u00b6 24, 353 Mont. 286, 220 P.3d 617 (citing cases). Both parties reference our spot zoning analysis in their discussion of this issue, and we agree the precedents supply relevant authority. Both spot zoning and reverse spot zoning involve \u201cthe process of <em>singling out \u2018a small parcel of land\u2019 </em>\u201d for differential use classification. <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 346-47, 631 P.2d at 1289 (emphasis in original); <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 132, 98 S. Ct. at 2663.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b629 In determining whether a county has engaged in illegal spot zoning, we apply the three-part framework provided in <em>Little. See Plains Grains L.P. v. Bd. of Co. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2010 MT 155, \u00b6\u00b6 58-66, 357 Mont. 61, 238 P.3d 332 (applying the <em>Little </em>three-part test); <em>see also Greater Yellowstone Coalition v. Bd. of Co. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2001 MT 99, \u00b6\u00b6 21-37, 305 Mont. 232, 25 P.3d 168 (same). The <em>Little </em>framework requires evaluation of whether: (1) \u201cthe requested use is significantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>different from the prevailing use in the area,\u201d (2) \u201cthe area in which the requested use is to apply is rather small,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe requested change is more in the nature of special legislation.\u201d <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 346, 631 P.2d at 1289. We clarified that \u201c[t]here is no single, comprehensive definition of spot zoning applicable to all fact situations,\u201d but \u201cusually all three elements are present\u201d when illegal spot zoning has occurred. <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 346, 631 P.2d at 1289 (quoting Donald G. Hagman, <em>Urban Planning and Land Development Control Law </em>ch. 6 \u00a7 93, 169 (West 1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\">\u00b630 HSG relies heavily on the second factor of the <em>Little </em>test because it is the only landowner shown to have been affected by the zoning in District 43. HSG is correct that the second <em>Little </em>test usually \u201cfocuses on the number of owners who stand to benefit from a zoning change.\u201d <em>See Greater Yellowstone Coalition, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-28 (recognizing that second test was met where only one landowner benefitted from rezone); <em>see also Little, </em>193 Mont. at 347, 631 P.2d at 1289 (stating that \u201cit is really a question of preferential treatment for one or two persons as against the general public, regardless of the size of the tract involved\u201d) (citing <em>Thomas v. Town of Bedford, </em>184 N.E.2d 285 (N.Y. 1962)). Here, even though-at over 400 acres-its parcel of land is not physically small, HSG has shown that it was the only landowner to be adversely affected by the zone change in creation of District 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b631 As we previously have observed, however, \u201czone changes for property owned by one person are not <em>always </em>spot zoning pursuant to the <em>Little </em>test.\u201d <em>Greater Yellowstone Coalition, </em>\u00b6 27. In particular, we \u201creinforced\u201d in <em>Little </em>that \u201c \u2018zoning has been held invalid as spot zoning when it is not in accordance with a comprehensive plan. We cannot ignore this test when our zoning statutes place great weight on the comprehensive plan as a guide in zoning.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Liberty Cove, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 347, 631 P.2d at 1290). Compliance with a comprehensive plan, or growth policy as in this case, is especially relevant to the third factor of the analysis. <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 347, 631 P.2d at 1290). The zoning is not \u201cin the nature of special legislation\u201d if it substantially complies with the growth policy. HSG conceded the point during oral argument before this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">The Court: Mr. Kakuk ... if the Court were to conclude that the district complies with the growth policy as a whole, does that then automatically answer the second issue raised in your brief, which is that it was reverse spot zoning? In other words, if it complies with the growth policy or if we defer to the legislative judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>that it complied with the growth policy, your spot zoning claim fails. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-3\">Counsel: Well, I don\u2019t want to shoot myself in the foot, I\u2019d like to say no, but I think you\u2019re right, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">This conclusion finds support in <em>Little, </em>which condemned the county\u2019s actions as \u201cspot zoning of the worst kind\u201d in part because the comprehensive plan recommended a different use of the affected property. <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 345-46, 631 P.2d at 1289. In contrast, as discussed above, the Lewis and Clark County Growth Policy does not recommend development of mining in transitional areas, but suggests that such activity occur in the rural areas of the Helena Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b632  For similar reasons, HSG does not satisfy the first factor of the <em>Little </em>analysis. Again, we already have determined that in adopting zoning regulations prohibiting mining in District 43 the County did not unlawfully depart from the prevailing \u201crural residential\u201d use in the surrounding area. Our decision that the zoning pattern and regulations substantially complied with the prevailing land use, as expressed in the Growth Policy and staff report, disposes of two out of the three <em>Little </em>factors. HSG therefore cannot demonstrate that its property was singled out for \u201ca use classification totally different from that of the surrounding area,\u201d <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 346-47, 631 P.2d at 1289, and thus subjected to illegal spot zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b633 Moreover, if we were to follow HSG\u2019s suggestion and apply the definition of reverse spot zoning used in <em>Penn Central, </em>HSG\u2019s claim likely also would fail under that analysis. <em>See Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 132, 98 S. Ct. at 2663 (stating that reverse spot zoning is \u201cthe antithesis of land-use control as part of some comprehensive plan...\u201d). \u00b634 <em>3. Whether HSG has an established property right, entitling it to bring a takings claim against the County.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u00b635 We engage in a two-step inquiry to determine whether government action amounts to a taking of private property-first, whether the plaintiff has a constitutionally protected property interest and second, whether the property owner has been deprived of that interest. <em>Seven Up Pete Venture v. State, </em>2005 MT 146, \u00b6 26, 327 Mont. 306, 114 P.3d 1009 (quoting <em>Kiely Constr., L.L.C. v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2002 MT 241, \u00b6 23, 312 Mont. 52, 57 P.3d 836) (\u201c[T]he guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply only when a constitutionally protected liberty interest or property interest is at stake.\u201d) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). On cross-motions for summary judgment, the parties agreed to limit the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Court\u2019s decision to the first step of the takings analysis-whether HSG has a constitutionally protected property interest. Accordingly, we limit our review to that threshold question. Both in its summary judgment briefs before the District Court and in its briefs on appeal, HSG argued that it has constitutionally protected property interests arising from its alleged interest in the expansion of its mining permit and from the impact of the zoning regulations on the value of the real property on which the mining activity is proposed to occur. Because the District Court concluded that HSG failed to show a protected entitlement to a mining permit, it did not consider separately HSG\u2019s ownership interest in the real property. Since HSG raises both interests on appeal, we will consider both aspects of HSG\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\">\u00b636  First, in assessing whether a constitutionally protected property right inheres in an opportunity to apply for a permit, we \u201cfocus on the degree of discretion given the decisionmaker and not on the probability of the decision\u2019s favorable outcome.\u201d <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 29 (quoting <em>Jacobs, Visconsi &amp; Jacobs, Co. v. City of Lawrence, </em>927 F.2d 1111, 1116 (10th Cir. 1991)). We recognize a property owner\u2019s constitutionally protected claim of entitlement to permit approval where \u201cthe local agency lacks <em>all </em>discretion to deny issuance of the permit or to withhold its approval.\u201d <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 28 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Gardner v. Baltimore Mayor &amp; City Council, </em>969 F.2d 63, 68 (4th Cir. 1992)). The issuing agency lacks all discretion when the permitting criteria under state and municipal law are \u201cso narrowly circumscribed that approval of a [proper] application is virtually assured.\u201d <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b637 HSG argues that upon its submitting a proper application for a mining permit, DEQ is statutorily mandated to grant the permit. According to HSG, DEQ does not have the authority to deny an application; rather, it \u201cmust continue to notify the applicant of any deficiencies and then allow the applicant to correct the application until it is deemed complete.\u201d HSG points to the language in the permitting process outlined in \u00a7 82-4-432, MCA (2011).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That statute states, \u201c[i]f the application is acceptable, the department <em>shall </em>issue a permit to the operator ....\u201d Section 82-4-432(10)(c), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\u00b638 The language of the statutes makes clear that an applicant is not entitled to a permit unless the application is \u201ccomplete\u201d <em>and </em>DEQ determines that the application is \u201cacceptable.\u201d Section 82-4-432(4)(b)(i), MCA (determination that an application is complete does not ensure that the application is acceptable). In addition to other requirements, \u201c[a]n application is acceptable if it... includes a plan of operation that satisfies the requirements of82-4-434 and rules adopted pursuant to this part related to 82-4-434.\u201d Section 82-4-432(10)(a), MCA. Section 82-4-434, MCA, also uses mandatory language; it provides that DEQ \u201cmay <em>not </em>accept a plan of operation <em>unless\u201d </em>the plan meets the fourteen requirements listed in \u00a7 82-4-434(3)(a)-(n), MCA. Those requirements include, among others, the following qualitative determinations: \u201cappropriate\u201d protection of archaeological and historical values under subsection (h); reclamation as concurrently with the operation \u201cas feasible\u201d under subsection (k); \u201cappropriate\u201d surface and ground water protection under subsection (1); and minimized noise and visual impacts \u201cto the degree practicable\u201d under subsection (m). In addition, an acceptable application \u201cmust\u201d include \u201ca statement from the local governing body ... that the proposed sand and gravel opencut operation complies with applicable zoning regulations ....\u201d Section 82-4-432(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\">\u00b639 Under these governing statutes, DEQ \u201cshall issue a permit\u201d <em>only if </em>it has determined that the operating plan complies with zoning regulations <em>and if </em>it also has decided that the operating plan meets the numerous qualitative requirements of \u00a7 82-4-434(3)(a)-(n), MCA. If DEQ determines that any of those qualitative factors is lacking, such as appropriate groundwater protection-a significant factor in a substantially residential area-the permit would not move forward. In addition, throughout the application review process, DE Q \u201cshall accept public comment,\u201d a factor we cannot disregard as meaningless to the approval process. Section 82-4-432(4)(b)(iii), MCA; <em>see Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 15, 344 Mont. 1, 185 P.3d 1003 (\u201cWe must presume that the Legislature would not pass useless or meaningless legislation.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b640 HSG argues that since it already has a permit for the initial 110 acres, \u201cit is a legal certainty that, but for the zoning, it would receive a permit amendment for the additional 310 acres when it submitted an acceptable application.\u201d HSG overlooks that any amendment to an operating plan must meet the same requirements as the original permit application in order to be \u201cacceptable.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 82-4-432(1l)(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>and 82-4-434(5)(b)(i), MCA. The only exception-that an amendment application is not subject to the public notice and meeting requirements \u201cunless it proposes an increase in permitted acreage of 50% or more\u201d-does not apply because HSG proposes a nearly three-fold increase in the permitted acreage. <em>See </em>\u00a7 82-4-432(ll)(b), MCA. Additionally, the original 110 acres for which DEQ granted a mining permit are located centrally within HSG\u2019s larger property. HSG acknowledged during oral argument before this Court that the remaining acreage was intended, at least in part, to serve as a buffer zone which protects the health, safety and welfare of the surrounding residential area. Without this protective barrier in place, DEQ certainly would need to reevaluate the \u201cnoise and visual impacts on residential areas\u201d and ensure safeguards to \u201cprevent significant physical harm to the affected land or adjacent land, structures, improvements, or life forms\u201d prior to granting a permit amendment. Section 82-4-434(3)(m)-(n), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\">\u00b641  The plaintiff in <em>Seven Up Pete </em>argued similarly to HSG that it had been deprived of an alleged right to seek a permit to conduct cyanide heap leach mining because it would have had the opportunity for a favorable permit decision but for enactment of an initiative that banned such operations. <em>Seven Up Pete, </em>\u00b6 22. We concluded that the \u201cState had wide discretion to reject the Venture\u2019s permit application, even without the enactment of 1-137,\u201d because permit approval \u201crequired convincing the State that this cyanide leaching project was appropriate ....\u201d <em>Seven Up Pete, </em>\u00b6 32. Here, although the specific statutory language is not as permissive as that considered in <em>Seven Up Pete, </em>the applicant for a gravel mining permit or permit amendment likewise must convince DEQ that its mining proposal is \u201cacceptable,\u201d according to the criteria listed in \u00a7\u00a7 82-4-432 and 82-4-434, MCA, before a permit will issue. Thus, it is not just a matter of filling in the blanks on an application form; DEQ unquestionably retains discretion, at a minimum, to \u201cwithhold its approval.\u201d <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 28. We agree with the District Court, therefore, that HSG does not have a constitutionally protected property interest in its right to apply for a mining permit or permit amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b642 Absent a property right in HSG\u2019s \u201copportunity\u201d to obtain expansion of its permit, the question becomes whether the County\u2019s adoption of the development pattern and zoning regulations affected and limited the use of HSG\u2019s land to such an extent that a taking occurred. The Supreme Court has directed that, when faced with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>claim that regulations have gone \u201ctoo far,\u201d courts should consider \u201cwhether the interference with [a party\u2019s] property is of such a magnitude that 'there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain [it].\u201d\u2019 <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 136, 98 S. Ct. at 2665.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">\u00b643 Thus, \u201c[w]here a regulation places limitations on land that fall short of eliminating all economically beneficial use, a taking nonetheless may have occurred, depending on a complex of factors including the regulation\u2019s economic effect on the landowner, the extent to which the regulation interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action.\u201d <em>Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, </em>533 U.S. 606, 617, 121 S. Ct. 2448, 2457 (2001) (citing <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 124, 98 S. Ct. at 2659); <em>see also Laurel Park Community, L.L.C. v. City of Tumwater, </em>698 F.3d 1180, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 22330 (9th Cir. Oct. 29, 2012) (No. 11-35466). Zoning regulations rarely amount to a taking of property on the ground that they affect some property owners more severely than others, \u201cbecause a landowner is not entitled to the highest and best use of [its] property.\u201d <em>Animas Valley Sand and Gravel, Inc. v. Bd. of Co. Comm\u2019rs of the Co. of La Plata, </em>38 P.3d 59, 65 (Colo. 2001) (citing Penn <em>Central, </em>438 U.S. at 125, 98 S. Ct. at 2659-60) (other citations omitted); <em>Laurel Park Community, </em>698 F.3d at 1188 (\u201cAs a general rule, zoning laws do not constitute a taking, even though they affect real property interests ...\u201d) (citing <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 125, 98 S. Ct. at 2659-60). <em>Palazzolo </em>makes clear that <em>Penn Central </em>requires an \u201cad hoc,\u201d fact-specific inquiry where the property retains economic value but, \u201cwhen its diminished economic value is considered in connection with other factors, the property effectively has been taken from its owner.\u201d <em>Animas Valley Sand and Gravel, </em>38 P.3d at 66. This ad hoc inquiry provides a safety valve \u201cto protect the landowner in the truly unusual <em>case.\u201d Animus Valley Sand and Gravel, </em>38 P.3d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b644 Our inquiry for purposes of this appeal is limited to whether HSG even may assert such a claim arising out of the impact of the zoning regulations on its real property interests. In <em>Kafka v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Fish, Wildife and Parks, </em>2008 MT 460, \u00b6 66, 348 Mont. 80, 201 P.3d 8, considering whether government action had constituted a taking of the appellant ranchers\u2019 land, fixtures and livestock, we held as a threshold matter that \u201c[t]here is no question that a person has a compensable property interest arising out of the ownership of such real and personal property.\u201d The County argues that, because HSG\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>mining permit is not virtually assured, <em>Seven Up Pete </em>also disposes of any claim arising from its ownership of real property. The County points out that, while the plaintiff in <em>Seven Up Pete </em>possessed only a leasehold interest, our holding that there was no viable constitutional claim of entitlement also applies in cases of fee title ownership, such as <em>Germann v. Stephens, </em>2006 MT 130, 332 Mont. 303, 137 P.3d 545 and <em>Roe v. City of Missoula, </em>2009 MT 417, 354 Mont. 1, 221 P.3d 1200. \u00b645 Neither <em>Seven UpPete, Germann, </em>nor <em>Roe, </em>however, evaluated the threshold inquiry whether a protected property interest arises from ownership of land. In each case, rather, we considered whether the plaintiff had a protected interest in an opportunity-to apply for a mining permit, <em>Seven Up Pete, </em>\u00b6 22; to obtain a liquor license in order to operate a casino and bar, <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-31; and to obtain an exemption from subdivision review, <em>Roe, </em>\u00b6 43. In all three cases, we rejected the claim that a lost opportunity to obtain a government permit or exemption amounted to a taking of a compensable property interest. Likewise, as discussed above, HSG is foreclosed from basing its takings claim on any alleged lost opportunity to mine its additional 310 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\">\u00b646 It is axiomatic, however, that the protections of \u201cprivate property\u201d under Article II, \u00a7 29 of the Montana Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution apply to real property owned in fee. <em>See e.g. Kafka, </em>\u00b6 33 (indicating that a constitutionally protected property interest exists where \u201cthe citizen had the rights to exclude, use, transfer, or dispose of the property\u201d) (quoting <em>Members of the Peanut Quota Holders Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. U.S., </em>421 F.3d 1323, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, HSG claims a compensable interest by virtue of its investment in 421 acres of real property located in District 43 and the impact of the zoning regulations on the value of that parcel of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b647 In <em>Kafka, </em>we recognized that a plaintiff may assert a takings claim, even if not entirely deprived of the established property interest. We stated that, \u201ceven when a compensable property interest still retains economic value, just compensation may be required if\u2018justice and fairness\u2019 require that economic injuries caused by public action be compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons.\u201d <em>Kafka, </em>\u00b6 69 (quoting <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 124, 98 S. Ct. at 2659) (internal quotation marks omitted). We recognized that \u201c[djetermining when such compensation is required is essentially an \u2018ad hoc, factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>inquiry,\u2019 based on the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Kafka, </em>\u00b6 69. In order to make this factual inquiry, we adopted the three factors provided by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Penn Central:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-3\">(1) the character of the governmental action; (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations; and (3) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><em>Kafka, </em>\u00b6 69 (citing <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 124, 98 S. Ct. at 2659). Each of these factors \u201caims to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from [its] domain.\u201d <em>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>544 U.S. 528, 539, 125 S. Ct. 2074, 2082 (2005). In <em>Palazzolo, </em>for example, the Court concluded that, although the plaintiffs waterfront parcel retained substantial economic value despite coastal wetlands regulations restricting use, \u201cthe claims under the <em>Penn Central </em>analysis were not examined, and for this purpose the case should be remanded.\u201d <em>Palazzolo, </em>533 U.S. at 632, 121 S. Ct. at 2465. We do the same here. On remand, the District Court must consider \u201cthe magnitude of the economic impact and \u2018the degree to which it interferes with legitimate property interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kafka, </em>\u00b6 71 (quoting <em>Lingle, </em>544 U.S. at 539, 125 S.

While I am not going to belabor the point, the County\u2019s adoption of District 43, here, was little more than illegal reverse spot zoning. The record demonstrates that District 43 was specifically designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>gerrymander HSG out of its ability to extend its mining operation onto its remaining property. The fact that this was accomplished as a result of a petition by other landowners (Part 1 zoning) is beside the point. The \u201czone\u201d was carefully crafted to deprive HSG of the further use of its property. I am not persuaded that, but for the creation of District 43, there was any real doubt that HSG would have been entitled to a further open cut mining permit for its other 311 acres. It is simply a bootstrap argument to say that the permit to further mine would not have been granted by DEQ because of the zoning. Moreover, District 43 was not adopted because of the Growth Policy. Rather, the zoning was put in place specifically to prevent HSG from mining sand and gravel on the remainder of its property. Illegal spot zoning does not become legal if there is something in the Growth Policy that might support it. And the County\u2019s rationale to that effect is simply smoke and mirrors. Indeed, District 43 was and is the poster child of NIMBY (not in my back yard) zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\">\u00b651 It strikes me that this is yet another example where a majority of citizens decide they do not like a particular business operation, although that operation is perfectly legal, and thus set out to restrict the business\u2019s operations through a \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d measure, but without any expectation of having to compensate the business owner. <em>Cf. Kafka v. Mont. Dept. of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks, </em>2008 MT 460, \u00b6\u00b6 96-248, 348 Mont. 80, 201 P.3d 8 (Nelson &amp; Rice, JJ., &amp; Swandal, <em>D.J., </em>dissenting). The constitutional guarantee \u201cthat private property shall not be taken for a public use without just compensation was designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 40, 49, 80 S. Ct. 1563, 1569 (1960). It seems to me this principle ought to apply to the residents of District 43. Accordingly, I am in agreement with the Court\u2019s decision to remand for takings proceedings. In this regard, I also join \u00b6\u00b6 55-57 of Justice Rice\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion. \u00b652 Finally, I continue to maintain that Montana\u2019s seeming lock-step reliance on federal takings jurisprudence is a mistake. Article II, Section 29 of Montana\u2019s Constitution sets forth this State\u2019s organic law on eminent domain. As I explained, in detail, in <em>Buhmann v. State, </em>2008 MT 465, 348 Mont. 205, 201 P.3d 70, Article II, Section 29, as a fundamental right, triggers the highest level of protection by Montana\u2019s courts, and our enforcement of this right must take into account other coordinate and overlapping guarantees in Montana\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Declaration of Rights. <em>Buhmann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 131-135 (Nelson, J., &amp; Swandal, D.J., dissenting). Moreover, the language of Montana\u2019s eminent domain provision is different than that of its federal counterpart in the Fifth Amendment. Article II, Section 29 guarantees just compensation to the full extent of the loss where private property has been \u201ctaken or damaged for public use.\u201d The problem is that this Court will continue to rely, lock-step, on federal takings jurisprudence until such time as Montana counsel begin to argue for the broader protections afforded under Article II, Section 29 in the trial courts and on appeal. There always has to be a first case.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">\u00b653 With the foregoing observations, I concur in part and dissent in part from the Court\u2019s decision and join \u00b6\u00b6 55-57 of Justice Rice\u2019s Concurrence and Dissent.</p>\n<author id=\"b171-4\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"ATB\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b654 I concur with the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue 1.1 also agree with the thrust of Justice Nelson\u2019s Concurrence/Dissent. I particularly agree with his conclusion that there was no \u201creal doubt that HSG would have been entitled to a further open cut mining permit,\u201d Concurrence/Dissent, \u00b6 50, and for that reason I would conclude that under this record HSG established a constitutionally protected property interest in. pursuing a permit and remand on that issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b655 This case differs significantly from <em>Seven Up Pete </em>in that HSG not only owns the gravel outright, but it has already obtained a permit and is currently mining. The Court scours the statutes for pockets of agency discretion to deny further permitting, Opinion, \u00b6 37, but in doing so the Court in my view over-emphasizes the theoretical basis for denying further permitting and under-emphasizes the factual reality that HSG has been previously successful in satisfying all of these concerns. We have never stated that the certainty of obtaining a permit must be absolute, but this decision pushes to that end. I cannot recall a case in the years of my tenure where the Court has approved a takings claim; all have been denied. A survey of the Court\u2019s jurisprudence reveals a seeming course to make takings claims more difficult to establish, to the point, as Justice Nelson explains, that legal business operations can be shuttered by the government \u201cwithout any expectation of having to compensate the business owner.\u201d Concurrence/Dissent, \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u00b656 We forget, I think, that the right of compensation for the loss of private property to public purpose is one of the Bill of Rights and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Declaration of Rights, just like any other civil right this Court is tasked with protecting. As a matter of basic civics, I find it hard to believe that, in a democracy formed upon the concept of private property rights, the government can prohibit a party from extracting gravel from the land it owns, which the party is already extracting under permit, and do so with no obligation to recompense the party for taking the value of this extractable property right out from beneath them. I believe many citizens would be surprised to learn this as well. \u00b657 It may be helpful to remember at this juncture that, ultimately, the citizens are the masters of the government, the courts, and the law. If, in their view, government is overstepping its bounds, and the law is deemed powerless by the courts to stop the transgression, the citizens can petition for their grievances, change the law, and curtail the government. As thorny as the takings issue may be, the Legislature is nonetheless empowered to legislate on the issue, and the citizens are empowered to propose direct initiatives, to provide greater protections against government action they deem to be excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\">\u00b658 I concur and dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
