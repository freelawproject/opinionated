We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\">\u00b62 Katherine Beehler-Goodson (\u201cKatherine\u201d) was the mother of minor children E.G. and R.G., the wife of Robert, and the sister of Tony. Prior to 2009, Katherine had suffered various back injuries. Katherine sought surgery in 2009 to address persistent pain resulting from these injuries. In preparation for surgery, Katherine saw Dr. Giuliano, a board certified radiologist associated with ERA, for a myelogram. A myelogram is a radiological procedure where a needle is used to inject dye into the sac surrounding the spine to help reveal the bones, nerves, and fluid filled spaces in an X-ray. As a radiological procedure, a myelogram consists of procedures, such as X-rays and the analysis thereof, which are not pertinent to this case. For our purposes, the only relevant portion of the myelogram consists of the infection control procedures taken preceding and surrounding the insertion of the myelogram needle into Katherine\u2019s spinal column and the subsequent injection of a dye into Katherine\u2019s cerebrospinal fluid (\u201cCSF\u201d). The further administration of radiological procedures is not at issue and was not raised by Plaintiffs at the District Court or on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b63 Dr. Giuliano performed the myelogram on Katherine on June 17, 2009, in a radiology suite at SVH. Dr. Giuliano did not wear a mask during the procedure, including while she prepared the needle and inserted it into Katherine\u2019s spinal column. Both parties agree Dr. Giuliano was the only person within the zone of oral droplet transmission surrounding Katherine during the critical portions of the myelogram. Following the procedure, Katherine was discharged without complication and returned to her hotel room to rest. Later that evening, Katherine developed a headache and nausea and returned to SVH, where she was admitted to the SVH Emergency Room and diagnosed with spinal meningitis. The time between the procedure and the diagnosis was roughly 12 hours. Spinal meningitis is a bacterial infection of the membranes (meninges) covering the spinal cord. Laboratory work determined that the bacteria that caused the infection were Group B Streptococci (\u201cGBS\u201d). The parties agree that the GBS bacteria were introduced into Katherine\u2019s CSF when the myelogram needle entered her spinal column. Katherine died as a result of the meningitis infection on June 20, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b64 Plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice claim against the Defendants on April 8, 2010, alleging, <em>inter </em>alia, that \u201cDefendants failed to adhere to proper infection control measures,\u201d thereby negligently causing Katherine\u2019s meningitis infection. In particular, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Plaintiffs alleged Dr. Giuliano negligently failed to wear a mask during the myelogram, causing Katherine\u2019s infection. Regarding SVH, Plaintiffs alleged that the hospital had a duty to promulgate infection control policies that specifically required wearing a mask during a myelogram. Plaintiffs claimed that SVH\u2019s failure to do so caused Katherine\u2019s infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b65 Following extensive discovery and briefing, Defendants filed motions <em>in limine </em>on August 19, 2011, attacking, <em>inter alia, </em>the qualifications of Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert witness, Dr. Patrick Joseph, MD, (\u201cDr. Joseph\u201d). The Defendants opposed Dr. Joseph\u2019s qualification as an expert witness on the appropriate standards of care, departure from those standards, and causation. Defendants sought to cast the subject matter of Plaintiffs\u2019 malpractice claim as specifically concerning myelograms performed by radiologists, not the infection prevention procedures taken surrounding the insertion of the needle into Katherine\u2019s spinal column. With regards to the relevant standards of care, Defendants essentially claimed that Dr. Joseph was not qualified to testify as an expert under \u00a7 26-2-601, MCA, because he is not a radiologist and does not perform myelograms. Regarding causation, Defendants argued that Dr. Joseph\u2019s testimony lacked a scientific basis and did not establish that it was more likely than not that the GBS bacteria traveled from Dr. Giuliano\u2019s uncovered mouth into Katherine\u2019s spinal column.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b66 Defendants concurrently filed motions for summary judgment on the standard of care and causation, alleging that if Plaintiffs\u2019 sole expert witness on the standard of care, breach, and causation was not qualified, judgment was appropriate as a matter of law. <em>See Montana Deaconess Hosp. v. Gratton, </em>169 Mont. 185, 189, 545 P.2d 670 (1976). The District Court held a hearing on Defendants\u2019 motions on September 22, 2011, and granted summary judgment on the standard of care and causation on October 11, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b67 In its summary judgment order, the court found that Dr. Joseph was not qualified to offer expert testimony on the applicable standards of care, breach, or causation. The court found that \u201cthe requisite qualifications for expert witnesses in medical malpractice cases are set forth in Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-2-601,\u201d and that because Dr. Joseph was not a board certified radiologist, he \u201ccannot give an opinion regarding Dr. Giuliano\u2019s duty based on board certified radiological standards.\u201d \u00b68 Respecting SVH, the court found that \u201c[t]he standards of care for a given specialty still control,\u201d and focused on Dr. Joseph\u2019s use of a 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) publication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>recommending masks during myelograms. The court found that because \u201cthe CDC does not impose requirements on healthcare providers,\u201d neither its recommendations nor Dr. Joseph\u2019s use of them could establish a hospital\u2019s standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\">\u00b69 As to Dr. Joseph\u2019s proposed opinion on causation, the court found that Dr. Joseph\u2019s testimony did not meet the necessary standard for expert medical opinion testimony. In so holding, the court applied M. R. Evid. 702 and our requirement that medical expert testimony be based upon a \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard. <em>See Dallas v. Burlington N. Inc., </em>212 Mont. 514, 523, 689 P.2d 273 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b610 Without Dr. Joseph\u2019s expert testimony, the court found Plaintiffs lacked the necessary expert witness to establish the elements of medical negligence,\u2019 making summary judgment for the Defendants appropriate as a matter of law. <em>See Seal v. Woodrows Pharm., </em>1999 MT 247, \u00b6 35, 296 Mont. 197, 988 P.2d 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b611 This appeal followed, and we held oral argument on August 1, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b612 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">\u00b613 1. Did the District Court err by excluding Dr. Joseph\u2019s expert testimony on Dr. Giuliano\u2019s and SVH\u2019s standard of care?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">\u00b614 2. Did the District Court err by excluding Dr. Joseph\u2019s expert testimony on causation?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">\u00b615 3. Did the District Court err by granting the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">\u00b616 4. Did the District Court err in granting costs for depositions?</p>\n<p id=\"AVq\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">\u00b617 A district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Wilmer, </em>2011 MT 78, \u00b6 11, 360 Mont. 101, 252 P.3d 178. This includes rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony. <em>Norris v. Fritz, </em>2012 MT 27, \u00b6 17, 364 Mont. 63, 270 P.3d 79. We do not simply determine whether this Court would have made the same ruling, but determine \u201cwhether the district court \u2018acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason\u2019 and prejudiced a substantial right of the appellant.\u201d <em>Weber v. BNSF Ry. Co., </em>2011 MT 233, \u00b6 39, 362 Mont. 53, 261 P.3d 984. A district court\u2019s application of a statute is reviewed to determine whether it was correct. <em>Blackmore v. Dunster, </em>2012 MT 74, \u00b6 6, 364 Mont. 384, 274 P.3d 748. We review summary judgment rulings de novo. <em>Estate of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Wilson v. Addison, </em>2011 MT 179, \u00b6 11, 361 Mont. 269, 258 P.3d 410 (citing <em>Goettel v. Estate of Ballard, </em>2010 MT 140, 356 Mont. 527, 234 P.3d 99). In the course of this analysis we apply the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria as the district court to determine \u201cwhether the moving party has established both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b6 18 Initially, \u201c[i]n order to survive a motion for summary judgment in a negligence action, the plaintiff must raise genuine issues of material fact with regard to a legal duty on the part of the defendant, breach of that duty, causation, and damages.\u201d <em>B.J. v. Shultz, </em>2009 MT 245, \u00b6 13, 351 Mont. 436, 214 P.3d 772 (citing <em>Butler v. Domin, </em>2000 MT 312, \u00b6 21, 302 Mont. 452, 15 P.3d 1189). With respect to medical malpractice claims in particular, the plaintiff must generally produce expert medical testimony establishing the applicable standard of care and a subsequent departure from that standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 21. We have repeatedly recognized that a plaintiffs failure to provide this expert testimony \u201cis fatal to the plaintiffs claim.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Moseley, </em>2010 MT 132, \u00b6 31, 356 Mont. 393, 234 P.3d 869 (citing <em>Montana Deaconess Hosp. v. Gratton, </em>169 Mont. 185, 189, 545 P.2d, 670, 672 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b619 Plaintiffs may not meet these requirements by offering CDC recommendations after their lone expert has been excluded. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that such CDC recommendations can set infection control standards of care, we require expert testimony to establish the standard of care and breach. <em>Griffin, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 21. Likewise, Plaintiffs may not establish genuine issues of material fact with an attorney\u2019s affidavit. M. R. Civ. P. 56(e); <em>Hiebert v. Cascade County, </em>2002 MT 233, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 311 Mont. 471, 56 P.3d 848; <em>Morales v. Tuomi, </em>214 Mont. 419, 424, 693 P.2d 532 (1985). As we have repeatedly found, Plaintiffs must present expert testimony to survive a motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, determining whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding Dr. Joseph\u2019s testimony will resolve this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b620 <em>1. Did the District Court err by excluding Dr. Joseph\u2019s expert </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>testimony on Defendants\u2019 standards of care?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\">\u00b621 <em>A. Is Dr. Joseph qualified to testify as an expert witness on Dr. Giuliano\u2019s standard of care under \u00a7 26-2-601, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b622 To support their claim that Defendants breached the applicable standard of care and caused Katherine\u2019s death, Plaintiffs sought to proffer the expert testimony of Dr. Joseph. Indeed, Dr. Joseph was the only expert Plaintiffs offered to establish the standard of care, breach, or causation. Dr. Joseph is not a radiologist, but he is board certified in Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Epidemiology, Medical Management, and Quality Assurance. Infection preventionists such as Dr. Joseph are specifically trained to prevent nosocomial (acquired in the hospital) infections. In this role, Dr. Joseph has investigated postmyelogram meningitis. Dr. Joseph is also the Chief of Infectious Disease for a physician \u2022 group, develops and reviews policies for preventing hospital-born infection as the Chair of a hospital Infection Control Committee, and performs procedures involving lumbar punctures, but not myelograms. Thus, Dr. Joseph has training and experience in the infection and infection control policies at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b623 Despite Dr. Joseph\u2019s evident qualifications in the field of infection prevention, the seeming subject of Plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim, the court excluded Dr. Joseph\u2019s testimony regarding Dr. Giuliano\u2019s standard of care based on its application of \u00a7 26-2-601, MCA. In particular, the court found that because Dr. Joseph was not a radiologist and had never performed a myelogram, he was not qualified under \u00a7 26-2-601, MCA, to testify on either the applicable standard of care or any departure from that standard. Section 26-2-601, MCA, enacted in 2005 and effective that year, established qualifications for medical malpractice expert witnesses. As a result, it must be considered in conjunction with a district court\u2019s admission of expert testimony pursuant to M. R. Evid. 702. Rule 702 requires that expert witnesses be qualified by way of \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\u201d M. R. Evid. 702. We have encouraged trial courts to \u201cconstrue liberally the rules of evidence so as to admit all relevant expert testimony\u201d when presented with scientific evidence. <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 328 Mont. 276, 119 P.3d 1194 (2005). This is done with the understanding that \u201c \u2018vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hulse v. DOJ, Motor Vehicle Div., </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 62, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75 (quoting <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 596, 113 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>2786 (1993)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b624 While we have not previously considered the effect of \u00a7 26-2-601, MCA, it adds to Rule 702\u2019s foundational requirements when courts consider medical malpractice experts, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">(1) A person may not testify as an expert witness on issues relating to negligence and standards of care and practice in an action on a malpractice claim, as defined in 27-6-103, for or against a health care provider, as defined in 27-6-103, unless the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">(a) is licensed as a health care provider in at least one state and routinely treats or has routinely treated within the previous 5 years the diagnosis or condition or provides the type of treatment that is the subject matter of the malpractice claim or is or was within the previous 5 years an instructor of students in an accredited health professional school or accredited residency or clinical research program relating to the diagnosis or condition or the type of treatment that is the subject matter of the malpractice claim; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">(b) shows by competent evidence that, as a result of education, training, knowledge, and experience in the evaluation, diagnosis, or treatment of the disease or injury that is the subject matter of the malpractice claim against the health care provider, the person is thoroughly familiar with the standards of care and practice as they related to the act or omission that is the subject matter of the malpractice claim on the date of the incident upon which the malpractice claim is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">(2) If the malpractice claim involves treatment that is recommended or provided by a physician as defined in 37-3-102, a person may not testify as an expert witness with respect to issues of negligence or standards of care and practice concerning the treatment unless the person is also a physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">(3) A person qualified as an expert in one medical specialty or subspecialty is not qualified to testify with respect to a malpractice claim against a health care provider in another medical specialty or subspecialty unless there is a showing that the standards of care and practice in the two specialty or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>subspecialty fields are substantially similar. This subsection (3) does not apply if the subject matter of the malpractice claim against the health care provider is unrelated to the relevant specialty or subspecialty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-3\">Section 26-2-601, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b625 Here, the court applied \u00a7 26-2-601, MCA, to exclude Dr. Joseph\u2019s testimony, determining that because he was not a radiologist, he could not testify on Dr. Giuliano\u2019s standard of care. However, Defendants and the court too narrowly conceived the subject matter of Plaintiffs\u2019 claim and, as a result, incorrectly excluded Dr. Joseph\u2019s testimony. When the specifics of Dr. Joseph\u2019s deposition and experience are applied to the requirements of \u00a7 26-2-601, MCA, and the subject of Plaintiffs\u2019 claim, it is clear that Dr. Joseph qualifies as an expert. Specifically, Dr. Joseph is licensed to practice in California, treats bacterial meningitis, and provides the type of treatment at issue, infection prevention during a myelogram, satisfying Subsection 1(a). Moreover, Dr. Joseph is board certified in infection prevention, investigates and treats nosocomial infections, has investigated postmyelogram meningitis infections, and has developed infection control procedures that require radiologists to wear masks during myelograms. Recognizing that the wearing of a mask during the myelogram is the \u201cact or omission that is the subject matter of the malpractice claim,\u201d it is clear that Dr. Joseph satisfied Subsection 1(b). Similarly, as Dr. Joseph is a physician testifying about a physician, he satisfied Subsection 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b626 Subsection 3 forbids one medical specialty testifying against another without a showing that the standards of care in the relevant specialties are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d or that the claim\u2019s subject matter is unrelated to radiology. Here, Plaintiffs contest an infection prevention procedure that, according to Dr. Joseph, does not involve technical details particular to either radiology or myelograms. As Dr. Joseph testified, wearing a mask during a myelogram is among those infection control procedures, such as room cleaning, hand washing, wearing appropriate surgical attire, and draping, that are \u201csimilar for other invasive procedures.\u201d Dr. Joseph further testified that wearing a mask applies \u201canytime something was injected into the spinal cord.\u201d Based on this testimony, it is evident that the infection control procedure at issue is not unique to radiology, and logically applies to other medical specialties.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b627  Since the Plaintiffs allege that Katherine\u2019s injuries were caused by Dr. Giuliano\u2019s failure to adhere to proper infection control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>procedures during injection of fluid into Katherine\u2019s spinal cord, there is an intersection between the specialties of infection prevention and radiology that arises in this case. Dr. Joseph has sufficient expertise concerning the subject matter of Plaintiffs claim and the medical procedure before the court to qualify as an expert witness under \u00a7 26-2-601, MCA. Dr. Joseph demonstrated that infection prevention is not unique to any medical specialty and that he had experience in promulgating infection control standards that applied to radiologists and myelograms. From our review of Dr. Joseph\u2019s deposition, it is clear that the applicable standards of care in infection prevention and radiology, at least with regards to myelograms, are substantially similar, satisfying \u00a7 26-2-601(3), MCA. Thus, \u00a7 26-2-601, MCA, does not prevent Dr. Joseph\u2019s testimony on Dr. Giuliano\u2019s standard of care. The court\u2019s holding to the contrary was an incorrect application of the statute and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b628 <em>B. Is Dr. Joseph qualified to testify as an expert on SVH\u2019s standard of care under \u00a7 26-2-601, MCA?</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b629 The court excluded Dr. Joseph\u2019s testimony on SVH\u2019s standard of care, focusing on Plaintiffs\u2019 use of both CDC recommendations and the testimony of Dr. William Rutala, MD, an infectious disease expert retained by Defendants. The court took Dr. Rutala\u2019s testimony to indicate that because the CDC recommendations did not set the standard for SVH, \u201cSVH had no duty to require Dr. Giuliano to wear a mask during a myelogram.\u201d The court also found that radiology standards of care were not \u201cusurped or controlled\u201d by SVH\u2019s own policies on infection control, but that \u201cthe standards of care for a given specialty still control.\u201d On appeal, SVH primarily argues that Dr. Joseph was not qualified to testify on the hospital\u2019s standard of care because he is not a radiologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b630 Again, both the court and SVH misconstrue the subject matter of Plaintiffs\u2019 claim against SVH. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges that \u201cDefendants failed to adhere to proper infection control measures\u201d in violation of the required standards of care. SVH correctly points out that it is not vicariously liable for any negligence by Dr. Giuliano. <em>See </em>Section 28-10-103, <em>MCA; Estates of Milliron v. Francke, </em>243 Mont. 200, 204, 793 P.2d 824, 827 (1990). SVH argues that, given the theory of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 case, \u201cwithout an underlying breach by the radiologist, there can be no breach by the hospital[.]\u201d Even under SVH\u2019s theory, however, it does not necessarily follow that only a radiologist may opine on hospital-wide infection control policies. Dr. Joseph testified that \u201cit\u2019s the role of the hospital to be sure that physicians practice appropriate infection control\u201d and that the hospital\u2019s infection preventionist \u201chas the obligation to investigate something that is being done which is against the recommendations of the CDC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\">\u00b631 Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Joseph is qualified to testify on the hospital\u2019s standard of care by virtue of his training and experience as the Chair of various hospital Infection Control Committees. We agree. Dr. Joseph has a degree in medical management, is board certified in infectious diseases, and has developed hospital infection control policies for invasive procedures in radiology, meetingthe requirements of \u00a7 26-2-601(l)-(2), MCA. Dr. Joseph satisfies \u00a7 26-2-601(3), MCA, due to his qualification in hospital infection prevention, the focus of Plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Indeed, Dr. Joseph opined that according to his experience and training, \u201cevery hospital should have an infection-control procedure that discusses room cleaning, hospitals should have an infection-control procedure that discusses wearing a mask, appropriate patient draping and how conduct should be done in a myelogram room.\u201d He further stated that such policies must be written and that the hospital must engage in some form of education. Dr. Joseph testified that these policies required wearing masks during myelograms in 2009 and that he had not seen a policy at SVH that applied in 2009 and met these standards. It is unclear who, if not Dr. Joseph, could qualify to testify on SVH\u2019s standard of care. He has training in infection prevention and has worked for over two decades in the specialty that forms the basis of Plaintiffs\u2019 claim against SVH. His experience and testimony directly apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 claim against SVH.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b632  Dr. Joseph was trained and works in infection control. Plaintiffs claim SVH was negligent in promulgating insufficient infection control policies. By its own terms, SVH\u2019s infection control program from 2009, which Dr. Joseph reviewed, applies to \u201cconsulting staff from all disciplines of the hospital\u201d and patients \u201cseeking services provided in all SVH facilities.\u201d According to the SVH infection plan for 2009, the hospital\u2019s Infection Preventionists had \u201cthe authority to initiate any appropriate Infection Prevention &amp; Control Program or studies when it is identified there may be a danger to patients or personnel.\u201d Dr. Joseph\u2019s testimony directly contests the adequacy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>this program. The court\u2019s exclusion of this testimony was an abuse of discretion and an incorrect application of \u00a7 26-2-601, MCA. An infection preventionist is surely qualified to testify on the adequacy of infection prevention policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b633 <em>2. Did the District Court err by excluding Dr. Joseph\u2019s expert medical opinion regarding causation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b634 Plaintiffs sought to qualify Dr. Joseph as an expert under M. R. Evid. 702 to establish causation. Dr. Joseph testified that Dr. Giuliano\u2019s failure to wear a mask and SVH\u2019s failure to establish policies requiring masks during myelograms caused Katherine\u2019s death. The court determined that Dr. Joseph\u2019s causation opinion was \u201cbased upon conjecture,\u201d was \u201cspeculative in nature,\u201d and \u201c[did] not meet the \u2018more likely than not\u2019 standard.\u201d The court specifically faulted the lack of literature on post-myelogram meningitis caused by GBS, the lack of cases involving oral transmission of GBS, and the \u201c90-95 percent chance that Dr. Giuliano was not colonized with GBS in her pharynx.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendants largely echo these claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b635 M. R. Evid. 702 permits expert testimony \u201c[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue....\u201d M.

Once so qualified, the expert \u201cmay testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,\u201d M. R. Evid. 702, and medical opinions must be based on the probability that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d the alleged breach caused the injury. <em>Addison, </em>\u00b6 19. Additionally, \u201c[i]n Montana, an expert's reliability is tested in three ways under Rule 702, M. R. Evid.: (1) whether the expert field is reliable, (2) whether the expert is qualified, and (3) whether the qualified expert reliably applied the reliable field to the facts.\u201d <em>Harris v. Hanson, </em>2009 MT 13, \u00b6 36, 349 Mont. 29, 201 P.3d 151. The last question is for the finder of fact. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b636 Here, Dr. Joseph is board certified in infectious diseases and epidemiology. These are recognized fields of scientific study and Dr. Joseph\u2019s board certifications qualify him as an expert. Dr. Joseph expressed the opinion that Dr. Giuliano\u2019s failure to wear a mask was the \u201cmost likely\u201d cause of Katherine\u2019s meningitis. Specifically, Dr. Joseph testified that Dr. Giuliano\u2019s throat was the most likely source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>of the GBS bacteria, and that the failure to wear a mask allowed the GBS to travel from Dr. Giuliano\u2019s throat to Katherine\u2019s CSF when the needle was inserted into her spinal column. Dr. Joseph based this opinion on his decades of experience in infection prevention and epidemiology, his analysis of cases involving post-myelogram meningitis, and the specific circumstances of Katherine\u2019s infection. However, the court seemed to take issue with Dr. Joseph\u2019s use of what it regarded as suspect terminology. In particular, the court cited Dr. Joseph\u2019s statements that GBS meningitis following a myelogram is \u201crare times rare,\u201d that science can only \u201cspeculate\u201d as to how, exactly, a bacterium travels from the oral pharynx into the CSF, and his use of \u201csuspicion\u201d while discussing how the GBS bacteria entered Katherine\u2019s CSF. Based on these statements, the court concluded that Dr. Joseph\u2019s testimony on causation failed to meet the requirements of M. R. Evid. 702 and was not based on a \u201creasonable medical certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\">\u00b637 Regarding Dr. Joseph\u2019s word choice, we must not let scrutiny of an expert\u2019s phrasing cloud the substantive appraisal of their testimony. <em>Ford v. Sentry Cas. Co., </em>2012 MT 156, \u00b6 42, 365 Mont. 405, 282 P.3d 687. It is well-noted that doctors are not lawyers and imposing strict legal terminology requirements improperly places form over substance. We have previously found that \u201cthe probative force of the opinion \u2018is not to be defeated by semantics if it is reasonably apparent that the doctor intends to signify a probability supported by some rational basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 42 (quoting <em>Miller v. Natl. Cabinet Co., </em>8 N.Y.2d 277, 168 N.E.2d 811, 813, 204 N.Y.S.2d 129 (1960)). Dr. Joseph\u2019s use of \u201cspeculate\u201d or \u201csuspicion\u201d does not defeat the probative value of his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b638 Recognizing this focus on substantive reliability, it is apparent that Dr. Joseph\u2019s opinion on causation, while not phrased in precise legal terms, met the more likely than not standard. Dr. Joseph clearly stated that he believed it was \u201cmost likely,\u201d a statement of probability, that Dr. Giuliano was the source of the GBS and that the failure to wear a mask was the cause of Katherine\u2019s meningitis. Indeed, when asked whether the GBS \u201chad to have come from another person,\u201d Dr. Joseph stated, \u201c[m]ore likely than not it came from another person.\u201d When commenting specifically, Dr. Joseph identified oral flora exiting Dr. Giuliano\u2019s uncovered mouth as \u201cthe most likely\u201d source of the infection. To form these opinions, Dr. Joseph compared the probable sources of GBS infection in the SVH radiological suite on June 17, 2009, including Katherine\u2019s skin and Dr. Giuliano\u2019s mouth. He applied case studies linking post-myelogram meningitis to the treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>radiologists\u2019 oral flora, identified radiologists\u2019 uncovered mouths as the most likely source of post-myelogram infections, and testified that \u201cnumerous publications\u201d had shown that masks generally reduced \u201crespiratory shedding\u201d of bacteria from the oral cavity. Dr. Joseph also testified that Katherine\u2019s skin was an unlikely source of GBS considering the rapid onset of the meningitis and the course of antibiotics that Katherine had taken prior to the procedure. Applying his training and experience to these facts, Dr. Joseph gave an expert opinion that Dr. Giuliano\u2019s failure to wear a mask \u201cmost likely\u201d caused Katherine\u2019s meningitis. Whether Dr. Joseph \u201cgathered and examined sufficient facts, and correctly applied the facts to reach his opinions, was a question for the jury to decide after cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and application of the law.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b639  From the foregoing, we conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to find that Dr. Joseph\u2019s opinion was inadmissible under M. R. Evid. 702 and our <em>Dallas </em>progeny. Moreover, despite Defendants\u2019 claims to the contrary, Plaintiffs are not required to trace the precise path of the infecting GBS bacterium from Dr. Giuliano\u2019s mouth into Katherine\u2019s CSF to satisfy the more likely than not standard. We require experts to opine on probability, and this standard does not require the level of exactitude that Defendants claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b640 This analysis comports with our holding in <em>Butler. </em>In <em>Butler, </em>we upheld the District Court\u2019s exclusion of a medical expert\u2019s testimony that one doctor\u2019s epidural injection, when weighed against a second injection, \u201ccould have\u201d caused the plaintiffs infection. <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 15. There, the expert indicated that it was a <em>possibility </em>that the other injection could have caused the infection. <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 15. When presented with the only two viable options, the expert equivocated, and we held that this did not meet the required \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard. <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>see also Hinkle ex rel. Hinkle v. Shepherd Sch. Dist. </em># <em>37, </em>2004 MT 175, \u00b6 38, 322 Mont. 80, 93 P.3d 1239. Here, in contrast, when Dr. Joseph was presented with the two possible sources of infection, Katherine\u2019s skin and Dr. Giuliano\u2019s oral pharynx, Dr. Joseph stated it was \u201cmost likely,\u201d based on the available scientific literature, that the infection came from Dr. Giuliano and that \u201cin my opinion I don\u2019t see a more likely source for this bacteria.\u201d If, in Dr. Joseph\u2019s opinion, no other possible source is more likely and Dr. Giuliano is the most likely, this surely meets our \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"AMQ\">\u00b641 <em>3. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u00b642 Because we conclude that the court abused its discretion by excluding Dr. Joseph\u2019s testimony on the applicable standards of care and causation, we therefore must vacate the orders of summary judgment in favor of both Dr. Giuliano and Saint Vincent\u2019s Hospital. <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\">\u00b643 <em>4.
