The Fund also appeals an order requiring it to pay damages. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u00b62 The Fund raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court properly determine that Elk Mountain was entitled to summary judgment on the question of whether the Fund had breached the payment plan agreement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court properly determine that Elk Mountain could receive consequential damages for the Fund\u2019s breach of contract?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court properly deny the Fund\u2019s motion for post-trial relief?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court properly calculate damages?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">\u00b67 Elk Mountain cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s decision to deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Elk Mountain\u2019s damage claim for ten years of lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b68 Elk Mountain operates an automobile and motor sports dealership in Helena, Montana. Elk Mountain sells used cars and serves as an Arctic Cat dealership. Bob McWilliams (McWilliams) owns Elk Mountain. Elk Mountain previously employed Timothy Wilson (Wilson). Wilson injured himself on January 8,2004, while working for Elk Mountain. Elk Mountain had failed to retain current worker\u2019s compensation insurance at the time of Wilson\u2019s accident. Wilson accordingly filed a claim with the Fund. The Fund accepted Wilson\u2019s claim due to Elk Mountain\u2019s failure to retain worker\u2019s compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b69 The Fund ultimately sought indemnity from Elk Mountain for Wilson\u2019s damages. The Fund struggled, however, to obtain payment from Elk Mountain. The Fund issued liens on Elk Mountain\u2019s bank account and eventually assigned to collection its claims against Elk Mountain.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b610 The Fund pulled back Elk Mountain\u2019s account from collection after the parties agreed to an interim payment plan in 2009. The Fund proposed via letter that Elk Mountain pay the Fund $1,034 by the 15th of every month. Additionally, the Fund proposed Elk Mountain make a one-time payment of $3,534. The Fund proposed that this agreement would remain in place until Elk Mountain and the Fund reached a settlement. The proposal specified that the Fund retained the right to send Elk Mountain to collection if Elk Mountain failed to make payment by the 15th, or if the parties failed to attain settlement. Elk Mountain agreed to these terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u00b611 The parties abided by this agreement until the Fund sent Elk Mountain a letter in May 2010 that proposed an alternative payment arrangement. Elk Mountain rejected the new proposal. The Fund immediately informed Elk Mountain that it would be turning its claims against Elk Mountain over to collection. The Fund asserted that it could send Elk Mountain to collection under the agreement in light of Elk Mountain having made four late payments. The Fund further claimed that Elk Mountain made no effort to pursue settlement with the Fund as dictated by the payment plan agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u00b6 12 The Fund followed through on its threat by turning Elk Mountain over to collection in July 2010. Elk Mountain responded by suing the Fund for breach of contract. The parties filed cross-motions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>summary judgment on the breach of contract claim. The Court ultimately granted Elk Mountain\u2019s summary judgment motion on the issue of whether the Fund had breached the repayment agreement. The parties proceeded to a bench trial to determine Elk Mountain\u2019s damages in May 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">\u00b613 Elk Mountain contended at trial that the Fund\u2019s actions cost Elk Mountain substantial profits. Elk Mountain used floor plan financing (known as \u201cflooring\u201d) to conduct its business. Elk Mountain borrows money pursuant to its flooring plan to purchase inventory. Elk Mountain repays that borrowed money from sale of the purchased inventory after it has sold the inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b614 Elk Mountain sought an SBA loan for this floor plan financing. Elk Mountain intended to process the SBA loan through First Community Bank. First Community Bank declined to process Elk Mountain\u2019s SBA application, however, once it received the Fund\u2019s letter advising First Community Bank that it had referred to collection Elk Mountain\u2019s debt. Elk Mountain could not pay for its current inventory without financing through its flooring plan. Elk Mountain returned merchandise to Arctic Cat for a re-stocking fee of $3,503.15. These returns left Elk Mountain with no merchandise to sell and with no option to finance the purchases of new merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b615 Elk Mountain successfully re-applied for the SBA loan after the District Court\u2019s summary judgment ruling. The SBA required Elk Mountain to pay a $29,750 origination fee, however, before the SBA would provide financing. This SBA loan allowed Elk Mountain to obtain new merchandise to sell. Elk Mountain estimated that it lost $71,422 in profits after the Fund sent Elk Mountain to collection and before Elk Mountain finally received its SBA loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b616 Elk Mountain also produced evidence at trial that Elk Mountain soon would lose its Arctic Cat dealership due to the Fund\u2019s actions. Elk Mountain\u2019s reduced sales strained its relationship with Arctic Cat. Arctic Cat informed Elk Mountain in May 2011 that it would terminate their dealership agreement. Arctic Cat instructed Elk Mountain to sell its remaining Arctic Cat inventory by June 11, 2011. Elk Mountain valued this remaining inventory at $94,074. McWilliams testified that he possessed little confidence that he could sell most of this inventory in such a limited time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u00b617 The District Court awarded damages to Elk Mountain in the amount of $198,749. The damages awarded largely centered on the District Court\u2019s implicit conclusion that the Fund\u2019s actions had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>interfered with Elk Mountain\u2019s ability to obtain financing. These issues, in turn, hurt Elk Mountain\u2019s sales. The court awarded $29,750 for the origination fee required by the SBA, $94,074 for Arctic Cat\u2019s unsold inventory, $3,503 for the re-stocking fee that Elk Mountain had incurred when it returned Arctic Cat\u2019s merchandise, and $71,422 for lost profits from May 2010 through April 2011-the time period in which Elk Mountain proved unable to secure financing. The District Court declined to award Elk Mountain for ten years of lost profits, however, due to its alleged loss of its Arctic Cat dealership. The District Court determined that Elk Mountain likely would replace Arctic Cat profits by selling greater numbers of used vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\">\u00b618 The Fund sought post-trial relief from this judgment. It alleged that the District Court had based its decision on the mistake or misrepresentation that Elk Mountain would lose its Arctic Cat dealership as of June 2011. In fact, Elk Mountain remained an Arctic Cat dealer at the time that the Court issued its judgment in October 2011. The Fund also argued that the judgment should be set aside due to surprise. It contended that Elk Mountain never had alleged or disclosed that it would seek lost sales as part of its damage claim. The Fund became aware of their alleged damages only at trial. The District Court denied the Fund\u2019s motion. The Fund appeals and Elk Mountain cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b619 This Court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment applying the same criteria as the district court pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Smith v. Burlington N. </em>R.R., 2008 MT 225, \u00b6 10, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639. We also review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6 18, 336 Mont. 105, 152 P.3d 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b620 We review the factual findings of a district court sitting without a jury to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Steiger v. Brown, </em>2007 MT 29, \u00b6 16, 336 Mont. 29, 152 P.3d 705. A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the district court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Steiger, </em>\u00b6 16. We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings. <em>Steiger, </em>\u00b6 16. We review for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Steiger, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b621 <em>Did the District Court properly determine that Elk Mountain was entitled to summary judgment on the question of whether the Fund had breached the payment plan agreement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b622 The Fund argues that Elk Mountain-not the Fund-breached the party\u2019s repayment agreement. The Fund notes that the agreement required the parties to reach a settlement. The Fund argues that Elk Mountain violated this requirement by refusing to turn over certain financial information. The Fund claims that Elk Mountain\u2019s failure to provide this information constituted a material breach. The Fund contends that it reacted appropriately to this breach by referring to collection its claim against Elk Mountain. The Fund points to no language in the contract that obligated Elk Mountain to make a financial disclosure. The Fund instead argues the requirement that Elk Mountain turn over its financial information constituted an incidental obligation to the contractual requirement that the parties reach settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b623 A contractual provision contains an incidental obligation only when the incidental obligation proves reasonably necessary to a party\u2019s performance of an express obligation. Section 28-3-702, MCA. The Fund has failed to allege, let alone demonstrate, the need for Elk Mountain to provide a financial disclosure in order to allow the parties to reach a settlement. The Fund\u2019s failure to make this allegation proves fatal to its contention that Elk Mountain possessed an incidental obligation to disclose its financial information to the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"ADC\">\u00b624 The Fund alternatively argues that it properly exercised its rights under the contract. The Fund contends that the agreement allowed the Fund to send Elk Mountain to collection if Elk Mountain failed to pay by the 15th of any month. The Fund contends that Elk Mountain made four late payments during the period in which the agreement was in place. The Fund contends that these late payments allowed it to send Elk Mountain back to collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u00b625 The Fund offers no response, though, to the District Court\u2019s determination that the Fund had waived its right to terminate the agreement based on late payment. Indeed, the Fund continually accepted these late payments. Violation of the express terms of a contract, including default in payment, vests the non-breaching party with certain rights. <em>Suburban Homes Co. v. North, </em>50 Mont. 108, 117-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>18, 145 P. 2, 5 (1914). The non-breaching party may waive these vested rights, however, through its actions, or more appropriately, its inaction. <em>Suburban Homes, </em>50 Mont. at 117-18, 145 P. 2 at 5. We previously held that a non-breaching party\u2019s acceptance of a payment on a contract after the non-breaching party has declared, or attempted to declare, a default \u201cconstitutes a waiver of the default.\u201d <em>Ahrens v. Cottle, </em>271 Mont. 339, 343, 896 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1995). This waiver denies to the non-breaching party the right of the non-breaching party under the contract \u201cto sue for acceleration.\u201d <em>Ahrens, </em>271 Mont. at 343, 896 P.2d at 1129. <em>See also Pipe Indus. Ins. Fund Trust of Loc. 41 v. Consol. Pipe Trades Trust, </em>233 Mont. 162, 171-73, 760 P.2d 711, 717-18 (1988) (affirming propriety of jury instruction on waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\">\u00b626  The Fund took no steps to refer to collection its claim against Elk Mountain after each late payment. The Fund only referred to collection its claim against Elk Mountain more than three months after Elk Mountain had made its last late payment. The Fund\u2019s repeated acceptance of late payments, in effect, communicated to Elk Mountain that it would accept these late payments rather than refer to collection its claim against Elk Mountain. The Fund never objected to Elk Mountain\u2019s late payments under the payment plan agreement until after Elk Mountain had rejected The Fund\u2019s proposal. The Fund accordingly waived its right to terminate the contract based on late payment. <em>Ahrens, </em>271 Mont. at 343, 896 P.2d at 1129-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b627 <em>Did the District Court properly determine that Elk Mountain could receive consequential damages for the Fund\u2019s breach of contradi</em></p>\n<p id=\"AaD\">\u00b628 Section 27-1-311, MCA, provides, in part, that the measure of damages for breach of contract \u201cis the amount which will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment which was proximately caused thereby or in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.\u201d <em>See also Weyler v. Kaufman, </em>196 Mont. 132, 137, 638 P.2d 393, 396 (1981). The District Court found that the facts presented at trial satisfied this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b629 The District Court awarded Elk Mountain damages related to Elk Mountain\u2019s inability to receive financing and Elk Mountain\u2019s increased cost of financing as reflected by the origination fee. Correspondingly, the court awarded Elk Mountain lost profits due to its inability to maintain inventory due to this lack of financing. The Fund argues that no evidence supports the District Court\u2019s determination that the Fund\u2019s breach caused Elk Mountain damages related to financing. The Fund entirely ignores, however, the testimony of Russ Noonan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>(Noonan).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\">\u00b630 Noonan serves as vice president and commercial loan officer for First Community Bank. Noonan has been Elk Mountain\u2019s banker since 2005. Noonan testified that the Fund\u2019s levies against Elk Mountain\u2019s account prevented his bank from providing floor financing to Elk Mountain. Noonan further testified that First Community Bank would have submitted Elk Mountain\u2019s SBA loan for approval but for the Fund\u2019s actions. The SBA loan stood no chance of approval once the Fund sent Elk Mountain to collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b631 The Fund similarly contends that no evidence supports the District Court\u2019s determination that the Fund\u2019s breach forced Elk Mountain to return product to Arctic Cat. Elk Mountain offered testimony, however, that established a causal link between the Fund\u2019s conduct and Elk Mountain\u2019s returning the Arctic Cat merchandise. McWilliams testified that Elk Mountain\u2019s lack of funding prevented it from receiving any new products from Arctic Cat. Elk Mountain also provided evidence that the Fund\u2019s conduct caused it to lose financing through First Community Bank, the SBA, or any other sources. This testimony provides sufficient proof of causation to support the District Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b632  Finally, the Fund contends that it could not have foreseen that referring to collection its claim against Elk Mountain would cause financing issues for Elk Mountain and the various consequences that would arise from the loss of financing. The Fund should have foreseen that referring to collection a claim against a business could create difficulties in obtaining financing for the business. Likewise, the Fund should have known that a business\u2019s inability to receive financing could cause substantial barriers. Beyond the obvious, though, Elk Mountain warned the Fund that retendering the debt would devastate Elk Mountain\u2019s business. McWilliams testified that Elk Mountain informed the Fund on multiple occasions that referring to collection its claim against Elk Mountain would cause irreparable harm to Elk Mountain\u2019s ability to do business. The Fund offered no evidence to contradict McWilliams\u2019s testimony. The District Court accordingly relied upon this credible evidence to award the consequential damages to Elk Mountain.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u00b633 <em>Did the District Court properly deny the Fund\u2019s motion for post-trial relief?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b634 The Fund contends that the District Court improperly denied the Fund\u2019s motion for post-trial relief. The Fund argues two legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>rationales supported its motion to set aside the judgment. The Fund first contends that the court should have set aside the judgment due to surprise. M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1). The Fund alleges that it had no notice that Elk Mountain intended to advocate for consequential damages. The Fund argues that Elk Mountain failed to plead such damages in its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\">f 35 The Fund cites to <em>CenTech Corp. v. Sprow, </em>2006 MT 27, 331 Mont. 98, 128 P.3d 1036, to support its position that a party cannot receive damages that it failed to plead. The Fund failed, however, to preserve this issue for appeal. It offered no objection to Elk Mountain\u2019s introduction of evidence in support of its claim for consequential damages. A party who fails to object to an issue at trial waives the right to do so on appeal. <em>Neal v. Nelson, </em>2008 MT 426, \u00b6 29, 347 Mont. 431, 198 P.3d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b636 The Fund also argues that the District Court should have set aside the judgment due to a mistake of fact. M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1). Elk Mountain alleged at trial that it soon would lose its Arctic Cat dealership due to its inability to maintain steady inventory because of its struggle to obtain financing. Arctic Cat had instructed Elk Mountain to wind down its Arctic Cat dealership by June 11, 2011-approximately one month after the bench trial. Elk Mountain ultimately did not lose its dealership. The Fund discovered this fact upon realizing that, in October 2011, Elk Mountain continued to advertise itself as an Arctic Cat dealer. Elk Mountain had in fact not lost its dealership. The Fund argues that, in light of Elk Mountain\u2019s ability to maintain its Arctic Cat dealership, the District Court should have set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b637 A mistake generally means that the mistaken fact existed at the time of trial, and that the parties misapprehended the information before them. <em>Kruzich v. Old Republic Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 205, \u00b6\u00b6 23-27, 188 P.3d 983, 344 Mont. 126. Mistake does not mean a fact that changes due to future events. <em>Kruzich, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-27. Indeed, parties routinely seek to establish facts that may, or may not, later turn out to be true. Arctic Cat had advised Elk Mountain before the trial to wind down its dealership by June 11, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b638  Parties rely on the best available information at the time that they try the case to prove whether an uncertain outcome is more likely than not to be true in the future. Accordingly, a decision to allow a judgment to be overturned simply because facts eventually turn out differently than a jury, or court, determined could cause a never-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ending cycle of re-litigated issues. <em>Cf. Kruzich, </em>\u00b6 20. Elk Mountain\u2019s ability to retain its Arctic Cat dealership, therefore, does not constitute a mistake that would warrant a new trial. Moreover, the fact that the court declined to award any sums for Elk Mountain\u2019s future lost profits occasioned by the loss of Elk Mountain\u2019s Arctic Cat dealership eliminates any need to set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\">\u00b639 <em>Did the District Court properly calculate damages?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b640 The Fund contends that the District Court awarded gross damages rather than net damages. The Fund failed to object to Elk Mountain\u2019s exhibits that contained these claims for gross damages rather than net damages. Once again the Fund has failed to preserve properly this issue. <em>In re Est. of Schueren, </em>162 Mont. 417, 427, 512 P.2d 1283, 1288 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b641 The Fund also argues that the District Court should have offset any damages that it awarded to Elk Mountain due to Elk Mountain\u2019s duty to mitigate damages. <em>Bronken\u2019s Good Time Co. v. J.W. Brown &amp; Assocs., </em>203 Mont. 427, 432, 661 P.2d 861, 864 (1983). The Fund contends that Elk Mountain took no steps to mitigate its damages. In particular, the Fund argues that Elk Mountain could have sold its remaining inventory to other Arctic Cat dealers. The Fund argues that these potential sales to other Arctic Cat dealers would have reduced the amount of unsold inventory that Elk Mountain would have needed to return when it thought that it would lose its Arctic Cat dealership. It argues that the Court should have offset any damages awarded to Elk Mountain by what Elk Mountain could have received by selling this inventory to other Arctic Cat dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b642  Elk Mountain apparently attempted, to no avail, to sell other dealers this merchandise. McWilliams testified that he had contacted at least three other Arctic Cat dealers about purchasing his inventory. McWilliams testified these other dealers, however, had no interest in Elk Mountain\u2019s inventory. This evidence supports the District Court\u2019s determination that Elk Mountain had fulfilled its duty to mitigate damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b643 <em>Cross-appeal: Did the District Court properly deny Elk Mountain\u2019s damage claim for ten years of lost profits ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u00b644 Elk Mountain alleges that the court failed to award it all the damages that it incurred due to the Fund\u2019s breach of the repayment agreement. Elk Mountain claims that the District Court should have awarded future lost profits that stemmed from Elk Mountain\u2019s loss of its Arctic Cat dealership. Elk Mountain contends that it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>earned profits of $1.3 million over ten years with its Arctic Cat dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\">\u00b645 A court may award future damages, however, only if those future damages are reasonably certain to occur. Section 27-1-203, MCA. The District Court determined that Elk Mountain was not reasonably certain to incur lost profits. The court noted that Elk Mountain likely would make up any lost Arctic Cat sales by selling more used vehicles. The court further determined that Elk Mountain likely would regain its Arctic Cat dealership. The fact that Elk Mountain retained its Arctic Cat dealership indeed reflects the lack of certainty regarding Elk Mountain\u2019s claim for future lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b646 Elk Mountain also contends that the District Court failed to award various bank fees. Elk Mountain claims that it had to maintain a low bank balance to prevent levies from the Fund. The District Court determined that these bank fees arose from Elk Mountain\u2019s account management-rather than from the Fund\u2019s breach of the repayment agreement. Substantial credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s factual determination. <em>Steiger, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b647 Finally, Elk Mountain contends that the District Court failed to award damages related to lost vehicle sales. Elk Mountain argues that the Fund\u2019s breach of the repayment agreement hurt its ability to obtain floor financing for used vehicles, such as ATVs. This lack of floor financing, in turn, hurt Elk Mountain\u2019s ability to obtain, and thereby, sell inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b648  The District Court determined that Elk Mountain had other means to obtain financing for the used vehicles. McWilliams conceded that Elk Mountain could have received financing from various entities who did not offer financing for ATVs, including Arctic Cat snowmobiles. Substantial credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Fund\u2019s breach of the repayment agreement did not cause Elk Mountain to suffer losses related to its future sale of vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\u00b649 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b66-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
