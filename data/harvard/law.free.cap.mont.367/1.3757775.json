We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">\u00b63 1. <em>Whether the District Court improperly disregarded C.R.\u2019s hearing testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">\u00b64 2. <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s failure to offer C.R. a court-appointed friend violated C.R.\u2019s statutory or constitutional rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">\u00b65 3. <em>Whether C.R. received ineffective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">\u00b66 The District Court involuntarily committed and authorized the involuntary medication of thirty-year-old C.R. after it determined that he suffered from a mental disorder and that his condition met the statutory criteria for involuntary commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-10\">\u00b67 Prior to the commitment proceedings, C.R. resided with his brother, L.R., at L.R.\u2019s residence. According to L.R., on January 8, 2012, C.R. exhibited \u201cbizarre and erratic behavior at the residence, yelling uncontrollably at no one in particular,\u201d and L.R. contacted the Billings Clinic Psychiatric Center to check on C.R.\u2019s welfare. Law enforcement transported C.R. to the Billings Clinic Emergency Room, where he became \u201cacutely aggressive\u201d during his mental health evaluation. As a result of these behaviors, Dr. Faraz Masood, M.D., a psychiatric hospitalist at the Billings Clinic Psychiatric Center, requested that the Yellowstone County Attorney\u2019s Office file a petition for involuntary commitment. The County Attorney\u2019s Office filed a petition on January 9, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-11\">\u00b68 After reviewing the petition, the District Court found probable cause to believe that C.R. \u201cmay suffer from a mental disorder and may need to be committed because of his mental disorder.\u201d The District Court appointed counsel to represent C.R., ordered him detained at the Billings Clinic Psychiatric Center pending resolution of the petition, and set an initial hearing on the petition for January 10, 2012. After being advised by counsel of his rights regarding the petition, C.R. waived the initial hearing. The District Court appointed a professional person, Dr. Masood, to evaluate C.R. and set an evidentiary hearing for January 11, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-12\">\u00b69 On January 10,2012, Dr. Masood reported to the court that, since his admission to the Psychiatric Center, C.R. \u201cremained labile, aggressive and hostile with disorganized behavior and thoughts.\u201d Dr. Masood determined that C.R. suffered from severe psychosis, a mental disorder, and that he needed to be committed because he \u201ccannot adequately care for his needs\u201d and was \u201can imminent threat to himself.\u201d In Dr. Masood\u2019s opinion, there was \u201cno recourse but for placement at the state hospital in Warm Springs.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>\u00b610 During the January 11, 2012 evidentiary hearing on the petition, the District Court heard testimony from L.R., Dr. Masood, and C.R. L.R. stated that his brother was not mentally well, appeared to be a risk to himself or others, and currently was unable to care for himself. L.R. was \u201c[a] hundred percent\u201d in support of committing C.R. Dr. Masood agreed that C.R. \u201cposes a risk of imminent harm to himself or others,\u201d due to psychosis coupled with schizophrenia. Dr. Masood stated that C.R. had shown little improvement since his admission to the Psychiatric Center, where he had refused medication, spit on staff, and required physical restraints on several occasions to prevent violent behavior. The hospital had to place C.R. in restraints three times and in seclusion twice during his short stay, which Masood testified was unusual. According to Masood, C.R. also continued to experience auditory hallucinations and delusions of paranoia, exhibit manic and impulsive behavior, and lack \u201cinsight and judgment ... to be able to care for himself.\u201d Masood testified that, absent treatment, C.R.\u2019s condition would \u201c[m]ost certainly\u201d deteriorate. He recommended a ninety-day commitment to MSH as the \u201cleast restrictive placement option\u201d and \u201cif necessary, the involuntary administration of medication\u201d to facilitate C.R.\u2019s treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">\u00b6 11 The District Court concluded that the State proved to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that \u201c[C.R.] suffers from a mental disorder,\u201d namely \u201cpsychosis and schizophrenia.\u201d It also concluded that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that C.R. required commitment in light of his inability to care for himself, the \u201creal risk of harm\u201d he posed to himself and others, and the likelihood that, absent treatment, his \u201cmental health will further deteriorate.\u201d The District Court ordered involuntary commitment of C.R. for up to three months and authorized the administration of involuntary medication, if needed \u201cto protect [C.R.] and the public and facilitate effective treatment.\u201d C.R. was hospitalized pursuant to the court\u2019s order and later released.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s order of civil commitment \u201cto determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct.\u201d <em>In re Mental Health of L.K.-S., </em>2011 MT 21, \u00b6 14, 359 Mont. 191, 247 P.3d 1100. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if \u201cit is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if, after a review of the entire record, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>L.K.S., </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u00b613 We require \u201cstrict adherence\u201d to the statutory scheme governing involuntary commitment due to the \u201ccritical importance\u201d of the constitutional rights at stake. <em>L.K. -S., </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>In re Mental Health of C.R.C., </em>2004 MT 389, \u00b6 16, 325 Mont. 133, 104 P.3d 1065 and In <em>re Mental Health of T.J.D., </em>2002 MT 24, \u00b6 20, 308 Mont. 222, 41 P.3d 323).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">\u00b614 An appeal from an order of involuntary commitment is not moot despite the appellant\u2019s release, since the issues are capable of repetition, yet otherwise would evade review. <em>In re Mental Health of D.V., </em>2007 MT 351, \u00b6 32, 340 Mont. 319, 174 P.3d 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">\u00b615 1. <em>Whether the District Court improperly disregarded C.R.\u2019s hearing testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">\u00b616 Section 53-21-126, MCA, details the standard of proof, procedural requirements and criteria that a court must apply when considering a petition for civil commitment. The standard of proof in commitment proceedings is \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt with respect to any physical facts or evidence and clear and convincing evidence as to all other matters.\u201d Section 53-21-126(2), MCA. Commitment is appropriate if the court determines, first, that the respondent suffers from a mental disorder and, second, that one of the following criteria has been met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-8\">(a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-9\">(b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-10\">(c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent or to others because of the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-11\">(d) whether the respondent\u2019s mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent\u2019s recent acts or omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent\u2019s mental condition to the point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety. Predictability may be established by the respondent\u2019s relevant medical history.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-12\">Section 53-21-126(1), MCA; <em>see </em>\u00a7 53-21-127(7) (\u201cSatisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter.\u201d). The District Court\u2019s decision to commit C.R. was based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>on its findings under \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(a), (b), and (d), MCA, that, due to his mental disorder, C.R. could not care for himself and posed a threat to himself and others, and that his mental condition would further deteriorate if left untreated.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">\u00b617 C.R. contends that, during the evidentiary hearing, \u201c[h]e testified coherently that he did not believe he suffered from a mental disorder and that he had a place to live and could provide for his own basic needs.\u201d C.R. posits that his involuntary medication prior to his psychiatric evaluation \u201ccaused the symptoms described by Dr. Masood\u201d and resulted in his inability to recollect most events that took place the day before his hearing. C.R. argues that his \u201clucid\u201d testimony during the evidentiary hearing was \u201csufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to C.R.\u2019s need for involuntary commitment or at the very least render Dr. Masood\u2019s testimony regarding C.R.\u2019s need for commitment not \u2018clear and convincing.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">\u00b618 We review for clear error the District Court\u2019s determination that C.R. suffers from a mental disorder and that he meets the criteria for commitment under \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA. <em>In re Mental Health of M.C.D., </em>2010 MT 15, \u00b6 9, 355 Mont. 97, 225 P.3d 1214 (we \u201cwill disturb the district court\u2019s findings in a civil commitment case only if they are clearly erroneous, when viewed in a light most favorable to the prevailing party\u201d) (citing <em>In re C.R.C., </em>2004 MT 389, \u00b6 11, 325 Mont. 133, 104 P.3d 1065). \u201cWe normally defer to a district court\u2019s determination of witness credibility and evidentiary weight.\u201d <em>In re G.M., </em>2008 MT 200, \u00b6 38, 344 Mont. 87, 186 P.3d 229 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">\u00b619 The District Court made the following findings based on Dr. Masood\u2019s hearing testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-7\">Since his admission, [C.R.] has refused medication, has been in and out of physical restraints, and has been segregated from the general population at the Psychiatric Center because of his propensity towards violence. Currently, [C.R.] is at risk of causing harm to self and others[,] the result of his mental disability. He has spit on other patients. He has been in restraints on a number of occasions and on two occasions directly before this hearing because of concerns of physical confrontations with staff and other patients. [C.R.] has shown no improvement and continues with auditory hallucinations, has delusions of paranoia, demonstrates manic and impulsive behavior and has no judgment or insight into his mental disorder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">The District Court also noted that L.R. testified he believed C.R. was \u201cnot mentally well,\u201d could not \u201cbecause of his current mental state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>care for himself,\u201d and had recently become violent. C.R. does not contest that Dr. Masood\u2019s and L.R.\u2019s testimony supported the District Court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">\u00b620  C.R. contends the District Court \u201cdid not even make a credibility finding with respect to C.R.\u2019s testimony,\u201d which it \u201ccompletely ignored.\u201d The District Court\u2019s written order, however, indicates that it considered C.R.\u2019s testimony and found it unreliable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">[C.R.] felt that others, not himself, had any issues, or alternatively, matters were not as bad as portrayed. [C.R.] indicated he could reside with his brother or other family members, however the brother indicated that placement with him at this time was not acceptable. [C.R.] was not able to grasp the seriousness of his mental disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude the District Court\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence, the District Court did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence and we are not left with a firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Thus, the District Court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\u00b621 2. <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s failure to offer C.R. a court-appointed friend violated C.R.\u2019s statutory or constitutional rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">\u00b622 Prior to 2009, respondents in civil commitment proceedings had a statutory right to a court-appointed friend. Section 53-21-122(2), MCA (2007) (\u201cThe judge shall appoint a professional person and a friend of respondent...\u201d). In 2009, the Legislature amended \u00a7 53-21-122, MCA, which now provides, \u201cIf the court finds that an appropriate person is willing and able to perform the functions of a friend of respondent as set out in this part and the respondent personally or through counsel consents, the court shall appoint the person as the friend of respondent.\u201d Section 53-21-122(2)(b), MCA. The statute mandates appointment of a friend only when the court has determined that an appropriate person is willing to perform that function; it does not obligate the court to seek out, investigate, or offer a friend when, as here, none was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">\u00b623 The 2009 amendments were made in response to two decisions of this Court reversing involuntary commitments for failure of the District Court to appoint a friend. <em>In re Mental Health of J.D.L., </em>2008 MT 445, 348 Mont. 1, 199 P.3d 805; <em>In re Mental Health </em>of A.S.F., 2008 MT 450, 348 Mont. 45, 199 P.3d 808. Though C.R. acknowledges that the statute no longer mandates appointment of a friend to a respondent in civil commitment proceedings, he contends that we recognized in <em>J.D.L. </em>andA.S.N the constitutional underpinnings ofthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>right to a court-appointed friend due to the liberty interests at stake. C.R. argues that he had \u201ca right to at least be <em>offered </em>a court appointed friend\u201d and the District Court\u2019s failure to \u201cinvestigate, inquire and/or offer C.R. a friend\u201d justifies reversal of its decision. (Emphasis added.) \u00b624 C.R. points out that under \u00a7 53-21-121(2)(f), MCA, a petition for commitment must include \u201cthe name and address of any person whom the county attorney <em>believes </em>might be willing and able to be appointed as friend of respondent,\u201d and that here, \u201cthe Petition merely stated \u2018unknown.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) The permissive language of the statute does not support an argument that the county attorney is obligated to provide the name of a willing friend if the county attorney knows of no person willing to assist the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b625 While C.R. alleges a due process violation, our decisions in <em>J.D.L. </em>and <em>A.S.F. </em>were premised on the express language of the statute, which at the time left the district court no discretion. \u201cThe mandate of \u00a7 53-21-122(2), MCA, to appoint a friend was essentially ignored.\u201d <em>J.D.L., </em>\u00b6 12. Now, the statute does not provide a mandate. C.R. does not challenge the constitutionality of the current statute, but argues that the court cannot comply with even the permissive language of the statute if \u201cit makes no inquiry into whether such a person exists.\u201d \u00b626 In both <em>J.D.L. </em>and <em>A.S.F., </em>we applied plain error review to the court\u2019s failure to follow the requirements of the statute. \u201cWe invoke plain error review sparingly and in only those limited situations where failure to review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>J.D.L., </em>\u00b6 6. Here, there was no objection before the District Court to the absence of a court-appointed friend and the record does not indicate whether either the State\u2019s attorney or C.R.\u2019s counsel gave consideration to any potential person willing to serve. C.R.\u2019s brother was involved in the proceedings and testified that commitment was in C.R.\u2019s best interest. C.R.\u2019s argument that a friend \u201ccould have advocated\u201d for an independent evaluation does not establish that failure to inquire into the possibility of a friend resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice or compromised the integrity of the proceeding. Since the statute does not mandate appointment of a friend, we decline to invoke plain error review in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b627 3. <em>Whether C.R. received ineffective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b628 We evaluate five \u201ccritical areas\u201d in determining whether a respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel in involuntary commitment proceedings: (1) appointment of competent counsel; (2) counsel\u2019s initial investigation; (3) counsel\u2019s interview with the client; (4) the patient-respondent\u2019s right to remain silent; and (5) counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>role as an advocate for the patient-respondent. <em>In re Mental Health of C.R.C., </em>2009 MT 125, \u00b6 16, 350 Mont. 211, 207 P.3d 289 (citing In <em>re Mental Health of K.G.F., </em>2001 MT 140, \u00b6\u00b6 70-86, 306 Mont. 1, 29 P.3d 485). \u201c[Ujpon a substantial showing of evidence ... that counsel did not effectively represent the patient-respondent\u2019s interests pursuant to the foregoing standards,\u201d we will vacate an order of involuntary commitment. <em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 16 (quoting K.G.F., \u00b6 91) (internal quotation marks omitted). We consider the whole record and evaluate each factor \u201cbased on the facts and circumstances of the entire case.\u201d <em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"An4\">\u00b629 C.R. contends that counsel did not adequately represent his interests because counsel \u201cdid not obtain an independent professional person to evaluate [him].\u201d C.R. points out that \u00a7 53-21-115(9), MCA, provides \u201cthe right to be examined by a professional person of the person\u2019s choice when the professional person is willing and reasonably available,\u201d but alleges that \u201cC.R. was never offered the option of an independent medical examination.\u201d C.R.\u2019s claim implicates the fifth factor only. Neither his briefs nor the record as a whole indicate any insufficiency regarding the appointment of competent counsel, counsel\u2019s initial investigation, counsel\u2019s interview with C.R., or C.R.\u2019s right to remain silent during his hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b630 As in this case, <em>C.R. C. </em>involved a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based only on the fifth factor. We noted, \u201c... it is unclear whether a challenge based only on one of the five \u2018critical areas\u2019 discussed in <em>K.G.F. </em>would meet the threshold \u2018substantial showing of evidence ... that counsel did not effectively represent the patient-respondent\u2019s interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>C.R. C., </em>\u00b6 19. We recognized, based on <em>K.G.F., </em>that counsel\u2019s stipulation to C.R.C.\u2019s commitment without her consent created a presumption of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>C.R.C. </em>\u00b6 17. We concluded, however, that the presumption was rebutted by otherwise effective representation-including counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the doctor who had concluded C.R.C. posed an imminent threat to herself and others, counsel\u2019s attempt to obtain an independent psychological evaluation, his motion to stay execution of the order of involuntary medication, and his notifying the court that he intended to appeal the order. <em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b631 C.R. cites no authority providing that counsel is <em>prima facie </em>ineffective for failing to obtain an independent evaluation. C.R. offers the MSH discharge report as evidence that another evaluation would have created reasonable doubt about the need for commitment. We do not consider that report as substantive evidence because it was prepared after entry of the District Court\u2019s commitment order and following eight days of inpatient care and intensive observation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>is a speculative basis upon which to conclude that a second evaluation prior to the hearing would have led to a different outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b632  As the State points out, the record in this case does not demonstrate that counsel made no effort to obtain an independent examination of C.R., or that C.R. asked for a second opinion. There are numerous other indications of effective representation. Counsel met with C.R. and Dr. Masood prior to the hearing. Counsel cross-examined Dr. Masood during the hearing regarding the length of his evaluation of C.R. prior to diagnosing him with schizophrenia and paranoia-twenty to thirty minutes-and regarding C.R.\u2019s disposition the day before the hearing, when, Dr. Masood agreed, he had been \u201ccooperating and giving answers.\u201d We conclude that the record as a whole demonstrates C.R.\u2019s counsel served as \u201ca vigorous advocate for the respondent\u2019s wishes.\u201d <em>In re Mental Health of T.J.F., </em>2011 MT 28, \u00b6 33, 359 Mont. 213, 248 P.3d 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b633 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b29-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
