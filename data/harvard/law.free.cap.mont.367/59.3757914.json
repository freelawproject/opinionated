Specifically, Brooks appeals the sentencing requirement that he register as a violent offender. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\u00b62 On February 25, 2011, Brooks was charged with felony arson for setting fire to a car and two dumpsters in Billings, Montana. Brooks and the State entered into a plea agreement in which the State agreed to recommend a six-year suspended sentence at the DOC, plus restitution, in exchange for Brooks\u2019 guilty plea. The District Court accepted Brooks\u2019 plea, and ordered a presentence investigation report (PSI) prior to sentencing. The PSI details Brooks\u2019 criminal history, which dates back to 1989 and involves several misdemeanor and felony offenses. The PSI also sets forth Brooks\u2019 battle with alcoholism. It describes Brooks as a recovering alcoholic who in recent times would drink two or three times a week, consuming as much as a fifth of whiskey at each setting. Brooks admitted that he drinks to excess, and he associates drinking with his legal and financial problems. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>reported that he completed an inpatient chemical dependency program in Missouri approximately eleven years ago, and remained sober for about eighteen months after. Jeff Snell (Snell), the probation and parole officer who completed Brooks\u2019 PSI, recommended the District Court follow the plea agreement and impose several sentencing conditions, including that Brooks register as a violent offender as required by Montana\u2019s Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act (SVORA).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b63 The District Court held a sentencing hearing for Brooks on June 30, 2011. At the hearing, Brooks\u2019 counsel recommended a three-year DOC sentence, all suspended. Counsel assured the District Court that Brooks was remorseful for his actions, and argued the crime was alcohol-fueled and a result of his \u201cang[er] at the world.\u201d Brooks\u2019 counsel further maintained that Brooks had \u201ccleaned up\u201d since his release from jail, and anticipated he would \u201ccontinue on his endeavor to maintain his sobriety.\u201d Brooks\u2019 counsel additionally objected to the PSI\u2019s probationary condition that required Brooks register as a violent offender, arguing the condition violates his constitutional right to privacy. The State objected to Brooks\u2019 constitutional argument and recommended a six-year suspended DOC commitment and an order that Brooks pay $1600 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b64 The District Court sentenced Brooks to a four-year suspended DOC commitment, and required him to pay the $1600 in restitution. It further imposed the recommended probationary conditions, including that Brooks register as a violent offender. The District Court also ordered that Brooks complete anger management classes, as well as chemical dependency and mental health evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b65 Brooks raises one issue on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AAW\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court\u2019s sentencing condition requiring that Brooks register as a violent offender violate his constitutional right to privacy ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">\u00b67 This Court reviews de novo whether a district court violated a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights at sentencing. <em>State v. Bullplume, </em>2011 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 359 Mont. 289, 251 P.3d 114. We presume that all statutes are constitutional. <em>State v. Pirello, </em>2012 MT 155, \u00b6 10, 365 Mont. 399, 282 P.3d 662. A defendant challenging a statute\u2019s constitutionality bears the burden of proving it unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Pirello, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court\u2019s sentencing condition requiring that Brooks register as a violent offender violate his constitutional right to privacy ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ab-\">\u00b69 Brooks argues on appeal that the District Court violated his constitutional right to privacy when it required he register as a violent offender as a result of what he describes as a \u201csingle ... isolated and out-of-character incident of arson.\u201d He asserts he has a subjective and actual expectation of privacy in his whereabouts and residential address and that there is no compelling State interest to justify the dissemination of this information. The State counters that Brooks\u2019 expectation of privacy is not the same as the average Montanan because he is a convicted felon and violent offender. Moreover, the State maintains that whatever expectation of privacy Brooks has as a violent offender, the State has a compelling interest in requiring him to register in order to protect the public and help law enforcement investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Montana\u2019s Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b610 In 1989, the Montana Legislature enacted the Sexual Offender Registration Act (SORA), which imposed a registration requirement upon sexual offenders. Section 46-23-501, 504, MCA (1989). In 1995, the Legislature renamed the SORA to the Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act (SVORA) and amended it to include a registration requirement for certain violent offenders. 1995 Mont. Laws 1481. Two years later, the Legislature again amended the SVORA and attached a preamble, which lists several legislative concerns that prompted the adoption of the SVORA. <em>State v. Mount, </em>2003 MT 275, \u00b6 44, 317 Mont. 481, 78 P.3d 829. These concerns include: (1) the danger of recidivism posed by sexual and violent offenders and the protection of the public; (2) the impairment of law enforcement\u2019s efforts to protect communities from lack of information about offenders; (3) the prevention of victimization and the prompt resolution of sexual or violent offenses; (4) the sexual or violent offender\u2019s reduced expectation of privacy because of the public\u2019s interest in safety; and (5) the furtherance of the primary governmental interest of protecting specific vulnerable groups and the public in general from potential harm. 1997 Mont. Laws 1742-43; <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u00b611 The current SVORA defines a sexual or violent offender as \u201ca person who has been convicted of... a sexual or violent offense,\u201d and specifically provides that arson, along with a number of other criminal offenses, constitutes a \u201cviolent offense\u201d subject to the Act. Section 46-23-502(10), (13), MCA. At the time of registering, the offender must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>provide certain information including the offender\u2019s name, social security number, driver\u2019s license number, description and license number of any vehicles owned or operated by the offender, and residence, employment and education information. Section 46-23-504(3), MCA. The offender is also fingerprinted and photographed, and all of the information is sent to the department of justice. Section 46-23-504(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b612 Once the information is received by the department of justice, its dissemination to the public is dependent upon whether the offender is a sexual or violent offender. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-508(1), MCA, a registered violent offender\u2019s name, address and offense for which the offender was required to register become public criminal justice information. Additional information about the offender may be disseminated to the public only if the department of justice or the registration agency determines that the offender is <em>\u201ca </em>risk to the safety of the community and that disclosure of the registration information ... may protect the public....\u201d Section 46-23-508(l)(b), MCA. With regard to sexual offenders, the statute requires the dissemination of more information, the amount of which is dependent upon the level designation the offender receives.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b613  Sexual offenders are generally required to register for life, while violent offenders are relieved of their registration obligation after 10 years, so long as they follow the registration requirements of the SVORA and are not convicted of any felonies during the ten-year period. Section 46-23-506(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Montana\u2019s Right to Privacy</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b614 Article II, Section 10, of the Montana Constitution affords citizens a fundamental right of individual privacy. A privacy interest is protected under Article II, Section 10, if (1) the individual had a subjective or actual expectation of privacy and (2) society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable. <em>Mont. Shooting Sports Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2010 MT 8, \u00b6 14, 355 Mont. 49, 224 P.3d 1240 (citing <em>State v. Burns, </em>253 Mont. 37, 41, 830 P.2d 1318, 1321 (1992)). This Court has specifically recognized the diminished expectation of privacy of probationers. \u201c \u2018Probation is an act of grace by a sentencing court, intended to give the offender a chance to rehabilitate outside the prison setting.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Moody, </em>2006 MT 305, \u00b6 19, 334 Mont. 517, 148 P.3d 662 (quoting <em>State v. Boulton, </em>2006 MT 170, \u00b6 15, 332 Mont. 538, 140 P.3d 482). Probation is a form of punishment and, accordingly, probationers do not enjoy the same liberty and expectations of privacy afforded every Montanan citizen. <em>Moody, </em>\u00b6 19. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>As the United States Supreme Court has recognized, \u201c \u2018the very assumption of the institution of probation\u2019 is that the probationer \u2018is more likely than the ordinary citizen to violate the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 120, 122 S. Ct. 587, 592 (2001) (quoting <em>Griffin v. Wis., </em>483 U.S. 868, 880, 107 S. Ct. 3164, 3172 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b615  Brooks will be on probation for the first four years that he is required to register as a violent offender. Consequently, he has a diminished privacy interest during this time. Even after he finishes serving his four-year probationary sentence, we cannot conclude that his privacy interests will be equal to those of an ordinary citizen. While society may generally recognize individuals\u2019 expectation of privacy in their whereabouts and residential address as reasonable, Brooks is not the average individual-he is a convicted felon and violent offender. The Legislature determined, as a matter of public policy, that the registration laws are necessary because \u201cpersons who have committed a sexual or violent offense have a reduced expectation of privacy because of the public\u2019s interest in safety.\u201d Section 46-23-501, MCA. As a result of Brooks\u2019 conviction of felony arson, he has a diminished privacy interest in the personal information required at his registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b616  The State argues, and we agree, that whatever limited expectation of privacy Brooks has as a violent offender in his whereabouts and residential information, the State\u2019s compelling interest in requiring that he register justifies the enactment of the SVORA.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b617 Any legislative infringement of the fundamental right to privacy is subject to strict scrutiny analysis-which means the government must show that the law is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6 98. This Court has already determined in <em>Mount </em>that the State has a compelling interest in enacting the SVORA, and that its registration and disclosure requirements are narrowly tailored to affect only those interests. <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6 99. There, defendant Mount was charged with failing to register as a sexual offender following his release from prison for a sexual intercourse without consent conviction. <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-11. The district court dismissed the charge, determining that the SVORA, as applied to Mount, violated the constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6 12. On appeal, we reversed the district court\u2019s ruling. In addition to the <em>ex post facto </em>issue, we addressed Mount\u2019s contention that the SVORA violated his constitutional right to privacy. <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6 93. While we acknowledged that Mount\u2019s privacy rights may be implicated by the registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>requirement, we cited to the SVORA\u2019s Preamble, which lays out the concerns that prompted the adoption of the Act, to support our conclusion that the State had a compelling interest in enacting the legislation. <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6 99. Further, we determined that the registration requirements are tailored to disclose only the information necessary to further the Act\u2019s purpose. <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b618 Brooks maintains that since <em>Mount </em>involved a sexual offense instead of a violent offense our analysis is \u201cnot necessarily controlling or instructive of the present case.\u201d With regard to the State\u2019s compelling interest, Brooks argues that because there are not \u201cserial arsonists,\u201d the SVORA does not reflect the same legislative concern for recidivism of individuals convicted of arson as it does for sexual offenders. He additionally asserts that his actions do not necessarily implicate public safety and that the dissemination of his whereabouts and residential information will not protect the public. Therefore, he argues, the reasons we upheld the constitutionality of the SVORA in <em>Mount </em>are not applicable in the present case. We find Brooks\u2019 arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b619  Each of the legislative concerns listed in the SVORA\u2019s Preamble explicitly regard violent offenders. 1997 Mont. Laws 1742-43. There is no indication that the concern for recidivism, public safety, and law enforcement\u2019s abilities to protect communities is any greater for sexual offenders than violent ones. In addition, the present matter illustrates exactly why the State has a compelling interest in requiring violent offenders such as Brooks to register in accordance with the SVORA\u2019s provisions. Brooks has a track record of drinking and making poor decisions, and associates his alcoholism with his legal problems-which include felony and misdemeanor convictions. In addition to his current \u201calcohol-fueled\u201d arson offense, Brooks has been convicted for driving under the influence and partner/ family member assault. We therefore cannot agree with Brooks\u2019 assertions that his actions do not implicate public safety and that the State\u2019s claim that he will engage in future wrongdoing is \u201cspeculation at best.\u201d The State clearly has a compelling interest in requiring Brooks register to protect the public from potential future crimes committed by Brooks as well as assist law enforcement in investigating those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b620  In addition to arguing there is no compelling State interest justifying the registration laws, Brooks also maintains the SVORA is not narrowly tailored, despite our determination in <em>Mount </em>that it is. <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6 99. Brooks argues our holding in <em>Mount </em>does not apply here because he is a violent offender, and even if the SVORA is narrowly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>tailored as applied to sexual offenders it is not as to violent ones. We disagree. While Brooks correctly recognizes that unlike sexual offenders violent offenders are not given level designation that dictates what information is provided to the public, he incorrectly concludes that such a categorization is necessary for the law to be narrowly tailored. Because violent offenders are required to release less information than sexual offenders-typically only name, address, and offense-designation levels would not serve much of a purpose. It is only upon a determination that the violent offender is a risk to the public\u2019s safety and that disclosure of additional information may protect the public that additional information is disseminated. In addition to providing less information than sexual offenders, violent offenders are typically required to register for shorter periods of time-ten years as opposed to the remainder of their lives. We therefore follow our holding in <em>Mount </em>and conclude that the SVORA is narrowly tailored to achieve the State\u2019s compelling interests without imposing any substantial or excessive hardships on the violent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b621 For the reasons stated above, we affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b86-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
