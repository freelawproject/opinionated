In the previous appeal, we reversed the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the Cross-Appellants and held that their cross-appeal on the attorneys\u2019 fee issue was moot. <em>Western Tradition Partn., Inc. v. Atty. </em>Gen., 2011 MT 328, \u00b6 48, 363 Mont. 220, 271 P.3d 1. Our decision thereafter was reversed by the United States Supreme Court. <em>American Tradition Partn., Inc. v. Bullock, </em>567 U.S. _, 132 S. Ct. 2490 (2012) (per curiam). On motion of the Cross-Appellants, we agreed to consider the attorneys\u2019 fee issue based on the briefing previously submitted to this Court. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">\u00b62 The procedural history of this case is set forth in detail in the Court\u2019s previous opinion. <em>Western Tradition Partn., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-33. Briefly stated, Plaintiffs Western Tradition Partnership-now known as American Tradition Partnership-Champion Painting, and Montana Shooting Sports Foundation (collectively referred to as ATP) sought a declaratory ruling that \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA, violated their rights to free speech guaranteed by the United States and Montana Constitutions by prohibiting political expenditures by corporations on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>behalf of or opposing candidates for public office. ATP argued that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Citizens United v. FEC, </em>558 U.S. 310, 130 S. Ct. <em>876 </em>(2010), barred Montana from prohibiting independent and indirect corporate expenditures on political speech, and that Montana\u2019s century-old ban on independent corporate expenditures therefore was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b63 The Attorney General defended the law\u2019s constitutionality on the grounds that the law invalidated in <em>Citizens United </em>was distinguishable from the Montana statute, that corporate rights could not be asserted against states in the same manner as against Congress, and that Montana has a compelling interest in requiring business corporations to use segregated funds for campaign expenditures. The Attorney General argued that \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA, is narrowly tailored because it still allows for lobbying, testimony, and other direct contacts and that the Commissioner of Political Practices has interpreted the law to exclude voluntary associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b64 The District Court entertained the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment. ATP\u2019s motion included a request for attorneys\u2019 fees under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA), \u00a7\u00a7 27-8-101 et seq., MCA, and under the private attorney general doctrine, first recognized by this Court in <em>In re Dearborn Drainage </em>Area, 240 Mont. 39, 43, 782 P.2d 898, 900 (1989). The court granted ATP\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the merits of its constitutional claim, denied the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment, declared \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA, unconstitutional, enjoined enforcement of the statute, and denied ATP\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees. The Attorney General appealed the District Court\u2019s summary judgment rulings and ATP appealed the denial of its request for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b65 On appeal, this Court reversed. A majority of the Court agreed with the Attorney General\u2019s position that <em>Citizens United </em>did not foreclose Montana from prohibiting independent corporate expenditures on behalf of candidates. Based on the record developed in the District Court, this Court concluded that the State had a compelling interest that justified the imposition of statutory restrictions that the Court determined were narrowly tailored to meet its objectives. <em>Western Tradition Partn., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47-48. We did not reach ATP\u2019s claim for fees, as it was mooted by our reversal of the District Court\u2019s summary judgment ruling. <em>Western Tradition Partn., </em>\u00b6 48. Two members of the Court dissented on the ground that Montana\u2019s statute did not pass constitutional muster under <em>Citizens United. Western Tradition Partn., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 49-60 (Baker, J., dissenting), \u00b6\u00b6 61-135 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>(Nelson, J., dissenting). The U.S. Supreme Court summarily reversed, ruling that \u201c[t]here can be no serious doubt\u201d that the holding of <em>Citizens United </em>applies to the Montana statute. <em>American Tradition Partn., </em>567 U.S. at_, 132 S. Ct. at 2491.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">\u00b66 We return now to ATP\u2019s cross-appeal and consider whether it is entitled to recover its attorneys\u2019 fees from the State of Montana under either the UDJA or the private attorney general doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ATP seeks a total award of $138,403.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b67 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s ruling granting or denying attorneys\u2019 fees under either the UDJA or the private attorney general doctrine. <em>Bitterroot River Protective Ass\u2019n v. Bitterroot Conserv. Dist., </em>2011 MT 51, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 359 Mont. 393, 251 P.3d 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in declining to award attorneys\u2019 fees ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\u00b69 Montana follows the American Rule that, absent a specific statutory or contractual provision, a prevailing party generally is not entitled to recovery of its attorneys\u2019 fees in prosecuting or defending the action. <em>Trustees of Ind. Univ. v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6 19, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663. We have recognized equitable exceptions to the American Rule, <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 19, but construe these exceptions narrowly \u201clest they swallow the rule.\u201d <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 248, \u00b6 23, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649. We have rejected the expansion of such equitable exceptions when the effect would \u201cdrive a stake into the heart of the American Rule.\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting <em>Mountain West Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Brewer, </em>2003 MT 98, \u00b6 40, 315 Mont. 231, 69 P.3d 652).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">1. Statutory Basis for Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">\u00b610 Montana law provides that a prevailing party may recover attorneys\u2019 fees against the State of Montana only if \u201cthe court finds that the claim or defense of the state ... was frivolous or pursued in bad faith.\u201d Section 25-10-711(l)(b), MCA. A claim or defense is frivolous or in bad faith \u201cwhen it is \u2018outside the bounds of legitimate argument on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>a substantial issue on which there is a bona fide difference of opinion.\u2019\u201d <em>Ostergren v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>2004 MT 30, \u00b6 23, 319 Mont. 405, 85 P.3d 738 (quoting <em>Jones v. City of Billings, </em>279 Mont. 341, 344, 927 P.2d 9, 11 (1996), and <em>Armstrong v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>250 Mont. 468, 469-70, 820 P.2d 1273, 1274 (1991)). In this case, the District Court did not find the Attorney General\u2019s position to be frivolous or in bad faith. To the contrary, the court determined that the State\u2019s arguments \u201cwere made in good faith and were supported by briefs that were meticulously researched, well written, and well argued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b611 ATP argues that, despite its finding of good faith, the District Court erred by failing to award fees under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, which serves as statutory authority for an award of fees in this case. That section does not specifically provide for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to a prevailing party, but does give a court the ability to grant \u201csupplemental relief\u2019 in a case brought under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act when the court determines such relief to be \u201cnecessary or proper.\u201d <em>Wagner v. Woodward, </em>2012 MT 19, \u00b6 31, 363 Mont. 403, 270 P.3d 21 (citing <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 42). While \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, may provide a statutory basis for awarding fees, its reach is narrow. In order to avoid \u201ceviscerat[ing]\u201d the American Rule, we have determined that an award of fees to the prevailing party is not warranted \u201cin every garden variety declaratory judgment action[.]\u201d <em>Mungas v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2009 MT 426, \u00b6 44, 354 Mont. 50, 221 P.3d 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b612 Accordingly, we have required courts analyzing a claim for fees in a declaratory judgment proceeding to make a threshold determination that equitable considerations support an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 45; <em>Hughes v. Ahlgren, </em>2011 MT 189, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 21, 361 Mont. 319, 258 P.3d 439; <em>United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 269, \u00b6 39, 352 Mont. 105, 214 P.3d 1260. If that threshold determination is met, we apply a three-part \u201ctangible parameters test\u201d to determine whether an award of fees is necessary or proper as required by \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. <em>Renville v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>2004 MT 366, \u00b6 27, 324 Mont. 509, 105 P.3d 280.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court concluded that, although the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act provided authority for an award of fees, the court did not find it \u201cnecessary and proper to do so in this case.\u201d Because equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>considerations also inform the analysis of ATP\u2019s claim for fees under the private attorney general doctrine, we will consider these arguments together.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\">2. Private Attorney General Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b613 The private attorney general doctrine is one of a handful of equitable exceptions this Court has recognized to the American Rule. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 19. This doctrine \u201cis normally utilized when the government, for some reason, fails to properly enforce interests which are significant to its citizens.\u201d <em>Montanans for the Responsible Use of the Sch. Trust v. State ex rel. Bd. of Land Comm\u2019rs (Montrust), </em>1999 MT 263, \u00b6 64, 296 Mont. 402, 989 P.2d 800 (quoting <em>Dearborn Drainage Area, </em>240 Mont. at 43, 782 P.2d at 900). It, too, has been invoked sparingly. Since first recognizing the doctrine in 1989, we have only twice used it to award or uphold the award of fees, and just once to a party prevailing against the State. <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 69 (fees awarded against the State); <em>Bitterroot River Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 37 (upholding award of fees against private parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b614 We held in <em>Montrust </em>that three factors should be considered in determining whether to award fees under the private attorney general doctrine: \u201c(1) the strength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) the necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, (3) the number of people standing to benefit from the decision.\u201d <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 66 (quoting <em>Serrano v. Priest, </em>569 P.2d 1303, 1314 (Cal. 1977)). We have limited the award of fees under the doctrine to cases \u201cvindicating constitutional interests.\u201d <em>Bitterroot River Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 22. We have declined to apply the doctrine when the litigation primarily served a party\u2019s own pecuniary interests. <em>Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 91, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079. We also consider whether an award of fees would be unjust under the circumstances. <em>Finke v. State ex rel. McGrath, </em>2003 MT 48, \u00b6 33, 314 Mont. 314, 65 P.3d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b615 ATP argues that it has vindicated important free speech rights that benefit all Montana citizens and corporations and will result in adding more thoughts and views to the state\u2019s political discourse. The Attorney General, conversely, argues that there is substantial overlap between ATP\u2019s view of the public interest and its own pecuniary interests, and that the District Court was justified in declining to award fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b616 The constitutional principles underlying this litigation cannot be doubted. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s order reaffirmed that \u201cpolitical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>speech does not lose First Amendment protection simply because its source is a corporation.\u201d <em>ATP v. Bullock, </em>567 U.S. at_, 132 S. Ct. at 2491 (quoting <em>Citizens United, </em>558 U.S. at_, 130 S. Ct. at 900). Our cases applying the private attorney general doctrine reflect the caution, however, \u201cthat the first factor not become for courts \u2018assessments of the relative strength or weakness of public policies furthered by their decisions ... a role closely approaching that of the legislative function.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bitterroot Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting <em>Serrano, </em>569 P.2d at 1314). The separation of powers between the branches requires us to use the same caution to avoid interference with the executive function as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b617 \u201cThe Attorney General is the legal officer of the state and shall have the duties and powers provided by law.\u201d Mont. Const. art. VI, \u00a7 4(4). It is the duty of the Attorney General \u201cto prosecute or defend all causes in the supreme court in which the state or any officer of the state in the officer\u2019s official capacity is a party or in which the state has an interest.\u201d Section 2-15-501(1), MCA. As an executive officer of the State of Montana, the Attorney General determines when to prosecute or to defend cases in which the State has an interest. Thus, if a challenge is brought to a state statute, the Attorney General has discretion to decide whether or not to defend its constitutionality. <em>See In re W.C., </em>206 Mont. 432, 439, 671 P.2d 621, 624 (1983) (Attorney General does not have a duty to appear in every action concerning constitutionality of a statute); <em>Associated Press v. State of Mont. 250 </em>Mont. 299, 820 P.2d 421 (1991) (noting Attorney General\u2019s concession that challenged statute was unconstitutional). The courts necessarily must use caution in awarding fees against the State in a \u201cgarden variety\u201d declaratory judgment action that challenges the constitutionality of a statute that the Attorney General, in the exercise of his executive power, has chosen to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\u00b618 The legislature has cabined this executive discretion by authorizing the courts to impose fees when the State\u2019s defense is frivolous or in bad faith. Section 25-10-711(l)(b), MCA. While not dispositive, this standard also serves as a guidepost in analyzing a claim for fees under the private attorney general doctrine. This Court reversed a fee award in <em>Dearborn Drainage Area </em>where, notwithstanding the ruling\u2019s potential \u201cfar reaching\u201d effects, the State, through the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, had \u201cacted in good faith and in accordance with constitutional and statutory mandates\u201d in representing the public\u2019s recreational use rights in the waters of Bean Lake. <em>Dearborn Drainage Area, </em>240 Mont. at 43, 782 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>P.2d at 900. In <em>Montrust, </em>on the other hand, we implied that since the private attorney general doctrine is an <em>equitable </em>exception to the American Rule, the statute was not controlling. <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\">\u00b619 <em>Montrust, </em>however, was not a \u201cgarden variety\u201d constitutional challenge to a legislative enactment. It involved unique issues raising the State\u2019s breach of fiduciary duties imposed by the Montana Constitution and federal enabling laws under which the federal government\u2019s grant of lands to Montana for support of common schools constitutes a trust for which the State is the trustee. <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14. As trustee, the State is obligated to obtain full market value for the school trust lands; the statutes in question were held to violate the State\u2019s constitutional obligation and its duty of undivided loyalty to the trust beneficiary. <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 32, 42, 51, 58. In contrast, we observed in <em>Finke </em>that fees against the State would not be appropriate under the private attorney general doctrine where \u201cthe only potential liability of the State for fees would lie for the actions of the Legislature in enacting an unconstitutional bill.\u201d <em>Finke, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b620  In this case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the State mounted a good faith defense to \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA. While the Attorney General did not prevail, it is difficult to conclude that his arguments were frivolous when five members of this Court were convinced of their merit. In the final analysis, even though ATP vindicated principles of constitutional magnitude, the State\u2019s defense also was grounded in constitutional principles and in an effort to enforce interests the executive deemed equally significant to its citizens. The Attorney General defended a statute with deep roots in the State\u2019s history, enacted by initiative of the people to combat corruption that had resulted in the bribery of state judges and the embarrassment of seeing one of the State\u2019s U.S. Senators unseated for also accepting bribes. <em>Western Tradition Partn., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23, 25. The challenge was brought in a time of shifting legal landscapes, the contours of which still have not finally been defined. Under these circumstances, the predicate for an award of fees under the private attorney general doctrine-\u201cwhen the government, for some reason, fails to properly enforce interests which are significant to its citizens\u201d-has not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b621  We reverse a district court for abusing its discretion only \u201cwhen it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason[,] resulting in substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>injustice.\u201d <em>B Bar J Ranch, LLC v. Carlisle Wide Plank Floors, Inc., </em>2012 MT 246, \u00b6 10, 366 Mont. 506, 288 P.3d 228. For the reasons discussed above, and given the District Court\u2019s express determination that the State\u2019s defense was meticulously researched, well presented, and made in good faith, we cannot conclude that equitable considerations required it to award fees against the State under either the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act or the private attorney general doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b622 The District Court\u2019s order declining to award attorneys\u2019 fees to the Cross-Appellants is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b140-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-11\"> Although ATP\u2019s renewed motion for fees also seeks a fee award under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, as prevailing parties in a proceeding to enforce 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, this argument was not raised in or decided by the District Court and we decline to consider it. <em>Robison </em>v. <em>Mont.

I believe the Court errs in three respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\u00b624 First, the District Court provided two distinct analyses of ATP\u2019s two distinct theories for seeking attorneys\u2019 fees: one under the private attorney general doctrine and the other under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (\u00a7 27-8-313, MCA). This Court provides <em>zero </em>analysis of the District Court\u2019s actual decision under the private attorney general doctrine. Moreover, the Court fails to conduct its own distinct analysis under this doctrine pursuant to the three <em>Montrust </em>factors. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 14; <em>Montanans for the Responsible Use of the Sch. Trust v. State ex rel. Bd. of Land Commrs. (Montrust), </em>1999 MT 263, \u00b6 67, 296 Mont. 402, 989 P.2d 800. Instead, the Court merges the private attorney general analysis into the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act analysis and thereby creates a sort of one-size-fits-all procedural \u201csmoothie\u201d for analyzing attorneys\u2019 fees requests under these two distinct doctrines.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\u00b625 Second, the Court further confuses matters by injecting \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, into this case. That statute provides an <em>independent </em>basis for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">(1) In any civil action brought by or against the state, a political subdivision, or an agency of the state or a political subdivision, the opposing party, whether plaintiff or defendant, is entitled to the costs enumerated in 25-10-201 and reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">(a) the opposing party prevails against the state, political subdivision, or agency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">(b) the court finds that the claim or defense of the state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>political subdivision, or agency that brought or defended the action was frivolous or pursued in bad faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-3\">(2) Costs may be granted pursuant to subsection (1) notwithstanding any other provision of the law to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aff\">Section 25-10-711, MCA. If ATP had sought an award of attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to this provision, then ATP would have been required to show (a) that it prevailed against the State and (b) that the State\u2019s defense was \u201cfrivolous or pursued in bad faith.\u201d What the Court apparently fails to appreciate, however, is the fact that ATP did <em>not </em>seek an award of attorneys\u2019 fees based on this statute. ATP relied, rather, on the private attorney general doctrine and the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. Hence, ATP was not required to show that the State\u2019s defense was \u201cfrivolous or pursued in bad faith.\u201d It was required, rather, to establish the elements of the two doctrines upon which it relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b626 Notably, the district court in <em>Montrust </em>denied an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, because the action involved \u201cneither frivolous conduct, extreme conduct, nor bad faith by the State.\u201d <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 60. On appeal, the State asserted the very proposition stated at \u00b6 10 of today\u2019s Opinion-namely, that a prevailing party may recover attorneys\u2019 fees against the State <em>only if </em>the court finds that the claim or defense of the State was frivolous or pursued in bad faith. <em>See Montrust, </em>\u00b6 63. In other words, the State suggested that \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, is a blanket limitation on an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the State under <em>any </em>theory-what the Court effectively holds in today\u2019s decision. The statute contains no such language, however, and we therefore rejected the State\u2019s proposition and instead adopted the private attorney general doctrine as a theory of recovery <em>distinct </em>from the entitlement to, and limitations on, an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA. <em>See Montrust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 64-67. We concluded that Montrust was entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under the private attorney general theory, <em>regardless of the district court\u2019s determination that the action involved \u201cneither frivolous conduct, extreme conduct, nor bad faith by the State.\u201d Montrust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 60, 69. The Court\u2019s contrary approach in its decision today throws this entire area of law into a state of utter disarray.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b627 Third, the Court denies relief under ATP\u2019s <em>private attorney general theory </em>based entirely on a sentence in the District Court\u2019s order that was <em>not </em>part of the District Court\u2019s reasoning under that theory. Specifically, the District Court observed that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s arguments were made in good faith and were supported by briefs that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>were meticulously researched, well written, and well argued.\u201d This statement might be relevant if ATP were pursuing a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA. ATP is not relying on this statute, however, as noted above. Furthermore, the District Court provided the foregoing quoted statement as its rationale for concluding that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees was not proper under ATP\u2019s <em>Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act theory. </em>The District Court provided an entirely separate analysis of the <em>private attorney general theory, </em>this Court simply chooses not to address the District Court\u2019s specific reasoning under that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b628 In short, and with due respect, I believe it is wrong-not to mention patently unfair-for this Court to reject ATP\u2019s argument for attorneys\u2019 fees based on the criteria of a statute (\u00a7 25-10-711, MCA) that ATP never even invoked. <em>Cf. Western Sec. Bank v. Eide Bailly LLP, </em>2010 MT 291, \u00b6\u00b6 73, 81, 359 Mont. 34, 249 P.3d 35 (Nelson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cIt will surely come as a surprise to Glacier, however, when it learns that it has lost this case because it failed to adequately support a claim that it never even raised! ... It is unfair to remake a plaintiffs cause of action into something it never was intended to be and then to deny the plaintiff relief for failing to adequately support this remade cause.\u201d). The Court completely muddles this area of law by blending the private attorney general doctrine and the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act doctrine into a single analysis and then superimposing on that analysis the \u201cfrivolous or pursued in bad faith\u201d criterion of \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA-contrary to our approach in <em>Montrust. </em>With this Opinion, we have effectively done away with the private attorney general doctrine. Like the majority of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Citizens United v. FEC, </em>558 U.S. 310, 130 S. Ct. 876 (2010), this Court has now remade this case so as to remake the law pertaining to the private attorney general doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b629 For the reasons which follow, I conclude and would hold that ATP is entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under a proper application of the criteria of the private attorney general doctrine, as set forth in <em>Montrust. </em>!</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The Private Attorney General Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u00b630 This Court adopted the private attorney general doctrine in <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 67. There are three factors to be considered in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees under this doctrine: (1) the strength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, and (3) the number of people standing to benefit from the decision. <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 66 (citing <em>Serrano v. Priest, </em>569 P.2d 1303, 1314 (Cal. 1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\">\u00b631 In the present case, the District Court concluded under the first factor that the issues here are clearly very important. Second, the District Court reasoned that because the Attorney General is required to defend the statute in question, private enforcement of the important constitutional rights at issue was required. Third, however, although the District Court had ruled in favor of ATP on the merits of its constitutional claim, the court opined that \u201cthere is no reasonable way of knowing \u2018the number of <em>people\u2019 </em>standing to benefit from this decision\u201d (emphasis in original). For this latter reason, the District Court denied an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the private attorney general doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b632 While I agree with the District Court\u2019s analysis as to the first factor, and agree with the District Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion under the second factor, I do not agree with the District Court\u2019s reasoning regarding the third factor. In my view, ATP has successfully answered all three factors. I address each one in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Factor 1</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b633 First, as to the strength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, it is hardly open to argument that ATP\u2019s lawsuit secured against the proscriptions of Montana\u2019s Corrupt Practices Act (in particular, \u00a7 13-35-227, MCA) the expansive right of corporations and associations-as decreed by the United States Supreme Court under the First Amendment in <em>Citizens </em>United-to use general treasury funds to make independent expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates. Absent this challenge, corporations and associations remained constrained and inhibited from making such independent expenditures in support of or against candidates in Montana. Moreover, as the Ninth Circuit has recently held, the loss of such First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, constitutes irreparable injury. <em>Sanders County Republican Cent. Comm. v. Bullock, </em>698 F.3d 741, 748 (9th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Factor 2</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u00b634 Second, as to the necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, the Attorney General\u2019s decision to defend the Corrupt Practices Act left ATP with no choice but to litigate its rights under <em>Citizens United. </em>Indeed, ATP took on the burden of vindicating the First Amendment rights of every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>corporation, association, and person<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the State of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b635 In this regard, I note my disagreement with the District Court\u2019s reasoning that this is a case in which the Attorney General was \u201crequired to defend the statute.\u201d I appreciate that it is the Attorney General\u2019s duty, generally, to defend the State and argue the validity of state statutes against attack. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-15-501, MCA. However, as the Court points out, the Attorney General has discretion in this regard and has even conceded that a challenged statute was unconstitutional. Opinion, \u00b6 17; <em>In re W.C., </em>206 Mont. 432, 439, 671 P.2d 621, 624 (1983); <em>Associated Press v. State, </em>250 Mont. 299, 300, 820 P.2d 421, 422 (1991). In the present case, given the clarity and breadth of the <em>Citizens United </em>decision and the fact that the Supreme Court in <em>Citizens United </em>rejected every one-not just some, but all-of the arguments for upholding \u00a7 13-35-227, MCA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I cannot understand how, much less agree with the proposition that, the Attorney General had any substantial grounds to defend the statute against ATP\u2019s challenge. Nor can I agree with the Court\u2019s suggestion that ATP\u2019s challenge was brought in a time of \u201cshifting legal landscapes.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20. The Supreme Court was very clear as to the breadth of its holding in <em>Citizens United. </em>The Attorney General, like other elected officials of this State, takes an oath to \u201csupport, protect and defend the constitution of the United States ....\u201d Mont. Const. art. Ill, \u00a7 3. The Constitution of the United States, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Citizens United, </em>is \u201cthe supreme Law of the Land ..., any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2.1 am not going to repeat my analysis in <em>Western Tradition Partn., Inc. v. Atty. Gen. of Montana, </em>2011 MT 328, \u00b6\u00b6 61-135, 363 Mont. 220, 271 P.3d 1 (Nelson, J., dissenting). Suffice it to say that, in my view, such analysis could just as easily have been undertaken and adopted by the Attorney General (as a host of other state attorneys general did), with the result that ATP\u2019s litigation in the District Court would not have been necessary, ATP\u2019s appeal to this Court would not have been necessary, and ATP\u2019s appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States would not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">\u00b636 In any event, the important point is that the Attorney General\u2019s decision to defend the law made it necessary for ATP to enforce its rights under <em>Citizens United. </em>As for the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, the State contends that ATP\u2019s burden was negligible because ATP\u2019s attorneys \u201clitigated this case only minimally. Plaintiffs conducted no discovery, swore out a couple of bare-bones affidavits, and in their two summary judgment briefs below made no legal arguments not already contained within the <em>Citizens United </em>opinion itself.\u201d According to the State, \u201c[t]his is far from the typical case of private attorney general doctrine fee awards, which involves \u2018significant legal costs\u2019 resulting from extensive discovery, expert testimony, and often trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b637 There are two flaws in the State\u2019s argument. First, the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff must be considered in relative terms. Here, the burden on ATP was significant if one considers that ATP should not have been forced to pursue this action in the first place. According to the Supreme Court, the Attorney General\u2019s arguments for upholding \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA, \u201ceither were already rejected in <em>Citizens United, </em>or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.\u201d <em>Am. Tradition, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2491. Yet, despite the clarity and breadth of the <em>Citizens United </em>decision, the Attorney General took the position that Montana\u2019s ban on independent expenditures is constitutional and enforceable. Regardless of the Attorney General\u2019s rationale behind this decision, the undisputed result was that ATP had to incur the burden of litigating its rights-not only in the District Court, but also in appeals to this Court and the Supreme Court-against arguments that \u201ceither were already rejected in <em>Citizens United, </em>or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.\u201d <em>Am. Tradition, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2491. In my view, given these facts, the magnitude of the burden was great.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b638 Second, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that ATP\u2019s burden was \u201cminimal,\u201d adopting the State\u2019s approach would give plaintiffs in these sorts of cases an incentive to run up \u201csignificant legal costs\u201d-even if the costs are unnecessary-in order to strengthen their claim for attorneys\u2019 fees under the private attorney general doctrine. In a case, such as the present one, which otherwise qualifies under that doctrine, the plaintiff should not be penalized for failing to incur \u201csignificant legal costs\u201d in the process. It is truly ironic that the State is here complaining that ATP\u2019s legal bills are not high enough. Such an approach to the private attorney general doctrine would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>be in the taxpayers\u2019 best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b639 For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that the necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff weigh in ATP\u2019s favor. The Supreme Court spoke unequivocally in <em>Citizens </em>United; Montana chose to challenge the application of <em>Citizens United </em>to Montana; and, predictably, Montana lost. Montana should not now be heard to argue that ATP is not entitled to its attorneys\u2019 fees for successfully litigating a case that, in my view, ATP should not have been forced to litigate in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Factor 3</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b640 Finally, the third factor concerns the number of people standing to benefit from the decision. There is no question that every corporation and association in Montana-and, due to ATP\u2019s appeal to the Supreme Court, every corporation and association in the United States-benefited from ATP\u2019s filing and pursuance of this litigation. As a result of the instant lawsuit, each corporation and association has been guaranteed the ability to exercise, at the state level, the rights decreed in <em>Citizens United, </em>given that the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of this Court\u2019s decision removed any lingering doubt-implausible as that doubt may have been<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>-about whether the application of <em>Citizens United </em>was limited to federal elections. <em>See Am. Tradition, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2491 (\u201cThe question presented in this case is whether the holding of <em>Citizens United </em>applies to the Montana state law. There can be no serious doubt that it does.\u201d (citing the Supremacy clause, U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u00b641 As noted, the District Court concluded that the third factor was not met because \u201cthere is no reasonable way of knowing \u2018the number of <em>people\u2019 </em>standing to benefit\u201d from the District Court\u2019s ruling in favor of ATP on the merits of its constitutional claim (emphasis in original). The District Court, however, cited no authority for its apparent premise that the term \u201cpeople\u201d in Montrust\u2019s third factor is limited to human beings. The District Court, it appears, simply assumed this to be true without analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u00b642 Setting aside the controversial question whether corporations and associations are \u201cpersons,\u201d however, the District Court overlooked a fundamental point of the <em>Citizens United </em>decision. As I recently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>discussed in <em>Montanans Opposed to I-166 v. Bullock, </em>2012 MT 168, \u00b6\u00b6 20-25, 365 Mont. 520, 285 P.3d 435 (Nelson, J., dissenting), <em>Citizens United </em>was not just about the rights of <em>corporations </em>and <em>associations </em>to speak. More importantly, it was about the rights of <em>citizens </em>to hear and obtain information about candidates from diverse sources without governmental censorship. Indeed, the <em>Citizens United </em>decision rested on two propositions: first, that expenditures (by a person or an organization) on political communication are a form of \u201cspeech\u201d; and second, that \u201ccitizens [have the right] to inquire, <em>to hear, </em>to speak, and to use information to reach consensus.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898 (emphasis added). These propositions were not created in <em>Citizens United. </em>Rather, they can be traced to <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S. Ct. 612 (1976) (per curiam), and <em>First Natl. Bank v. Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 98 S. Ct. 1407 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">\u00b643 Of particular significance to the present discussion, the Supreme Court observed in <em>Bellotti </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\">[t]he court below framed the principal question in this case as whether and to what extent corporations have First Amendment rights. We believe that the court posed the wrong question. <em>The Constitution often protects interests broader than those of the party seeking their vindication. </em>The First Amendment, in particular, serves significant societal interests. The proper question therefore is not whether corporations \u201chave\u201d First Amendment rights and, if so, whether they are coextensive with those of natural persons. Instead, the question must be whether [the state statute at issue] abridges expression that the First Amendment was meant to protect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">435 U.S. at 775-76, 98 S. Ct. at 1415 (emphasis added). The <em>Bellotti </em>Court stated further that \u201c[t]he inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual,\u201d 435 U.S. at 777, 98 S. Ct. at 1416, and that \u201cthe First Amendment goes beyond protection of the press and the self-expression of individuals to prohibit government from <em>limiting the stock of information from which members of the public may draw,\u201d </em>435 U.S. at 783, 98 S. Ct. at 1419 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b644 Likewise, the Supreme Court stated in <em>Citizens United </em>that \u201cit is inherent in the nature of the political process that <em>voters </em>must be free <em>to obtain information </em>from diverse sources in order to determine how to cast their votes\u201d and that the First Amendment does not allow \u201cthe exclusion of a class of speakers from the general public dialogue.\u201d 130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>S. Ct. at 899 (emphases added). The Supreme Court observed that the First Amendment protects the \u201copen marketplace\u201d of ideas, <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 899, and prohibits restrictions on political speech based on the speaker\u2019s identity, <em>Citizens United, 130 S. </em>Ct. at 902-03. Because voters must be free to obtain information from diverse sources, it is a violation of the First Amendment to control expression by distinguishing among different speakers and the subjects upon which they may speak. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898-99. The Supreme Court held that this country\u2019s law and tradition require more expression, not less, <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 911, and that \u201c[w]hen Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command <em>where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, </em>it uses censorship to control thought,\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AIv\">\u00b645 Clearly, then, the constitutional rights protected by the <em>Citizens United </em>decision are not just those of corporations; they are those of \u201cpeople.\u201d And the District Court was clearly wrong, therefore, in suggesting that \u201cpeople\u201d do not stand to benefit from the District Court\u2019s decision in favor of ATP or that there is no reasonable way of knowing \u201cthe number\u201d of people standing to benefit from that decision. As a matter of federal constitutional law, <em>all </em>Montana citizens-at least, every <em>voter </em>in Montana-benefitted from the District Court\u2019s decision in favor of ATP under <em>Citizens United. </em>By virtue of the District Court\u2019s decision, which the Supreme Court has now tacitly affirmed, the State of Montana may not \u201cuse its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908. The State no longer may \u201climit[ ] the stock of information from which members of the public may draw\u201d when making their electoral decisions. <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. at 783, 98 S. Ct. at 1419. ATP\u2019s successful lawsuit vindicated not only the rights of corporations and associations to make independent expenditures in support of or against candidates, but also the First Amendment rights of the \u201cpeople\u201d of Montana to receive information about candidates from diverse sources without governmental censorship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">\u00b646 Based on the foregoing analysis, I conclude that the private attorney general doctrine applies to ATP\u2019s lawsuit. Accordingly, I would reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees. I would remand for a factual determination of ATP\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and for the entry of judgment in ATP\u2019s favor and against the State.
