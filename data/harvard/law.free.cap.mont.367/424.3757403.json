Lozon argues his conviction should be reversed because the District Court admitted the video of the Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test administration without sound over Lozon\u2019s objection. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by partially denying Lozon\u2019s motion in limine to exclude video footage depicting administration of the PAST?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">\u00b64 On July 6, 2010, Lozon was stopped by Officer Reichert after failing to stop at a stop sign in Hamilton. After noting that Lozon\u2019s movements were labored and he had glassy and bloodshot eyes, Officer Reichert asked Lozon if he had been drinking. Lozon stated he had two-and-a-half beers earlier in the evening. Officer Reichert asked Lozon to perform several standardized field sobriety tests, including the horizontal gaze nystagmus, which Lozon failed. Lozon agreed to perform the Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test (PAST)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and he registered a blood alcohol level of .153. Officer Reichert arrested Lozon and transported him to the Ravalli County Detention Center where Lozon refused to perform additional field sobriety tests and would not provide an Intoxilyzer 8000 breath sample. Lozon was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">\u00b65 Ajury found Lozon guilty of DUI in Hamilton City Court in March 2011. Lozon appealed to the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Ravalli County, and a new trial was scheduled for August 2011. Before trial, Lozon filed a motion in limine requesting the court to redact all portions of the in-car or \u201cfield\u201d video during which the PAST and the horizontal gaze nystagmus test were administered or discussed. Lozon also requested the court to redact a portion of the jail video in which Lozon refers to his PAST results. The State, through the City of Hamilton (State), opposed the motion. The District Court granted the motion to redact all footage of the administration and discussion of the horizontal gaze nystagmus and all references to the PAST results, but denied the request to redact all video footage of the administration of the PAST.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b66 At the District Court trial, Officer Reichert testified, describing his professional training and experience. He explained generally the administration of the walk-and-turn and the one-leg stand, two standardized field sobriety tests. Officer Reichert then testified that Lozon\u2019s performance on both of these standardized field sobriety tests indicated impairment. No expert testimony about the PAST was offered. The in-car video was then played for the jury. The video showed Lozon performing the standardized field sobriety tests. The State switched to a blank screen during the horizontal gaze nystagmus portion of the video. The sound was muted during the portion of the video showing Officer Reichert administering the PAST. After the PAST was administered, the video depicted the results being shown to Lozon. He was told to sit on the bumper of the police cruiser and shortly afterwards was placed under arrest. The PAST results were not revealed to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b67 During deliberations, the jury sent a question to the court asking, \u201c[c]an we know the results of the field breathalyzer? Why/why not?\u201d The court responded in writing: \u201cNo. The Montana Supreme Court generally limits the use of PAST (\u201cfield breathalyzer\u201d) results to an estimation of a person\u2019s alcohol concentration for purposes of establishing probable cause.\u201d The jury found Lozon guilty of DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b68 Lozon appeals the District Court\u2019s partial denial of his motion in limine to exclude the video of the PAST administration, which was played without sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u00b69 A district court\u2019s ruling on a motion in limine is an evidentiary ruling and the district court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible. <em>State v. Weldele, </em>2003 MT 117, \u00b6 41, 315 Mont. 452, 69 P.3d 1162. \u201c[I]t is within the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>court\u2019s sound discretion to determine whether an adequate foundation has been established to warrant admissibility of evidence.\u201d <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6 43 <em>(citing State v. Delaney, </em>1999 MT 317, \u00b6 14, 297 Mont. 263, 991 P.2d 461). We will not disturb a district court\u2019s determination on the admissibility of evidence absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Snell, </em>2004 MT 334, \u00b6 17, 324 Mont. 173, 103 P.3d 503. \u201cAbuse of discretion occurs if a district court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>2011 MT 36, \u00b6 12, 359 Mont. 281, 248 P.3d 850 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by partially denying Lozon\u2019s motion in limine to exclude video footage depicting administration of the PAST?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u00b611 Lozon notes that PAST results are not admissible as substantive evidence unless the State presents testimony that establishes PAST accuracy and reliability under M. R. Evid. 702. Lozon argues that the video of the PAST administration, played without sound, was used as substantive evidence because \u201cit proved the element that Lozon was \u2018under the influence\u2019\u201d and permitted the jury to infer that Lozon was above the legal limit when he was arrested shortly afterwards. He argues that the State \u201cdid not provide the requisite evidence to establish PAST reliability and accuracy, therefore the district court abused its discretion when it admitted the PAST video.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\u00b612 The State responds that the \u201cvideo evidence at issue here is not evidence of a PAST <em>result\u201d </em>and \u201c[e]xpert testimony is not required to admit Lozon\u2019s on-screen video depicting real-time interactions with an investigating officer.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The State contends that the District Court \u201cdid not abuse its discretion in allowing the jury to view relevant video footage of Reichert\u2019s total DUI field investigation that included administration of the PAST.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u00b613  The admission of audio-visual evidence is generally within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>City of Missoula v. Forest, </em>236 Mont. 129, 134-36, 769 P.2d 699 (1989) (citing <em>State v. Warwick, </em>158 Mont. 531, 494 P.2d 627 (1972)). Audio-video evidence is generally admissible to assist the trier of fact because it demonstrates the person\u2019s mannerisms, including speech and performance on sobriety tests. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>237 Mont. 384, 386-87, 773 P.2d 722, 723-24 (1989); <em>see also State v. Devlin, </em>1999 MT 90, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 21, 294 Mont. 215, 980 P.2d 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u00b614 PAST results may be introduced to establish probable cause for arrest. <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6 50. \u201cBefore a [PAST] result may be admitted as substantive evidence, however, a court must conduct a conventional Rule 702, M. R. Evid., analysis and the test result must be demonstrably accurate and reliable and meet all other admissibility requirements.\u201d <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, \u00b6 25, 328 Mont. 276, 119 P.3d 1194 (citing <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6 57). In <em>Weldele, </em>we noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">[PASTs] are qualitatively different from [other standardized] field [sobriety] tests, which call for a subjective analysis of a person\u2019s behavior. A [PAST] utilizes a scientific instrument to test a person\u2019s chemistry. In this scientific age, it is indisputable that, fairly or not, the result of a [PAST], given its scientific nature, will be weighed heavily by a jury and will likely be accorded more weight than the other field tests. We conclude, therefore, that our many concerns pertaining to the [PAST], i.e., its unreliability, lack of regulation and potentially inappropriate evidentiary weight, are not addressed or cured by admitting the [PAST] result into evidence in conjunction with the arresting officer\u2019s observations and field sobriety test results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\"><em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6 55. This reasoning invokes M. R. Evid. 403, which provides: \u201c[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b615 Although Lozon\u2019s blood alcohol content level from the PAST was not revealed to the jury, we agree with Lozon that the evidence prompted a jury inference that he had failed the PAST. The video of the PAST administration, followed closely by Lozon\u2019s arrest, raised a compelling inference that he was over the legal blood alcohol limit. Thus, the video was impermissibly used as substantive evidence of Lozon\u2019s intoxication without the State satisfying the requirement of <em>Damon </em>and M. R. Evid. 702 to call an expert to testify regarding the reliability and accuracy of the PAST. Further, as we cautioned in <em>Weldele, </em>it is likely that the jury placed inappropriate weight on the fact that Lozon was arrested. following the PAST and concluded therefrom that Lozon was over the legal limit. During deliberations, the jury asked if it could be given the result of Lozon\u2019s PAST and, if not, asked the reason this information would be withheld. While the video was relevant to the State\u2019s case, the potential for unfair prejudice by that portion of the video showing the PAST administration followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>almost immediately by Lozon\u2019s arrest outweighed its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"ACg\">\u00b616 The State does not argue harmless error, but Lozon wisely does, and we believe this issue should be addressed, in light of our precedent. In both <em>Weldele </em>and <em>State v. </em>Crawford, 2003 MT 118, 315 Mont. 480, 68 P.3d 848, we considered whether the erroneous admission of PAST or PBT evidence was harmless under <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6 59; <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 19. Under <em>Van Kirk, </em>we first determine whether the error was \u201cstructural\u201d or \u201ctrial\u201d error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 37. Here, the error occurred when the jury viewed the video during trial, which constitutes trial error, as we also determined in <em>Weldele </em>and <em>Crawford. Weldele, </em>\u00b6 61; <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 19. Then, to determine whether the erroneous admission of evidence prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, \u201cwe apply the \u2018cumulative evidence test\u2019 which determines whether the fact-finder was presented with admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence proved.\u201d <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6 40 (citing <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43). \u201cMoreover, the State must also demonstrate that the <em>quality </em>of the tainted evidence was such that there was no reasonable possibility that it might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 44 (emphasis in original). The State bears the burden of \u201cdemonstrat[ing] that the error at issue was not prejudicial.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b617 We concluded that the error was harmless and non-prejudicial in <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6 63, but that the error was prejudicial and therefore reversible in <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 22. In <em>Weldele, </em>the State also introduced the arresting officer\u2019s field observations, the results of the defendant\u2019s standardized field sobriety tests, and the defendant\u2019s Intoxilyzer results to prove the element of intoxication for DUI. <em>Weldele, </em>f 63. We found that the Intoxilyzer results independently established the element of intoxication and the erroneously admitted PAST results were non-prejudicial and harmless. <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6 63. In <em>Crawford, </em>the defendant refused to provide an Intoxilyzer sample and we held that the erroneous admission of the PAST evidence was prejudicial despite the State\u2019s introduction of the arresting officer\u2019s field observations, the results from the defendant\u2019s standardized field sobriety tests, and the defendant\u2019s admission he had been drinking. <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 22. The State could not demonstrate \u201cthat the tainted evidence would not have contributed to Crawford\u2019s conviction,\u201d and thus the error required reversal. <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b618  Here, as noted above, the State\u2019s presentation of the PAST evidence improperly became substantive evidence of the intoxication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>element of driving under the influence, and the State must demonstrate that, qualitatively, the tainted evidence of the PAST would not have contributed to the conviction. In addition to the portions of the video properly admitted, the State notes it introduced Officer Reichert\u2019s testimony about Lozon\u2019s driving errors and his physical condition, the standardized field sobriety test results, Lozon\u2019s admission he had been drinking, and his refusal to provide a later breath sample. This refusal left the State without Intoxilyzer results.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah5\">\u00b619  The error that resulted here was the prompting of the inference that Lozon had failed the PAST. While the other evidence introduced by the State may have cumulatively and conclusively proven the element of intoxication necessary to support a DUI conviction, it did not constitute \u201cadmissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 44; <em>see also Weldele, </em>\u00b6 63. Further, we conclude that the State has not \u201cdemonstrate^] that the <em>quality of </em>the tainted evidence was such that there was no reasonable possibility that it might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 44 (emphasis in original). Therefore, the admission of the PAST evidence by video was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b620 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b450-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT, MORRIS and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-15\"> This Court\u2019s previous decisions involving field beathalyzer tests have used PAST and preliminary breath test (PBT) interchangeably.
