The court also ordered that Claassen be designated a Level 3 sexual offender. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">\u00b62 Claassen raises the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err by elevating Claassen\u2019s sexual offender level designation from Level 1 to Level 3 upon revocation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">\u00b64 On March 25, 2004, the State charged Claassen by Information with one count of Sexual Abuse of Children, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-625(l)(e), MCA. Claassen pled guilty to the charge on April 8, 2005, pursuant to a plea agreement with the State. Prior to sentencing, the District Court ordered the completion of a psychosexual evaluation and a presentence investigation report (PSI).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">\u00b65 Dr. Michael Scolatti completed the psychosexual evaluation of Claassen. Dr. Scolatti determined that Claassen was a Level 1 sexual offender with a low risk to re-offend. The PSI offered several treatment recommendations, and indicated that Claassen was an appropriate candidate for outpatient sexual offender treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">\u00b66 Probation and Parole Officer Heather Ostwalt compiled Claassen\u2019s PSI, and concluded that the plea agreement\u2019s recommendation of a seven-year sentence to the DOC, with two years suspended, was an appropriate sentence. Among the many conditions she recommended for the period of community supervision was the requirement that Claassen follow all of the recommendations of Dr. Scolatti\u2019s evaluation, engage in sexual offender treatment, and refrain from using or possessing pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">\u00b67 At the sentencing hearing, the District Court sentenced Claassen to the DOC for a period of seven years, with two years suspended upon several terms and conditions. One of these conditions required that Claassen \u201cnot use or possess any pornography, erotica, x-rated videos, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>adult books or magazines ....\u201d During the oral pronouncement of the sentence on August 30, 2005, the District Court designated Claassen a Level 1 sexual offender in accordance with Scolatti\u2019s evaluation and recommendation. The court did not include the level designation in its written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b68 Claassen was discharged to serve his two-year suspended sentence in July, 2010. On December 15, 2010, Claassen\u2019s probation officers conducted a routine home visit at Claassen\u2019s motel room and found Claassen in possession of child pornography. On December 21, 2010, Claassen was terminated from his community-based sexual offender treatment. In the termination letter, Claassen\u2019s treatment provider, Dr. Bob Bakko, stated that Claassen was a \u201cdanger to supervise and or treat in the community and should be incarcerated.\u201d Dr. Bakko recommended that based on the evidence seized on December 15 and Claassen\u2019s treatment progress, Claassen should be designated a Level 3 sexual offender. Probation Officer Michelle Downey, who filed the report of violation pertaining to the home visit on December 15, 2010, submitted the letter from Dr. Bakko to the court with her report.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b69 On January 4, 2011, the State petitioned the District Court to revoke Claassen\u2019s suspended sentence, alleging, in part, that Claassen violated the no-pornography condition of his sentence. Prior to the District Court\u2019s hearings on the matter, the federal government got involved and charged Claassen with receipt of child pornography based on the discovery during the home visit on December 15,2010. Claassen pled guilty to this charge and was sentenced in December, 2011, to serve a 20-year term in federal prison, which was ordered to run consecutively to any sentence imposed by the State District Court. \u00b610 On January 17, 2012, the District Court held an evidentiary hearing at which it found Claassen in violation of the conditions of his sentence. At the disposition hearing held two days later, Officer Downey testified and recommended the court revoke Claassen\u2019s suspended sentence. Further, she stated that she agreed with Dr. Bakko\u2019s recommendation that Claassen be designated a Level 3 sexual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b611 At the conclusion of the disposition hearing, the State asked the court to revoke Claassen\u2019s suspended sentence and modify his sexual offender level designation, elevating it from Level 1 to Level 3. Claassen responded by arguing, in part, against altering his level designation. Specifically, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">And the level in terms of the tier level, we simply ask the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>to not to [sic] adjust the tier level that was previously ordered here in Court. Defendant is in federal custody and I imagine they\u2019ll make their own decision on what tier he is. He\u2019s on their supervision now at this point. And we object to the tier level being modified as there has been an expert who testified regarding the increase in tier level space.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b612 The court revoked Claassen\u2019s suspended sentence and committed him to the DOC for a period of two years to run consecutively to his federal sentence. It also ordered, \u201c[b]ased on the report of Dr. Bob Bakko, ... Defendant is designated a Tier Level III Sex Offender.\u201d During the revocation proceedings, the District Court did not order the completion of a new PSI or sexual offender evaluation report.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b613 Claassen timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b614 We review criminal sentences that include at least one year of actual incarceration for legality only, which is generally a review for correctness. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>2011 MT 277, \u00b6 18, 362 Mont. 416, 264 P.3d 1146 (citing <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6\u00b6 174-75, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815). As a question of law, we review de novo whether the sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, the sentence falls within the statutory parameters, and the court adhered to the statutory mandates. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 174-75).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court err by elevating Claassen\u2019s sexual offender level designation from Level 1 to Level 3 upon revocation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">\u00b616 As an initial matter, both parties agree the oral pronouncement of Claassen\u2019s 2005 sentence is the valid, final judgment. \u201c[T]he sentence orally pronounced from the bench in the presence of the defendant is the legally effective sentence and valid, final judgment.\u201d <em>State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6 40, 288 Mont. 286, 957 P.2d 9. In situations in which a conflict exists between the oral or written judgments, the oral judgment controls. <em>State v. Kroll, </em>2004 MT 203, \u00b6 18, 322 Mont. 294, 95 P.3d 717. Here, when the District Court orally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>pronounced its sentence for Claassen\u2019s 2005 sexual abuse of children conviction, it designated Claassen a Level 1 sexual offender. Although this designation was not incorporated in the court\u2019s written order, it was nonetheless still a part of the legally effective and valid judgment. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement designating Claassen a Level 1 sexual offender on August 30, 2005, remained a part of his sentence until the court revoked Claassen\u2019s sentence and designated him a Level 3 offender at the disposition hearing on January 19, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b617 On appeal, Claassen challenges the District Comb\u2019s modification of his sexual offender level designation during his revocation. Specifically, Claassen claims the District Court exceeded its statutory authority by elevating him from a Level 1 to a Level 3 without ordering a new PSI and psychosexual evaluation prior to the disposition hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">f 18 In response, the State first argues that Claassen\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s modification of his sexual offender level is not reviewable on appeal because he failed to properly preserve the issue. Although the State acknowledges that Claassen objected to the modification of his tier level before the District Court, it claims the objection was too general to preserve his argument for appeal. Claassen counters that his objection was sufficiently detailed and, moreover, that he is allowed to bolster his preserved issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b619 In Montana, we generally refuse to consider issues presented for the first time on appeal because it is \u201c \u2018fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Baze, </em>2011 MT 52, \u00b6 9, 359 Mont. 411, 251 P.3d 122 (quoting <em>State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683). In order to preserve an objection for appeal, a party must state grounds for the objection that are sufficiently specific. <em>In re B.I., </em>2009 MT 350, \u00b6 16, 353 Mont. 183, 218 P.3d 1235. A general objection to an alleged error is not sufficient. <em>In re B.I., </em>\u00b6 16. However, we have held that parties may \u201cbolster their preserved issues with additional legal authority or to make further arguments within the scope of the legal theory articulated to the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>2010 MT 193, \u00b6 12, 357 Mont. 348, 239 P.3d 929 (citing <em>Becker v. Rosebud Operating Servs., </em>2008 MT 285, \u00b6 18, 345 Mont. 368, 191 P.3d 435 (\u201cWhile some specific arguments Becker offers on appeal were not offered in the District Court, we cannot conclude that Becker\u2019s overall theory or claim has significantly changed.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u00b620 Here, Claassen objected to the District Court\u2019s modification of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>tier level during the disposition hearing. The grounds raised in his objection were: 1) that Claassen was in federal custody for his new conviction and subject to a federal determination of his tier level; and 2) that the District Court did not hear any expert testimony regarding an increase in his tier level prior to modifying it. On appeal, the focus of Claassen\u2019s argument is that it was not within the District Court\u2019s statutory authority to change his tier level because the court did not consider a new PSI and psychosexual evaluation. We determine that Claassen\u2019s appeal \u201cdoes not amount to such a significant change in legal theory that we must decline to consider his appeal.\u201d <em>Becker, </em>2008 MT 285 \u00b6 18; accord <em>H &amp; H Dev., LLC v. Ramlow, </em>2012 MT 51, \u00b6 15, 364 Mont. 283, 272 P.3d 657. We now turn to the merits of Claassen\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b621 Claassen first argues that pursuant to Montana\u2019s sentencing statutes-specifically, \u00a7 46-18-111(1), and \u00a7 46-23-509(3)(a), (b), MCA-the District Court was required to consider a PSI and psychosexual evaluation before sentencing him and designating his tier level. Although he recognizes these mandates are not included in \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, the statute that governs revocation proceedings, he claims \u201cspecific statutes regarding tier level designations control over the general revocation statute.\u201d Claassen cites \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA, to support his assertion, which provides that \u201c[i]n the construction of a statute, the intention of the legislature is to be pursued if possible. When a general and particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former, so a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it.\u201d Our role is simply to interpret and apply the statutes as written and consistent with legislative intent. <em>Ford v. Sentry Cas. Co., </em>2012 MT 156, \u00b6 68, 365 Mont. 405, 282 P.3d 687 (citing \u00a7 1-2-101, -102, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b622 Here, the plain language of the statutes at issue shows the Legislature intended for them to apply to different situations. Section 46-18-111(1), MCA, requires the district court order a PSI report \u201c[u]pon the acceptance of a plea or upon a verdict or finding of guilty to one or more felony offenses ....\u201d An \u201coffense\u201d is defined in Title 46 as \u201ca violation of any penal statute of this state or any ordinance of its political subdivisions,\u201d \u00a7 46-1-202(15), MCA, and does not include a probation violation in this context, because conditions of a suspended sentence are not penal statutes or ordinances. <em>State v. Boulton, </em>2006 MT 170, \u00b6 16, 332 Mont. 538, 140 P.3d 482 (citing <em>State v. Watts, </em>221 Mont. 104, 107, 717 P.2d 24, 26 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b623 Section 46-23-509(2), MCA, provides that \u201c[p]rior to sentencing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>a person convicted of a sexual offense,\u201d a sexual offender evaluation must be completed. Section 46-23-509(3), MCA, further requires that \u201c[u]pon sentencing the offender,\u201d the district court must review the report and designate the offender a Level 1, 2, or 3. In probation revocation hearings involving defendants previously convicted of a sexual offense, the defendants are not being sentenced for their violation of the sexual offender law, but rather their violation of the conditions of their parole or probation. As we have stated on numerous occasions, a revocation proceeding is not a criminal adjudication designed to punish a defendant for violation of a criminal law, but rather a \u201c \u2018purely administrative action designed to determine whether a parolee or probationer has violated the conditions of his parole or probation ....\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Cook, </em>2012 MT 34, \u00b6 16, 364 Mont. 161, 272 P.3d 50 (quoting <em>State v. Haagenson, </em>2010 MT 95, \u00b6 15, 356 Mont. 177, 232 P.3d 367). Section 46-23-509(2), (3), MCA, applies to the sentencing proceeding when the district court is sentencing \u201ca person convicted of a sexual offense,\u201d not a person who violated their conditions of parole or probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b624 By contrast, \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, applies later when the district court decides if a defendant violated the terms of the original suspended sentence. <em>See State v. Roberts, </em>2010 MT 110, \u00b6 12, 356 Mont. 290, 233 P.3d 324. The statute states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoV\">46-18-203 Revocation of suspended or deferred sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">(7) (a) If the judge finds [at the hearing on revocation] that the offender has violated the terms and conditions of the suspended or deferred sentence, the judge may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">(iii) revoke the suspension of sentence and require the offender to serve either the sentence imposed or any sentence that could have been imposed that does not include a longer imprisonment or commitment term than the original sentence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">(9) The provisions of this section apply to any offender whose suspended or deferred sentence is subject to revocation regardless of the date of the offender\u2019s conviction and regardless of the terms and conditions of the offender\u2019s original sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The statute specifically describes the requirements that must be followed in revocation proceedings, and provides what judges may do if they find the offender violated the terms and conditions of a suspended sentence. \u201cThe revocation of a suspended sentence is \u2018particularly and expressly governed\u2019 by \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA... and that statute defines the district court\u2019s options in a revocation proceeding.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Roberts, 2010 MT 110, \u00b6 12, 356 Mont. 290, 233 P.3d 324 (quoting <em>State v. Seals, </em>2007 MT 71, \u00b6 15, 336 Mont. 416, 156 P.3d 15) <em>(citing State v. Letasky, </em>2007 MT 51, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 336 Mont. 178, 152 P.3d 1288).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b625  We therefore determine that Claassen\u2019s revocation hearing was governed by \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, and not by \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-111(1), and 46-23-509(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b626 Claassen argues in his reply brief that even under \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, the District Court\u2019s elevation of his tier level was in error. He claims the statute prohibits an increased restriction on an offender\u2019s liberty upon revocation beyond the term of the original sentence. Citing <em>State v. Samples, </em>2008 MT 416, 347 Mont. 292, 198 P.3d 803, Claassen maintains that increasing an offender\u2019s tier level upon revocation imposes a greater restriction on the offender\u2019s liberty and is therefore not within the court\u2019s statutory authority. Claassen\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, is incorrect, and his argument therefore flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b627  The plain language of \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA, provides that if an offender violates the terms of a suspended sentence, a judge can revoke the suspended sentence and order the offender \u201cto serve either the sentence imposed or any sentence that could have been imposed <em>that does not include a longer imprisonment or commitment term than the original sentence ...\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Claassen correctly points out that in <em>Samples, </em>we recognized there is a liberty interest at stake when a person is designated a sexual offender level. <em>Samples, </em>\u00b6 34. A level designation \u201cplaces a burden on offenders to update their registration or face criminal sanctions.\u201d <em>Samples, </em>\u00b6 34. The extent of the burden depends on their level. <em>Samples, </em>\u00b6 34. However, although an increase in tier level increases the burden on the offender, it does not increase the imprisonment or commitment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>term, which is what \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA, expressly prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"AYt\">\u00b628  Here, the District Court did not impose a longer imprisonment or commitment term at the revocation hearing. Its order that Claassen be designated a Level 3 sexual offender is a sentence that \u201ccould have been imposed\u201d during his original sentencing for sexual abuse of children. Therefore, the District Court did not err by elevating Claassen\u2019s sexual offender level designation upon revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b629 For the reasons stated above, we affirm the District Court\u2019s Order designating Claassen a Level III sexual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b630 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-11\"> Both parties note in their appellate briefs that, in actuality, there was no expert testimony at the hearings. Therefore, as the State contends, the statement in the transcript from the disposition hearing stating that \u201cthere has been an expert who testified regarding ....\u201d was likely a stenographic or transcription error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\"> The State argues that because Claassen committed the underlying offense between December 2002 and September 2003, the 2001 version of the MCA governs his original sentence and his revocation. However, \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA (2011), contains an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>express retroactivity provision. Therefore, all references to \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, are to the 2011 version. Because we generally apply the law in effect at the time a crime was committed, <em>State v. Stoner, </em>2012 MT 162, \u00b6 12, 365 Mont. 465, 285 P.3d 402, all other statutory references in this Opinion are to the 2001 MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
