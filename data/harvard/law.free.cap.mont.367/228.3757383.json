In 2010 they sued the State of Montana, complaining that they are unable to obtain protections and benefits that are available to similarly- situated different-sex couples who marry under State law. Plaintiffs expressly do not challenge Montana law\u2019s restriction of marriage to heterosexual couples, do not seek the opportunity to marry, and do not seek the designation of marriage for their relationships. They contend however that there is a \u201cstatutory structure\u201d in Montana law that prohibits them from enjoying \u201csignificant relationship and family protections and obligations automatically provided to similarly-situated different-sex couples who marry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">\u00b62 Plaintiffs contend that this statutory structure interferes with their rights under Article II of the Montana Constitution, including their rights to equal protection, due process, and the rights to privacy, dignity and the pursuit of life\u2019s necessities. They seek a declaration that the State\u2019s failure to provide them access to the statutory scheme available to different-sex couples denies them the rights guaranteed by Article II. They seek an injunction prohibiting the State from continuing to deny them access to the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">\u00b63 The District Court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The District Court noted that Plaintiffs do not seek a declaration that any specific statutes are unconstitutional. The District Court concluded that granting the relief sought-ordering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Legislature to enact a statutory scheme to address Plaintiffs\u2019 goals of achieving equal treatment-would be an inappropriate exercise of judicial power. Doing so, according to the District Court, would run afoul of the separation of powers required by Article III, section 1 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b64 The District Court was also concerned that granting broad declaratory relief would likely impact a large number of statutes in potentially unknown and unintended ways. In the District Court proceedings Plaintiffs parenthetically listed a number of Montana statutes that they contend are within the \u201cstatutory scheme\u201d that denies them equal access to rights and responsibilities. The District Court concluded, however that \u201cwhat plaintiffs want here is not a declaration of the unconstitutionality of a specific statute or set of statutes but rather a direction to the legislature to enact a statutory arrangement.\u201d The District Court determined that while this had some appeal, such relief was \u201cunprecedented and uncharted in Montana law.\u201d The District Court concluded that \u201cthe proper ways to deal with Plaintiffs\u2019 concerns are specific suits directed at specific, identifiable statutes.\u201d Plaintiffs appealed after the District Court denied their motion to alter or amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b65 On appeal Plaintiffs argue, without reference to specific statutes, that they are \u201cexcluded from the statutory scheme of benefits and obligations the state has associated exclusively with marriage.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that a strict level of review is required, but that even at the lowest levels of constitutional scrutiny the State cannot show a legitimate governmental interest in the current statutory scheme, and that it violates their rights under Article II of the Montana Constitution. Plaintiffs contend that the State excludes them from access to unnamed benefits and obligations in violation of Montana\u2019s constitutional rights of privacy, dignity and the pursuit of life\u2019s basic necessities. Plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to a declaratory judgment and to injunctive relief to redress the violation of their rights. Plaintiffs contend that while they can obtain relief without a judicial order requiring the Legislature to act, such an order is a remedy well within established constitutional bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b66 Plaintiffs ask that the judgment of the District Court be reversed and the case remanded to grant Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment as well as a declaratory judgment and injunction. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b67 As a general rule, this Court will not disturb a district court\u2019s determination that declaratory relief is not necessary or proper unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the district court abused its discretion. <em>Miller v. State Farm, </em>2007 MT 85, \u00b6 5, 337 Mont. 67, 155 P.3d 1278 (citing <em>Northfield Ins. v. Mont. Assoc. of Counties, </em>2000 MT 256, \u00b6 8, 301 Mont. 472, 10 P.3d 813). We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of law to determine whether the interpretation is correct. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b68 In the past Montana courts have held specific statutes unconstitutional, and in some cases have directed the Legislature to act to comply with specific duties. <em>Helena Elementary School Dist. No. 1 v. State, </em>236 Mont. 44, 769 P.2d 864 (school funding); <em>Snetsinger v. Mont. Univ. System, </em>2004 MT 390, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445 (provision of employment benefits). In the present case, however, Plaintiffs do not seek a declaration that any particular statute is unconstitutional or that its implementation should be enjoined. Rather, Plaintiffs seek a general declaration of their rights and seek orders enjoining the State to provide them a \u201clegal status and statutory structure\u201d that protects their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b69  We agree with the District Court that Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief exceeds the bounds of a justiciable controversy, <em>Gryczan v. State, </em>283 Mont. 433, 442, 942 P.2d 112, 117 (1997), and decline to provide the declaratory relief requested. It is the opinion of this Court that the broad injunction and declaratory judgment sought by Plaintiffs would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to this proceeding. Instead, a broad injunction and declaration not specifically directed at any particular statute would lead to confusion and further litigation. As the District Court aptly stated: \u201cFor this Court to direct the legislature to enact a law that would impact an unknown number of statutes would launch this Court into a roiling maelstrom of policy issues without a constitutional compass.\u201d A district court may refuse to enter a declaratory judgment if it would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceedings, \u00a7 27-8-206, MCA; <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 7. Courts do not function, even under the Declaratory Judgments Act, to determine speculative matters, to enter anticipatory judgments, to declare social status, to give advisory opinions or to give abstract opinions. <em>Mont. Dept. Nat. Res. &amp; Cons. v. Intake Water Co., </em>171 Mont. 416, 440, 558 P.2d 1110, 1123 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b610 In addition, declaring the parameters of constitutional rights is a serious matter. This Court, for example, avoids deciding constitutional issues whenever possible. <em>Weidow v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2010 MT 292, \u00b6 22, 359 Mont. 77, 246 P.3d 704. Statutes are presumed to be constitutional. <em>Oberson v. U.S. Forest Service, </em>2007 MT 293, \u00b6 14, 339 Mont. 519, 171 P.3d 715. That presumption can only be overcome after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>careful consideration of the purpose and effect of the statute, employing the proper level of scrutiny. <em>Oberson, </em>\u00b6 22 (analyzing the constitutionality of the snowmobile liability statute, \u00a7 23-2-653, MCA). Broadly determining the constitutionality of a \u201cstatutory scheme\u201d that may, according to Plaintiffs, involve hundreds of separate statutes, is contrary to established jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b611 This Court may fashion the relief warranted by any appeal. Section 3-2-204, MCA. It is this Court\u2019s opinion that Plaintiffs should be given the opportunity, if they choose to take it, to amend the complaint and to refine and specify the general constitutional challenges they have proffered. For example, the record contains several affidavits from the named Plaintiffs and others that assert that they have suffered discrimination from the State\u2019s failure to recognize their relationships. While Plaintiffs\u2019 brief listed Title 40 of the Montana Code as an area of family law that furthers such discrimination, the dismissal of this action because of Plaintiffs\u2019 broad claims has precluded the development of claims that specific statutes promote or cause discrimination. These are important issues and should be decided only after the statutes involved are specifically identified and specifically analyzed in district court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b612 Montana law generally favors allowing a party to amend its pleadings. Rule 15, M. R. Civ. P.; <em>Hobble-Diamond Cattle Co. v. Triangle Irrig. Co., </em>249 Mont. 322, 325, 815 P.2d 1153, 1155 (1991); <em>Aldrich &amp; Co. v. Ellis, </em>2002 MT 177, \u00b6 27, 311 Mont. 1, 52 P.3d 388 (remand to allow plaintiff to add claim). The purpose of amending a complaint is to give the defendant adequate notice of the plaintiffs claims. <em>Kudloff v. City of Billings, </em>260 Mont. 371, 375, 860 P.2d 140, 142 (1993). The decision to allow a plaintiff to amend a complaint is essentially an equitable one. <em>Stundal v. Stundal, </em>2000 MT 21, \u00b6 17, 298 Mont. 141, 995 P.2d 420, and leave to amend may be denied when the amendment would be futile or legally insufficient. <em>Hickey v. Baker School Dist. No. 12, </em>2002 MT 322, \u00b6 33, 313 Mont. 162, 60 P.3d 966.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai0\">\u00b613  The Plaintiffs should be afforded the opportunity to amend their complaint and to develop an argument as to the nature of the State\u2019s interest in advancing specific laws as well as the level of constitutional scrutiny that should be applied to those laws by the courts. Plaintiffs of course may choose to not amend, and that decision is theirs to make. If they do amend they will need to choose what statute or statutes to put in issue and upon what legal grounds. The dissent may be disappointed in the majority\u2019s approach to this case. However, that does not change the fact that the Plaintiffs chose to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>pursue an overly broad request for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, without developing a factual record in the District Court and without identifying a specific statute or statutes that impose the discrimination they allege.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b614 For the reasons set out above, the decision of the District Court is affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, in a schedule to be determined by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b615 The Clerk is directed to provide copies hereof to all counsel of record and to the Honorable Jeffrey M. Sherlock, District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"AbA\">DATED this 17th day of December, 2012.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-6\">/S/ CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH</judges>\n<judges id=\"A94\">/S/JUSTICE BAKER</judges>\n<judges id=\"ATv\">/S/JUSTICE MORRIS</judges>\n<judges id=\"ARlf\">/S/JUSTICE RICE</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"ALk\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"ATG\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u00b616 I join in the Court\u2019s decision affirming the District Court. I agree with the Court and the District Court that the remedy sought in Plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for relief-that the court issue an order requiring the State to offer Plaintiffs <em>\u201ca </em>legal status and statutory structure that confers the protections and obligations that the State provides to different-sex couples who marry\u201d-is overly broad and not justiciable. Opinion, \u00b6 8. Further, I have no objection to remanding the case to allow Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their pleadings to start the case anew. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. This is the procedural equivalent to filing a different legal challenge after dismissal of a case, which the Plaintiffs are entitled to pursue. Thus, I have signed the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u00b617 I write separately to address the District Court\u2019s analysis of the Marriage Amendment to the Montana Constitution, and to explain the Amendment\u2019s application to Plaintiffs\u2019 substantive equal protection contentions set forth in Count I of their complaint. I believe that the Amendment provides another basis to affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Count I, in addition to the overly broad nature of the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\u00b618 The District Court reasoned that, while \u201cthis Court does not necessarily feel that Montana\u2019s marriage amendment bars it from acting,\u201d nonetheless \u201cthe existence of the marriage amendment plays into the jurisprudential decision that Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief constitutes an impermissible sojourn into the powers of the legislative branch.\u201d I agree that the Marriage Amendment is applicable, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>believe the District Court understated its significance. With its passage, the law\u2019s historical designation of marriage as between a man and a woman-and the exclusive treatment premised thereon-became an expressly constitutional classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b619 Count I alleges that \u201cPlaintiffs are similarly situated in every material respect to [] different-sex couples\u201d and that the State\u2019s exclusion of Plaintiffs from the benefits and obligations \u201cthat the State offers to similarly-situated different-sex couples through the legal status of marriage impermissibly subjects Plaintiffs to unequal treatment\u201d and constitutes \u201cState discrimination.\u201d With all due respect to Plaintiffs, I believe their equal protection claim must fail under longstanding and deeply rooted legal principles, in both Montana and national jurisprudence. Under the law, discussed below, marriage between a man and woman is a unique relationship, dissimilar to all other relationships and alone essential to the nation\u2019s foundation and survival, and the State errs neither by recognizing it as such nor by giving it exclusive treatment. In sum, it is not discrimination to treat uniquely that which is unique.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b620 Plaintiffs emphasize that they are not seeking the right to marry, but nonetheless claim in Count I that they are entitled to all of the \u201cprotections, rights, benefits, duties, responsibilities, and obligations\u201d which the State grants based upon marriage. During oral argument, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel acknowledged that the relief sought would strip from the law the exclusive treatment of marriage as a basis for providing any concrete legal benefit. The only exclusive meaning left to marriage, counsel said, would be aspirational: \u201cHow people view it, how symbolic and how important and how solemn it is.\u201d The question thus posed by Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim is whether the State is barred by the Constitution from using marriage as an exclusive basis for granting any concrete legal entitlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u00b621 As we have explained, \u201c[t]he first step in an equal protection analysis is to \u2018identify the classes involved, and determine if they are similarly situated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jaksha v. Silver Bow Co., </em>2009 MT 263, \u00b6 16, 352 Mont. 46, 214 P.3d 1248 (citation omitted). \u201c \u2018If the classes are not similarly situated, then ... it is not necessary for us to analyze the challenge further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kershaw v. Dept. of Transp., </em>2011 MT 170, \u00b6 17, 361 Mont. 215, 257 P.3d 358. The classes here have been identified as same-sex couples, represented by Plaintiffs, and married couples. To analyze whether these classes are similarly situated, I begin by summarizing the extensive jurisprudence on the issue of marriage, particularly, as it stood when Montanans were asked to adopt the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Marriage Amendment, and then turn to the Amendment itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b622 It is so well established that marriage between a man and a woman is a fundamental constitutional right I need not belabor the point. <em>See Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 95, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 2265 (1987) (\u201c[T]he decision to marry is a fundamental right\u201d); <em>Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 384, 98 S. Ct. 673, 680 (1978) (quoting Meyer <em>v. Neb., </em>262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S. Ct. 625, 626 (1923)) (\u201cthe right \u2018to marry, establish a home and bring up children\u2019 is a central part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause\u201d); <em>Conaway v. Deane, </em>932 A.2d 571, 618 n. 63 (Md. 2007) (citations omitted) (\u201cIt is beyond doubt that the right to marry is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Constitution.\u201d). Likewise, this Court has stated, \u201c[w]e too have recognized that marriage is a fundamental right.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Guill, </em>2011 MT 32, \u00b6 66, 359 Mont. 225, 248 P.3d 826.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b623 Marriage between a man and woman has been declared a fundamental right because of the critical functions it performs and the purposes it fulfills for the greater society. \u201c[Mjarriage involves interests of basic importance in our <em>society.\u201d Boddie v. Conn., </em>401 U.S. 371, 376, 91 S. Ct. 780, 785 (1971) (citations omitted). Marriage is \u201cthe relationship that is the foundation of the family in our society.\u201d <em>Zablocki, </em>434 U.S. at 386, 98 S. Ct. at 681. Maintenance of marriage is an issue in which \u201cthe public is deeply interested, for it is the foundation of the family and of society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress.\u201d <em>Maynard v. Hill, </em>125 U.S. 190, 210-11, 8 S. Ct. 723, 729 (1888). Our Court has explained that \u201cupon [marriage\u2019s] permanence depends the family, the foundation of the home, \u2018upon the preservation of which, in turn, depends good citizenship and the permanency of a republican form of government.\u2019\u201d <em>Walker v. Hill, </em>90 Mont. 111, 124, 300 P. 260, 263-64 (1931) (citations omitted); <em>accord Franklin v. Franklin, </em>40 Mont. 348, 350, 106 P. 353, 354 (1910) (Upon marriage \u201cdepends the home, upon the preservation of which, in turn, depends good citizenship and the permanency of a republican form of government. The state therefore favors the institution of marriage\u201d). \u201cMarriage is a foundation stone in the bedrock of our state and communities.\u201d <em>Cook v. Cook, </em>104 P.3d 857, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>862, \u00b6 18 (Ariz. App. Div. 1 2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b624 Beyond these reasons of family, societal stability, governance and progress, as important as they are, courts analyzing marriage have focused upon even more compelling reasons: its exclusive role in procreation and in insuring the survival, protection and thriving of the human race. Marriage is \u201c \u2018fundamental to our very existence and survival.\u2019 \u201d <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 66 <em>(quoting Loving v. Va., </em>388 U.S. 1, 12, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 1824 (1967)). \u201cMarriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race.\u201d <em>Skinner v. Okla. ex rel. Williamson, </em>316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S. Ct. 1110, 1113 (1942). \u201c[V]irtually every [U.S.] Supreme Court case recognizing as fundamental the right to marry indicates as the basis for the conclusion the institution\u2019s inextricable link to procreation, which necessarily and biologically involves participation (in ways either intimate or remote) by a man and a woman.\u201d <em>Conaway v. Deane, </em>932 A.2d 571, 621 (Md. 2007). \u201cAll of the cases infer that the right to marry enjoys its fundamental status due to the male-female nature of the relationship and/or the attendant link to fostering procreation of our species.\u201d <em>Conaway, </em>932 A.2d at 619 (citing the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Loving, Zablocki, Turner, </em>and <em>Skinner).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b625 From procreation springs further societal protections provided exclusively by marriage. As noted above, courts have cited the raising of children to be one of the core functions which support constitutional protection of marriage. <em>See Meyer v. Neb., 262 U.S. </em>at 399, 43 S. Ct. at 626; <em>see also Baker v. Nelson, </em>191 N.W.2d 185, 186 (Minn. 1971), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>409 U.S. 810, 93 S. Ct. 37 (1972) (\u201cThe institution of marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreation and <em>rearing of children within a family, </em>is as old as the book of Genesis.\u201d) (emphasis added). Married couples role-model and thereby teach procreative relationships and the procreative lifestyle to children of the marriage as they are raised, ensuring that marriage\u2019s human race-sustaining functions upon which the survival and stability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>of society depend are passed to and replicated by the next generation.</p>\n<p id=\"Aca\">\u00b626 The replication, by children, of the procreative marital relationship as role-modeled by their married parents not only perpetuates the race-sustaining function by populating the race, but also builds extended families which share hereditary characteristics of a common gene pool. Throughout history, this genetic commonality has provided an invaluable tool to enhance human survival. Common hereditary traits provide critical understanding of an extended family\u2019s physical and mental strengths, weaknesses, and susceptibility to disease and death. Even before the advent of modern science, this information was collectively shared among extended family members and served to alert and prepare them for eventualities related to the onset of disease and other life patterns, thus strengthening their health and livelihood. Modern medical technologies have only increased this capability, as research of an extended family\u2019s genetics now serves to predict, detect, and treat common, family-related diseases, further enhancing human survival.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b627 Upon extended families are built people groups or ethnic groups of individual races, tribes, kindred, and nationalities based upon their broadly shared genetic characteristics. In addition to developing understanding about their mutually shared health risks, people groups throughout history have looked outward to their physical surroundings and, based upon their common genetics and collective experiences, have obtained the knowledge necessary for their people to adapt to and function well in the physical environment, thus enhancing their health and longevity. People groups around the world have been linked to make up the larger human race. While world customs and cultures vary greatly, these societies share the common foundational element of a woman and a man united in marriage. It is little wonder the Supreme Court has said that marriage is \u201cfundamental to the very existence and survival of the race.\u201d <em>Zablocki, </em>434 U.S. at 384 (citing <em>Skinner, </em>316 U.S. at 541). One court well summed up these principles: \u201c[T]he State has a compelling interest in fostering the traditional institution of marriage (whether based on self-preservation, procreation, or in nurturing and keeping alive the concept of marriage and family as a basic fabric of our society), as old and as fundamental as our entire civilization, which institution is deeply rooted and long established in firm and rich societal values.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Cooper, </em>564 N.Y.S.2d 684, 688 (N.Y. Surrog. Ct. 1990); <em>see also Conaway, </em>932 A.2d at 630 (\u201cIn light of the fundamental nature of procreation, and the importance placed on it by the Supreme Court, safeguarding an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>environment most conducive to the stable propagation and continuance of the human race is a legitimate government interest.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AxP\">\u00b628 These principles demonstrate clearly that marriage is not merely a private act. It is also a public act which serves a public function critical to society, that of bringing together female and male to create and raise the future generation. Courts have recognized this, holding that the above-discussed critical societal functions are uniquely provided by marriage between a woman and man and cannot be replicated by other relationships.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cBecause only relationships between opposite-sex couples can naturally produce children, it is reasonable for the state to afford unique legal recognition to that particular social unit in the form of opposite-sex marriage. The legislature could reasonably conclude that the institution of civil marriage as it has existed in the country from the beginning has successfully provided this desirable social structure and should be preserved.\u201d <em>In re J.B., </em>326 S.W.3d 654, 677 (Tex. App. Dallas 2010) (internal citations omitted). \u201cIndisputably, the only sexual relationship capable of producing children is one between a man and a woman. The State could reasonably decide that by encouraging opposite-sex couples to marry, thereby assuming legal and financial obligations, the children born from such relationships will have better opportunities to be nurtured and raised by two parents within long-term, committed relationships, which society has traditionally viewed as advantageous for children. <em>Because same-sex couples cannot by themselves procreate, the State could also reasonably decide that sanctioning same-sex marriages would do little to advance the State\u2019s interest in ensuring responsible procreation within committed, long-term relationships.\u201d Standhardt v. Super. Ct. of Ariz., </em>77 P.3d 451, 462-63, \u00b6 38 (Ariz. App. Div. 1 2003) (emphasis added); <em>see also Citizens for Equal Protec. v. Bruning, </em>455 F.3d 859, 868 (8th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[Appellees\u2019] argument disregards the expressed intent of traditional marriage laws-to encourage heterosexual couples to bear and raise children in committed marriage relationships.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[S]o far as heterosexuals are concerned, the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>that on average married couples live longer, are healthier, earn more, have lower rates of substance abuse and mental illness, are less likely to commit suicide, and report higher levels of happiness-that marriage civilizes young males, confers economies of scale and of joint consumption, minimizes sexually transmitted disease, and provides a stable and nourishing framework for child rearing-refutes any claim that policies designed to promote marriage are irrational.\u201d <em>Irizarry v. Bd. of Educ. of Chicago, </em>251 F.3d 604, 607 (7th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). Modern medicine makes it technologically possible for some same-sex couples to artificially conceive and bear children. However, that fact does not diminish the truth that human life cannot be sustained without procreative marriage relationships, even in light of modern technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b629 Consequently, the right to marry has not been held to mean there is a fundamental right to marry someone of the same gender. \u201c[VJirtually every court to have considered the issue has held that same-sex marriage is not constitutionally protected as fundamental in either their state or the Nation as a whole.\u201d <em>Conaway, </em>932 A.2d at 628 (citations omitted). \u201cThe idea that same-sex marriage is even possible is a relatively new one. Until a few decades ago, it was an accepted truth for almost everyone who ever lived, in any society in which marriage existed, that there could be marriages only between participants of different sex. ... The right to marry is unquestionably a fundamental right. The right to marry someone of the same sex, however, is not \u2018deeply rooted\u2019; it has not even been asserted until relatively recent times.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. Robles, </em>855 N.E.2d 1, 8-9 (N.Y. 2006) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u00b630 Given this exclusive importance of marriage, the law developed to give it sanction, permanence, and a formal structure upon which to base legal entitlement and obligation. Although commonly referred to as a contractual relationship, the obligation of marriage is more than merely contractual. As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cwhen the contract to marry is executed by the marriage, a relation between the parties is created which they cannot change. Other contracts may be modified, restricted, or enlarged, or entirely released upon the consent of the parties. Not so with marriage. The relation once formed, the law steps in and holds the parties to various obligations and liabilities.\u201d <em>Maynard, </em>125 U.S. at 210-11, 8 S. Ct. at 729. \u201cWhen the contracting parties have entered into the married state, they have not so much entered into a contract as into a new relation, the rights, duties and obligations of which rest, not upon their agreement, but upon the general law of the State, statutory or common, which defines and prescribes those rights, duties and obligations. They are of law, not of contract.\u201d <em>Adams, </em>51 Me. at 483. As we have noted, \u201cit is to the interest of the state that [marriage] be permanent.\u201d <em>Franklin, </em>40 Mont. at 350, 106 P. at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b631 Upon this structure of permanence, and again in view of the exclusive importance of marriage, the state has built a system of exclusive benefits and protections on behalf of, and dependent upon, marriage. \u201c[M]arital status often is a pre-condition to the receipt of government benefits <em>(e.g., </em>Social Security benefits), property rights <em>(e.g., </em>tenancy by the entirety, inheritance rights), and other, less tangible benefits <em>(e.g., </em>legitimation of children born out of wedlock).\u201d <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 96, 107 S. Ct. at 2265. \u201cIn terms of federal benefits, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) compiled in 1997, and updated in 2004, a list of federal rights, responsibilities, and privileges granted to married couples, but denied to same-sex couples. According to the study, there were 1, 138 federal statutes providing such benefits.\u201d <em>Conaway, </em>932 A.2d at 582 n. 6 (citations omitted). Plaintiffs provided the District Court with a list of over 340 Montana statutes that classify based on marital status and that would be impacted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the proposed relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b632 While Plaintiffs do not claim the right to marry, they are nonetheless claiming constitutional entitlement to all of these same rights and benefits which are provided to married couples on the ground that they are \u201csimilarly situated in every material respect.\u201d However, this position ignores the historical and long-developed legal foundation and formal structure giving marriage an exclusive legal permanence, which does not exist for other relationships. More importantly, the above discussion, including the precedent addressing marriage and its unique attributes, demonstrates that Plaintiffs\u2019 claim to be \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to married couples is without merit. This is not meant to disparage Plaintiffs or minimize the contributions they offer, but is simply a statement of the reality that marriage between a woman and man exclusively provides unique and transcendent societal protections vital to human survival which differentiate it and make it dissimilar from other relationships. These protections uniquely provided by marriage form a legitimate and even compelling state interest, and thus a constitutional basis, for the State\u2019s exclusive treatment of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b633 The above discussion of the law of marriage reflects the general state of the law before the Marriage Ame'ndment was adopted by Montanans in 2004. Although some of the cited cases were decided after adoption of the Marriage Amendment, they were premised upon pre-2004 precedent, and marriage was considered to be a fundamental right with constitutionally protected status at the time of the Amendment\u2019s adoption. However, several years earlier, legal arguments attacking the exclusive status of marriage began to be offered, and considerable concern was generated over whether the law\u2019s exclusive treatment of marriage would remain, or whether courts would begin to overturn long-standing precedent favoring marriage. With all due respect, several courts indicated a willingness to uproot established legal precedent recognizing the uniqueness of marriage between a man and woman, and eliminate the law\u2019s exclusive treatment of marriage. <em>See e.g. Baehr v. Lewin, </em>852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993); <em>Baker v. State, </em>744 A.2d 864 (Vt. 2000); <em>Goodridge v. Dept. of Pub. Health, </em>798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b634 The response of the citizens of the country to these court decisions can only be described as a phenomenon of direct democracy. To counter this threat to established precedent favoring marriage, citizens of some 31 states acted to either reinstate the law\u2019s exclusive definition and treatment of marriage in some manner, or to ensure that courts could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>not eliminate such exclusive treatment, by amending their state constitutions to explicitly protect marriage. Montana was one of those states.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b635 Building on the foundation of historical legal protections for marriage, Montana voters solidified the premise that marriage is between one man and one woman by placing the concept expressly into the Montana Constitution. Mont. Const, art. XIII, \u00a7 7. The Voter Information Packet provided voters with the arguments for and against adoption of the Amendment. Proponents stated that the \u201c[t]he time-honored, vital institution of marriage is being threatened. ... Special interest groups are constantly seeking to gain special rights that infringe on the rights of the rest of society. Such special rights cost all Montanans. ... Voting yes on CI-96 allows the people to give clear direction to judges on this important issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b636 Directly related to this case, proponents discussed the issue of benefits which are attendant to marriage. \u201cIf CI-96 fails, how will homosexual marriage one day affect your family? ... Small business employers in Montana may someday be required to provide expanded health coverage, retirement and fringe benefits to same-sex \u2018spouses\u2019 of employees. The broad subjectivity of such un-funded mandates could hurt Montana\u2019s economy and jobs.\u201d Opponents likewise also focused on benefits and obligations associated with same-sex couples: \u201cif CI-96 were to pass, the State could nullify the contractual agreements made between same-gender partners. CI-96 would limit innovative and robust companies from treating their employees equitably.\u201d As the District Court noted, both sides of the debate acknowledged \u201cthat the marriage amendment would have something to do with the benefits and obligations that relate to the status of being married.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b637 Proponents and opponents alike focused on the issue of benefits because everyone understood the law: that marriage is a concrete legal status upon which the State premises exclusive treatment and benefits, as demonstrated by the above-cited authority. It is more than a label, a societal choice, a union of two people, or an aspiration. Indeed, marriage is an obligation given exclusive protections in the law because it provides exclusive protections to society. Even before adoption of the Marriage Amendment, this was recognized in Montana statute. <em>See e.g. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 40-1-101, 40-1-103, 40-1-401, 40-2-101, 40-2-102, MCA. Montana has long used marital status as an exclusive basis for provision and allotment of benefits and obligations. <em>See e.g. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-18-601,19-17-405, 33-22-140, 39-51-2205, 39-71-723, 50-9-106, 72-2-112, 15-30-2114,15-30-2366, MCA. Building on these statutory provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>and the prior holdings of our cases, Montana citizens enacted the Marriage Amendment to expressly \u201cconstitutionalize\u201d these principles, thereby strengthening the law\u2019s exclusive treatment of marriage. <em>See State v. Toomey, </em>135 Mont. 35, 51-53, 335 P.2d 1051, 1059-60 (1958) (\u201c[W]e must construe the amendment in the light of the conditions as they existed at the time of its adoption. <em>Rankin v. Love, </em>125 Mont. 184, 187, 232 P.2d 998, 1000 (1951); <em>State ex rel. Bottomly v. District Court, </em>73 Mont. 541, 547, 237 P. 525, 527 (1925). ... \u201cIt is only reasonable to assume that the people, in adopting the amendment to our Constitution, adopted it in light of the existing [state law] and the construction placed upon that law by this Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b638 When asked during oral argument what unique legal concreteness would remain to marriage if the requested relief was granted, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel replied, \u201cHow people view it, how symbolic and how important and how solemn it is, is important. Marriage is meaningful.\u201d When asked again, \u201cIn what way? I\u2019m trying to understand what concrete[ness] in the law is left?\u201d Counsel responded, \u201cThe significance is that you\u2019re married.\u201d However, such a diminished concept of marriage would necessitate a dramatic rewriting of the law. Marriage has always been much more-a concrete legal status which the law recognized and favored with exclusive treatment, including benefits and obligations. In adopting the Marriage Amendment, Montana voters determined to permanently preserve this exclusive treatment for marriage by placing it in the Constitution. Thus, in one way, Plaintiffs are asking this Court to render the Marriage Amendment superfluous by holding that it added nothing to the law\u2019s previous exclusive classification of marriage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But further, Plaintiffs are asking the Court to hold the Marriage Amendment actually had a reverse effect-that marriage has <em>less </em>legal protection now than before the Amendment was passed, because marriage can no longer serve as the basis for exclusive treatment by the State. Clearly, this is directly contrary to the \u201cclear direction to judges\u201d which the Marriage Amendment was designed to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b639 \u201cThe Equal Protection Clause \u2018is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of [the voters\u2019] choices.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens for Equal Protec., </em>455 F.3d at 867 (bracket in original) (quoting <em>F.C.C. v.

Now that the marriage relationship has been given constitutionally-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>protected status, any change to the long-standing principles which govern this issue must come from the people through the democratic process, not from the courts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe package of government benefits and restrictions that accompany the institution of formal marriage serve a variety of other purposes. <em>The legislature-or the people through the initiative </em>process-may rationally choose not to expand in wholesale fashion the groups entitled to those benefits.\u201d <em>Citizens for Equal Protec., </em>455 F.3d at 868 (emphasis added). \u201c[A]s we have explained, there is no fundamental right to be free of the political barrier a validly enacted constitutional amendment erects.\u201d <em>Citizens for Equal Protec., </em>455 F.3d at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b640 I appreciate the deeply-held feelings and beliefs of the Plaintiffs and condemn any acts of cruelty they have suffered, some of which are referenced in their affidavits.

Due to the success of these measures, it became \u201ca constant theme of opponents of same-sex marriage that whenever it has been put before the voters it has lost.\u201d Erik Eekholm, <em>In Maine and Maryland, Victories at the Ballot Box for Same-Sex Marriage, </em>N.Y. Times (Nov. 7, 2012). That, however, is no longer true. In this most recent election of November 6, 2012, voters in Maine, Maryland, and Washington approved ballot measures authorizing same-sex couples to marry. And in Minnesota, voters defeated a ballot measure that would have amended the Minnesota Constitution to limit marriage to one man and one woman. It appears that a majority of voters in these states have seen through the scare tactics and propaganda which \u201cfamily values\u201d organizations and certain religious groups have used to persuade the electorate that allowing same-sex marriage will harm children, hurt businesses and the economy, intrude on religious freedoms, and undermine the institution of marriage itself. As discussed in greater detail later in this Dissent, there is no <em>actual </em>evidence supporting any of the maledictions and stereotypes used in the campaigns against same-sex marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b648 Meanwhile, in Montana, the issue at hand is not about same-sex marriage. It is less dramatic, though by no means less important. It concerns the right of committed intimate same-sex couples to receive the same civil protections which the State makes available to committed intimate different-sex couples. Plaintiffs assert, and rightly so, that their government may not single out unpopular groups for disfavored treatment, as the State of Montana has done here. Shockingly, this Court refuses to uphold this most basic principle of constitutional law. While I have not always agreed with this Court\u2019s decisions-in fact, I have strenuously disagreed with my colleagues on occasion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>-! have never disagreed more strongly with the Court as I do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>in this case.

And it will be my last opportunity, sitting as a member of this Court, to address the fundamental constitutional rights of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people and the discrimination which the State of Montana is perpetrating against these individuals. The issues here are significant and complex, and deserving of thorough consideration, analysis, and discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b650 Second, I am profoundly disappointed in this Court, as an institution, for rendering a decision that requires Plaintiffs, the same-sex couples here, to wage a litigation jihad against their own government to obtain the statutory rights, benefits, and protections to which they are constitutionally entitled. I have located no court decision in this country-state or federal-applying the declaratory judgment laws in the cabined and unworkable fashion that this Court does here.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b651 Lastly, I am thoroughly disheartened that today\u2019s decision takes civil rights in this State backward to a time when court decisions supported and facilitated other equally pernicious forms of government-sanctioned discrimination, including slavery and racial segregation; women being viewed as little more than men\u2019s dependents, unable to vote or own property; the Chinese being deemed an \u201cinferior\u201d race; the compulsory sterilization of the \u201cfeebleminded\u201d; and the criminalization of private sexual intimacy between two consenting adults. No other minority group has been treated in this fashion in this State in modern times. This, truly, is a shameful, black day for civil rights in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b652 Yet, while gay, lesbian, and bisexual citizens may have lost this battle, the war is not over. If we have learned anything as an evolving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>species, it is that no government, no religion, no institution, and no political party can long oppress the inviolable dignity and spirit of human beings in their fight for fairness in the courts, access to justice, and equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b653 With these introductory remarks, I now proceed to my detailed discussion and analysis. In Part II (\u00b6\u00b6 57-80), I provide a background and overview of the case and the issues. In Part III (\u00b6\u00b6 81-113), I explain the declaratory judgment laws and address in detail the District Court\u2019s and this Court\u2019s erroneous analyses under those laws.</p>\n<p id=\"A0T\">\u00b654 Next, in Part IV (\u00b6\u00b6 114-168), I analyze Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim. Given the evidence that gay, lesbian, and bisexual people are reviled and demonized in Montana and have suffered a history of invidious and prejudicial treatment, I conclude that sexual orientation is a suspect class under Montana\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, and thus that discrimination based on sexual orientation in the provision of statutory benefits, protections, and services must survive \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d review. I further conclude that treating Plaintiffs differently based on sexual orientation is an affront to and violation of their inviolable right to human dignity, also protected by Montana\u2019s Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b655 As a final matter, in Part V (\u00b6\u00b6 169-206), I am compelled to address the so-called Marriage Amendment to Montana\u2019s Constitution (Mont. Const, art. XIII, \u00a7 7). Plaintiffs do not ask to be \u201cmarried,\u201d and granting them the relief they seek does not offend that provision in the slightest. Yet, the State relies on the Marriage Amendment as support for its position, and the State\u2019s argument before this Court is bolstered by an outpouring of attacks on the same-sex couples by no less than 128 Montana protestant churches and the Montana Catholic Bishops, all appearing through the Montana Catholic Conference as amicus curiae, along with other \u201cfamily values\u201d organizations, also appearing as amici curiae. The Marriage Amendment is the conduit through which the State and its amici claim that it may deprive Plaintiffs-who, because of this provision, cannot marry-of the statutory benefits and protections which the State grants to married couples. That the State and its amici have injected the Marriage Amendment into this case at all, however, demonstrates, in spades, what that provision is <em>really </em>about: the constitutionalization of religious doctrine. Indeed, what the State and its amici seek to do here is conflate <em>sectarian </em>canons regarding marriage with <em>secular </em>laws governing the provision of benefits and protections to committed couples. In my view, this approach violates several constitutional provisions, not the least of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>which is the clause in Montana\u2019s Declaration of Rights prohibiting the State from establishing religion. Emblematic of the religiously grounded discrimination defended by the State and its amici is the blatant mendacity underlying the Marriage Amendment initiative-a fourberie reminiscent of some of the worst propaganda campaigns perpetrated in modern times.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b656 In the last section of this Dissent, Part VI (\u00b6\u00b6 207-212), I set forth my conclusions and provide a short epilogue.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">II. BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b657 Plaintiffs here are twelve lesbian, gay, or bisexual individuals who are in six committed, intimate, same-sex relationships. As of the filing of their affidavits in the District Court on December 10,2010, plaintiffs Donaldson and Guggenheim had been in a relationship for 27 years; Leslie and Haugland for 12 years; Stallings and Wagner for 21 years; Gibson and Boettcher for 11 years; Long and Parker for 8 years; and Owens and Williams for 18 years. With their life partners, Plaintiffs have established families which provide them with long-term mutual emotional and economic support and a stable environment for raising children. Plaintiffs are employed in, or have retired from, a variety of professions including teaching, coaching, counseling, engineering, music, art, and medicine. They are active in their children\u2019s schools, in their churches, in their professions, and in their communities. One has served in the Montana Legislature. It is undisputed that Plaintiffs are productive members of society and have, in fact, successfully raised a number of children. Some Plaintiffs are now grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b658 Plaintiffs desire to protect their family relationships in the same way their heterosexual neighbors, coworkers, and fellow community members are able to do under Montana law. Plaintiffs have taken some steps in this regard. For example, they have entered into joint tenancy arrangements on their houses and bank accounts and have executed powers of attorney, healthcare directives, and wills in favor of their partners. Plaintiffs point out, however, that such private legal arrangements can be expensive and, thus, are not available to many couples. Plaintiffs also express concerns about whether these arrangements will be honored-especially in the event of a medical emergency. Some Plaintiffs describe (in their affidavits) past incidents when healthcare personnel refused to speak with them about their partner\u2019s condition. Another Plaintiff (Leslie) describes how she and her former partner, Erika, took many of the legally available steps to protect their relationship. Yet, after Erika died in a work-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>accident on Christmas Day 1996, which was their eighth anniversary, Leslie found herself \u201cpowerless and degraded\u201d and treated like a \u201clegal stranger\u201d when she attempted to exercise the responsibilities of a partner. She was denied access to Erika\u2019s remains; she was denied a copy of the death certificate by the sheriff because she was a \u201cstranger in blood\u201d; she was refused paid bereavement leave by her employer (the same employer for whom Erika had been working when she was killed) and thus had to go back to work only a week after Erika\u2019s death; she had no rights under the intestacy laws with regard to Erika\u2019s property; she had no legal means to prevent Erika\u2019s family from entering their home, going through their belongings, and taking Erika\u2019s possessions, many of which the two had shared as domestic partners; and, to add insult to injury, she was required to pay inheritance taxes on the proceeds from Erika\u2019s half of their condominium, which Leslie was forced to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b659 The underlying issue, as the District Court stated in its Order, is that \u201cindividuals such as Plaintiffs are denied a variety of benefits and protections that are statutorily available to heterosexual spouses.\u201d The District Court identified some of these statutes and noted some of the \u201creal life scenarios\u201d in which these laws have affected Plaintiffs. For example, Montana\u2019s intestacy laws and workers\u2019 compensation laws provide certain protections to the surviving spouse of a different-sex relationship, but not to the surviving partner of a same-sex relationship. Likewise, bereavement leave is made available to a different-sex spouse but not to a same-sex partner. Furthermore, Plaintiffs are unable under Montana\u2019s tax laws to file joint returns or to take the spousal exemption for nonworking spouses if filing separately. Montana law permits the different-sex spouse of a terminally ill person to withhold life-sustaining treatment, but does not afford this right to the same-sex partner of a terminally ill person. Similarly, the different-sex spouse of a person who has become mentally incompetent has priority to become guardian, but a same-sex partner does not have this same right.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b660 If not for the fact that each couple consists of two members of the <em>same </em>sex, Plaintiffs\u2019 relationships could qualify as \u201cmarriage\u201d under Montana law. Title 40, chapter 1, MCA. As noted, however, Plaintiffs do not ask to be granted the status of \u201cmarried.\u201d For purposes of this case, Plaintiffs only seek a determination that they are entitled, as a matter of constitutional law, to obtain the same rights and benefits-along with the same mutual responsibilities and obligations-which the State of Montana has chosen to grant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>different-sex married couples. The premise underlying this claim is that \u201cmarriage\u201d does not include an exclusive right to any particular rights and benefits conferred by the government, and that \u201cmarriage\u201d connotes something other than just the receipt of such rights and benefits. <em>See e.g. In re Marriage Cases, </em>183 P.3d 384, 426-27, 434-35, 444-46 (Cal. 2008) (\u201cthe constitutional right to marry clearly does not obligate the state to afford specific tax or other governmental benefits on the basis of a couple\u2019s family relationship\u201d; even if all of the personal and dignity interests which have traditionally informed the right to marry have been given to same-sex couples through the Domestic Partner Act, there is still \u201ca considerable and undeniable symbolic importance\u201d to the designation of \u201cmarriage\u201d); <em>Kerrigan v. Commr. of Pub. Health, </em>957 A.2d 407, 417-18 (Conn. 2008) (\u201c[mjarriage ... is not merely shorthand for a discrete set of legal rights and responsibilities\u201d; \u201c[although marriage and civil unions do embody the same legal rights under our law, they are by no means \u2018equal\u2019[;]... the former is an institution of transcendent historical, cultural and social significance, whereas the latter most surely is not\u201d); <em>Perry v. Brown, </em>671 F.3d 1052, 1077-79 (9th Cir. 2012) (discussing \u201cthe extraordinary significance of the official designation of \u2018marriage\u2019 \u201d apart from the rights, protections, and benefits conferred by the government). Therefore, Plaintiffs argue, when the State chooses to make benefits and protections available to persons in committed intimate relationships, the State must do so evenhandedly, without discriminating on the basis of the sexual orientation of the persons in those relationships. In a sense, Plaintiffs are merely demanding \u201cseparate but equal\u201d treatment by the State-the minimal floor of equal protection rights under <em>Plessy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b661 The Attorney General does not deny that the State <em>could </em>provide such protections to committed intimate same-sex couples. As a matter of fact, the Attorney General acknowledges in his appellate brief that \u201cthe Legislature could choose to provide benefits similar to spousal benefits to unmarried couples\u201d and that \u201cthe Legislature could create a different status conferring similar benefits outside of marriage for civil unions or domestic partners.\u201d The Attorney General, speaking through an Assistant Attorney General, made similar statements during oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b662 One may wonder, then, why we do not simply grant Plaintiffs the declaratory relief they seek. While I certainly do not condone the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine of P/essy-which the Supreme Court overruled in <em>Brown v. Board of Ed., </em>347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>(1954)-Plaintiffs have made clear that, for purposes of this lawsuit, they do not seek the status of marriage. They merely seek \u201cequal opportunity\u201d to obtain the same benefits and protections which the State, in its discretion, has chosen to make available to different-sex couples. It is surely beyond cavil that Plaintiffs are entitled, at the very least, to the equal protection of these laws-even if that protection is effected through a regime that does not include marriage, as the Attorney General suggests. <em>See Alaska Civ. Liberties Union v. State, </em>122 P.3d 781, 793-94 (Alaska 2005) (restricting public benefits programs to different-sex married couples violates the rights of employees with same-sex partners to \u201cequal rights, opportunities, and protection under the law\u201d); <em>Lewis v. Harris, </em>908 A.2d 196, 220-21 (N. J. 2006) (as a matter of equal protection, \u201ccommitted same-sex couples must be afforded on equal terms the same rights and benefits enjoyed by married opposite-sex couples\u201d); <em>Baker v. State, </em>744 A.2d 864, 886 (Vt. 1999) (the State has \u201ca constitutional obligation to extend to [same-sex couples] the common benefit, protection, and security that Vermont law provides opposite-sex married couples\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b663 It appears from the District Court record, the arguments on appeal, and the Court\u2019s Opinion that the hindrance in recognizing and declaring these rights boils down to a simple refusal by those in power to make the constitutionally sound-albeit politically unpopular-decision. For starters, rather than concede the elementary premise of this lawsuit-that it is a denial of equal protection to make statutory protections available to different-sex couples, who may obtain them by getting married, but to categorically deny them to same-sex couples, who are not able to get married-the Attorney General instead attempts to justify and <em>prolong </em>this institutionalized discrimination being perpetrated by the State of Montana against a discrete minority of its citizens.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Frankly, the State\u2019s arguments in this regard are inconsistent and difficult to follow. On one hand, the State concedes that the Legislature could provide committed intimate same-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>sex couples with similar benefits as are afforded to different-sex married couples. Yet, on the other hand, the State suggests that any benefits provided to different-sex married couples cannot also be provided to same-sex couples due to the Marriage Amendment. This reasoning is clearly a non sequitur for reasons discussed in greater detail in the Marriage Amendment section below. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 174-179, <em>infra. </em>For the time being, it suffices to point out that the Marriage Amendment merely states: \u201cOnly a marriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state.\u201d And, as noted, Plaintiffs are not asking that their relationships be recognized as \u201cmarriage.\u201d Furthermore, the Marriage Amendment does not require the State to grant married couples tax benefits, or the right to make medical decisions for a spouse, or the right to death benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation laws, etc. Nor does it say that these sorts of benefits and protections, if the State chooses to grant them, may not also be offered to unmarried persons. The State concedes that the Legislature could enact a civil-union or domestic-partnership scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b664 Perhaps for these reasons, the State ultimately takes the position that Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim should not be decided at all. The reason: a ruling in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor could result in the invalidation of \u201cinnumerable\u201d unspecified statutes. Yet, surely the fact that Plaintiffs are being discriminated against in \u201cinnumerable\u201d ways is reason to <em>hasten </em>a decision on the merits of their claim, not delay it. Regrettably, however, a majority of this Court defers to the Attorney General\u2019s approach. Instead of requiring the State to demonstrate the constitutionality of its practices, the Court punts. The Court implies that Plaintiffs are to blame-that their failure to \u201cspecifically identify\u2019 and \u201cspecifically analyze\u201d the \u201cspecific statutes\u201d that are discriminatory somehow precludes us from declaring Plaintiffs\u2019 rights. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 9,11,13. How the Court expects Plaintiffs to present their claim is not entirely clear from the Court\u2019s opaque analysis. But a careful inspection reveals the Court\u2019s rationale to be entirely disingenuous in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"AVB-\">\u00b665 First of all, Plaintiffs <em>have </em>identified numerous statutes which grant benefits and protections to different-sex spouses but not to same-sex partners. Indeed, after observing in its Order that \u201cPlaintiffs are denied a variety of benefits and protections that are statutorily available to heterosexual spouses,\u201d the District Court lists a slew of those statutes. Furthermore, Plaintiffs attached a laundry list of the discriminatory statutes to their motion to alter or amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>judgment. That list is attached as Appendix 1 to this Dissent. If what the Court needs is a specific statute to analyze, the Court can simply pick one of the numerous statutes identified in the District Court\u2019s Order or in Plaintiffs\u2019 list, and assess its validity in light of the parties\u2019 arguments. The constitutional principles of the Court\u2019s analysis could then be extrapolated and applied to other statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b666 Secondly, if the Court is suggesting that Plaintiffs may not obtain a declaratory ruling until they have specifically identified <em>every single </em>discriminatory statute, it appears entirely likely that the extensive list of statutes attached to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment is, in fact, a listing of <em>every single </em>discriminatory statute. If that is what the Court needs, then the Court need look no further than Plaintiffs\u2019 motion, which is contained in the District Court record. More importantly, however, the Court has cited no authority whatsoever for requiring Plaintiffs to identify all of the discriminatory statutes. In fact, as I discuss in further detail below, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act enables Plaintiffs to obtain a declaration of their rights in a single lawsuit, without necessarily identifying each and every discriminatory statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b667 Thirdly, if the Court is suggesting that Plaintiffs must challenge each statute on an individual basis, the Court has cited no authority for this approach either. Indeed, one purpose of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is to <em>avoid </em>such seriatim litigation. As Plaintiffs reminded the District Court in their motion to alter or amend the judgment, they sought declaratory relief \u201cin part to avoid this type of expensive and protracted litigation that would drain judicial resources while prolonging the harm experienced by Plaintiffs and their families.\u201d <em>Cf. McGillivray v. State, </em>1999 MT 3, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 293 Mont. 19, 972 P.2d 804 (concluding that declaratory relief was the only \u201creasonable remedy\u201d where, absent such relief, only those plaintiffs who had \u201cthe financial resources and personal fortitude to endure four different court proceedings\u201d would be able to exercise their claimed constitutional right, while those plaintiffs \u201cwho will not or cannot afford this extensive litigation would be denied their right\u201d). Indeed, forcing Plaintiffs to challenge each of the \u201cinnumerable\u201d statutes in piecemeal fashion is not only manifestly unfair to them, it is an enormous waste of resources, given that the underlying legal question is the same with respect to each statute at issue. Montana taxpayers, who will have to foot the State\u2019s legal bills for defending each of these \u201cinnumerable\u201d lawsuits, should be appalled by the Court\u2019s and the Attorney General\u2019s approach here.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\u00b668 I think it is worth noting that the Court\u2019s and the Attorney General\u2019s approach is completely out of step with other courts around the country-federal and state. For example, Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 7, defines \u201cmarriage\u201d as a legal union between one man and one woman, and defines \u201cspouse\u201d as a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife. Although these definitions have \u201cvarying impact on more than a thousand federal laws,\u201d the Second Circuit Court of Appeals did not require the plaintiff to specifically identify those laws. <em>Windsor v. United States, </em>699 F.3d 169, 180 (2d Cir. 2012). To the contrary, the court proceeded to analyze her equal protection claim and concluded that \u201chomosexuals compose a class that is subject to heightened scrutiny,\u201d that the class is \u201cquasi-suspect\u201d and thus subject to \u201cintermediate scrutiny,\u201d and that \u201cDOMA\u2019s classification of same-sex spouses was not substantially related to an important government interest.\u201d <em>Windsor, </em>699 F.3d at 185, 188. Similarly, despite DOMA\u2019s \u201cramifying application throughout the U.S. Code\u201d and its \u201ceffects on the numerous federal programs at issue,\u201d the First Circuit Court of Appeals did not require the plaintiffs to identify the \u201ceconomic and other benefits\u201d impacted by DOMA. <em>Massachusetts v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Servs., </em>682 F.3d 1, 5, 13 (1st Cir. 2012). The court simply analyzed the constitutionality of excluding same-sex couples and concluded that \u201cCongress\u2019 denial of federal benefits to same-sex couples lawfully married in Massachusetts has not been adequately supported by any permissible federal interest.\u201d <em>Massachusetts, </em>682 F.3d at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b669 In New Jersey, different-sex married couples are entitled to \u201ca vast array of economic and social benefits and privileges.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>908 A.2d at 206. While same-sex couples enjoyed various rights under New Jersey\u2019s Domestic Partnership Act, they were still denied \u201cmany benefits and privileges\u201d accorded to married couples. <em>Lewis, </em>908 A.2d at 215. In other words, the Domestic Partnership Act \u201cfailed to bridge the inequality gap between committed same-sex couples and married opposite-sex couples.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>908 A.2d at 215. The New Jersey Supreme Court noted a number of the rights afforded to married couples but denied to same-sex couples. The court did <em>not </em>require the plaintiffs, however, to go back to the trial court and re-file their constitutional challenge to this scheme-like this Court does in the present case-as \u201cspecific\u201d challenges to \u201cspecific\u201d statutes. Rather, the court quite sensibly and logically explained that the constitutional question is \u201cwhether there is a public need to deny committed same-sex partners the benefits and privileges available to heterosexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>couples.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>908 A.2d at 217. Ultimately, the court held that \u201cdenying to committed same-sex couples the financial and social benefits and privileges given to their married heterosexual counterparts bears no substantial relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>908 A.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b670 The fact that there were \u201chundreds\u201d of statutes relating to marriage and to marital benefits did not prevent the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts from ascertaining whether the exclusion of same-sex couples from those benefits violated the state constitution. <em>Goodridge v. Dept. of Pub. Health, </em>798 N.E.2d 941, 955 (Mass. 2003). The court noted some of the statutory benefits in its opinion, but saw no need \u201cto be comprehensive.\u201d <em>Goodridge, 798 </em>N.E.2d at 955. The Hawaii Supreme Court also saw no such need. In considering the same-sex couples\u2019 constitutional challenge, the court observed that \u201ca multiplicity of rights and benefits\u201d are contingent upon the status of marriage, but the court found it \u201cunnecessary ... to engage in an encyclopedic recitation of all of them.\u201d <em>Baehr v. Lewin, </em>852 P.2d 44, 59 (Haw. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b671 The Vermont Supreme Court likewise had no difficulty analyzing the legality of excluding same-sex couples from the \u201cbroad array of legal benefits and protections incident to the marital relation, including access to a spouse\u2019s medical, life, and disability insurance, hospital visitation and other medical decisionmaking privileges, spousal support, intestate succession, homestead protections, and many other statutory protections.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>744 A.2d at 870. The court did not require the plaintiffs to specifically identify and specifically analyze the specific statutes. Rather, the court addressed the question common to each: \u201cwhether the exclusion of same-sex couples from the benefits and protections incident to marriage under Vermont law\u201d is unconstitutional. <em>Baker, </em>744 A.2d at 880. The court ultimately found \u201ca constitutional obligation to extend to plaintiffs the common benefit, protection, and security that Vermont law provides opposite-sex married couples.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>744 A.2d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b672 I could continue, but I think the point is clear. In refusing to issue a declaratory ruling as to Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights, and in forcing them to instead litigate each statutory protection individually, this Court sets itself up as the only court in the country to follow such an approach. In so doing, the Court commits grievous error.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u00b673 The instant case is no different than the cases cited above. \u201cMarriage\u201d in Montana is presently defined as \u201ca personal relationship between a man and a woman arising out of a civil contract.\u201d Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>40-1-103, MCA. Marriage between two persons of the same sex is prohibited. Section 40-l-401(l)(d), MCA; Mont. Const, art. XIII, \u00a7 7. Hence, by definition, a person cannot be the \u201cspouse\u201d of someone who is the same sex. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1533 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., Thomson Reuters 2009) (spouse: \u201ca married person\u201d). The State grants a broad array of legal benefits and protections to \u201cspouses.\u201d As but one example, \u00a7 37-19-904(2)(c), MCA, grants the surviving \u201cspouse\u201d the right to control the disposition of the remains of a deceased person. Same-sex couples are excluded from the operation of these statutes because, by definition, they cannot be \u201cspouses\u201d and because they are not encompassed within the scope of the statutes in some <em>other </em>way. <em>See e.g. </em>\u00a7 45-5-206, MCA (for purposes of partner or family member assault, \u201cpartners\u201d means \u201cspouses, former spouses, persons who have a child in common, and persons who have been or are currently in a dating or ongoing intimate relationship with a person of the <em>opposite </em>sex\u201d (emphasis added)). Plaintiffs\u2019 claim here is the same as the challengers\u2019 claims in the above cases: excluding same-sex couples from the opportunity to obtain the protections of these laws is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b674 As detailed in the Declaratory Judgment section below, there is simply no basis in law or in reason for requiring Plaintiffs to present their constitutional claim within the context of a challenge to a specific spousal benefit, or for requiring them to pursue independent challenges to each benefit, or for requiring them to identify all of the discriminatory laws. The notion that they must \u201cspecifically identify\u201d and \u201cspecifically analyze\u201d each of the \u201cinnumerable\u201d statutes is, in reality, nothing more than a straw-man argument that the Attorney General has invented, and this Court has adopted, to avoid a socially divisive issue. I cannot believe that if the statutes discriminated on the basis of race, national origin, or religious affiliation, rather than sexual orientation, the Court would concoct such an implausible procedural technicality as the Court does here to evade a legitimately presented constitutional question and deny the plaintiffs relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b675 For all of these reasons, the Court\u2019s contention that it cannot issue a ruling on Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights is devoid of any genuine or well-grounded underpinning. And so is the Court\u2019s suggestion that Plaintiffs still need \u201cto develop an argument as to ... the level of constitutional scrutiny that should be applied to [the discriminatory] laws by the courts.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 13. Plaintiffs devote entire sections of their briefs to this exact question, arguing that sexual orientation is a suspect class and that the denial of statutory benefits and obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>based on sexual orientation should be subject to heightened scrutiny. It is not clear whether the Court has overlooked these sections of Plaintiffs\u2019 briefs, or simply chosen to ignore them, but the argument is there. Perhaps the Court\u2019s view is that the level of scrutiny varies from statute to statute depending on \u201cthe nature of the State\u2019s interest.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 13. That, however, would be quite the novel approach to constitutional law. Indeed, I am aware of no precedent, from any court in this country, holding that the level of scrutiny-rational basis, middle tier, or strict-is determined not by the <em>classification </em>or the <em>constitutional right </em>at issue, but by \u201cthe nature of the State\u2019s interest\u201d in discriminating against the class or infringing the right. Such an approach turns equal protection and due process analysis on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"A-N\">\u00b676 If the reader is baffled by what the Court is requiring of Plaintiffs, he or she is not alone. As a purely factual matter, there is no dispute that the State, by statute, makes certain benefits and obligations available to different-sex couples but denies same-sex couples access to those same benefits and obligations. The legal question common to every challenge Plaintiffs might lodge against these statutes is whether, under our Constitution, the State may categorically exclude homosexuals and bisexuals in committed intimate same-sex relationships from the opportunity to obtain the same statutory protections made available to heterosexuals and bisexuals in committed intimate different-sex relationships. There is no persuasive, let alone legitimate, reason why we cannot issue a ruling on this question. Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that \u201cthe nature of the State\u2019s interest\u201d in excluding same-sex couples varies from statute to statute, this does not preclude us from declaring what Plaintiffs\u2019 rights are under traditional constitutional principles. We can rule-and I would rule-that sexual orientation is a suspect class and, therefore, that the State\u2019s interest in denying same-sex couples the opportunity to obtain the statutory protections offered to different-sex couples must be \u201ccompelling.\u201d Such a ruling is permitted by the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, and it would adequately resolve this dispute. At that point, the legislative and executive branches could take whatever steps are necessary to honor Plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights-as legislative and executive officers are constitutionally sworn to do (Mont. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 3)-in accordance with our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b677 The Court tells Plaintiffs that they may amend their complaint and pursue further proceedings in the District Court. Opinion, \u00b6 13. While this at least has the virtue of rescuing their claims from the District Court\u2019s outright dismissal, I cannot agree that this remedy is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>adequate. To the contrary, refusing to declare Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights <em>forthwith, </em>and sending them back to the District Court for unnecessary re-litigation of a constitutional question they have squarely presented to us in the instant appeal, is itself an infringement of those rights. It must not be forgotten that \u201c[t]he rights here asserted are, like all such rights, present rights; they are not merely hopes to some future enjoyment of some formalistic constitutional promise. The basic guarantees of our Constitution are warrants for the here and now and, unless there is an overwhelmingly compelling reason, they are to be promptly fulfilled.\u201d <em>Watson v. City of Memphis, </em>373 U.S. 526, 533, 83 S. Ct. 1314, 1318 (1963) (rejecting the City\u2019s request for further delay in meeting its constitutional obligation under the Fourteenth Amendment to desegregate its public parks and other municipal recreational facilities). Likewise, under Montana law, the courts of this State (including the Montana Supreme Court) are courts of justice. Section 3-1-101, MCA. \u201cCourts of justice shall be open to every person, and speedy remedy afforded for every injury of person[.] ... Right and justice shall be administered without sale, denial, or delay.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 16. This fundamental constitutional right is not simply access to courts. It is access toyusiice \u2014 defined in Montana\u2019s organic law to mean a speedy remedy, to every person, for every injury of person, without delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b678 Thus, as a matter of federal constitutional law and Montana constitutional law, Plaintiffs are entitled to a <em>prompt </em>determination of their constitutional rights vis-\u00e1-vis the State of Montana\u2019s admitted practice of making benefits and protections available to different-sex couples while categorically denying them to same-sex couples. Plaintiffs are also entitled to <em>prompt </em>rectification for any violations of these rights. <em>Watson, </em>373 U.S. at 533, 83 S. Ct. at 1318 (\u201cany deprivation of constitutional rights calls for prompt rectification\u201d); Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 16 (\u201cspeedy remedy\u201d shall be afforded for every injury). \u201cIt is axiomatic that \u2018justice delayed is justice denied.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Carlin v. Fifth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>118 Mont. 127, 135, 164 P.2d 155, 159 (1945); <em>cf. Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 816, 108 S. Ct. 2166, 2178 (1988) (\u201cPerpetual litigation of any issue ... delays, and therefore threatens to deny, justice.\u201d); <em>Kloss v. Edward D.

It is as if those rights cease to exist as legal rights.\u201d). Evading and delaying a decision on the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims, and requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>them to file seriatim challenges to \u201cinnumerable\u201d statutes-each with the same, common legal issue-denies Plaintiffs access to justice just as clearly and as surely as if we had simply padlocked the courthouse doors. No class of litigants should be burdened with the emotional, financial, and time-related costs of this approach. No class of litigants should be treated in this draconian fashion. Our decision today makes a mockery of this Court\u2019s supposed commitment to access-to-justice principles. <em>See In re the Estab. of an Access to Just. Commn., </em>No. AF 11-0765 (Mont. May 22, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b679 In light of the foregoing, I believe that rather than affirmatively <em>protect </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights as they are sworn to do, the Attorney General, the Legislature, and now, sadly, a majority of this Court have instead denied these persons justice and wrongly prolonged the State\u2019s discriminatory practices. In requiring Plaintiffs to jump through procedural hoops that we have <em>never </em>imposed on any other minority group, and in thus delaying the vindication of their constitutional rights, the Court conveys that gay, lesbian, and bisexual Montanans cannot expect to receive fairness, justice, respect, and equal treatment from Montana\u2019s courts. As I said at the outset, this is a black day for civil rights in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b680 I now turn to a detailed discussion of the law supporting my conclusion that declaratory relief is appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">III. DECLARATORY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b681 <em>Procedure should be the \u201chandmaid of justice,\u201d a means to an end. Instead ... procedure tends to become rigid, stereotyped, and over-technical, an end in itself, often seemingly oblivious to the practical needs of those to whose ills it is designed to minister. Litigants thus often become pawns in a game, the social cost of which is excessive and the result of which is frequently unnecessarily cumbersome and socially undesirable. Substantive rights often become the incidents of procedural fencing. </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AzQ\">A. Legal Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b682 The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act in 1922. The Act has been adopted, substantially as drafted, in most states including Montana. <em>See </em>Unif. Declaratory Judms. Act, tbl. of jxns. and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>historical notes, 12 U.L.A. 331 (2008 &amp; Supp. 2012); Mont. Code Ann., Annotations 2012, at 1030; Title 27, chapter 8, MCA. The Act states that it is to be \u201cso interpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those states which enact it and to harmonize, as far as possible, with federal laws and regulations on the subject of declaratory judgments and decrees.\u201d Section 27-8-103, MCA. Thus, it is appropriate to consider decisions from other jurisdictions when applying the Act. <em>See e.g. Beahringer v. Page, </em>789 N.E.2d 1216, 1223 (Ill. 2003) (\u201cIn interpreting the Illinois declaratory judgment statute, Illinois courts may look to the decisions of other states in interpreting the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b683 The purpose of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act \u201cis to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations.\u201d Section 27-8-102, MCA. The Act relieves litigants of the common-law rule that no declaration of rights may be judicially adjudged unless a right has been violated. <em>Boyds Civic Assn. v. Montgomery Co. Council, </em>526 A.2d 598, 602 (Md. 1987). In other words, the Act renders disputes concerning legal rights and duties justiciable without proof of a wrong committed by one party against another. <em>Hirschfield v. Bd. of Co. Commrs., </em>944 P.2d 1139, 1142 (Wyo. 1997); <em>see also Beahringer, </em>789 N.E.2d at 1223 (\u201cThe declaratory judgment procedure allows the court to take hold of a controversy one step sooner than normally-that is, after the dispute has arisen, but before steps are taken which give rise to claims for damages or other relief. The parties to the dispute can then learn the consequences of their action before acting.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b684 Thus, we have recognized that declaratory relief serves \u201cto liquidate uncertainties and controversies which might result in future litigation.\u201d <em>In re Dewar, </em>169 Mont. 437, 444, 548 P.2d 149, 154 (1976); <em>accord Forty-Second Legis. Assembly v. Lennon, </em>156 Mont. 416, 421, 481 P.2d 330, 332 (1971) (\u201cto eliminate or reduce a multiplicity of future litigation\u201d); <em>Beahringer, </em>789 N.E.2d at 1223 (\u201c \u2018to afford security and relief against uncertainty so as to avoid potential litigation\u2019 \u201d). Through declaratory relief, \u201c \u2018parties between whom an actual controversy exists or between whom litigation is inevitable are enabled to have the issues speedily determined where their determination would be delayed to the possible injury of the one or the other if they were compelled to await the course of ordinary judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Automation Sys., Inc. v. Intel Corp., </em>501 F. Supp. 345, 347 (S.D. Iowa 1980) (quoting Anthony William Deller, <em>Walker on Patents </em>vol. 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u00a7 617, 65 (2d ed. 1973)). In this respect, \u201cdeclaratory procedure operates prospectively, and not merely for the redress of past wrongs. It serves to set controversies at rest before they lead to repudiation of obligations, invasion of rights or commission of wrongs; in short, the remedy is to be used in the interests of preventive justice, to declare rights rather than execute them.\u201d <em>Babb v. Super. Ct., </em>479 P.2d 379, 383 (Cal. 1971) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b685 To that end, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act confers on courts the \u201cpower to declare rights, status, and other legal relations <em>whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\u201d </em>Section 27-8-201, MCA (emphasis added). The declaration \u201cmay be either affirmative or negative in form and effect,\u201d and it has \u201cthe force and effect of a final judgment or decree.\u201d Section 27-8-201, MCA. The Act specifically provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">[a]ny person interested under a deed, will, written contract, or other writings constituting a contract or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument, statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Section 27-8-202, MCA. The Act further provides, however, that this enumeration \u201cdoes not limit or restrict the exercise of the general powers conferred in 27-8-201 in any proceeding where declaratory relief is sought in which a judgment or decree will terminate the controversy or remove an uncertainty.\u201d Section 27-8-205, MCA. The Act \u201cis to be liberally construed and administered,\u201d \u00a7 27-8-102, MCA, and \u201c[n]o action or proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a declaratory judgment or decree is prayed for,\u201d \u00a7 27-8-201, MCA. \u00b686 Lastly, it is well settled that declaratory procedure is appropriate to determine a constitutional question or to test a constitutional right. <em>See e.g. MEA-MFT v. McCulloch, </em>2012 MT 211, 366 Mont. 266, 291 P.3d 1075; <em>Snetsinger v. Mont. Univ. Sys., </em>2004 MT 390, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445; <em>McGillivray v.

As the Washington Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[djeclaratory procedure is peculiarly well suited to the judicial determination of controversies concerning constitutional rights and ... the constitutionality of legislative action or inaction.\u201d <em>Seattle Sch. Dist. v. State, </em>585 P.2d 71, 80 (Wash. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>B. The District Court\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b687 Given these principles, the District Court clearly had power \u201cto declare [Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional] rights, status, and other legal relations <em>\u2019\u2019-whether or not further relief was or could he claimed-in </em>order to \u201cterminate the controversy\u201d or \u201cremove an uncertainty.\u201d Sections 27-8-201, -205, MCA. The District Court did not deny that it has this power; in fact, Plaintiffs reminded the District Court that it has this power in their motion to alter or amend the judgment. The District Court, rather, simply failed to exercise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b688 At this juncture it is necessary to describe Plaintiffs\u2019 Prayer for Relief, which is attached as Appendix 2 to this Dissent. It consists of nine numbered paragraphs. The first five paragraphs seek <em>declaratory </em>relief-specifically, a \u201cdeclaration\u201d that the State\u2019s categorical exclusion of same-sex couples from the opportunity to obtain the protections and obligations which the State makes available to different-sex couples violates five separate rights in the Montana Constitution. The next two paragraphs seek <em>injunctive </em>relief: that the State be enjoined \u201cfrom continuing to deny Plaintiffs and their families access to a legal status and statutory structure that confers the protections and obligations the State provides to different-sex couples who marry,\u201d and that the State be required \u201cto offer same-sex couples and their families a legal status and statutory structure that confers the protections and obligations that the State provides to different-sex couples who marry, but not the status or designation of marriage.\u201d The final two paragraphs seek costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b689 Curiously, while five of the nine paragraphs in the Prayer for Relief seek <em>declaratory </em>relief, the District Court focused exclusively on the question of <em>injunctive </em>relief. The court stated that \u201c[t]he relief sought by Plaintiffs is contained in paragraph 7 of their prayer for relief.\u201d Paragraph 7 requests an order requiring the State to offer same-sex couples and their families \u201ca legal status and statutory structure that confers the protections and obligations that the State provides to different-sex couples who marry, but not the status or designation of marriage.\u201d The District Court interpreted this to mean that \u201cPlaintiffs seek an order of this Court requiring the legislature to adopt a civil union or domestic partnership statutory scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u00b690 The District Court questioned whether the issuance of such an order would be an appropriate exercise of the court\u2019s power. The District Court acknowledged that it has previously been willing to exercise its judicial power when it found \u201ca specific statute applying to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>gay people\u201d unconstitutional. <em>See Gryczan v. State, </em>No. BDV-93-1869 (Mont. 1st Jud. Dist. Feb. 16, <em>1996), aff'd, </em>283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112 (1997). However, the District Court distinguished the present case from <em>Gryczan </em>on the ground that \u201cwhat Plaintiffs want here is not a declaration of the unconstitutionality of a specific statute or set of statutes, but rather a direction to the legislature to enact a statutory arrangement.\u201d The District Court opined that directing the Legislature to take such action \u201cwould launch this Court into a roiling maelstrom of policy issues without a constitutional compass.\u201d The District Court also felt that it could not issue such an order without knowing <em>\u201call </em>of the statutes that would be affected\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b691 The District Court further acknowledged that it has previously declared a statutory scheme unconstitutional and allowed the Legislature broad discretion to correct the unconstitutional portions of the statutes. <em>See Columbia Falls Elem. Sch. Dist. v. State, </em>No. BDV-02-0528 (Mont. 1st Jud. Dist. Apr. 15, 2004), <em>aff'd, </em>2005 MT 69, 326 Mont. 304, 109 P.3d 257. But the District Court viewed <em>Columbia Falls </em>as distinguishable from the present case in that the court was dealing with \u201ca discreet school funding formula\u201d and \u201cknew exactly what statutes would be affected\u201d in the <em>Columbia Falls </em>case, whereas the present case involves \u201ca not yet entirely specified array of statutes that deal with many different topics and were enacted over a variety of years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b692 The District Court thus reached \u201cthe jurisprudential decision that Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief constitutes an impermissible sojourn into the powers of the legislative branch.\u201d Citing \u201cthe constitutional separation of powers\u201d (Mont. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 1), the District Court granted the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss. The District Court posited that the proper way to address Plaintiffs\u2019 concerns would be through \u201cspecific suits directed at specific, identifiable statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b693 With regard to the issue of <em>injunctive </em>relief, I do not fault Plaintiffs for including requests for such relief in their complaint. It was their prerogative to do so. <em>See </em>Title 27, chapter 19, MCA. Likewise, however, I do not fault the District Court for declining to order <em>injunctive </em>relief at this stage. The District Court noted several factors which, in the court\u2019s view, weighed against the issuance of a judicial order requiring the Legislature to enact the \u201cstatutory structure\u201d requested by Plaintiffs. I cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in this regard. <em>See Krutzfeldt Ranch, LLC v. Pinnacle Bank, </em>2012 MT 15, \u00b6 13, 363 Mont. 366, 272 P.3d 635 (\u201cthe denial of a temporary or permanent injunction is reviewed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u2018manifest abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b694 That being said, <em>none </em>of the factors identified by the District Court regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 request for <em>injunctive </em>relief excuse or justify that court\u2019s complete and utter failure to grant Plaintiffs\u2019 request for <em>declaratory </em>relief. It bears repeating that the District Court had \u201cpower to declare rights, status, and other legal relations <em>whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\u201d </em>Section 27-8-201, MCA (emphasis added). Indeed, \u201c \u2018[a] declaratory judgment or decree is one which simply declares the rights of the parties or expresses the opinion of the court on a question of law, <em>without ordering anything to be done-, </em>its distinctive characteristic being that the declaration stands by itself, and no executory process follows as of course ....\u2019 \u201d <em>Black v. Siler, </em>392 P.2d 572, 574 (Ariz. 1964) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Clein v. Kaplan, </em>40 S.E.2d 133, 137 (Ga. 1946)). The District Court had the power to issue a declaration if for no other reason than to \u201cremove an uncertainty\u201d regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 rights. Section 27-8-205, MCA. Again, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act \u201cis to be liberally construed and administered,\u201d \u00a7 27-8-102, MCA, and \u201c[n]o action or proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a declaratory judgment or decree is prayed for,\u201d \u00a7 27-8-201, MCA. Thus, the fact that the District Court felt precluded from granting Plaintiffs\u2019 requests for <em>injunctive </em>relief was not a valid legal basis for ignoring their requests for <em>declaratory </em>relief. These are distinct forms of relief, and a court\u2019s ability to grant the latter does not depend in any way whatsoever on its ability to grant the former. Section 27-8-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b695 There is likewise no merit to the proposition that declaratory relief cannot be granted without first identifying \u201call\u201d of the statutes that would be affected by the ruling. First of all, as a factual matter, Plaintiffs provided the District Court with a list, appearing to be exhaustive, of the Montana statutes that confer benefits and protections on married couples-benefits and protections that are unavailable to Plaintiffs because they cannot marry. <em>See </em>Appendix 1 to this Dissent. The District Court thus had what it claimed it needed: a list of \u201call of the statutes that would be affected\u201d by the court\u2019s ruling. Yet, rather than address Plaintiffs\u2019 requests for declaratory relief in light of this list-which Plaintiffs had provided at the District Court\u2019s behest-the District Court inexplicably took no action at all and thus caused their motion to alter or amend the judgment to be denied by operation of law. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b696 Secondly, this same proposition-that declaratory relief cannot be granted without first identifying \u201call\u201d of the statutes that would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>affected by the ruling-was asserted, and rejected, in <em>Spates v. Montgomery Co., </em>590 A.2d 1074, 1076 (Md. Spec. App. 1991). There, the government argued that \u201cby failing to identify particular statutes he regards as unconstitutional, Spates has not presented a justiciable issue.\u201d <em>Spates, </em>590 A.2d at 1077. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals agreed that Spates\u2019 complaint was \u201cpoorly drawn and seriously lacking in specifics.\u201d <em>Spates, </em>590 A.2d at 1077. Yet, the court observed that Spates\u2019 \u201cbasic point\u201d was that the government\u2019s failure to tax personal property placed an unfair, disproportionate, and nonuniform tax burden on the owners of real property. <em>Spates, </em>590 A.2d at 1077. From this, the court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">the failure to identify particular sections of the Tax-Property article of the Code is really not telling in this case. Spates has challenged the system of taxation authorized by law, which includes those sections defining terms, imposing the property tax, determining the kinds of property to be taxed, establishing the method of assessment, and providing for the collection of the tax. Given the nature of his attack, it would, as he contends, be well-nigh impossible, and quite unnecessary in our view, to pick through the entire Tax Code and identify only those specific statutes or parts of statutes that directly support the system he challenges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><em>Spates, </em>590 A.2d at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b697 Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge in the present case is not directed at Montana\u2019s system of taxation; it is directed at Montana\u2019s system of statutory benefits and protections accorded to married couples. Nevertheless, <em>Spates\u2019 </em>reasoning is pertinent here. Indeed, the fact that the Legislature has spread the benefits and protections throughout the Code, rather than collecting them all in a single title and chapter, cannot immunize the system from challenge and review.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u00b698 The one feature common to each of the benefits and protections is that they are granted to \u201cspouses,\u201d or on the basis of \u201cmarriage\u201d to a \u201chusband\u201d or \u201cwife.\u201d Under current Montana law, only heterosexuals and bisexuals in different-sex relationships can get \u201cmarried\u201d and thus become \u201cspouses,\u201d \u201chusbands,\u201d and \u201cwives\u201d; homosexuals and bisexuals in same-sex relationships are not allowed to marry. Mont. Const, art. XIII, \u00a7 7; \u00a7\u00a7 40-1-103, -401(l)(d), MCA; <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>810, 1533, 1735 <em>(spouse: </em>\u201ca married person\u201d; husband: \u201c[a] married man\u201d; wife: \u201c[a] married woman\u201d). As a result, same-sex couples are not encompassed within these benefits and protections. Plaintiffs challenge this scheme as unconstitutional-i.e., the fact that the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>systematically denies them \u201cthe opportunity\u201d to obtain the benefits and protections made available to different-sex couples. Again, Plaintiffs do not ask to be married; they would be satisfied if \u201cthe opportunity\u201d to obtain the benefits and protections were provided through some sort of alternative method distinct from \u201cmarriage.\u201d Whether this claim implicates one statute or a hundred, it is quite unnecessary for Plaintiffs to identify them all in this lawsuit in order to obtain a declaratory ruling. Paragraphs 1 through 5 of the Prayer for Relief seek only a \u201cdeclaration\u201d that this disparate treatment \u2014 iAe <em>existence of which no one disputes </em>\u2014 violates the Montana Constitution. The District Court and this Court, in turn, may decree that it is unconstitutional to deny same-sex couples the opportunity to obtain the civil protections made available to different-sex couples, absent a compelling state interest. Once that is done, the Legislature can identify the problem statutes and amend them. Indeed, the Legislature did just that in 2009 when it passed House Bill 37, titled \u201cAn Act Gender Neutralizing and Conforming Titles 10 through 90 of the Montana Code Annotated to Current Bill Drafting Standards ....\u201d This single piece of legislation, the text of which spans 967 pages of the 2009 Session Laws, simultaneously amended 2,876 statutes. Surely if the Legislature can identify several thousand statutes needing to be \u201cgender neutralized,\u201d the Legislature can identify a few hundred statutes needing to be \u201csexual-orientation neutralized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b699 We have said that \u201c[t]he decision to dismiss a complaint for declaratory relief is within the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Renville v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>2003 MT 103, \u00b6 9, 315 Mont. 295, 69 P.3d 217. We have also held, however, that the \u201c[fjailure of a district court to exercise discretion is itself an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Clark Fork Coalition v. Mont. Dept. of Envtl. Quality, </em>2008 MT 407, \u00b6 43, 347 Mont. 197, 197 P.3d 482; <em>cf. Spates, </em>590 A.2d at 1076 (\u201cHaving failed to find a legitimate reason not to declare the rights of the parties, it was incumbent upon the court to do so.\u201d). That is what happened here when the District Court dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint based on their requested <em>injunctive </em>relief, without addressing their requested <em>declaratory </em>relief. In so doing, the District Court wrongly conflated these two forms of relief. The District Court failed to recognize that one of the purposes of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is \u201c[t]o enable public duties and powers to be established without the cumbersome and technical prerequisites of mandamus, certiorari, injunction, prohibition, or habeas corpus.\u201d Edwin Borchard, <em>Declaratory Judgments </em>288 (2d ed. 1941). The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>overlooked the fact that while a motion to dismiss may be used in a declaratory judgment proceeding \u201cto challenge the legal availability or appropriateness of <em>the remedy,\u201d </em>a motion to dismiss should \u201cseldom, if ever,... be sustained or the complaint dismissed without <em>a declaration </em>one way or the other of <em>the rights </em>of the parties.\u201d <em>Spates, </em>590 A.2d at 1076 (emphases added, brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>cf. Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 468-69, 94 S. Ct. 1209, 1220 (1974) (a federal court has \u201cthe duty to decide the appropriateness and the merits of the declaratory request irrespective of its conclusion as to the propriety of the issuance of the injunction\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); James Wm. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>vol. 2, \u00a7 12.34[l][b], 12-81 (3d ed., Matthew Bender 2012) (\u201cConsistently with their obligation to construe plaintiffs\u2019 allegations liberally, courts will not dismiss for failure to state a claim merely because the complaint requests inappropriate relief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b6100 I am thus in complete agreement with Plaintiffs\u2019 statement, in their motion to alter or amend the judgment, that \u201cdismissal of the entire action based solely on one request for injunctive relief reflects a manifest error of law as there are five other requests for declaratory judgment upon which this Court may properly rule.\u201d The District Court erred, as a matter of law, in its treatment of Plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory relief, and the District Court\u2019s judgment must therefore be reversed to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">C. This Court\u2019s \u201cJusticiability\u201d Rationale</p>\n<p id=\"ATJ\">\u00b6101 Like the District Court, this Court also lumps Plaintiffs\u2019 requests for <em>injunctive </em>relief and <em>declaratory </em>relief into a single analysis. Opinion, \u00b6 9. Doing so is error for the reasons just discussed. The Court does appear, however, to reject Plaintiffs\u2019 claims using a somewhat different rationale. Specifically, the Court asserts that this case is not \u201cjusticiable\u201d because a ruling in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor \u201cwould not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to this proceeding\u201d and because Plaintiffs are asking this Court to \u201cdetermine speculative matters,\u201d \u201cdeclare social status,\u201d \u201cgive advisory opinions,\u201d or \u201cgive abstract opinions.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 9. In all respects, the Court is mistaken. \u00b6102 First of all, a declaratory judgment is itself \u201cremedial.\u201d Section 27-8-102, MCA. A declaratory judgment or decree is one which simply declares the rights of the parties or expresses the opinion of the court on a question of law, <em>without ordering anything to be done-, </em>the declaration stands by itself, and no executory process follows as of course. <em>Black, </em>392 P.2d at 574; <em>Clein, </em>40 S.E.2d at 137; \u00a7 27-8-201, MCA. The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act permits courts \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity.\u201d Section 27-8-102, MCA. A declaratory judgment is appropriate if for no other reason than to \u201cremove an uncertainty.\u201d Section 27-8-205, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b6103 The Court\u2019s contention that a declaratory judgment would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to this proceeding is simply untrue. There is no dispute that the State offers a variety of benefits and protections to committed intimate couples, but only different-sex couples have the opportunity to obtain them. This regime gives preferential treatment to heterosexuals and bisexuals committed to a person of the opposite sex, and disfavors homosexuals and bisexuals committed to a person of the same sex. Plaintiffs\u2019 requests for declaratory relief raise one legal question: Is it constitutionally permissible for the State to deny same-sex couples the opportunity to obtain the benefits and protections made available to different-sex couples? In other words, is it constitutionally permissible for Montana\u2019s government to treat Plaintiffs differently based on their sexual orientation? That is the \u201cuncertainty or controversy\u201d in this case. We may resolve it-and, for the reasons detailed in the Constitutional Analysis section below, I would resolve it-by holding that sexual orientation is a suspect class and that any disparate treatment between committed intimate same-sex couples and different-sex married couples is subject to \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d review. Such a ruling would answer and resolve Plaintiffs\u2019 requests for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b6104 Secondly, there is no merit to the Court\u2019s suggestion that Plaintiffs have asked us to determine speculative matters, declare social status, or give an abstract opinion. This dismissive portrayal of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is insulting and disrespectful. There is nothing \u201cspeculative\u201d about the discrimination Plaintiffs have experienced-some of it private, some of it state-imposed-as described in their affidavits. The State itself does not deny that Plaintiffs have suffered economic and emotional harm due to their sexual orientation and that Plaintiffs\u2019 relationships are treated differently than their different-sex counterparts under the law. Plaintiffs do not ask or need this Court to declare their \u201csocial status.\u201d Plaintiffs are acutely aware of their social status. They ask this Court, rather, to declare and uphold their constitutional rights. There is nothing \u201cspeculative\u201d or \u201cabstract\u201d about this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b6105 Lastly, we have previously defined nonjusticiable advisory opinions as \u201copinions issued by the court in response to a request from some other branch of government, such as the legislative or executive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>asking for information concerning matters of law.\u201d <em>In re Secret Grand Jury Inquiry, </em>170 Mont. 354, 357, 553 P.2d 987, 990 (1976). That clearly is not the case here. More recently, we have stated that an advisory opinion is \u201cone advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts or upon an abstract proposition.\u201d <em>Plan Helena, Inc. v. Helena Regl. Airport Auth. Bd., </em>2010 MT 26, \u00b6 12, 355 Mont. 142, 226 P.3d 567. That too is not the case here. The underlying state of facts is not \u201chypothetical,\u201d nor is the proposition \u201cabstract.\u201d Plaintiffs are being denied access to statutory benefits and protections which the State, in its discretion, has chosen to make available to different-sex couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b6106 In <em>Secret Grand Jury Inquiry, </em>this Court articulated what constitutes a \u201cjusticiable controversy\u201d for purposes of obtaining a declaratory judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">First, a justiciable controversy requires that parties have existing and genuine, as distinguished from theoretical, rights or interests. Second, the controversy must be one upon which the judgment of the court may effectively operate, as distinguished from a debate or argument invoking a purely political, administrative, philosophical or academic conclusion. Third, it must be a controversy the judicial determination of which will have the effect of a final judgment in law or decree in equity upon the rights, status or legal relationships of one or more of the real parties in interest, or lacking these qualities be of such an overriding public moment as to constitute the legal equivalent of all of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">170 Mont. at 357, 553 P.2d at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b6107 We have repeated this test in numerous cases,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and recently applied the test in <em>Chipman v. N.W. Healthcare Corp., </em>2012 MT 242, \u00b6\u00b6 19-23, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d 193. Here, the rights Plaintiffs invoke (Article II, Sections 3, 4, 10, and 17 of the Montana Constitution) are obviously not theoretical. They are \u201cexisting and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>genuine\u201d constitutional rights. Second, a judgment on whether the State may make statutory benefits and protections available to different-sex couples, but categorically deny them to same-sex couples, \u201cwill effectively operate to settle the issues at hand.\u201d <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 22. I am not persuaded that it is necessary to litigate \u201cthe nature of the State\u2019s interest\u201d with respect to each individual statute. Opinion, \u00b6 13. But even assuming, for the sake of argument, that <em>the nature of the State\u2019s interest </em>in excluding same-sex couples varies from statute to statute, the present action can definitively settle <em>the nature of Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional </em>rights-rights that are the same regardless of the statute at issue. There is no indication, therefore, that a declaration here would be \u201cpurely political, administrative, philosophical or academic.\u201d <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 22. Finally, in considering \u201cthe main thrust\u201d of this lawsuit, <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 23, this Court has been asked to determine the constitutional relationship of the parties. In particular, we must determine whether the Constitution requires that when the State offers legal benefits and protections to persons in committed intimate relationships, it must do so evenhandedly, without discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. This controversy directly involves the rights, status, and legal relationships of the parties. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>see also Plan Helena, </em>\u00b6 9 (the controversy must be \u201cdefinite and concrete, touching legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, it is a justiciable controversy under the foregoing three-part test.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">D. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b6108 In sum, the Court errs in holding that this case is nonjusticiable. In adopting its statute-by-statute approach, the Court not only fails to follow Montana\u2019s own statutory commands, but also sets itself apart as the non-uniform black sheep in the otherwise <em>Uniform </em>Declaratory Judgments Act states.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b6109 Courts have \u201cpower to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\u201d Section 27-8-201, MCA. This power \u201cis to be liberally construed and administered\u201d to permit courts \u201cto settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity.\u201d Section 27-8-102, -205, MCA. Through a declaratory judgment proceeding, \u201ca multiplicity of suits can be avoided, while an adequate, expedient, and inexpensive remedy can be afforded for litigants in a single action.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Cilbe, Inc., </em>104 So. 2d 397, 403 (Fla. App. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b6110 Here, the declaratory issue is whether the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Constitution prohibits the State from excluding same-sex partners from the opportunity to obtain the benefits and protections that the State makes available to different-sex partners. There is no need to identify \u201call\u201d of the potentially offending statutes in order to issue a ruling on this legal question, nor is there a need to pursue each statutory challenge separately. It is sufficient to declare the constitutional standard applicable to Plaintiffs\u2019 claim-an issue which Plaintiffs have raised and briefed. And for the reasons discussed below, I would hold that sexual orientation is a suspect class under Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution and that discrimination based on sexual orientation in the provision of statutory benefits and protections is subject to \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d review. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment and direct it to enter such an order. I dissent from this Court\u2019s failure and refusal to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b6111 As for the injunctions Plaintiffs request, I do not believe it is necessary to order such relief at this point. It is sufficient to declare Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights so as to remove the apparent uncertainty concerning those rights. Sections 27-8-201, -205, MCA. Rather than proceed to direct the State how to remedy the problem, it is prudent to do what was done in the <em>Columbia Falls </em>and <em>Snetsinger </em>cases and permit the legislative and executive branches to address and resolve the matter in the first instance, in accordance with our constitutional interpretation, as those officers are sworn to do (Mont. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 3). <em>See </em>Borchard, <em>Declaratory Judgments </em>279-80 (\u201cThe declaratory action proceeds on the assumption that a mild remedy will often satisfy, that responsible defendants, like government officials or large corporations, do not need more than a declaration of the law to obey it and that a coercive procedure under such circumstances is an expensive and often unnecessary luxury.\u201d). Indeed, this is exactly what happened following our decision in <em>Snetsinger, </em>where we concluded that the Montana University System\u2019s policy of treating unmarried same-sex couples differently than unmarried different-sex couples in the provision of health benefits violated the Montana Constitution. Within three months, the Board of Regents had approved-unanimously, no less-a new insurance policy that would allow University System employees to obtain health coverage for gay and lesbian partners. <em>See Regents Approve Same-Sex Insurance Policy, </em>Missoulian (Mar. 18, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b6112 Plaintiffs here contend that entering a declaratory judgment regarding their constitutional rights \u201cwould serve the courts\u2019 primary function of adjudicating citizens\u2019 rights under the Constitution, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>allowing the coordinate branches of government a reasonable opportunity to bring the State\u2019s conduct into compliance with the Constitution.\u201d I agree and, thus, would affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief, with the understanding that Plaintiffs may again pursue such relief if it becomes necessary in the future to do so. <em>See e.g. Baker v. State, </em>744 A.2d 864, 886, 887 (Vt. 1999) (\u201cWe hold only that plaintiffs are entitled under Chapter I, Article 7, of the Vermont Constitution to obtain the same benefits and protections afforded by Vermont law to married opposite-sex couples. We do not purport to infringe upon the prerogatives of the Legislature to craft an appropriate means of addressing this constitutional mandate.... In the event that the benefits and protections in question are not statutorily granted, plaintiffs may petition this Court to order the remedy they originally sought.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b6113 Having detailed my reasons for disagreeing with the District Court\u2019s and this Court\u2019s procedural dispositions of the case, I now provide the legal analysis underlying my conclusions that sexual orientation is a suspect class and, thus, that treating same-sex couples differently than different-sex couples is subject to strict scrutiny review.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">IV. CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b6114 <em>[I]n view of the constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens.

In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the </em>law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b6115 Plaintiffs contend that the State\u2019s exclusion of same-sex couples from the opportunity to obtain the benefits and protections which the State makes available to different-sex couples violates five fundamental constitutional rights: to pursue safety, health, and happiness (Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 3), to equal protection of the laws (\u00a7 4), to individual dignity (\u00a7 4), to individual privacy (\u00a7 10), and to due process of law (\u00a7 17). Because I conclude that the Equal Protection Clause (which happens to be Plaintiffs\u2019 primary argument) is sufficient to resolve this case, I focus my analysis there and do not address Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments under Article II, Sections 3, 10, or 17. At the conclusion of my equal protection discussion, however, I briefly discuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Article II, Section 4\u2019s Dignity Clause and the additional support it provides for Plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">A. Religious, Moral, and Political Beliefs</p>\n<p id=\"ATd\">\u00b6116 At the outset, it is important to emphasize two preliminary points made by various courts which have addressed these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"AyTX\">\u00b6117 First, although the question whether the State may exclude same-sex couples from the benefits and protections that it provides to different-sex married couples \u201carouses deeply-felt religious, moral, and political beliefs[, o]ur constitutional responsibility to consider the legal merits of issues properly before us provides no exception for the controversial <em>case.\u201d Baker v. State, </em>744 A.2d 864, 867 (Vt. 1999). Courts have a duty to uphold the constitutional rights of all parties, regardless of how unpopular they or their cause may be. <em>See e.g. Gryczan v. State, </em>283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112 (1997) (upholding the constitutional right of homosexuals to engage in private, consensual, noncommercial sexual conduct with other adults free of governmental interference or regulation); <em>Texas v.

As aptly stated by the United States Supreme Court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These considerations do not answer the question before us, however. The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of [its] law[s]. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 571, 123 S.

Speaking to this same subject, this Court has likewise observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">it is not the function of this or of any court to interpret the law on the basis of what may be morally acceptable or unacceptable to society at any given time.... Our Constitution does not protect morality; it does, however, guarantee to all persons, whether in the majority or in a minority, those certain basic freedoms and rights which are set forth in the Declaration of Rights .... Regardless that majoritarian morality may be expressed in the public-policy pronouncements of the legislature, it remains the obligation of the courts-and of this Court in particular-to scrupulously support, protect and defend those rights and liberties guaranteed to all persons under our Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APv\"><em>Gryczan, </em>283 Mont. at 454-55, 942 P.2d at 125; <em>see also Alaska Civ.

Indeed, \u201cthe fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional <em>attack.\u201d Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 577-78, 123 S.

While we have stated the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d requirement in numerous cases, <em>see e.g. Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>State v. Egdorf, </em>2003 MT 264, \u00b6 15, 317 Mont. 436, 77 P.3d 517; <em>Powell v. State Compen. Ins.

Federal caselaw provides some guidance on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\u00b6124 The federal framework for analyzing equal protection claims is the same as the Montana framework. The first step is to identify the State\u2019s classification of groups. <em>Freeman v. City of Santa Ana, </em>68 F.3d 1180, 1187 (9th Cir. 1995). To accomplish this, a plaintiff can show that the law is applied in a discriminatory manner or imposes different burdens on different classes of people. <em>Freeman, </em>68 F.3d at 1187. Once the plaintiff establishes a governmental classification, it is necessary to identify a \u201csimilarly situated\u201d class against which the plaintiffs class can be compared. <em>Freeman, </em>68 F.3d at 1187. This is necessary because \u201c[discrimination cannot exist in a vacuum; it can be found only in the unequal treatment of people in similar circumstances.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>Atty. Gen. of U.S. v. Irish People, Inc., </em>684 F.2d 928, 946 (D.C. Cir. 1982). \u201cThe goal of identifying a similarly situated class ... is to isolate the factor allegedly subject to impermissible discrimination. The similarly situated group is the control group.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguilar, </em>883 F.2d 662, 706 (9th Cir. 1989). Although the formula for determining whether two groups are \u201csimilarly situated\u201d for equal protection purposes \u201cis not always susceptible to precise demarcation,\u201d <em>Marrero-Gutierrez v. Molina, </em>491 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2007), the question is essentially whether the plaintiffs group is \u201croughly equivalent\u201d to the control group, <em>Tapalian v. Tusino, </em>377 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004), in \u201call relevant respects\u201d other than the factor constituting the alleged discrimination, <em>Aguilar, </em>883 F.2d at <em>706; Nordlinger v. Hahn, </em>505 U.S. 1, 10, 112 S. Ct. 2326, 2331 (1992). \u201cExact correlation is neither likely nor necessary, but the cases must be fair congeners.\u201d <em>Tapalian, </em>377 F.3d at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Lastly, if it is demonstrated that a cognizable class is treated differently, the court analyzes whether the distinction made between the groups is justified under the appropriate level of scrutiny. <em>United States v. Lopez-Flores, </em>63 F.3d 1468, 1472 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">D. Classification and \u201cSimilarly Situated\u201d Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"A7_\">\u00b6 125 As discussed, the State grants various benefits and obligations to married persons, which is accomplished through the use of such terms as \u201chusband,\u201d \u201cwife,\u201d \u201cspouse,\u201d or \u201cmarried\u201d in the various statutes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The State contends, therefore, that the statutes create \u201ca marital classification.\u201d In the State\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he different classes involved here are married couples, who by definition are capable of receiving spousal benefits, and unmarried couples, who by definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>are not capable of receiving spousal benefits.\u201d The State further argues that married couples and unmarried couples are not similarly situated because married couples are formally recognized under the law and unmarried couples are not. Thus, the State concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim must fail. One of the State\u2019s amici (Montana Family Foundation) similarly argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 claim fails because \u201call unmarried couples are treated alike under Montana law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b6126 These arguments are incorrect-both in identifying the pertinent classification and in applying the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d concept. It is true that the statutes, on their face, classify based on marital status. But, as we have recognized, it is sometimes necessary to look beyond the face of a classification in order to ascertain the true distinction being drawn. In <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Peterson, </em>263 Mont. 156, 866 P.2d 241 (1993), for example, this Court did not treat \u201cnormal pregnancy and childbirth\u201d as a classification between pregnant persons and non-pregnant persons-the approach the State argues here. Rather, we recognized that distinctions based on pregnancy are, in reality, sex-linked classifications. \u201c[A]ny classification which relies on pregnancy as the determinative criterion is a distinction based on sex\u201d because \u201cit is the capacity to become pregnant which primarily differentiates the female from the male.\u201d <em>Bankers Life, </em>263 Mont. at 160, 866 P.2d at 243 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b6127 Likewise here, only different-sex couples have the capacity under current Montana law to get \u201cmarried\u201d and thereby become \u201cspouses,\u201d \u201chusbands,\u201d and \u201cwives.\u201d Same-sex couples are not permitted to marry and are thus categorically excluded from the statutory benefits and obligations granted to spouses, husbands, and wives. Mont. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 7; \u00a7\u00a7 40-1-103, -401(l)(d), <em>MCA]Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>810, 1533, 1735 <em>(spouse: </em>a married person; husband: a married man; <em>wife: </em>a married woman). Different-sex couples may obtain all of the benefits and obligations-by getting married. Same-sex couples may not obtain any of the benefits and obligations-because they cannot get married. Thus, while the classification may appear on its face to be marital status, the statutory definition of \u201cspouse\u201d is \u201c[i]nherent\u201d in this classification. <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 20. And because marital status, by definition, is available only to different-sex couples, the pertinent classification is sexual orientation. <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 27 (holding that sexual orientation, not marital status, is \u201cthe defining difference\u201d where \u201cunmarried opposite-sex couples are able to avail themselves of health benefits under the University System\u2019s policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>while unmarried same-sex couples are denied the health benefits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AvO\">\u00b6128 Indeed, if the State limited marriage to Caucasians, and then granted an array of statutory benefits to such married couples, it would be ludicrous to argue-as the State does here-that \u201cmarried couples qualify for spousal benefits not because they are [Caucasian] but because they are spouses.\u201d This statement is simply wrong. Being Caucasian is, in fact, a prerequisite to qualifying for the benefits in this example, just as being heterosexual (or bisexual and committed to someone of the opposite sex) is a prerequisite to qualifying for the benefits in the present case. By granting benefits in a seemingly benign fashion to \u201cspouses,\u201d but then defining \u201cspouses\u201d to include only Caucasians, the relevant classification is race, not marital status. If the State limited the meaning of \u201cspouse\u201d to Catholics, the classification would be religious affiliation. And by defining \u201cspouse\u201d to mean a member of a different-sex couple, the statutory scheme creates a classification based on sexual orientation.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b6129 It is perplexing that the State is even making the contrary argument, given the multitude of courts that have already rejected it. In <em>Tanner v. Oregon Health Sci. U., </em>971 P.2d 435 (Or. App. 1998), for example, the governmental defendant argued that the benefits at issue were \u201cavailable to all on equal terms\u201d because \u201c[a]ll married employees-heterosexual and homosexual alike-are permitted to acquire insurance benefits for their spouses.\u201d 971 P.2d at 447-48 (emphasis omitted). As the Oregon Court of Appeals observed, such reasoning \u201cmisses the point\u201d: \u201cHomosexual couples may not marry. Accordingly, the benefits are not made available on equal terms. They are made available on terms that, for gay and lesbian couples, are a legal impossibility.\u201d <em>Tanner, </em>971 P.2d at 448. Similarly, the governmental defendants in <em>Alaska Civ. Liberties Union </em>argued that their programs differentiated on the basis of marital status, not sexual orientation. The Alaska Supreme Court, however, concluded otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR8\">We agree with the plaintiffs that the proper comparison is between same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples, whether or not they are married. The municipality correctly observes that no unmarried employees, whether they are members of same-sex or opposite-sex couples, can obtain the disputed benefits for their domestic partners. But this does not mean that these programs treat same-sex and opposite-sex couples the same. Unmarried public employees in opposite-sex domestic relationships have the opportunity to obtain these benefits, because employees are not prevented by law from marrying their opposite-sex domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>partners. In comparison, public employees in committed same-sex relationships are absolutely denied any opportunity to obtain these benefits, because these employees are barred by law from marrying their same-sex partners in Alaska or having any marriage performed elsewhere recognized in Alaska. Same-sex unmarried couples therefore have no way of obtaining these benefits, whereas opposite-sex unmarried couples may become eligible for them by marrying. The programs consequently treat same-sex couples differently from opposite-sex couples.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><em>Alaska Civ. Liberties Union, </em>122 P.3d at 788; <em>accord Collins v. Brewer, </em>727 F. Supp. 2d 797, 803 (D. Ariz. 2010), <em>aff'd sub nom. Diaz v. Brewer, </em>656 F.3d 1008 (9th Cir. 2011); <em>Kerrigan v. Commr. of Pub.

Ct. at 2486-87 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in the judgment) (\u201cWhile it is true that the law applies only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is conduct that is closely correlated with being homosexual. Under such circumstances, Texas\u2019 sodomy law is targeted at more than conduct. It is instead directed toward gay persons as a class.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b6130 One of the fallacies in the State\u2019s approach is that it denies the most fundamental and defining aspect of same-sex relationships. The State contends that \u201c[l]aws granting spousal benefits do not discriminate against gays and lesbians any more than they discriminate against... other couples that may desire spousal benefits but do not qualify as spouses.\u201d In other words, the State asserts, Plaintiffs \u201care situated no differently than unmarried different-sex partners.\u201d Yet, as discussed above, different-sex partners may get married. And the State\u2019s implication that Plaintiffs may do the same-albeit, to someone of the opposite sex-is absurd. As the California Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">By limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples, the marriage statutes, realistically viewed, operate clearly and directly to impose different treatment on gay individuals because of their sexual orientation. By definition, gay individuals are persons who are sexually attracted to persons of the same sex and thus, if inclined to enter into a marriage relationship, would choose to marry a person of their own sex or gender. A statute that limits marriage to a union of persons of opposite sexes, thereby placing marriage outside the reach of couples of the same sex, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>unquestionably imposes different treatment on the basis of sexual orientation. <em>In our view, it is sophistic to suggest that this conclusion is avoidable by reason of the circumstance that the marriage statutes permit a gay man or a lesbian to marry someone of the opposite sex, because making such a choice would require the negation of the person\u2019s sexual orientation. </em>Just as a statute that restricted marriage only to couples of the same sex would discriminate against heterosexual persons on the basis of their heterosexual orientation, the current California statutes realistically must be viewed as discriminating against gay persons on the basis of their homosexual orientation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><em>In re Marriage Cases, </em>183 P.3d 384, 440-41 (Cal. 2008) (emphasis added, footnote omitted). It should be noted that people have a constitutionally protected right under the \u201cliberty\u201d component of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause and under the \u201cprivacy\u201d provision of the Montana Constitution to choose a personal intimate relationship with someone of the same sex. <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 567, 123 S. Ct. at 2478; <em>Gryczan, </em>283 Mont. at 455-56, 942 P.2d at 125-26. It is not the State\u2019s prerogative to prohibit such relationships. Nor, however, may the State seek to accomplish the same result through coercive measures-such as by denying homosexuals and bisexuals the equal protection of the State\u2019s secular laws when these individuals choose a partner of the same sex, rather than one of the opposite sex.</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\">\u00b6131 Another fallacy in the State\u2019s argument is the mistaken perception that \u201csimilarly situated\u201d means \u201csimilar in the possession of the classifying trait.\u201d When the government creates a particular classification, there of course will be some who fall within that class and some who fall outside of it. It is incorrect to say, however, as the State does here, that these two groups are not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d <em>because of the classification itself. </em>Such circular reasoning would effectively immunize every classification against equal protection challenge. The Iowa Supreme Court discussed this point in <em>Varnum:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFSX\">In considering whether two classes are similarly situated, a court cannot simply look at the trait used by the legislature to define a classification under a statute and conclude a person without that trait is not similarly situated to persons with the trait. The equal protection clause does not merely ensure the challenged statute applies equally to all people in the legislative classification. \u201cSimilarly situated\u201d cannot mean simply \u201csimilar in the possession of the classifying trait.\u201d All members of any class are similarly situated in this respect and consequently, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>classification whatsoever would be reasonable by this test. In the same way, the similarly situated requirement cannot possibly be interpreted to require plaintiffs to be identical in every way to people treated more favorably by the law. No two people or groups of people are the same in every way, and nearly every equal protection claim could be run aground onto the shoals of a threshold analysis if the two groups needed to be a mirror image of one another. Such a threshold analysis would hollow out the constitution\u2019s promise of equal protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">763 N.W.2d at 882-83 (citations, brackets, and some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b6132 Having discussed the fallacies of the State\u2019s approach, I turn to a proper \"similarly situated\u201d analysis. Again, whether two classes are similarly situated depends on whether they are roughly equivalent in all relevant respects <em>besides </em>the classifying trait adopted by the State. <em>Tapalian, </em>377 F.3d at 6; <em>Aguilar, </em>883 F.2d at 706. The inquiry is not whether persons are similarly situated for <em>all </em>purposes, but whether they are similarly situated for purposes of the law challenged. <em>Kerrigan, 957 </em>A.2d at 422; <em>accord Varnum, </em>763 N.W.2d at 883 (\u201cthe equal protection guarantee requires that laws treat all those who are similarly situated <em>with respect to the purposes of the law </em>alike\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b6133 In <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 27, this Court concluded that unmarried different-sex couples and unmarried same-sex couples, \u201calthough similarly situated in all respects other than sexual orientation,\u201d were not being treated \u201cequally and fairly\u201d because the former group had the ability to obtain the health benefits provided by the Montana University System and the latter group did not. That conclusion is on point here: unmarried different-sex couples are able to obtain the various benefits provided by the State, while unmarried same-sex couples are not able to obtain those benefits. Although the Court in <em>Snetsinger </em>did not discuss its conclusion on the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d requirement in much detail, a number of other courts have provided persuasive analyses on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u00b6134 The Iowa Supreme Court, for example, concluded in <em>Varnum </em>that \u201cfor purposes of Iowa\u2019s marriage laws, which are designed to bring a sense of order to the legal relationships of committed couples and their families in myriad ways,\u201d the plaintiffs (six same-sex couples) \u201care similarly situated compared to heterosexual persons\u201d \u201cin every important respect, but for their sexual orientation.\u201d 763 N.W.2d at 883-84.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Plaintiffs are in committed and loving relationships, many raising families, just like heterosexual couples.

The Vermont Supreme Court agreed that \u201cthe State has a legitimate and long-standing interest in promoting a permanent commitment between couples for the security of their children\u201d and that \u201cthe State\u2019s interest has been advanced by extending formal public sanction and protection to the union, or marriage, of those couples considered capable of having children.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>744 A.2d at 881.

The federal district court\u2019s decision is discussed in greater detail below in the Marriage Amendment section. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 183-189, <em>infra. </em>For purposes of the present discussion, it is sufficient to note the following testimony and factual findings made by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u2022 \u201cGay and lesbian sexual orientations are \u2018normal variation[s] and are considered to be aspects of well-adjusted behavior.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">\u2022 \u201cHomosexuality is not considered a mental disorder.... [Mjajor professional mental health associations have all gone on record affirming that homosexuality is a normal expression of sexuality and that it is not in any way a form of pathology.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">\u2022 \u201c \u2018Courts and legal scholars have concluded that sexual orientation is not related to an individual\u2019s ability to contribute to society or perform in the workplace.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">\u2022 \u201cSame-sex couples are identical to opposite-sex couples in the characteristics relevant to the ability to form successful marital unions. Like opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples have happy, satisfying relationships and form deep emotional bonds and strong commitments to their partners. Standardized measures of relationship satisfaction, relationship adjustment and love do not differ depending on whether a couple is same-sex or opposite-sex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">\u2022 \u201cSame-sex couples receive the same tangible and intangible benefits from marriage that opposite-sex couples receive,\u201d including \u201cgreater commitment to the relationship, more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>acceptance from extended family, less worry over legal problems, [and] greater access to health benefits and benefits for their children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">\u2022 \u201cThe sexual orientation of an indiiddual does not determine whether that individual can be a good parent. Children raised by gay or lesbian parents are as likely as children raised by heterosexual parents to be healthy, successful and well-adjusted. The research supporting this conclusion is accepted beyond serious debate in the field of developmental psychology.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u2022 \u201cThe evidence shows that, by every available metric, opposite-sex couples are not better than their same-sex counterparts; instead, as partners, parents and citizens, opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples are equal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\"><em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 967, 969, 980, 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u00b6139 These findings are consistent with the record in the present case. Plaintiffs filed the affidavit of Dr. Letitia Anne Peplau, a psychologist, who states: \u201cResearch clearly establishes that same-sex couples closely resemble heterosexual couples both in terms of the quality of their relationship and the processes that affect their relationships.\u201d The State does not deny this. Plaintiffs also filed the affidavit of Dr. Suzanne D. Dixon, a behavioral and developmental pediatrician, who states: \u201cChildren raised by same-sex parents are just as likely to be psychologically, emotionally, socially and sexually well adjusted as those raised by heterosexual parents. Being parented by gay, lesbian or bisexual parents has no adverse impact on the behavior and development of children.\u201d The State does not deny this either. In fact, the State does not deny that Plaintiffs are similarly situated to different-sex couples in every respect other than the ability to obtain the secular benefits and obligations at issue here by getting married.</p>\n<p id=\"Aln\">\u00b6140 I agree with the Iowa Supreme Court that the benefits and responsibilities granted by the State to married persons \u201care designed to bring a sense of order to the legal relationships of committed couples and their families in myriad ways\u201d-for example, by providing a stable framework within which to raise children and the power to make healthcare decisions for loved ones. <em>Varnum </em>763 N.W.2d at 883-84. Plaintiffs indicate in their affidavits that they share the same interest as different-sex couples in protecting their relationships, their families, and their children. Except for the fact that one partner is the same sex as the other, Plaintiffs\u2019 committed intimate relationships are materially indistinguishable from different-sex committed intimate relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u00b6 141 Based on these undisputed facts and the foregoing discussion, I conclude and would hold that the pertinent classification here is sexual orientation. I further conclude and would hold that Plaintiffs are similarly situated to, but treated differently than, different-sex couples vis-a-vis the benefits and responsibilities afforded by the State to married persons. I now turn to the question of the appropriate level of scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">E. Level of Scrutiny</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b6 142 As noted above, if a law neither burdens a constitutional right nor targets a suspect or quasi-suspect class, then the courts will uphold the legislative classification so long as it bears a rational relationship to some legitimate governmental objective. But if the law disadvantages a suspect or quasi-suspect class or impinges upon the exercise of a constitutional right, then the classification is subject to heightened scrutiny. <em>See </em>Romer, 517 U.S. at 631, 116 S. Ct. at 1627; <em>Cleburne, </em>473 U.S. at 440-41, 105 S. Ct. at 3254-55; <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u00b6143 In <em>Snetsinger, </em>this Court concluded that the Montana University System\u2019s policy of allowing unmarried different-sex couples to avail themselves of the health benefits offered under the University System\u2019s group health insurance plan, while denying unmarried same-sex couples the ability to obtain these same benefits, failed even the most deferential standard of review: \u201cthere is no justification for treating the two groups differently, nor is the University System\u2019s policy rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\u201d <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u00b6144 In the present case, Plaintiffs likewise argue that the State\u2019s exclusion of same-sex couples from the opportunity to obtain the benefits and protections which the State makes available to different-sex couples fails rational basis review. Plaintiffs further argue, however, that \u201csexual orientation should be considered a suspect classification under Montana law\u201d and that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is therefore subject to \u201cstrict scrutiny.\u201d For purposes of resolving Plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory relief, and for the reasons which follow, I agree that sexual orientation is a suspect class and that treating same-sex couples differently than different-sex couples is thus subject to strict scrutiny review.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\u00b6145 Courts have identified four factors or indicia as bearing on whether a class is suspect or quasi-suspect (thus warranting a more exacting constitutional analysis of the legislative classification than that provided by rational basis review). They are (1) whether the class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>has historically been subjected to discrimination; (2) whether the characteristics that distinguish the class indicate a typical class member\u2019s ability to perform or contribute to society; (3) whether the distinguishing characteristic is immutable or beyond the class members\u2019 control; and (4) whether the class is a minority or politically powerless. <em>See In re C.H., </em>210 Mont. 184, 198, 683 P.2d 931, 938 (1984) (citing <em>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 28, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 1294 (1973)); <em>Windsor v. United States, </em>699 F.3d 169, 181 (2d Cir. 2012); <em>Marriage Cases, </em>183 P.3d at 442-43; <em>Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 426; <em>Varnum, </em>763 N.W.2d at 886-88; <em>Conaway, </em>932 A.2d at 606-07; <em>Andersen v. King County, </em>138 P.3d 963, 974 (Wash. 2006). The third and fourth factors (immutability and lack of political power), however, \u201care not strictly necessary factors to identify a suspect class.\u201d <em>Windsor, </em>699 F.3d at 181. Indeed, as to immutability, the California Supreme Court has pointed out that, under California law, \u201ca person\u2019s religion is a suspect classification for equal protection purposes, and one\u2019s religion, of course, is not immutable but is a matter over which an individual has control.\u201d <em>Marriage Cases, </em>183 P.3d at 442 (citations omitted). Likewise, as to lack of political power, the California Supreme Court has pointed out that \u201cif a group\u2019s <em>current </em>political powerlessness were a prerequisite to a characteristic\u2019s being considered a constitutionally suspect basis for differential treatment, it would be impossible to justify the numerous decisions that continue to treat sex, race, and religion as suspect classifications.\u201d <em>Marriage Cases, </em>183 P.3d at 443 (emphasis in original); <em>see also Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 426 (characterizing history of discrimination and ability to perform or contribute to society as \u201crequired\u201d factors, and immutability and political powerlessness as \u201cother considerations that, in a given case, may be relevant\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b6146 In the present case, the parties\u2019 disagreement centers primarily on the first and fourth factors-history of discrimination and lack of political power. In considering the four factors, therefore, I shall focus primarily on these two.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">1. History of Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u00b6 147 As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals recently observed, \u201c[i]t is easy to conclude that homosexuals have suffered a history of discrimination.\u201d <em>Windsor, </em>699 F.3d at 182. Indeed, as I discussed in my <em>Snetsinger </em>concurrence, \u201c[i]t is overwhelmingly clear that gays and lesbians have been historically subject to unequal treatment and invidious discrimination.\u201d <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45-53 (Nelson, J., specially concurring); <em>accord Varnum </em>763 N.W.2d at <em>889-90; Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>at 432-34. \u201cOutside of racial and religious minorities, we can think of no group which has suffered such pernicious and sustained hostility, and such immediate and severe opprobrium, as homosexuals.\u201d <em>Marriage Cases, </em>183 P.3d at 442 (bracketed material and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cPerhaps the most telling proof of animus and discrimination against homosexuals in this country is that, for many years and in many states, homosexual conduct was criminal.\u201d <em>Windsor, </em>699 F.3d at 182. In point of fact, although this Court held 15 years ago that homosexuals have the right under Montana\u2019s Constitution to engage in private, consensual, noncommercial sexual conduct with other adults free of governmental interference or regulation, <em>Gryczan, </em>283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112, the Legislature has repeatedly refused in multiple subsequent legislative sessions to repeal the statutory criminalization of \u201csexual contact or sexual intercourse between two persons of the same sex,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 45-2-101(21), 45-5-505, MCA; Aff. of Christine Kaufmann at 4 &amp; Attachment A (detailing the failed efforts to repeal this statutory language).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b6148 Plaintiffs filed the affidavit of Dr. George Chauncey, a professor of history at Yale University. Dr. Chauncey states that, in his professional opinion, \u201cgay and lesbian people have been subject to widespread and significant discrimination and hostility in the United States, including the State of Montana.\u201d He notes that among the most conspicuous legacies of this discrimination are \u201cthe numerous state statutes and constitutional amendments that brand gays and lesbians as second-class citizens by denying them the right to marry the person they love\u201d and \u201cthe federal Defense of Marriage Act that prohibits the federal government from recognizing such marriages legally entered into in states where they are allowed.\u201d Dr. Chauncey provides a detailed historical record of anti-gay discrimination and the roots of such discrimination. Aff. of George Chauncey, Ph.D., at 3-22. His discussion is extensive, spanning 20 single-spaced pages, and it is not possible to recite every example of anti-gay discrimination and violence he describes. I shall attempt, however, to highlight the main points of his discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b6149 Dr. Chauncey explains that through much of the twentieth century, in particular, gay men and lesbians have suffered under the weight of medical theories that treated their desires as a disorder, penal laws that condemned their consensual adult sexual behavior as a crime, and federal and state civil statutes, regulations, and policies that discriminated against them on the basis of their sexual orientation. Beginning in the 1930s and 1940s, many states prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>gay people from being served in restaurants and bars. In the 1950s, the federal government banned the employment of homosexuals and insisted that its private contractors ferret out and dismiss their gay employees. Across the century, many municipalities periodically launched police campaigns to suppress gay meeting places and sought to purge gay civil servants from government employment. Many clergy condemned homosexuality as sinful. Leading physicians and medical researchers claimed that homosexuality was a pathological condition or disease. Government leaders and the media justified anti-gay discrimination and the suppression of gay meeting places by fostering stereotypes ofhomosexuals as child molesters. These stereotypes have had enduring consequences and continue to inspire public fears and hostility, especially concerning gay teachers and parents. In the 1990s, following Anita Bryant\u2019s lead, activists opposed to gay rights frequently fomented voter fear of gay people by reviving demonic stereotypes of homosexuals as perverts who threatened the nation\u2019s children and moral character. Such tactics have been invoked in Montana. In 1995, the Montana Senate included homosexual acts in a bill requiring the registration of sexual and violent offenders. Senator A1 Bishop, a supporter of the bill, stated on the Senate floor that homosexual sex is \u201ceven worse than a violent sexual act.\u201d During a 2003 debate over keeping Montana\u2019s criminal sodomy law on the books-despite this Court\u2019s decision in Gryczan-a member of the Coalition for Community Responsibility asserted that \u201c[g]ay men think they are doing children a favor by sodomizing them.\u201d During the 2005 legislative session, Senator Dan McGee of Laurel stated, \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to support bills which try to overturn centuries of moral ideology. Homosexuality is wrong.\u201d In 2010, opponents of the Missoula ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity stated that passage of the ordinance would result in \u201cunacceptable loss of safety and privacy for women and children.\u201d Numerous bills have been proposed to add sexual orientation to Montana\u2019s antidiscrimination laws and to Montana\u2019s hate-crimes law, but all have failed. (Christine Kauffman details the repeated defeat of such legislation in Attachment A to her affidavit, at pages 3 to 7.) Earlier this year, the Hamilton School Board voted to <em>remove </em>sexual orientation from a proposed anti-bullying policy and <em>not </em>to include sexual orientation in the district\u2019s equal-education and equal-employment policies. <em>See </em>David Erickson, <em>Sexual Orientation Not Included in Hamilton Schools\u2019 Anti-Bullying Policy, </em>Ravalli Republic (Mar. 30, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>\u00b6150 Dr. Chauncey notes that gay people continue to face discrimination from highly regarded institutions. For example, the Boy Scouts of America, a federally chartered organization, insists that \u201chomosexual conduct is not morally straight\u201d and refuses to allow gay men into the organization. <em>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, </em>530 U.S. 640, 651, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 2453 (2000). Gay people also continue to face violence motivated by anti-gay bias. In 1984, three teens attacked 23-year-old Charlie Howard due to his sexual orientation and threw him off a bridge into the Kenduskeag Stream in Maine, where he drowned. In 1998, Matthew Shepard, a college student in Wyoming, was bound, tied to a fence, beaten with a pistol, and left to die because he was gay. In 2008, Lawrence Fobes King, a 15-year-old student in California, died two days after he was shot in school by a fellow student because of his sexual orientation. The FBI reported 1,260 hate crimes based on perceived sexual orientation in 1998 and 1,297 in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b6151 In its Order, the District Court observed that \u201cthere appears little doubt that Plaintiffs have been subject to private prejudice, discrimination, and even violence in Montana.\u201d Indeed, Plaintiffs describe various ways in which they have been harassed because of their sexual orientation. One plaintiff, for example, was labeled a \u201clesbian baby-killer\u201d on a neo-Nazi website, and \u201cwanted dead or alive\u201d posters of her were hung in downtown Bozeman, causing her to fear for her physical safety. Another plaintiff, who grew up in Great Falls and worked at the Cascade County Regional Youth Services Center for several years, describes an incident when a Cascade County Commissioner confronted her and told her that gay people are dangerous and should not be allowed to work with youth. Plaintiffs describe demeaning instances where employers, healthcare workers, and others refused to recognize or honor their same-sex relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"AHA\">\u00b6152 The State concedes that \u201cgays and lesbians have been subject to <em>private </em>prejudice, discrimination, and violence in Montana\u201d (emphasis added). But the State contends that Plaintiffs \u201chave yet to identify a single instance of any targeted State action against them that they ask the Court to review and invalidate.\u201d This contention is simply bizarre. The question at hand is whether gays and lesbians have suffered a history of discrimination. Clearly they have. The State\u2019s suggestion that all of the prejudice and discrimination has been purely \u201cprivate\u201d is utterly ridiculous. Indeed, the State\u2019s position flies in the face of the substantial evidence presented in the District Court, none of which the State refuted. Perhaps the most obvious evidence of \u201cpublic\u201d discrimination against gays and lesbians is the codification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>disparate treatment in at least three Montana statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 40-1-103, 40~l-401(l)(d), and 45-2-101(21), MCA), not to mention the Montana Constitution itself (Mont. Const, art. XIII, \u00a7 7). The State implies that there was not \u201cany expressed animus underlying the approval of CI-96.\u201d (CI-96 refers to Constitutional Amendment 96, the 2004 ballot measure which added the Marriage Amendment to Montana\u2019s Constitution.) But as discussed in the Marriage Amendment section below, that provision demonstrably was motivated by animus toward gays and lesbians. The State fails to provide any evidence or sensible argument to refute Plaintiffs\u2019 overwhelming showingthat homosexuals as a group have historically endured persecution and discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">2. Relation to Ability</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b6153 \u201cThere are some distinguishing characteristics, such as age or mental handicap, that may arguably inhibit an individual\u2019s ability to contribute to society, at least in some respect. But homosexuality is not one of them. The aversion homosexuals experience has nothing to do with aptitude or performance.\u201d <em>Windsor, </em>699 F.3d at 182-83; <em>accord Marriage Cases, </em>183 P.3d at 442 (\u201csexual orientation is a characteristic ... that bears no relation to a person\u2019s ability to perform or contribute to society\u201d); <em>Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 435 (\u201chomosexuality bears no relation at all to an individual\u2019s ability to contribute fully to society\u201d; \u201can individual\u2019s homosexual orientation implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability or general social or vocational capabilities\u201d (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Varnum </em>763 N.W.2d at 891 (\u201csexual orientation is broadly recognized in Iowa to be irrelevant to a person\u2019s ability to contribute to society\u201d). The State does not contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b6154 A classification which bears no relationship to a person\u2019s ability to contribute to society \u201cis likely based on irrelevant stereotypes and prejudice.\u201d <em>Varnum, </em>763 N.W.2d at 890. A classification unrelated to a person\u2019s ability to perform or contribute to society typically reflects prejudice and antipathy-a view that those in the burdened class are not as worthy or deserving as others-or reflects outmoded notions of the relative capabilities of persons with the characteristic. <em>Varnum, </em>763 N.W.2d at 890; <em>Cleburne, </em>473 U.S. at 440-41, 105 S. Ct. at 3254-55. Such is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">3. Immutability</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\u00b6 155 Although often couched in terms of \u201cimmutability,\u201d the Second Circuit explained in <em>Windsor </em>that the question under this factor is whether there are obvious, immutable, <em>or </em>distinguishing characteristics that define a discrete group. 699 F.3d at 183. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>instance, classifications based on alienage, illegitimacy, and national origin are all subject to heightened scrutiny, even though these characteristics do not declare themselves, and often may be disclosed or suppressed as a matter of preference, and even though alienage and illegitimacy are actually subject to change. \u201cWhat seems to matter is whether the characteristic of the class [invites] discrimination when it is manifest.\u201d <em>Windsor, </em>699 F.3d at 183. Here, the characteristic that distinguishes gays and lesbians from others and qualifies them for recognition as a distinct and discrete group is the characteristic that historically has resulted in their social and legal ostracism: their attraction to persons of the same sex. <em>Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 436; <em>accord Windsor, </em>699 F.3d at 184 (\u201csexual orientation is a sufficiently distinguishing characteristic to identify the discrete minority class of homosexuals\u201d); <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 964 (\u201c[s]exual orientation is fundamental to a person\u2019s identity and is a distinguishing characteristic that defines gays and lesbians as a discrete group\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AL7\">\u00b6156 To the extent that \u201cimmutability\u201d has any significance to the analysis, this prong of the inquiry is satisfied when the identifying trait is so central to a person\u2019s identity that it would be abhorrent for government to penalize a person for refusing to change it. <em>Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 438; <em>Varnum, </em>763 N.W.2d at 893; <em>Watkins v. U.S. Army, </em>875 F.2d 699, 726 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc) (Norris, J., concurring in the judgment). In this regard, the federal district court in <em>Perry </em>found, based on the evidence presented, that \u201c[i]ndividuals do not generally choose their sexual orientation. No credible evidence supports a finding that an individual may, through conscious decision, therapeutic intervention or any other method, change his or her sexual orientation.\u201d 704 F. Supp. 2d at 966. The court noted that sexual orientation is \u201can enduring pattern of sexual, affectional or romantic desires for and attractions to men, women or both sexes\u201d and that \u201c[t]he vast majority of people are consistent in self-identification, behavior and attraction throughout their adult lives. <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 964. Accordingly, I agree with the California Supreme Court that \u201c[b]ecause a person\u2019s sexual orientation is so integral an aspect of one\u2019s identity, it is not appropriate to require a person to repudiate or change his or her sexual orientation in order to avoid discriminatory treatment.\u201d <em>Marriage Cases, </em>183 P.3d at 442; <em>accord Varnum, </em>763 N.W.2d at 893 (\u201cAccordingly, because sexual orientation is central to personal identity and may be altered if at all only at the expense of significant damage to the individual\u2019s sense of self, classifications based on sexual orientation are no less entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>consideration as a suspect or quasi-suspect class than any other group that has been deemed to exhibit an immutable characteristic.\u201d (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">4. Political Power</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b6157 The last factor is premised on the notion that \u201c[w]ithout political power, minorities may be unable to protect themselves from discrimination at the hands of the majoritarian political process.\u201d <em>Windsor, </em>699 F.3d at 184. As noted, the Judiciary has a \u201cspecial role in safeguarding the interests of those groups that are relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.\u201d <em>Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist., </em>458 U.S. 457, 486, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 3203 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b6158 While the State\u2019s central argument on this point is devoted to the proposition that gays and lesbians have achieved some recent political successes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">[t]he question is not whether homosexuals have achieved political successes over the years; they clearly have. The question is whether they have the strength to politically protect themselves from wrongful discrimination. When the Supreme Court ruled that sex-based classifications were subject to heightened scrutiny in 1973, the Court acknowledged that women had already achieved major political victories. <em>See Frontiero, </em>411 U.S. at 685, 93 S.Ct. 1764. The Nineteenth Amendment had been ratified in 1920, and Title VII had already outlawed sex-based employment. <em>See </em>78 Stat. 253. The Court was persuaded nevertheless that women still lacked adequate political power, in part because they were \u201cvastly underrepresented in this Nation\u2019s decisionmaking councils,\u201d including the presidency, the Supreme Court, and the legislature. <em>Frontiero, </em>411 U.S. at 686 n. 17, 93 S.Ct. 1764.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsgI\"><em>Windsor, </em>699 F.3d at 184 <em>(citing Frontiero v.

The court noted that the seemingly small number of acknowledged homosexuals in positions of power and authority \u201cis attributable either to a hostility that excludes them or to a hostility that keeps their sexual preference private-which, for our purposes, amounts to much the same thing.\u201d <em>Windsor, </em>699 F.3d at 184-85. The court further noted that these same considerations can also be expected \u201cto suppress some degree of political activity by inhibiting the kind of open association that advances political agendas.\u201d <em>Windsor, </em>699 F.3d at 185; <em>see also Rowland v. Mad River Local School Dist., </em>470 U.S. 1009, 1014, 105 S. Ct. 1373, 1377 (1985) (Brennan &amp; Marshall, JJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (\u201cBecause of the immediate and severe opprobrium often manifested against homosexuals once so identified publicly, members of this group are particularly powerless to pursue their rights openly in the political arena.\u201d). Thus, the court concluded that \u201chomosexuals are not in a position to adequately protect themselves from the discriminatory wishes of the majoritarian public.\u201d <em>Windsor, </em>699 F.3d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b6160 The Connecticut Supreme Court likewise had \u201clittle difficulty in concluding that gay persons are entitled to heightened constitutional protection despite some recent political progress.\u201d <em>Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 444. The court cited several considerations in this regard. First, the discrimination that gay persons have suffered has been so pervasive and severe-even though their sexual orientation has no bearing at all on their ability to contribute to or perform in society-that it is highly unlikely that legislative enactments alone will suffice to eliminate that discrimination. <em>Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 444. Second, insofar as gay persons play a role in the political process, it is apparent that their numbers reflect their status as a small and insular minority. <em>Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 446. Third, although the state legislature eventually enacted a gay-rights law, its enactment was preceded by nearly a decade of numerous failed attempts at passage, and the legislation contained \u201can unprecedented proviso\u201d expressing the legislature\u2019s position that it does not condone homosexuality. <em>Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 448-50. Fourth, while the enactment of remedial legislation aimed at protecting a class from discrimination may indicate that the subject group possesses some political power, it also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>supports the conclusion that the subject group is in need of heightened constitutional protection. <em>Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 450-51; <em>accord Hernandez v. Robles, </em>855 N.E.2d 1, 28-29 (N.Y. 2006).(Kaye, C.J., &amp; Ciparick, J., dissenting) (the passage of civil rights measures \u201cacknowledge[s]-rather than mark[s] the end of-a history of purposeful discrimination\u201d). Fifth, the awareness of public hatred and the fear of violence that often accompanies it undermine efforts to develop an effective gay political identity; gay persons are disinclined to risk retaliation by open identification with the movement, and potential allies from outside the gay and lesbian community may think twice about allying their fortunes with such a despised population. <em>Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 452. Sixth, gay persons lack the political power that African-Americans and women possess today; yet, political gains by African-Americans and women have not been found to obviate the need for heightened judicial scrutiny of legislation that draws distinctions on the basis of race or gender. <em>Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 453. Given all of these factors (and the detailed analysis accompanying them), the court held that \u201cgay persons cannot be deprived of heightened judicial protection merely because of their relatively limited political influence.\u201d <em>Kerrigan, </em>957 A.2d at 453-54; <em>see also Varnum, </em>763 N.W.2d at 895 (\u201cgay and lesbian people are not so politically powerful as to overcome the unfair and severe prejudice that history suggests produces discrimination based on sexual orientation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AvJ\">\u00b6161 In the present case, Dr. Chauncey provided his professional opinion that \u201cgay and lesbian people do not currently possess a meaningful degree of political power in the United States or in the State of Montana.\u201d He cites various examples reflecting the persistence of anti-gay discrimination over the last decade. The State has not refuted Dr. Chauncey\u2019s opinion or any of the evidence underlying it. I also note that the entire underpinning of the Marriage Amendment, discussed in further detail below, was based on attacking and demeaning homosexuals and homosexuality. Accordingly, in light of Dr. Chauncey\u2019s unrefuted report, the detailed discussions in the <em>Windsor </em>and <em>Kerrigan </em>opinions, and the circumstances underlying the passage of the Marriage Amendment, I conclude that gays and lesbians are not in a position to adequately protect themselves from the discriminatory wishes of the majoritarian public.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">5. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b6162 Based on the foregoing analysis under each of the factors, I conclude and would hold that sexual orientation is a suspect class under Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Correspondingly, I would also hold that discrimination based on sexual orientation in the provision of statutory benefits and protections is subject to \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d review. <em>See Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 17 (\u201cStrict scrutiny applies if a suspect class or fundamental right is affected.\u201d). Under the strict-scrutiny standard, the State has the burden of showing that the law or policy is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 17. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment and direct it to enter a declaratory order encompassing these holdings. But for reasons discussed in the Declaratory Judgment section above, I would not order injunctive relief at this time and instead would permit the legislative and executive branches to implement our constitutional interpretation in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">F. Human Dignity</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b6 163 As just discussed, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory ruling that gay, lesbian, and bisexual persons are a suspect class in Montana and the State\u2019s disparate treatment of same-sex couples is subject to \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d review under the Equal Protection Clause of Article II, Section 4. This approach is sufficient to resolve this case in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b6164 That said, however, it is equally important to acknowledge the more fundamental human issue in this case. In addition to guaranteeing \u201cthe equal protection of the laws,\u201d Article II, Section 4 also provides that \u201c[t]he dignity of the human being is inviolable.\u201d I addressed this provision of Montana\u2019s Constitution at length in <em>Baxter v. State, </em>2009 MT 449, \u00b6\u00b6 74-94, 354 Mont. 234, 224 P.3d 1211 (Nelson, J., specially concurring). In the interests of brevity, given that this is already a lengthy dissent, I am not going to repeat my entire analysis and discussion of the Dignity Clause here.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b6165 Suffice it to say that, as I stated in <em>Baxter, </em>human dignity is perhaps the most fundamental right in the Declaration of Rights. Indeed, it is the <em>only </em>right in Montana\u2019s Constitution that is \u201cinviolable\u2019-meaning that it is absolute. No individual may be stripped of his or her human dignity by the government or by a private organization. <em>Baxter, </em>\u00b6 83 (Nelson, J., specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">\u00b6166 Human dignity may be defined in many ways. But, at bottom, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>it encompasses a fundament truth: every individual person is intrinsically valuable and has inherent worth because we are sentient beings with the capacity of independent, autonomous, rational, and responsible thought and action. <em>Baxter, </em>\u00b6 84 (Nelson, J., specially concurring). Demonizing, demeaning, degrading, and stereotyping people because of their sexual orientation is simply an attempt to strip those so condemned of their worth, their value, and hence their dignity. Indeed, naming it for what it is, discrimination based on sexual orientation is bigotry. And, whether rationalized on the basis of majoritarian morality, partisan ideology, or religious tenets, homophobic discrimination is still bigotry. <em>Kulstad v. Marniaci, </em>2009 MT 326, \u00b6 103, 352 Mont. 513, 220 P.3d 595 (Nelson, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"AoNz\">\u00b6167 Without belaboring the point, the State\u2019s treatment of the committed couples here based on their sexual orientation is a frontal assault on their dignity as autonomous, rational, independent human beings. The State\u2019s public censure effectively conveys to these citizens the message that, as a class, they are inferior, immoral, corrupt, perverted, and sinful-that they are not worthy of sharing in the advantages that the State provides to their \u201cnormal,\u201d family-oriented, God-fearing, and morally superior heterosexual counterparts. \u201c[T]he failure to provide equal benefits and protections in Montana law to same-sex couples [is] a failure to respect the core humanity of gay and lesbian couples by denying that they can create, for themselves, the same sort of committed, loving relationships which heterosexual couples can create.\u201d Matthew O. Clifford and Thomas P. Huff, <em>Some Thoughts on the Meaning and Scope of the Montana Constitution\u2019s \u201cDignity\u201d Clause with Possible Applications, </em>61 Mont. L. Rev. 301, 335 n. 137 (2000). I can think of no better way to attack the right of inviolable human dignity of each of the Plaintiffs in this case. I conclude and would hold that the State\u2019s discriminatory refusal to provide the benefits and protections at issue here to the committed intimate same-sex couples violates the Dignity Clause of Article II, Section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b6 168 Having concluded my analysis under the Equal Protection and Dignity Clauses, I now turn to the Marriage Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">V. THE MARRIAGE AMENDMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b6169 <em>Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number><em>with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared </em>that. <em>their legislature should \u2018make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\u2019 thus building a wall of separation between church and State.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">A. Constitutional Language</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b6170 The Montana Constitution is divided into 14 articles, each addressing a different facet of government. Article I contains the Compact with the United States. Article II is the Declaration of Rights-which we have described as \u201ca compact of overlapping and redundant rights and guarantees,\u201d <em>Armstrong v. State, </em>296 Mont. 361, 389, 989 P.2d 364, 383 (1999), each of which is \u201cfundamental,\u201d <em>Kortum-Managhan v. Herbergers NBGL, </em>2009 MT 79, \u00b6 25, 349 Mont. 475, 204 P.3d 693. They include the rights to privacy, due process, human dignity, religion, and equal protection of the laws, to name but a few. Article III enumerates general governmental provisions, such as separation of powers, the oath of office, and the powers of initiative and referendum. Article IV concerns suffrage and elections. Articles V, VI, and VII set forth the powers of the Legislature, the Executive, and the Judiciary, respectively. Article VIII concerns revenue and finance; Article IX the environment and natural resources; Article X education and public lands; Article XI local government; Article XII departments and institutions; and Article XIV constitutional revision and amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b6171 That leaves Article XIII, which is titled \u201cGeneral Provisions.\u201d Section 1 concerns the chartering of nonmunicipal corporations. Section 2 directs the Legislature to provide for an office of consumer counsel. Section 3 (repealed in 1986) required the Legislature to create a salary commission. Section 4 directs the Legislature to adopt a code of ethics. Section 5 requires the Legislature to enact liberal homestead and exemption laws. And Section 6 prohibits perpetuities except for charitable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b6172 Last among these general provisions is Section 7, the Marriage Amendment, which was added in 2004. It states, in its entirety: \u201cOnly a marriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state.\u201d Mont. Const, art. XIII, \u00a7 7. I note that this is the <em>only </em>provision in the Montana Constitution that purports to affirmatively strip an entire class of citizens of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>elemental civil right accorded, presumptively and without thought or hesitation, to all other Montanans.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">B. Irrelevance of the Marriage Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"Ayz\">\u00b6173 The State and several of its amici drape themselves in the mantel of the Marriage Amendment as an underpinning for their arguments. They argue that granting committed intimate same-sex couples any of the statutory benefits and protections which are accorded to different-sex married couples-while still denying same-sex couples the right to marry-may violate the Marriage Amendment. I say \u201cmay\u201d because, as noted earlier, the Attorney General\u2019s position is difficult to reconcile. On one hand, he seems to contend that the Marriage Amendment precludes Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, yet, on the other hand, he concedes that the Legislature could provide same-sex couples with similar protections as are granted to different-sex married couples, by means of a civil-union or domestic-partnership scheme, if it chose to do so. <em>See </em>\u00b6 63, <em>supra. </em>Regardless of the State\u2019s actual position on this matter, however, there is no question where the State\u2019s amici stand: They believe that the Marriage Amendment precludes Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>See </em>Amicus Curiae Br. of Mont. Catholic Conf. and Other Christian Churches at 5 (\u201cThis lawsuit is, in effect, an attempt to change the Constitutional and statutory definition of marriage.\u201d); Br. of Amicus Curiae Mont. Family Found, at 3 (\u201cTh[e] constitutional definition of marriage is, in reality, what Appellants challenge....\u201d); Br. of Amici Curiae Sen. President, Sen. Majority Leader, Speaker of the H.R., and H. Majority Leader of the State of Montana at 7-13 (analogizing the issue here, concerning same-sex couples, to the \u201cmoral dilemma\u201d in the mid-1800s of whether slavery was \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong,\u201d and arguing that this Court should not \u201cexalt the desires of the minority\u201d over the will of the majority expressed through Montana\u2019s Marriage Amendment). Needless to say, I disagree entirely with this view of the Marriage Amendment\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b6174 First of all, Plaintiffs do not seek the status of \u201cmarriage.\u201d They seek only the opportunity to obtain the protections which the State of Montana has made available to different-sex couples-such as decision-making authority during medical emergencies and end-of-life situations, a financial safety net under the tax code, and legal rights in the event of a spouse\u2019s injury, death, or intestacy. In the most basic terms, these committed intimate same-sex couples-some of whom have been together for decades-merely ask that they not be treated as \u201clegal strangers\u201d to each other. It is difficult to comprehend how granting them this basic civil right infringes upon or undermines the institution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>of marriage, or threatens the rights of different-sex couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b6175 Indeed, the same sort of paranoid arguments were once held out as obvious and incontrovertible reasons to deny the constitutional rights of different-race couples. <em>See e.g. Perez v. Sharp, </em>198 P.2d 17, 23 (Cal. 1948) (\u201c[Respondent has sought to justify the statute by contending that the prohibition of intermarriage between Caucasians and members of the specified races prevents the Caucasian race from being contaminated by races whose members are by nature physically and mentally inferior to Caucasians.\u201d); <em>Scott v. State, </em>39 Ga. 321, 323 (1869) (\u201cThe amalgamation of the races is not only unnatural, but is always productive of deplorable results. Our daily observation shows us, that the offspring of these unnatural connections are generally sickly and effeminate, and that they are inferior in physical development and strength, to the fullblood of either race. It is sometimes urged that such marriages should be encouraged, for the purpose of elevating the inferior race. The reply is, that such connections never elevate the inferior race to the position of the superior, but they bring down the superior to that of the inferior. They are productive of evil, and evil only, without any corresponding good.\u201d); <em>State v. Gibson, </em>36 Ind. 389, 405 (1871) (requiring separation of the races \u201c \u2018is not prejudice, nor caste, nor injustice of any kind, but simply to suffer men to follow the law of races established by the Creator himself, and not to compel them to intermix contrary to their instincts\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>W. Chester &amp; Phila. R.R. Co. v. Miles, </em>55 Pa. 209, 214 (1867)); <em>Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 3, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 1819 (1967) (\u201c \u2018Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for [interracial] marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.\u2019 \u201d (quoting the trial judge\u2019s decision)). As we now recognize, these supposedly self-evident propositions are, in fact, utterly groundless. Upholding the rights of different-race couples did not impinge on the institution of marriage or deprive it of its vitality, and neither will upholding the rights of the same-sex couples here, who do not even ask to be \u201cmarried\u201d in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b6176 Secondly, \u201c[t]hat the Marriage Amendment effectively prevents same-sex couples from marrying does not automatically permit the government to treat them differently in other ways.\u201d <em>Alaska Civ. Liberties Union v. State, </em>122 P.3d 781, 786-87 (Alaska 2005). Indeed, the plain language of the Marriage Amendment neither requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>State to confer any specific benefits or obligations on married persons, nor prohibits the State from granting the same protections to unmarried persons that it grants to married persons. This fact is reflected throughout the Montana Code. For example, the right of a spouse to be appointed as guardian of an incapacitated person is not <em>exclusive </em>to the spouse. The right is also shared by \u201ca relative or friend who has demonstrated a sincere, longstanding interest in the welfare of the incapacitated person.\u201d Section 72-5-312, MCA. Likewise, the partner-or-family-member-assault statute protects not only spouses, but also \u201cpersons who have been or are currently in a dating or ongoing intimate relationship with a person of the opposite sex.\u201d Section 45-5-206, MCA. Other examples exist, but the point is that these illustrations demonstrate, unequivocally, that there is no merit to the premise that the Marriage Amendment bars the State from granting unmarried persons the same rights and protections that the State grants to married persons. Neither the State nor any of its amici cite any authority for such a proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b6177 In fact, the State\u2019s reasoning on this point is entirely circular. The State offers the following syllogism: <em>Premise 1 </em>- \u201cMarriage is defined by [\u00a7 40-1-103, MCA] as \u2018a personal relationship between a man and a woman arising out of a civil contract to which the consent of the parties is essential\u2019 <em>Premise 2 </em>- This definition \u201chas been incorporated into the Montana Constitution by [the Marriage Amendment]\u201d; <em>Conclusion </em>- \u201cSpousal benefits, therefore, flow from the now-constitutional status of marriage.\u201d All that Premise <em>1 </em>and <em>Premise 2 </em>establish, however, is that the \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d recognized by the State must, under the Montana Constitution, consist of one man and one woman. The third (unstated) premise of the State\u2019s syllogism is that this \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d includes the right to \u201cspousal benefits.\u201d Yet, neither the Marriage Amendment nor \u00a7 40-1-103, MCA, says anything about spousal benefits, and the State concedes elsewhere in its brief that there is \u201cno constitutional or judicially enforceable mandate for the Legislature to provide or fund spousal benefits.\u201d <em>See In re Marriage Cases, </em>183 P.3d 384, 426 (Cal. 2008) (\u201cthe constitutional right to marry clearly does not obligate the state to afford specific tax or other governmental benefits on the basis of a couple\u2019s family relationship\u201d). So, if the Legislature is not mandated to provide or fund spousal benefits, then obviously such benefits are not implicit in the \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d identified in \u00a7 40-1-103, MCA. Indeed, to hold otherwise could give rise to innumerable Takings and Due Process claims every time the Legislature reduced or eliminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>a spousal benefit. As Plaintiffs point out, and as the State tacitly admits, the Legislature\u2019s conferral of such benefits is entirely \u201cdiscretionary.\u201d Apparently the point the State is attempting to make is that when the State <em>does </em>choose to grant a benefit to married persons, the benefit cannot be granted to anyone else (i.e., to unmarried persons). But that is clearly not true, given the various statutes, noted above, which grant the same benefits to non-spouses as they do spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b6178 Notably, the California Supreme Court concluded that Proposition 8, which amended California\u2019s Constitution to restrict marriage to one man and one woman, did not also \u201chave the effect of abrogating the constitutional right of same-sex couples to enter into an officially recognized family relationship with a designation other than marriage.\u201d <em>Strauss v. Horton, </em>207 P.3d 48, 77 (Cal. 2009). The court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">an alternative, much more sweeping initiative measure-proposing the addition of a new constitutional section that would have provided not only that \u201c[o]nly marriage between one man and one woman is valid or recognized in California,\u201d but also that \u201c[njeither the Legislature nor any court, government institution, government agency, initiative statute, local government, or government official shall... bestow statutory rights, incidents, or employee benefits of marriage on unmarried individuals\u201d-was circulated for signature at the same time as Proposition 8, but did not obtain sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\"><em>Strauss, </em>207 P.3d at 76 n. 8 (brackets and ellipsis in original). In Nebraska, voters did pass a more sweeping measure of this sort in November 2000. As a result, Nebraska\u2019s Constitution now states: \u201cOnly marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid or recognized in Nebraska. <em>The uniting of two persons of the same sex in a civil union, domestic partnership, or other similar same-sex relationship shall not be valid or recognized in Nebraska.\u201d </em>Neb. Const. art. I, \u00a7 29 (emphasis added). If the additional language contained in Nebraska\u2019s Marriage Amendment and in the failed alternative to California\u2019s Proposition 8 were part of Montana\u2019s Marriage Amendment, the State\u2019s and its amici\u2019s arguments here might have traction. But that is not the case, and it is not the prerogative of the State, its amici, or this Court to insert such language. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Jud. Stands. Commn. v. Not Afraid, </em>2010 MT 285, \u00b6 15, 358 Mont. 532, 245 P.3d 1116. By its plain terms, Montana\u2019s Marriage Amendment applies to \u201cmarriage.\u201d It says nothing about civil unions, domestic partnerships, or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>similar same-sex relationships. It does not say that the government cannot bestow statutory rights, incidents, or employee benefits of marriage on unmarried individuals. As the State concedes, the Legislature could enact a civil-union or domestic-partnership scheme if it chose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b6179 Accordingly, there was no need for the Attorney General to inject the Marriage Amendment into this case, nor was there any legal basis for the religious and \u201cfamily values\u201d organizations to file numerous amicus briefs supporting the Attorney General\u2019s arguments in that respect. Nevertheless, the Marriage Amendment has been put at issue, and it is thus necessary to address this aspect of the State\u2019s approach. For the reasons which follow, and based on my examination of the provision for what it actually is and does, I conclude <em>the Marriage Amendment itself </em>cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">C. Basis of the Marriage Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"Ap9\">\u00b6 180 The entire underpinning of the Marriage Amendment is based on attacking and demeaning homosexuals and homosexuality. This is abundantly clear from the 2004 Voter Information Pamphlet provided to voters by the Montana Secretary of State and contained in the record of this case. In their argument for the Marriage Amendment (referred to as Constitutional Initiative 96 or CI-96), Proponents rail against \u201chomosexual activists\u201d who, Proponents claim, are seeking out \u201cactivist judges\u201d to force Montanans to become part of \u201ca vast, untested social experiment.\u201d Proponents assert that \u201chomosexual activists\u201d are \u201cthreatening\u201d not only \u201cthe time-honored, vital institution of marriage,\u201d but also \u201cthe freedom to teach our children as we wish.\u201d Proponents warn parents that if CI-96 fails, \u201c[ejvery public school in Montana would be required <em>to teach your children that same-sex marriage and homosexuality are perfectly normal\u201d </em>(emphasis in original). Proponents use similar scare tactics in an attempt to rally \u201csmall business employers,\u201d asserting that they <em>\u201cmay someday be required to provide expanded health coverage, retirement and fringe benefits to same-sex \u2018spouses\u2019 of employees\u201d </em>(emphasis in original), which allegedly \u201ccould hurt Montana\u2019s economy and jobs.\u201d Proponents also warn churchgoers that if CI-96 does not pass, \u201c[y]our church will be legally pressured to perform same-sex weddings\u201d and may lose its \u201ctax exemptions\u201d if it refuses to perform such ceremonies. Finally, Proponents argue that CI-96 is necessary for childrearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">Natural marriage is extremely important for future generations. Men and women are distinctly different. Each gender brings vitally important, and unique, elements to a child\u2019s development. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>Saying that children don\u2019t necessarily need fathers or mothers is saying that one gender or the other is unnecessary. </em>A loving and compassionate society always aids motherless and fatherless families. Compassionate societies never intentionally create families without mothers or fathers, which is exactly what same-sex homes do. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b6181 Notably, in their rebuttal to the opponents\u2019 argument against CI-96, Proponents state that the initiative \u201cdoesn\u2019t limit the ability of homosexuals to enter into contractual agreements to protect their assets,\u201d \u201cdoesn\u2019t stop employers from giving same-sex couples the same benefits as their married employees (if they so choose),\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t stop churches from recognizing same-sex relationships.\u201d Proponents categorically <em>deny </em>that the Marriage Amendment \u201climits the rights of homosexuals.\u201d They state that the Marriage Amendment accomplishes one thing: \u201cIt simply stops the legalization of homosexual marriage,\u201d which Proponents claim has never been a \u201cright\u201d of same-sex couples in the first place. Proponents make it clear that their goal is to preserve \u201cthe historical definition of marriage.\u201d Proponents present no argument that the Marriage Amendment will go further and prohibit state government from granting same-sex couples legal protections similar to those possessed by married persons. Proponents did not incorporate into Montana\u2019s Marriage Amendment the language used in Article I, Section 29 of the Nebraska Constitution, which had been approved by Nebraska electors several years earlier (in November 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b6182 In any event, the important point here is that there is no factual or legal basis whatsoever for any of Proponents\u2019 assertions in support of CI-96. Indeed, the Voter Information Pamphlet offers no actual reasoning, statistics, or evidence to support the fears it mongers. Yet, the fabricated threats posed by homosexuals to marriage, family, children, business, religion, and the economy were the so-called \u201cofficial\u201d justifications for the Marriage Amendment. It is clear that the promoters of the Marriage Amendment were playing to a populist paranoia grounded in something other than actual evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"A31S\">\u00b6183 In this regard, some useful insights may be gleaned from the strikingly similar campaign four years later (in 2008) in support of Proposition 8 in California. Essentially identical to Montana\u2019s Marriage Amendment, Proposition 8 (now Article I, Section 7.5 of the California Constitution) states in its entirety: \u201cOnly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\u201d Following its approval by a slim majority of California voters (52.3 percent), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Proposition 8 was challenged in federal court. In January 2010, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California held a 12-day bench trial, during which it heard testimony from 8 lay witnesses and 11 expert witnesses. The federal district court then entered extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law, ultimately deciding that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional under both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause. <em>Perry v. Schwarzenegger, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d 921 (N.D. Cal. 2010), <em>aff'd sub nom. Perry v. Brown, 671 </em>F.3d 1052 (9th Cir. 2012). Because the proponents of Proposition 8 \u201cvigorously\u201d defended the constitutionality of California\u2019s Marriage Amendment, <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 931, and because a substantial evidentiary record was created concerning the alleged need for a prohibition against same-sex marriage, the <em>Perry </em>case provides valuable context and insights for my discussion of Montana\u2019s Marriage Amendment. I shall detail, therefore, the pertinent parts of the <em>Perry </em>decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"AiPG\">\u00b6184 For starters, the federal district court found that the proponents of Proposition 8 relied \u201con fears that children exposed to the concept of same-sex marriage may become gay or lesbian\u201d and \u201con stereotypes to show that same-sex relationships are inferior to opposite-sex relationships.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 988, 990. Indeed, the proponents admitted as much:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">\u201c[Pjassing Proposition 8 would depend on our ability to convince voters that same-sex marriage had broader implications for Californians and was not only about the two individuals involved in a committed gay relationship.\u201d \u201cWe strongly believed that a campaign in favor of traditional marriage would not be enough to prevail.\u201d \u201cWe probed long and hard in countless focus groups and surveys to explore reactions to a variety of consequences our issue experts identified\u201d and they decided to create campaign messaging focusing on \u201chow this new \u2018fundamental right\u2019 would be inculcated in young children through public schools.\u201d \u201c[T]here were limits to the degree of tolerance Californians would afford the gay community. They would entertain allowing gay marriage, but not if doing so had significant implications for the rest of society.\u201d \u201cThe Prop 8 victory proves something that readers of Politics magazine know very well: campaigns matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\"><em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 988 (brackets in original) (quoting Frank Schubert &amp; Jeff Flint, <em>Passing Prop 8, </em>Politics, Feb. 2009, at 45-47). \u00b6185 Similar to the ballot argument for Montana\u2019s Marriage Amendment, the ballot argument in support of Proposition 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>summarized the initiative as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">Proposition 8 is simple and straightforward. * * * Proposition 8 is about preserving marriage; it\u2019s not an attack on the gay lifestyle. * * * It protects our children from being taught in public schools that \u201csame-sex marriage\u201d is the same as traditional marriage. * * * While death, divorce, or other circumstances may prevent the ideal, the best situation for a child is to be raised by a married mother and father. * * * If the gay marriage ruling [of the California Supreme Court] is not overturned, TEACHERS COULD BE REQUIRED to teach young children there is no difference between gay marriage and traditional marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">We should not accept a court decision that may result in public schools teaching our own kids that gay marriage is ok. * * * [W]hile gays have the right to their private lives, they do not have the right to redefine marriage for everyone else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\"><em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 930 (brackets and asterisks in original, internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting California Voter Information Guide, California General Election, Tuesday, November 4, 2008). In a mailing leaflet, the Proposition 8 proponents accused the California Supreme Court of being \u201cactivist\u201d when it decreed earlier that year that gays and lesbians have the same fundamental right as heterosexuals to marry. <em>See Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 988-89; <em>Marriage Cases, </em>183 P.3d at 433-34 (\u201c[W]e conclude that the right to marry ... guarantees same-sex couples the same substantive constitutional rights as opposite-sex couples to choose one\u2019s life partner and enter with that person into a committed, officially recognized, and protected family relationship that enjoys all of the constitutionally based incidents of marriage.\u201d). The Proposition 8 proponents argued that \u201c \u2018[i]f traditional marriage goes by the wayside, then in every public school, children will be indoctrinated with a message that is absolutely contrary to the values that their family is attempting to teach them at home.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 990. They suggested to voters that \u201c \u2018the fact that gay people are being asked to be recognized and have their relationships recognized is an imposition on other people, as opposed to an extension of fundamental civil rights to gay and lesbian people.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 989. Like the proponents of Montana\u2019s Marriage Amendment, the Proposition 8 proponents \u201cfocused on protecting children and the concern that people of faith and religious groups would somehow be harmed by the recognition of gay marriage.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 990. \u201cThe campaign conveyed a message that gay people and relationships are inferior, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>homosexuality is undesirable and that children need to be protected from exposure to gay people and their relationships.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b6186 Based on the evidence regarding the campaign to pass Proposition 8, the federal district court concluded that \u201cthe most likely explanation for its passage [was] a desire to advance the belief that opposite-sex couples are morally superior to same-sex couples.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 1002-03. The court further observed, however, that none of the evidence supported the proponents\u2019 premise that opposite-sex relationships are materially distinct from same-sex relationships. To the contrary, \u201cthe evidence thoroughly rebutted [that premise]: rather than being different, same-sex and opposite-sex unions are, for all purposes relevant to California law, exactly the same.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 1001. Furthermore, and contrary to the unsubstantiated fears asserted by the State\u2019s amici in the present case, the federal district court found that \u201c[p]ermitting same-sex couples to marry will not affect the number of opposite-sex couples who marry, divorce, cohabit, have children outside of marriage or otherwise affect the stability of opposite-sex marriages.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 972. In regard to these findings, the court pointed to extensive expert testimony and other evidence in the record, plus various admissions by the Proposition 8 proponents, highlights of which I shall note here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u2022 \u201cGay and lesbian sexual orientations are \u2018normal variation[s] and are considered to be aspects of well-adjusted behavior.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u2022 \u201cHomosexuality is not considered a mental disorder.

Supp. 2d at 961, 967-69, 972-73, 980-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b6187 In sum, like the CI-96 campaign, the Proposition 8 campaign \u201crelied heavily on negative stereotypes about gays and lesbians.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 1003. But when asked to demonstrate the validity of their arguments in court, the proponents failed to produce any <em>actual </em>evidence substantiating the notion that same-sex marriage harms children, is inferior to different-sex marriage, or threatens the stability of different-sex marriage. More to the point, the challengers did produce substantial evidence-including deposition testimony by two of the proponents\u2019 own <em>witnesses-refuting </em>each of these propositions. In the end, it became apparent to the federal district court that <em>\u201cmoral and religious views </em>form the <em>only </em>basis for a belief that same-sex couples are different from opposite-sex couples.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 1001 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u00b6 188 One such underlying moral and religious view is that men and women must adhere to specific gender roles in a marriage: the husband \u201cis the bread winner\u201d and the wife \u201cstays at home.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 958-59, 975, 998. That is no longer the law in California or Montana, however. <em>See </em>Cal. Fam. Code \u00a7 720; \u00a7 40-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN7\">\u201c[T]he primacy of the husband as the legal and economic representative of the couple, and the protector and provider for his wife, was seen as absolutely essential to what marriage was\u201d in the nineteenth century. Gender restrictions were slowly removed from marriage, but \u201cbecause there were such alarms about it and such resistance to change in this what had been seen as quite an essential characteristic of marriage, it took a very very long time before this trajectory of the removal of the state from prescribing these rigid spousal roles was complete.\u201d The removal of gender inequality in marriage is now complete \u201cto no apparent damage to the institution. And, in fact, I think to the benefit of the institution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-8\"><em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 960 (brackets in original) (quoting trial testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">\u00b6189 Another underlying moral and religious view is that gay and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>lesbian relationships are sinful. <em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 985-86. In this regard, one witness pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">[t]he religious arguments that were mobilized in the 1950s to argue against interracial marriage and integration as against God\u2019s will are mirrored by arguments that have been mobilized in the Proposition 8 campaign and many of the campaigns since Anita Bryant\u2019s \u2018Save Our Children\u2019 campaign, which argue that homosexuality itself or gay people or the recognition of their equality is against God\u2019s will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\"><em>Perry, </em>704 F. Supp. 2d at 985.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And this leads me to the crux of the matter: that Montana\u2019s Marriage Amendment is an unconstitutional attempt to enforce a sectarian belief (held by some <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>) through Montana\u2019s secular law.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b6190 Indeed, the Marriage Amendment is undisputedly grounded in religious doctrine. That much is apparent not only from the federal district court\u2019s findings, but particularly from the fulminations of numerous religious organizations in the present case, led by the Montana Catholic Conference, against the prospect that gay, lesbian, and bisexual Montanans might enjoy some measure of legal protection for their relationships. If homosexuality and same-sex relationships were not a religious issue, it is highly doubtful that any of these amici <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>would be so actively involved in this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b6191 Before proceeding, I should note that what follows is not an attack on religion, and I make no pretense of being a theologian. That the Marriage Amendment embodies a biblical abhorrence of homosexuality is, in my view, apparent from the testimony and evidence in the <em>Perry </em>case, discussed above, and from a casual reading of the Bible\u2019s teachings against homosexuality, discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b6192 While the historical Jesus, notably, had absolutely nothing to say on the subject, there are passing references to homosexuality in <em>Romans </em>1:26-27, I <em>Corinthians </em>6:9-10,1 <em>Timothy </em>1:10, and <em>Jude </em>1:7 (New King James Version). The primary condemnations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>homosexuality, however, are taken from the Genesis story of Sodom and Gomorrah, and from the rules set out in Leviticus. In the former, God sends two angles in the form of men to the home of Lot to warn him of God\u2019s impending punishment of the townspeople. The Sodomites surround Lot\u2019s house demanding to \u201cknow\u201d (i.e., have carnal knowledge of) the two men. Lot declines and, instead, offers up his two daughters to the mob. But when that ploy fails, the angels strike the townsmen blind. Lot, his wife Sarah, and his two daughters then flee the city. Along the way, Sarah is turned into a pillar of salt. Lot eventually takes up residence in a cave with his two daughters, where he gets drunk and impregnates them both. <em>Genesis </em>19:1-36. Many believe this story reflects God\u2019s condemnation of homosexuality, and they thus equate \u201cSodomite\u201d with \u201chomosexual.\u201d I note, though, that in <em>Ezekiel </em>16:49-50, the sins of Sodom are identified as pride, gluttony, sloth, greed, arrogance, and failure to help the poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b6193 The references to homosexuality in Leviticus are part of the so-called \u201cHoliness Code.\u201d <em>See </em>Luther Seminary, <em>Leviticus 17-27 </em>- <em>The Holiness Code, </em>http://www.enterthebible.org/resource link.aspx?rid=377. Leviticus explicitly condemns homosexuality: \u201cYou shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination.\u201d <em>Leviticus, </em>18:22; <em>see also Leviticus, </em>20:13 (\u201cIf a man lies with a male as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them.\u201d). It should also be noted, however, that Leviticus sets forth a number of other rules that presumably made sense to a primitive nomadic culture thousands of years ago but that modern society would certainly question, if not outright ignore. Indeed, it seems absurd to consider an amendment to Montana\u2019s Constitution authorizing the possession of slaves <em>(Leviticus </em>25:44), or requiring the burning of animals as a sacrifice to God <em>(Leviticus </em>1:2-17), or prohibiting intercourse with menstruating women <em>{Leviticus </em>15:19-24), or prohibiting the consumption of shellfish <em>{Leviticus </em>11:10-12), or prohibiting a blind or lame person from approaching the altar of God <em>{Leviticus, </em>21:18-20), or prohibiting the trimming of one\u2019s hair, especially at the temples <em>{Leviticus </em>19:27), or prohibiting any contact with or consumption of dead pigs <em>{Leviticus </em>11:7-8), or prohibiting the planting of two different crops in the same field <em>{Leviticus </em>19:19), or prohibiting the wearing of mixed linen and wool <em>{Leviticus </em>19:19), or requiring the stoning of those who blaspheme <em>{Leviticus </em>24:10-16).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b6194 As already stated, this is not meant to disparage or trivialize biblical teachings. In terms of sectarian doctrine and ritual, people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>have the right to believe and practice whatever they choose. That is the very essence of the constitutional protection of the \u201cfree exercise\u201d of religion. U.S. Const, amend. I; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 5; <em>Thomas v. Rev. Bd. of Ind. Empl. Sec.

Ct. at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b6195 My focus here, however, is not on federal law. My analysis instead focuses solely on Montana\u2019s Constitution because it, unlike its federal counterpart, is burdened with the Marriage Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">D. Constitutionality of the Marriage Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"APn\">\u00b6196 The Montana Constitution makes it clear that the right and power of government originates with the people, and they may amend the Constitution whenever they deem it necessary. Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. Yet, one will search in vain for a provision in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Constitution authorizing the people to amend that document so as to effect some social policy or majoritarian ideology that is, itself, contrary to constitutional principles. Quite simply, \u201cwhile the people may amend the Constitution, they may not violate it in the process.\u201d <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 68, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455.</p>\n<p id=\"AFU\">\u00b6197 By way of example, the people could not enact additional \u201cGeneral Provisions\u201d in Article XIII that would prohibit marriages between Catholics and Protestants, prohibit women from working outside the home, and create a committee of business and religious leaders to sanitize media stories. Such amendments would clearly run afoul of Article II, Sections 4, 3, and 7, respectively (not to mention their counterparts in the federal Constitution). Such amendments would themselves be inherently unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b6198 In the same fashion, the people do not have the power to constitutionalize religious doctrine. Again, by way of example, the people could not adopt an amendment that required all church worship services to be conducted on Sunday, or that denied certain governmental services to persons who were not \u201cborn again,\u201d or that prohibited women from being ordained as ministers. And for the same reasons, religious teachings that homosexuality is a sin cannot be made part of Montana\u2019s secular law-as the proponents of CI-96 have attempted to do through the Marriage Amendment. The Achilles heel of the Marriage Amendment is that it is the wolf of constitutionalized religious doctrine parading in the sheep-suit of social policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b6199 Unlike the Marriage Amendment, Article II, Section 5 is a \u201cfundamental right.\u201d <em>Kortum-Managhan v. Herbergers NBGL, </em>2009 MT 79, \u00b6 25, 349 Mont. 475, 204 P.3d 693. It provides that \u201c[t]he state shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion ....\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 5. The Montana Constitution itself is \u201cthe supreme <em>law </em>of this State.\u201d <em>Associated Press v. Bd. of Pub. Educ., </em>246 Mont. 386, 391, 804 P.2d 376, 379 (1991) (emphasis added). Thus, when the State, through the initiative process, \u201cmakes a law\u201d that serves no purpose other than to codify a religious canon-here, select portions of Genesis and Leviticus-the State clearly violates Article II, Section 5. One can only imagine the uproar if the State began incorporating doctrines from the Koran or some other religion\u2019s sacred text into the Constitution. Yet, that is precisely what the Marriage Amendment did. Through the initiative process, the State constitutionalized the biblical abhorrence for homosexuality by prohibiting same-sex couples not only from marrying but, according to the State and its amici, from enjoying any sort of legal protection for their relationships. Such protections are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>instead to be reserved to the biblically favored class of different-sex couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b6200 The Bible\u2019s condemnation of homosexuality aside, marriage clearly has-and has had for centuries-two separate components. There is the sectarian component: Various religions have doctrines, rituals, and proscriptions regarding marriage. Under the Free Exercise Clause, religions may choose to adopt any desired beliefs, practices, or rituals (within reason<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>). <em>See St. John\u2019s, </em>252 Mont. at 523, 830 P.2d at 1276; <em>Griffith v. Butte Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>2010 MT 246, \u00b6 62, 358 Mont. 193, 244 P.3d 321. If some religious institutions wish to condemn same-sex relationships, they are free to do so. Conversely, if others wish to perform same-sex marriages, they likewise are free to do so. Article II, Section 5 guarantees that each religion may adhere to its own doctrines, practices, and rituals. Under Article II, Section 5, the State cannot force any religion or sectarian organization to perform same-sex weddings or to recognize same-sex marriages, nor can it penalize any religion or sectarian organization for refusing to do so-Proponent\u2019s nonsensical statements in the 2004 Voter Information Pamphlet to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b6201 The right of citizens to practice their religious beliefs is not what is at issue here, however. It is the other component of marriage-the secular component-that is at issue. Like many other states, Montana permits people to marry without the involvement of any institutionalized religion or sectarian organization. People may choose to marry in a completely civil ceremony. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-1-301(1), MCA (\u201cA marriage may be solemnized by a judge of a court of record, by a public official whose powers include solemnization of marriages, by a mayor, city judge, or justice of the peace, by a tribal judge, or in accordance with any mode of solemnization recognized by any religious denomination, Indian nation or tribe, or native group.\u201d). Importantly, what brings the marriage relationship into existence in the eyes of the law is the properly executed marriage license issued by <em>the State </em>and the completion of certain medical tests and legal prerequisites. <em>See </em>Title 40, chapter 1, parts 1 and 2, MCA; \u00a7\u00a7 40-1-301(1), -321, -322, MCA. This is so regardless of the ceremony or ritual performed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>regardless of who performs it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201c[L]aw (federal <em>or </em>state) is not concerned with holy matrimony. Government deals with marriage as a civil status .... A state may enforce and dissolve a couple\u2019s marriage, but it cannot sanctify or bless it. For that, the pair must go next door.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Windsor v. United States, </em>699 F.3d 169, 188 (2d Cir. 2012) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b6202 With the governmentally created and licensed relationship, there also springs into existence the various benefits and obligations at issue here. There is <em>no </em>religion or religious institution in Montana that can create, provide, or deny statutory benefits and protections incident to marriage. Only <em>the State </em>can do that. Certainly the State could choose to provide no benefits at all for married couples. <em>Marriage Cases, </em>183 P.3d at 426 (\u201cthe constitutional right to marry clearly does not obligate the state to afford specific tax or other governmental benefits on the basis of a couple\u2019s family relationship\u201d). Indeed, the State concedes in its brief that there is \u201cno constitutional or judicially enforceable mandate for the Legislature to provide or fund spousal benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But the point of this case is that the State <em>has </em>decided to make various benefits available to different-sex couples, who may obtain them by marrying in either sectarian or secular ceremonies, but has not made the same sorts of benefits available to same-sex couples who, by reason of the Marriage Amendment, cannot marry. Although the same-sex couples here do not claim the right to marry-acknowledging that the Marriage Amendment has denied them that ability-they do demand, and rightly so, that their government accord them <em>at least </em>the benefits and protections provided to different-sex married couples in the State\u2019s secular laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b6203 In denying Plaintiffs these protections through the conduit of the Marriage Amendment, the State conflates <em>religious </em>canons regarding marriage with the State\u2019s own <em>civil </em>laws. This is patently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>unconstitutional. When the State chooses to enact secular laws for the benefit of different-sex couples, but at the same time denies equal protection of those laws to same-sex couples because of sectarian proscriptions constitutionalized in the Marriage Amendment, the State is engaged in blatant discrimination grounded in religious doctrine. This sort of discrimination is unlawful not only under Article II, Section 5, but also under Article II, Section 4 (\u201cNeither the state nor any person, firm, corporation, or institution shall discriminate against any person in the exercise of his civil or political rights on account of ... religious ideas.\u201d). Indeed, when, on the basis of religious doctrine, the State denies committed intimate same-sex couples the secular benefits and civil rights incidental to the status of marriage, the State is guilty of at least three abuses of the Constitution: the Equal Protection and Nondiscrimination Clauses of Article II, Section 4; the Dignity Clause of Article II, Section 4; and the Establishment Clause of Article II, Section 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b6204 Before concluding this discussion, I have two final observations. First, to credit the implicit (and explicit) fears expressed in the amicus briefs of the religious and \u201cfamily values\u201d organizations, one is led to believe that same-sex marriages are going to overwhelm (or dilute, as the State puts it) the now heterosexually dominated institution. These fears are completely irrational. Indeed, were it not for its religious underpinnings, such homophobia would be bizarre. For one thing, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community is a relatively small minority. A Gallup report published in October 2012 reported that, nationally, 3.4 percent of U.S. adults answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked if they identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. Of the remaining, 92.2 percent answered \u201cno\u201d and 4.4 percent refused to answer or answered \u201cdon\u2019t know.\u201d Racial and ethnic minorities were more likely than white Americans to identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender: 4.6 percent of African Americans, 4.3 percent of Asians, 4.0 percent of Hispanics, and 3.2 percent of Caucasians. And younger Americans (age 18 to 29) were more likely than seniors (age 65 and older) to identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender: 6.4 percent versus 1.9 percent, respectively. <em>See </em>Gary J. Gates &amp; Frank Newport, <em>Special Report: 3.4% of U.S. Adults Identify as LGBT, </em>http://www .gallup.com/poll/158066/special-report-adults-identifylgbt.aspx (Oct. 18, 2012); Gary J. Gates &amp; Frank Newport, <em>Gallup Special Report: The U.S. Adult LGBT Population, </em>http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/census-lgbtdemographics-studies/gallup-special-report-18oct-2012. Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>in 2010, same-sex couples comprised a mere 1 percent of all \u201ccouple\u201d households in the United States. <em>See </em>U.S. Census, <em>Same-Sex Couple Households, </em>at 1 (Sep. 2011), http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/ acsbrl0-03.pdf. Permitting these couples to enjoy their full measure of civil rights-much less marry-would not denigrate the \u201cinstitution of marriage\u201d one iota. There is no actual evidence supporting the threat of ruination of families, businesses, churches, and childrearing in the irreversibly horrendous ways predicted. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary, as already discussed. The scare tactics, misinformation, and propaganda used by the promoters of the Marriage Amendment were then, and remain now, not only false, but patently absurd as well.</p>\n<p id=\"AEo\">\u00b6205 Second, the institution of marriage has been and is, of course, completely dominated by heterosexuals. However, for all of the sanctimonious hyperbole about the one-man/one-woman marital relationship, the nationwide rates of divorces in 1990, 2000, and 2009 were 48 percent, 49 percent, and 50 percent, respectively, relative to the rate of marriages performed those same years. In Montana, the numbers were even higher: 59 percent, 58 percent, and 55 percent, respectively. <em>See </em>U.S. Census Bureau, <em>Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012, </em>at 98 (2011), http://www.census.gov/compendia/ statab. Those who insist on the nuclear mother-father-children model appear to be wholly detached from the reality of modern America. While the number of \u201cfamily households\u201d increased 8 percent between 2000 and 2010, the percentage of such households falling into the \u201chusband-wife with own children\u201d category dropped from 35 percent in 2000 to 30 percent in 2010. <em>See </em>U.S. Census Bureau, <em>Households and Families: 2010, </em>at 4-5 (Apr. 2012), http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/ briefs/c2010br-14.pdf. In 2004, 58 percent of children lived with their married, biological parents, down from 60 percent in 2001 and 61 percent in 1996. <em>See </em>U.S. Census Bureau, <em>Living Arrangements of Children: 2004, </em>at 4 (Feb. 2008), http://www.census.gov/prod/ 2008pubs/p70-114.pdf. The \u201cBeaver Cleaver\u201d family of the 1950s simply does not represent modern America, and is not likely to be resurrected given the demographics, demands, and exigencies of contemporary life in this country. In any event, if sectarian and \u201cfamily values\u201d organizations are intent on preserving the sanctity of marriage, it seems that their efforts and resources would be better spent focusing on the damage that <em>heterosexuals </em>are inflicting on the institution, rather than the imagined threat that homosexuals and bisexuals supposedly pose. Furthermore, if those organizations are setting out to reform American \u201cmorality\u201d to the dictates of their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>religious beliefs and to create a sort of Christian theocracy in this country not unlike the Islamic theocracies prevalent in certain Middle Eastern countries, then they ought to candidly disclose that fact rather than hiding behind the thoroughly disproved notion that reserving marriage to different-sex couples is necessary for the protection of children and essential for our survival as a nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b6206 In conclusion, assuming for the sake of argument that it is even applicable in this case, the Marriage Amendment cannot justify the State\u2019s approach. The Marriage Amendment is simply constitutionalized religious doctrine, and it cannot serve as a conduit for providing discretionary statutory benefits to some committed intimate couples while denying them to others. The benefits and obligations which the State creates under its secular law must not first be filtered through the sieve of religious doctrine in order to see who gets what. Article II, Section 5 ensures the separation of church and state. The constitutional quid pro quo is this: While the State is not permitted to be involved in the workings of religious institutions, neither is the State permitted to enforce the doctrines, canons, mandates, or proscriptions of any religion or sectarian organization. The State may not \u201ctarget\u201d a class of individuals for disparate treatment in order to advance a religious purpose or doctrine, without violating the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">VL CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b6207 There are many who believe that gays and lesbians are second-class citizens; that they are morally inferior; that they are objects worthy of societal scorn, derision, and hatred; that they may be reviled and demonized on the floor of the Legislature with impunity; that they may be discriminated against by local governments; that they may be bullied in their schools and workplaces; and that they are not entitled to the same rights accorded to heterosexuals. Such views parallel those held by many-even the United States Supreme Court-regarding racial minorities and women a century ago. <em>Dred Scott v. Sandford, </em>60 U.S. 393, 407 (1857) (African-Americans, whether slave or free, were \u201caltogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations,\u201d and \u201chad no rights which the white man was bound to respect\u201d); <em>People v. Hall, </em>4 Cal. 399, 404-05 (Cal. 1854) (the Chinese were \u201ca race of people whom nature has marked as inferior, and who are incapable of progress or intellectual development beyond a certain point\u201d); <em>Muller v. Oregon, </em>208 U.S. 412, 421-23, 28 S. Ct. 324, 326-27 (1908) (\u201c[t]hat woman\u2019s physical structure and the performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence is obvious\u201d; \u201chistory discloses the fact that woman has always been dependent upon man. He established his control at the outset by superior physical strength, and this control in various forms, with diminishing intensity, has continued to the present\u201d). We legitimize those similar, pernicious views about gays and lesbians when, as the Court does today, we abrogate our solemn obligation to declare and uphold the constitutional rights of all Montanans <em>-especially </em>those among us who have been subjected to majoritarian and state-imposed hatred and discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b6208 My abiding belief is that no person-no human being-in our society should be reviled, demonized, and discriminated against for being gay, lesbian, or bisexual, any more than they should be treated in that fashion for being Native American, Presbyterian, female, disabled, poor, or Irish. No person should be the object of state-sanctioned bigotry simply for being born homosexual or for choosing to love another person of the same sex. No person should be made to suffer the deprivation of their civil rights and liberties because of the religious beliefs and doctrines of others-doctrines that are now constitutionalized in the Marriage Amendment and enforced by Montana\u2019s government. And no person should be stripped of her or his inviolable human dignity based on sexual orientation. Ever!</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b6209 It may be argued that gay, lesbian, and bisexual Montanans theoretically have won a token victory today. But that simply is not the case. Their victory, if any, must yet be determined in the multitude of lawsuits that will have to be filed in the District Court here and in other trial courts. I doubt that any of these citizens will have the time, the money, or the fortitude to wage the required litigation jihad against their own government simply to obtain the same rights that their heterosexual fellow citizens enjoy. Realistically the Plaintiffs here have gained nothing. The problem, it should be noted, is not with their counsel, who have done an excellent job of researching, briefing, and arguing the issues in this case. The problem, rather, is that this Court has chosen to punt. And in simply kicking the can down the road, the Court has denied Plaintiffs the dignity, respect, fairness, justice, and equality to which they are entitled-foremost as human beings, and legally under Montana\u2019s Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b6210 Sexual orientation is a big deal to those who demand that their personal religious beliefs, their Bible\u2019s abhorrence, and their partisan ideology concerning homosexuality must apply to everyone else, across the board, no exceptions. But future generations-indeed, most young <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>people today-will not fear, much less honor, the sexual-orientation taboo. The taboo will die because of education, science,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and changing social mores, and because of the small, real victories that lesbian, gay, and bisexual citizens have won. <em>See e.g. Gryczan v. State, </em>283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112 (1997); <em>Snetsinger v. Mont. Univ. Sys., </em>2004 MT 390, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445; <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 326, 352 Mont. 513, 220 P.3d 595. Most importantly, though, the taboo will die because the scare tactics, propaganda, and misinformation of those who would hang on to the maledictions and stereotypes have proven to be so patently false, malicious, and absurd. Most decent people just hate being lied to. Indeed, a not-too-distant generation of Montanans will consign today\u2019s decision, the Marriage Amendment, and the underlying intolerance to the dustbin of history and to the status of a meaningless, shameful, artifact.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Epilogue</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b6211 This will be my last opportunity to sit as a member of this Court on a case involving the fight for the dignity and the civil and human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. I had hoped-indeed, believed-that the work this Court started 15 years ago in <em>Gryczan </em>would be brought to fruition and successfully concluded with our decision in this case. Sadly, that is not to be. As I have, I can strenuously disagree with this Court\u2019s decision. Regrettably, however, I have been unsuccessful in doing more than that. I know how frustrating today\u2019s decision must be for the committed same-sex couples and for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Montanans across this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b6212 Our collective frustration and sadness aside, however, if we have learned anything as an evolving species, it is that no government, no religion, no institution, and no political party can long oppress the inviolable dignity and spirit of human beings in their fight for fairness in the courts, access to justice, and equal protection of the laws. Those are the seminal principles upon which our country was founded, and they are the birthright of <em>every </em>natural person on this planet, without exception. Those rights will not be long denied to those suffering the scourge of discrimination and hatred. The committed couples here-and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Montanans everywhere-must never lose sight of the fact that although today\u2019s battle has been lost, the war has not been. They must remain united in defeat because, in the end, they <em>will </em>overcome; they <em>will </em>prevail. Of that, I am absolutely certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b6213 For the foregoing reasons, I strenuously dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">APPENDIX 1 to DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">(Listing of Statutes Attached to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"A270\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"AGg8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"A6m5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"AOo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"Af8I\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"Aoy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"AIa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>APPENDIX 2 to DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"AUpE\">(Plaintiffs\u2019 Prayer for Relief)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">PRAYER FOR RELIEF</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">(1) A declaration that the State\u2019s failure to offer same-sex couples equal opportunity to obtain the protections and obligations that are available to different-sex couples through the legal status of marriage violates Plaintiffs\u2019 right to equal protection under Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">(2) A declaration that the State\u2019s exclusion of same-sex couples from the opportunity to obtain the protections and obligations the State provides to different-sex couples who marry violates Plaintiffs\u2019 right to privacy under Article II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">(3) A declaration that the State\u2019s exclusion of same-sex couples from the opportunity to obtain the protections and obligations the State provides to different-sex couples who marry violates Plaintiffs\u2019 right to dignity under Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">(4) A declaration that the State\u2019s exclusion of same-sex couples from the opportunity to obtain the protections and obligations the State provides to different-sex couples who marry violates Plaintiffs\u2019 right to pursue life\u2019s basic necessities under Article II, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">(5) A declaration that State\u2019s exclusion of same-sex couples from the opportunity to obtain the protections and obligations the State provides to different-sex couples who marry violates Plaintiffs\u2019 right to due process under Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">(6) An order enjoining the State from continuing to deny Plaintiffs and their families access to a legal status and statutory structure that confers the protections and obligations the State provides to different-sex couples who marry.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">(7) An order requiring the State to offer same-sex couples and their families a legal status and statutory structure that confers the protections and obligations that the State provides to different-sex couples who marry, but not the status or designation of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">(8) An order awarding Plaintiffs their costs and their reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">(9) An order awarding such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\">-20-</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-5\"> <em>In re Marriage Cases, </em>183 P.3d 384, 451 (Cal. 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\"> <em>See e.g. Western Tradition Partn. v.

The literature on this subject is prodigious, and I make no attempt to cite all of it here.
