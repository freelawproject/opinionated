After the youth violated the terms of his initial probation agreement, the court revoked that agreement and entered a dispositional order that extended the youth\u2019s probationary period for an additional three years. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the Youth Court exceed its statutory authority by imposing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">\n<em>on revocation an additional three-year probationary term that lasts until S.M.K-S.H\u2019s twenty-first birthday?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the imposition of an additional three-year term of probation violate S.M.K.-S.H\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection of the </em>laws?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">\u00b65 On December 15, 2009, the State filed a petition seeking a \u2022determination that fourteen-year-old S.M.K-S.H. was a delinquent youth or a youth in need of intervention. The State alleged that the youth committed assault with a weapon, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, when he struck a fellow student in the head with a glass bottle and then punched him in the nose. Initially, the youth denied the State\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">\u00b66 On June 29,2010, S.M.K-S.H. entered a signed admission to the charge filed against him. That same day, the Youth Court held a hearing at which the court accepted the youth\u2019s admission and set a dispositional hearing for August 3, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">\u00b67 At the dispositional hearing, the court declared that S.M.K.-S.H. was a delinquent youth for committing assault with a weapon. The Youth Court entered a dispositional order, which committed S.M.K.S.H. to its jurisdiction and placed him on probation until his eighteenth birthday. As part of its order, the Youth Court expressly forbade S.M.K.-S.H. from owning, possessing or being in control of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>firearms or other deadly weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b68 On October 3, 2011, when S.M.K.-S.H. was sixteen years old, the State filed a petition to revoke his probation and to take the youth into custody. That action was prompted by a report from the youth\u2019s probation officer that S.M.K.-S.H. had violated the terms of his probation agreement by possessing a 9mm handgun. The Youth Court authorized the State to take the youth into custody and, on November 7, 2011, S.M.K.-S.H. entered a signed admission to the allegations contained in the State\u2019s petition to revoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b69 That same day, the Youth Court held a change of plea and dispositional hearing. The court informed S.M.K.-S.H. that it was alleged that he \u201chad violated the terms of [his] probation\u201d by possessing \u201ca 9mm handgun\u201d in violation of the conditions of his probation. The youth then admitted to those allegations. In response, the Youth Court accepted S.M.K.-S.H.\u2019s admission and revoked his probation. Next, the court proceeded to the dispositional portion of the hearing. The State recommended that the court should commit the youth \u201cto the Montana Department of Corrections until his 18th birthday for placement at the Pine Hills Youth Correctional Facility,\u201d but did not ask \u201cfor any probationary period beyond that.\u201d Counsel for S.M.K.-S.H. agreed with that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b610 The Youth Court questioned the basis upon which the State and counsel for the youth had decided not to recommend extending the youth\u2019s probation. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">But what can you give me to consider as far as the reasoning regarding any additional supervision after 18? I\u2019m just going to tell you my hesitation is that once he turns 18, he just kind of gets dropped out there in whatever community he\u2019s living at the time, whether it\u2019s here or anywhere else, and then he has no support services or supervision-if I agree to this-to help make sure that he makes good choices .... But what if he just needs support to help get additional education or additional training or just to be responsible to get a job?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b611 The court then explained to the youth why it was concerned about not extending his probation. The court noted that S.M.K.-S.H. had \u201cdone well when [he was] under supervision.\u201d Further, the court explained that it was \u201cworried that if we just have you released from Pine Hills at age 18 and there\u2019s no follow-up, nobody to go to ... I\u2019m not willing to say that we\u2019ve given everything that we could possibly give to support you.\u201d The youth responded, \u201cI understand completely where you\u2019re coming from, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u00b612 Shortly after that exchange, counsel for the State interjected that he was concerned that, in its original dispositional order, the Youth Court only had committed S.M.K.-S.H. to the court\u2019s jurisdiction until his eighteenth birthday. The State questioned whether the Youth Court had the authority to extend the youth\u2019s probationary period past his eighteenth birthday when it had failed to do so in its original dispositional order. The court asked counsel for both parties whether there was any legal authority for extending a youth\u2019s probationary period after his original probation agreement had been revoked. Counsel for S.M.K.-S.H. stated that, because \u201cthe Montana Constitution says adults and youth are to be treated similarly,\u201d an \u201cargument could be made that the Court wouldn\u2019t be able to ... give more time on the revocation than it would have originally imposed.\u201d Counsel for both parties agreed that they were not aware of any cases from this Court that either authorized or prohibited a youth court from extending its jurisdiction over a delinquent youth upon revocation. Counsel for the State did observe, however, that \u201cthere\u2019s a specific statute on point that says you can modify those orders at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AR6r\">\u00b613 After considering arguments made by S.M.K-S.H.\u2019s attorney, the court informed the parties that it was still concerned that failing to extend S.M.K-S.H.\u2019s probation to his twenty-first birthday would not be in the youth\u2019s best interests. The Youth Court told S.M.K.-S.H. that when it sentenced youth offenders, it hoped the sentence would provide \u201can opportunity to learn and change and what we call be rehabilitated to become a good adult....\u201d The Youth Court ultimately determined that it should order the youth to be placed on probation until he turned twenty-one. The main reason for the court\u2019s decision was that it wanted \u201cto make sure [the youth] continue[d] to change [his] thinking and make good decisions, and I want to insure [sic] that we have a way to know that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b614 After the hearing, the court entered a dispositional order, which declared S.M.K.-S.H. a delinquent youth and committed him to the custody of the Montana Department of Corrections for placement at the Pine Hills Youth Correctional Facility until his eighteenth birthday. The court also extended the youth\u2019s probation until his twenty-first birthday and ordered the youth to \u201creturn to the Court immediately following the youth\u2019s eighteenth birthday\u201d to allow the court to \u201cestablish the terms and conditions of the youth\u2019s probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AmG\">\u00b615 S.M.K.-S.H. appeals from that dispositional order. He contends that the Youth Court was not authorized-by statute or by the Montana Constitution-to impose an additional probationary period after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Youth Court failed to do so in its initial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b616 This Court reviews for correctness a youth court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Youth Court Act. <em>In re K.J., </em>2010 MT 41, \u00b6 13, 355 Mont. 257, 231 P.3d 75 <em>(citing In re G.T.M., </em>2009 MT 443, \u00b6 9, 354 Mont. 197, 222 P.3d 626). The constitutionality of a sentencing statute \u201cpresents a question of law that we review de novo.\u201d <em>State v. Strong, </em>2009 MT 65, \u00b6 7, 349 Mont. 417, 203 P.3d 848 (citing <em>In re S.L.M., </em>287 Mont. 23, 32, 951 P.2d 1365, 1370 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b617 <em>1. Did the Youth Court exceed its statutory authority by imposing on revocation an additional three-year probationary term that lasts until S.M.K-S.H\u2019s twenty-first birthday?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\u00b618 S.M.K-S.H.\u2019s argument on this issue is predicated on two of our opinions that are distinguishable from the present case. The youth first contends that, pursuant to our opinion in <em>In re K.D.K., 2006 </em>MT 187, 333 Mont. 100, 141 P.3d 1212, the Youth Court cannot expand its jurisdiction over a delinquent youth once a dispositional order has been entered. We noted in <em>In re K.D.K. </em>that the court could not order additional restitution because the court no longer had jurisdiction to do so. <em>In re K.D.K., </em>\u00b6 21. We determined that K.D.K. \u201creached his eighteenth birthday having satisfied the conditions of his probation and, pursuant to the original disposition order, <em>his probation terminated on February 27,2005.\u201d In re K.D.K., </em>\u00b6 18 (emphasis added). That opinion does not support S.M.K-S.H.\u2019s argument because he had not turned eighteen and his probation had not terminated when the Youth Court extended his probationary period and-as S.M.K.-S.H. acknowledges-\u201cthe Youth Court had jurisdiction over [him] at the time it extended its jurisdiction for three years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\u00b619 The youth further relies on <em>In re T.M.L., </em>2012 MT 9, 363 Mont. 304, 268 P.3d 1255, for the proposition that a youth court must \u201cpurposefully retain jurisdiction after a youth reaches the age of 18\u201d in order to extend the youth\u2019s probationary period. That argument misapprehends our holding. In that case, the Youth Court placed T.M.L. on probation until his eighteenth birthday and ordered him to appear before the court for a transfer hearing after he turned eighteen. <em>In re T.M.L., </em>\u00b6 3. After the youth turned eighteen, he argued that the Youth Court had terminated its jurisdiction over him and no longer was authorized to transfer his case to the district court. <em>In re T.M.L.,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u00b6 10. We held that the Youth Court did not terminate its jurisdiction over the youth when he turned eighteen because the Youth Court \u201cpurposefully retained jurisdiction over T.M.L. when it required T.M.L., upon turning eighteen, to appear before the court for the purpose of a transfer hearing.\u201d <em>In re T.M.L., </em>\u00b6 15 (citing \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA). Although we held that a youth court purposefully may retain jurisdiction over a youth after his probation ends by ordering him to appear for a transfer hearing pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA, we did not state that a youth court is required to do so in order to modify a dispositional order before the youth\u2019s probation has terminated. <em>In re T.M.L., </em>\u00b6 15 (citing \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b620 The State argues that the Youth Court\u2019s second dispositional order \u201cdid not \u2018add three years to [S.M.K-S.H.\u2019s] commitment term.\u2019 \u201d Instead, the State contends that the youth \u201cwas in effect \u2018resentenced\u2019 pursuant to the authority of Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-5-1431(3).\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b621  The statute provides that \u201c[i]f a youth is found to have violated a term of probation, the youth court may make any judgment of disposition that could have been made in the original case.\u201d Section 41-5-1431(3), MCA. At the original dispositional hearing, the Youth Court was authorized by statute to impose a variety of dispositions for S.M.K.-S.H., including two relevant here. First, pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(b), MCA, the court could have \u201ccommit[ted] the youth to the [Department of Corrections] for placement in a state youth correctional facility and recommend to the department that the youth not be released until the youth reaches 18 years of age.\u201d Second, \u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(a), MCA, authorized the Youth Court to \u201cplace the youth on probation\u201d and \u201cretain jurisdiction\u201d over the youth. At the original dispositional hearing, the court could have placed S.M.K.-S.H. on probation and \u201cretained] jurisdiction over [him] until [he reached] 21 years of age.\u201d <em>In re K.D.K., </em>\u00b6 20 (citing \u00a7 41-5-205, MCA). Prior to the second dispositional hearing, S.M.K.-S.H. entered a signed, written admission acknowledging that he had violated a term of his probation agreement. At the hearing, the court correctly concluded that it could commit S.M.K.-S.H. to the Pine Hills Youth Correctional Facility until his eighteenth birthday and place him on probation until his twenty-first birthday because the court could have made both judgments of disposition at the original hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b622  The language of \u00a7 41-5-1431(3), MCA, plainly allows a youth court, after a youth is found to have violated a term of his probation, to enter any dispositional order that originally could have been made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>even if such an order extends the youth\u2019s probation or his commitment to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The Youth Court correctly interpreted and applied the Youth Court Act when it entered its second dispositional order and imposed an additional term of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b623 <em>2. Did the imposition of an additional three-year term of probation violate S.M.K.-S.H\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection of the laws?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aq-\">\u00b624 S.M.K.-S.H. contends that that he was denied his constitutional right to equal protection of the law when the Youth Court extended his probationary period by three years upon revocation. The youth alleges that \u201ca similarly situated adult who committed the offense of Assault with a Weapon, and was serving a set probationary term of supervision, could not be subjected to an additional three year term upon revocation,\u201d whereas the Youth Court Act allows the court to impose a longer commitment term on revocation pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1422(1) and -1431(3), MCA. In his reply brief, S.M.K.-S.H. clarified that his challenge should be regarded as \u201can \u2018as applied\u2019 argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APts\">\u00b625 The youth specifically asserts that, as applied to the facts of his case, these statutes in the Youth Court Act are unconstitutional under Article II, Sections 4 and 15 of the Montana Constitution. Article II, Section 4 provides in part that \u201c[n]o person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Article II, Section 15 provides, \u201c[t]he rights of persons under 18 years of age shall include, but not be limited to, all the fundamental rights of this Article unless specifically precluded by laws which enhance the protection of such persons.\u201d We have held that Article II, Section 15 must be read in conjunction with Article II, Section 4 because one of the \u201cprimary purposes of Article II, Section 15 was to remedy the fact that minors had not been accorded full recognition under the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>In re S.L.M., </em>287 Mont. at 35, 951 P.2d at 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b626 The basic premise of equal protection is \u201cthat persons similarly situated with respect to a legitimate governmental purpose of the law must receive like treatment.\u201d <em>Kershaw v. Mont. Dept. </em>of Transp., 2011 MT 170, \u00b6 17, 361 Mont. 215, 257 P.3d 358 (quoting <em>Satterlee v. Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>2009 MT 368, \u00b6 15, 353 Mont. 265, 222 P.3d 566). The first step in an equal protection analysis is to \u201cidentify the classes involved, and determine if they are similarly situated.\u201d <em>Jaksha v. Butte-Silver Bow Co., </em>2009 MT 263, \u00b6 16, 352 Mont. 46, 214 P.3d 1248 (quoting <em>Reesor v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2004 MT 370, \u00b6 10, 325 Mont. 1, 103 P.3d 1019). If the classes are not similarly situated, \u201cthe first criterion for proving an equal protection violation is not met, and it is not necessary for us to analyze the challenge further.\u201d <em>Kershaw, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Rausch v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, </em>2005 MT 140, \u00b6 18, 327 Mont. 272, 114 P.3d 192).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b627 The State contends that S.M.K.-S.H. is not \u201csimilarly situated to an adult being sentenced to probation for the same offense.\u201d It notes that \u201c[offenders in the Youth Court system are not subject to the same criminal sanctions as adults since [the Youth Court Act] is \u2018designed to promote individual rehabilitation and allow young people to learn positive lessons from their transgressions.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>In re Appeal of Cascade Co. Dist. Ct., </em>2009 MT 355, \u00b6 14, 353 Mont. 194, 219 P.3d 1255). It further notes that some adults who commit assault with a weapon could be subjected to an additional commitment term on revocation, such as \u201can adult [who] had been granted a deferred sentence for assault with a weapon and later had the sentence revoked\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(iv), MCA. We find the first point dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b628 Where a youth in the youth court system faces a disposition different from an adult who has committed the same offenses, we have held that the youth and the adult \u201care not similarly situated with respect to Montana\u2019s sentencing laws for three reasons.\u201d <em>In re C.S., </em>210 Mont. 144, 146, 687 P.2d 57, 59 (1984). Those reasons are: (1) juvenile commitment under the Youth Court Act is \u201cstrictly for rehabilitation, not retribution\u201d; (2) the \u201cliberty interest of a minor is subject to reasonable regulation by the state, to an extent not permissible with adults\u201d under the doctrine <em>ofparens patriae-, </em>and (3) other jurisdictions persuasively have concluded that \u201cadults and juveniles are not similarly situated in these circumstances.\u201d <em>In re C.S., </em>210 Mont. at 146-47, 687 P.2d at 59. We followed our reasoning from <em>In re C.S. </em>and applied its holding in <em>In re G.T.M., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b629 In <em>In re G.T.M., </em>we distinguished <em>In re S.L.M., </em>in which \u201cthis Court determined that youths sentenced as adults under the Extended Jurisdiction Prosecution Act (EJPA) and adults sentenced for committing the same offense are similarly situated classes for purposes of equal protection.\u201d <em>In re G.T.M., </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>In re S.L.M., </em>287 Mont. at 32-33, 951 P.2d at 1371). That was a markedly different factual scenario from the one presented in <em>In re C.S., </em>where we noted that, regarding the offense charged in that case, \u201cyouths in the youth court system and adults in the criminal justice system faced different dispositions for committing the same offense.\u201d <em>In re G.T.M., </em>\u00b6 12. Ultimately, we determined that the classes in <em>In re G.T.M. </em>were not similarly situated because, like the youth in <em>In re C.S. </em>and unlike the youths in <em>In re S.L.M., </em>G.T.M. faced \u201ca different disposition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>negligent arson as a youth in need of intervention in youth court than an adult would face in district court.\u201d <em>In re G.T.M., </em>\u00b6 13 <em>(comparing </em>\u00a7 41-5-345, MCA, <em>with </em>\u00a7 45-6-102, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b630 S.M.K.-S.H. concedes that he \u201cwas not prosecuted under the Extended Jurisdiction Prosecution Act as were the youths in <em>S.L.M.,\u201d </em>and it is clear from the record that he has not been sentenced as an adult. Further, the State argues that \u201cthere are specific statutory provisions in place [in the Youth Court Act] to ensure minors are treated differently than adults.\u201d We recognized as much when we noted that in Montana, \u201cyouths are to be given special treatment by the courts\u201d because the Youth Court Act is \u201cdesigned to promote individual rehabilitation\u201d and because youths \u201care not subject to the same criminal sanctions as are adults.\u201d <em>In re Appeal of Cascade Co. Dist. Ct., </em>\u00b6 14. Like the youth in <em>In re C.S. </em>and <em>In re G.T.M., </em>S.M.K.S.H. faces a different disposition for assault with a weapon as a delinquent youth than an adult would face in district court. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 41-5-1513 <em>with </em>\u00a7 45-5-213, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b631 To the extent the statutes allow for different treatment of S.M.K.S.H. and an adult convicted of assault with a weapon, the Youth Court\u2019s comments on the record illustrate why they are not similarly situated under the rationale of <em>In re G.T.M. </em>and <em>In re C.S. </em>At the dispositional hearing, the court stated that it wanted to ensure S.M.K.S.H. was given the necessary support to make good life choices. Specifically, the court stated, \u201cif we just have you released from Pine Hills at age 18 and there\u2019s no follow-up, nobody to go to ... I\u2019m not willing to say that we\u2019ve given everything that we could possibly give to support you.\u201d Based on our review of the dispositional hearing transcript, the Youth Court made it clear that it was extending the youth\u2019s probationary period so that the youth could be more fully rehabilitated, consistent with the stated purpose of the Youth Court Act. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-5-102, MCA. By allowing the court to enter any dispositional order that could have been made at the original dispositional hearing, \u00a7 41-5-1431(3), MCA, \u201cprovides the sentencing court with more flexibility in ensuring the long term supervision of youths convicted of serious offenses in district court.\u201d <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"AJs\">\u00b632 Citing <em>In re S.L.M., </em>S.M.K.-S.H. also contends that his right to equal protection of the laws has been violated because he is now \u201c\u2018at risk\u2019 for consequences\u201d under \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA. Pursuant to that section, a youth court <em>\u201cmay, </em>on the youth\u2019s motion or the motion of the county attorney, transfer jurisdiction to the district court and order the transfer of supervisory responsibility from juvenile probation services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>to adult probation services.\u201d Section 41-5-208(1), MCA (emphasis added). Even if jurisdiction over him is transferred to the district court for supervisory responsibility, S.M.K.-S.H. will not necessarily be subjected to these \u201cconsequences.\u201d Unlike the youths in <em>In re S.L.M., </em>S.M.K.-S.H. has not had a youth sentence <em>and </em>an adult sentence imposed on him, so he does not face the same \u201clegitimate and realistic fear\u201d that he will be sentenced as an adult. Furthermore, unlike the youths <em>in In re </em>S.L.M.-who could have been committed to both a youth sentence and then an adult sentence-S.M.K.-S.H. \u201cmay not be held in a state youth correctional facility for a period of time in excess of the maximum period of imprisonment that could be imposed on an adult convicted\u201d of the same offense. Section 41-5-1522(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b633 The court listened to the youth\u2019s concerns about \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA, and determined that the court would \u201chave to cross that bridge if needed\u201d at a later date. The Youth Court correctly determined that S.M.K-S.H.\u2019s objection on this point is not ripe for review because the youth can only point to \u201chypothetical, speculative, or illusory disputes as opposed to actual, concrete conflicts.\u201d <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 54, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b634  S.M.K-S.H.\u2019s equal protection claim fails because the youth is not similarly situated with adults sentenced for the same crime. Furthermore, the Youth Court extended S.M.K-S.H.\u2019s probation to enhance his protections and to provide him with additional support to make good life decisions. The Youth Court\u2019s actions were consistent with the stated goals of the Youth Court Act and with our interpretation of the equal protection guarantees of the Montana Constitution. <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 26. Since the youth received \u201call the fundamental rights\u201d guaranteed by the constitution, we need not further consider his claims under Article II, Section 15. For those reasons, we hold that the imposition of an additional three-year term of probation pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1422(1) and -1431(3), MCA, did not violate S.M.K.-S.H\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b635 For the foregoing reasons, the dispositional order of the Youth Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b205-7\">JUSTICES RICE, COTTER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
