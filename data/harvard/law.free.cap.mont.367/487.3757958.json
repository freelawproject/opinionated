Tonner (Tonner) appeals an order of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Flathead County, granting summary judgment to Holly Ann Cirian (Cirian). The sole issue on appeal is whether Cirian is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We reverse and remand for trial on Tonner\u2019s claim of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">\u00b62 On March 19, 2007, Tonner was driving her Nissan Titan pickup truck east on Balsam Street in Libby, Montana. At the same time, Cirian was driving her Hyundai Elantra north on Washington Avenue, which meets Balsam Street at an uncontrolled intersection. Cirian approached the intersection from Tonner\u2019s right, and Tonner was to Cirian\u2019s left. As Tonner was driving through the intersection, the front of Cirian\u2019s car collided with the rear quarter-panel of the passenger side of Tonner\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">\u00b63 The collision damaged both vehicles and injured Tonner. Tonner filed an amended complaint against Cirian on July 25, 2011, alleging that the \u201ccollision was the direct and proximate result of the negligence of [Cirian].\u201d Tonner contended in part that Cirian was negligent because she had failed \u201cto maintain a proper lookout for other vehicles lawfully driving upon said roadway\u201d and because she had failed \u201cto operate her vehicle in a reasonable and prudent manner, under the circumstances then and there existing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">\u00b64 Cirian moved for summary judgment under M. R. Civ. P. 56(c), contending that she was not negligent \u201cas a matter of law\u201d because she \u201capproached the intersection to the right of Tonner,\u201d and thus Tonner had an absolute \u201cstatutory duty to yield the right-of-way to Cirian\u201d under \u00a7 61-8-339, MCA (2007). Tonner opposed Cirian\u2019s motion, arguing that \u201cthe simple allegation of a right of way violation ... does not conclude issues of comparative negligence, which are distinctly factual.\u201d She contended that \u201cthe fact that one driver enjoys the right of way does not absolve the favored driver of his duty to maintain a proper lookout.\u201d Both parties submitted deposition testimony and Tonner also attached a signed affidavit to her brief, recounting her recollection of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">\u00b65 Each driver testified in her deposition that she was driving at or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>under the posted speed limit and was unimpaired. Both admitted, however, that neither saw the other\u2019s car prior to entering the intersection. Tonner explained in her affidavit that she slowed and looked down the street to her right before crossing Washington Avenue, but she did not see Cirian\u2019s car. Cirian, on the other hand, testified in her deposition that she did not look to her left before entering the intersection. She stated, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I was just looking straight, I mean, but at the last minute I saw her, so I was looking straight instead of anywhere else.\u201d Cirian later explained that, even if she had looked left, she would have been unable to see Tonner because \u201cbushes and a fence\u201d rendered that side of the intersection \u201cvery un-visible\u201d to her. With her affidavit in response to Cirian\u2019s motion, Tonner attached photographs of the intersection taken shortly after the accident, purporting to demonstrate that Cirian\u2019s view of Balsam Street was not obstructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b66 The District Court granted Cirian\u2019s motion for summary judgment on February 16,2012, on the ground that \u201cno genuine issue of material fact exists and that [Cirian] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The court faulted Tonner for failing to offer \u201cadmissible evidence to support [her] allegations.\u201d It refused to consider Tonner\u2019s contention that Cirian had received a traffic citation, noting that she had failed to submit an affidavit from the investigating officer and that issuance of a traffic citation was not admissible in the civil case in any event <em>(citing Hart-Anderson v. Hauck, </em>239 Mont. 444, 449, 781 P.2d 1116, 1119 (1989)). The court also noted the lack of evidence that Cirian was speeding. The court concluded that, \u201c[a]s a matter of law,\u201d Cirian \u201cwas not negligent nor did she proximately cause the accident, as the collision would not have occurred without [Tonner\u2019s] violation of the right-of-way statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same M. R. Civ. P. 56(c) criteria as the district court. <em>Turner v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>2012 MT 213, \u00b6 11, 366 Mont. 285, 291 P.3d 1082. Summary judgment is appropriate only \u201cwhen the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Parish v. Morris, </em>2012 MT 116, \u00b6 10, 365 Mont. 171, 278 P.3d 1015. \u00b68 The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of \u201cestablishing that no genuine issue of material fact exists.\u201d <em>Fisher v. Swift Transp. Co., </em>2008 MT 105, \u00b6 12, 342 Mont. 335, 181 P.3d 601 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>(citing <em>Eklund v. Trost, </em>2006 MT 333, \u00b6 21, 335 Mont. 112, 151 P.3d 870). Once the moving party has met that burden, the non-moving party \u201cneed only submit evidence of sufficient facts to support a genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment in favor of the movant.\u201d <em>Meadow Lake Ests. Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 41, \u00b6 38, 341 Mont. 345, 178 P.3d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b69 Summary judgment is \u201can extreme remedy and should never be substituted for trial if a material factual controversy exists.\u201d <em>Contreras v. Fitzgerald, </em>2002 MT 208, \u00b6 23, 311 Mont. 257, 54 P.3d 983 (citation omitted). Because negligence actions \u201cordinarily involve questions of fact, they are generally not susceptible to summary judgment.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>\u00b6 12 <em>(citing Hinkle v. Shepherd Sch. Dist. # 37, </em>2004 MT 175, \u00b6 23, 322 Mont. 80, 93 P.3d 1239). In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the evidence \u201cmust be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party[.]\u201d <em>Malpeli v. State, </em>2012 MT 181, \u00b6 12, 366 Mont. 69, 285 P.3d 509. A district court\u2019s conclusion that no genuine issue of material fact exists \u201cis a legal conclusion we review for correctness.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u00b610 <em>Is Cirian entitled to judgment as a matter of law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\u00b611 The District Court relied on \u00a7 61-8-339(1), MCA (2007), in granting summary judgment to Cirian. The statute provides, \u201c[w]hen two or more vehicles enter or approach an intersection from different highways, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching from the right that are close enough to constitute an immediate hazard.\u201d Montana\u2019s right-of-way statutes are \u201cintended to accord vehicles approaching or entering an intersection the status of favored and disfavored drivers \u2018to facilitate the orderly movement of automobiles.\u2019\u201d <em>Yates v. Hedges, </em>178 Mont. 488, 496, 585 P.2d 1290, 1295 (1978) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">\u00b612 Tonner disputes the District Court\u2019s conclusion that, under the plain language of \u00a7 61-8-339, MCA (2007), Cirian-the favored driver under the statute-could not be negligent as a matter of law because Tonner had a statutory duty to yield the right-of-way. According to Tonner, \u201cthe direction in which the parties approach an uncontrolled intersection is but one factor to consider, even under [\u00a7 61-8-339, MCA (2007)],\u201d and that, even if Cirian had the right-of-way, she still was \u201csubject to legal duties e.g., to drive in a careful and prudent manner, to not speed, and to maintain a proper lookout ....\u201d Tonner contends that where \u201cthere is active negligence which can be attributed to <em>both </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>drivers, and an issue of comparative negligence, it cannot be said that reasonable minds could not differ and summary judgment ... is inappropriate to resolve those issues.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Upon de novo review of the record, we agree with Tonner that the parties presented the District Court with genuine issues of material fact that could not be resolved on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b613 In similar cases, we have affirmed judgment as a matter of law only when the undisputed facts supported but one conclusion-that the cause of the collision was the disfavored driver\u2019s failure to yield to an approaching vehicle that was so close as to be an immediate hazard under the right-of-way statute. <em>Roe v. </em>Kornder-Owen, 282 Mont. 287, 292, 937 P.2d 39, 42-43 (1997). While the District Court correctly cited <em>Roe </em>for the general proposition that the favored driver at an intersection has the right to rely on the disfavored driver\u2019s compliance with the right-of-way statute, <em>Roe </em>does not preempt a factual inquiry into the circumstances of the collision. We clarified in a later case that our holding in <em>Roe </em>was based on the record in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">In <em>Roe, </em>we essentially concluded, based on the plaintiffs testimony that the defendant's vehicle was only one-half block from the intersection when she attempted to cross, that the defendant was so close as to constitute an immediate hazard, creating a duty on the plaintiffs part to yield the right-of-way. The plaintiffs failure to comply with this duty constituted negligence as a matter of law and made the issue of whether the defendant maintained an adequate lookout immaterial. <em>Roe, </em>282 Mont. at 292, 937 P.2d at 42. Unlike the defendant in <em>Roe, </em>however, Spinier has not presented any evidence regarding the location of her vehicle at the time Allen entered the intersection and, as a result, it cannot be determined as a matter of law that Allen\u2019s statutory duty to yield ever arose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\"><em>Spinier v. Allen, </em>1999 MT 160, \u00b6 22, 295 Mont. 139, 983 P.2d 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u00b614 Our decision in <em>Spinier </em>demonstrates that summary judgment is not appropriate in an intersection collision case when the parties dispute material facts with regard to the disfavored driver\u2019s failure to yield the right-of-way. Even in that situation, where it was alleged that a disfavored driver violated the right-of-way statute, we held that whether a favored driver maintained an adequate lookout is a material fact that should be weighed by the finder of fact. <em>Spinier, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-26. We noted as much in <em>Roe </em>when we reiterated that \u201c[a] favored driver cannot ignore obvious dangers by blindly relying on her right-of-way ... but instead must maintain a proper lookout and use reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>care.\u201d Roe, 282 Mont. at 291-92, 937 P.2d at 42. Maintaining a proper lookout requires a driver \u201cto look not only straight ahead but laterally ahead as well and to see that which is in plain sight.\u201d <em>Payne v. Sorenson, </em>183 Mont. 323, 326, 599 P.2d 362, 364 (1979); <em>see also Autio v. Miller, </em>92 Mont. 150, 165, 11 P.2d 1039, 1043 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b615  The statute requires vehicles from the left to yield the right-of-way to a vehicle approaching from the right if it is \u201cclose enough to constitute an immediate hazard.\u201d Section 61-8-339(1), MCA (2007). Similar to the defendant in <em>Spinier, </em>Cirian has not presented any evidence regarding the location of her vehicle at the time Tonner entered the intersection that demonstrated that her vehicle posed an immediate hazard to Tonner as Tonner entered the uncontrolled intersection. The only testimony in the record regarding the location of Cirian\u2019s vehicle in relation to Tonner\u2019s is found in Tonner\u2019s affidavit. In that document, Tonner swore that as she approached the intersection, \u201cshe looked to both her left and right before entering the intersection\u201d and that, although she was \u201cable to see between a quarter and a half a block to the right,\u201d she \u201cobserved no cars on the intersecting street.\u201d On this record, it cannot be determined that Tonner\u2019s entry into the uncontrolled intersection constituted negligence as a matter of law such that the issue whether Cirian maintained an adequate lookout was immaterial. <em>See Spinier, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b616 Although Cirian cites <em>Marcoff v. Buck, 179 </em>Mont. 295, 297, 587 P.2d 1305, 1307 (1978), in support of her position, that case came before the Court following a trial on the merits. At the conclusion of a bench trial, the district court in <em>Mareoff </em>found that the favored driver was negligent and that the right-of-way statute then in effect did not apply because the disfavored driver had entered the intersection first. <em>Marcoff, </em>179 Mont. at 297, 587 P.2d at 1306-07. We reversed the court\u2019s legal conclusion because \u201cthe driver on the left coming into an uncontrolled intersection must yield to the driver on the right.\u201d <em>Marcoff, 179 </em>Mont, at 297, 587 P.2d at 1307. Our conclusion that the disfavored driver was negligent was based on our review of the complete trial record, not on a determination that the facts of the particular incident were immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u00b617 During her deposition, Cirian testified that she was \u201clooking straight ahead instead of anywhere else,\u201d and even if she had been looking laterally ahead, she would not have been able to see Tonner\u2019s vehicle because her view to the left was obstructed by \u201cbushes and a fence.\u201d After Cirian filed her motion for summary judgment, Tonner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>challenged Cirian\u2019s recollection of her ability to see laterally ahead to her left by submitting photographs of the intersection. Those photographs allegedly showed that if Cirian had been looking laterally ahead to her left, she should have been able to see Tonner\u2019s vehicle approach the uncontrolled intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b618  Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Tonner, we conclude that a jury reasonably could find both parties partially responsible for the collision. Whether Tonner\u2019s duty to yield the right-of-way arose under \u00a7 61-8-339(1), MCA (2007), and whether Cirian maintained a proper lookout are matters of factual dispute. These disputed facts are material because they raise issues of comparative negligence. We have held that the defense of contributory negligence on a defendant\u2019s part is available to a plaintiff who is accused of violating a traffic statute; it falls upon \u201cthe factfinder to determine the comparative degree of negligence on the part of plaintiff and defendant.\u201d <em>Reed v. </em>Little, 209 Mont. 199, 206, 680 P.2d 937, 940 (1984). Under such an analysis, \u201cthe jury must consider evidence of negligence from violation of a highway traffic statute, which was a proximate cause of the accident, with other evidence of negligence on the part of <em>both parties\u201d </em>and the \u201cjury must then weigh or compare the negligence of both parties in reaching its verdict.\u201d <em>Reed, </em>209 Mont. at 207, 680 P.2d at 941 (emphasis added). We consistently have followed and applied Need\u2019s analytical construct in subsequent cases. <em>See Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, \u00b6\u00b6 48-51, 338 Mont. 19, 162 P.3d 134; <em>Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33, 344 Mont. 540, 189 P.3d 615; <em>Olson v. Shumaker Trucking &amp; Excavating Constrs., Inc., </em>2008 MT 378, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68, 347 Mont. 1, 196 P.3d 1265; <em>City of Whitefish v. Jentile, </em>2012 MT 185, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 366 Mont. 94, 285 P.3d 515.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, even if Tonner is found to be negligent per se for violating \u00a7 61-8-339, MCA (2007), the fact finder still must weigh Tonner\u2019s negligence against any potential negligence of Cirian and compare the negligence of both in reaching its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u00b619  After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Tonner, we hold that Cirian is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Notwithstanding the exclusion of evidence regarding the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>traffic citation, the deposition and affidavit testimony established factual issues concerning the parties\u2019 comparative negligence. The District Court erred by concluding that the issue whether Cirian was maintaining a proper lookout was not a genuine issue of material fact. \u00b620 For the foregoing reasons, the February 16, 2012, order of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court is reversed and the action is remanded to the court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b514-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> Montana\u2019s adoption of comparative negligence in place of contributory negligence after <em>Reed </em>was decided does not alter the fact finder\u2019s task in weighing the negligence of both parties. <em>See Giambra, </em>\u00b6 51 <em>and Peterson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
