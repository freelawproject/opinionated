CARNES, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1405-17\">This case is presently before the Court on defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss [34], defendants\u2019 Motion for Leave to File Corrected Memorandum of Law [35], and plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Strike Exhibits J, K, L, M, N, O, P, and R to Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (\u201cMotion to Strike\u201d) [46]. The Court has reviewed the record and the arguments of the parties and, for the reasons set out below, concludes that defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss [35] should be GRANTED, defendants\u2019 Motion for Leave to File Corrected Memorandum of Law [35] should be GRANTED, and plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Strike [46] should be DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-18\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-19\">This case arises under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>Plaintiffs Kent Sewright (\u201cSewright\u201d) and Deadre Diggs (\u201cDiggs\u201d) assert that defendants breached fiduciary duties under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>ERISA by permitting plaintiffs to purchase shares of ING Groep, N.V. (\u201cING\u201d) in the ING Americas Savings Plan for ILIAC Agents (\u201cILIAC Plan\u201d) and the Employee Stock Option Plan (\u201cAmericas Plan\u201d). Plaintiffs allege that they were participants in the Americas Plan from June 1, 2007 to the present. (ACC [21] at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18, 64.) Plaintiffs acknowledge that they were never participants in the ILIAC Plan. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">Defendant ING is \u201ca global financial institution of Dutch origin offering banking, investments, life insurance, and retirement services.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 19.) Defendants ING North America Insurance Corporation and ILIAC are subsidiaries of ING and the sponsors of the Americas Plan and the ILIAC Plan, respectively. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 49, 54.) Defendant ING U.S. Pension Committee is the administrator of both plans. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 57.) Defendants Delahanty, Harris, Shattuck, and Wheat are members of the Committee (collectively \u201cCommittee defendants\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant Mclnerney is a member of ING\u2019s Executive Board, defendant Burton is the Senior Vice President at ING North America Insurance Corporation, and defendant Smith is the CEO of ING U.S. Retirement Services.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (ACC [21] at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 51, 55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-5\">Like most financial institutions, ING was negatively affected by the worldwide economic recession in 2008 and 2009. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 142, 145). ING\u2019s stock fell from $40.40 on April 28, 2008 to a low of S3.03 on March 5, 2009. <em>(Id.) </em>On June 8, 2009, the date plaintiffs filed the complaint, the price was back up to $10.89. <em>(Id.) </em>Generally, the fluctuations in ING\u2019s stock tracked the market. <em>(See </em>Mot. to Dismiss at Ex. N.) Throughout the period of decline in the market, ING disclosed in its SEC filings the impact of changing market conditions. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-12\">In October 2008, the Dutch government provided a 10 billion infusion of capital to ING, which enabled ING to pay down its debt and increase shareholders\u2019 equity. (ACC [21] at \u00b6 158.) Since that time, ING has continued to take measures to fortify its position in the market in light of the new market conditions. <em>(See </em>Mot. to Dismiss [34] at Ex. R.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-13\">The plans at issue in this case are \u201celigible individual account plans\u201d (\u201cEIAPs\u201d) within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107(d)(3). They provide retirement income to eligible employees. Both are voluntary contribution plans in which participants manage and direct investment in their own accounts. (ACC [21] at \u00b6\u00b6 72, 86.) Both plans require ING stock be included as an investment option:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-14\">The Committee shall determine the investment options which will be made available under the plan from time to time, and may add or delete investment options, except for the Company Stock investment option which, consistent with the status of a portion of the Plan as an employee stock ownership plan, shall always be an investment option under the Plan, and the Committee shall have no discretion with respect to investments in or disposition of Company stock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-15\">(Americas Plan (2008) at \u00a7 6.2(a), attached as Ex. A to Mot. to Dismiss [34]). Pursuant to the above provision, none of the defendants had the discretion or authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>to eliminate ING stock from the list of alternatives. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">A class action securities complaint was filed against ING in the Southern District of New York in February 2009. <em>See Freidus v. ING Groep N.V., et al., </em>No. 09-cv-1049 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2009). Several copycat cases followed, and all were consolidated with the <em>Freidus </em>action. <em>Id. </em>at Docket 32, Consolidation Order. Plaintiff Sewright filed a complaint in this Court on February 13, 2009, one week after <em>Freidus </em>was filed. Plaintiff Diggs filed a complaint asserting similar claims on March 5, 2009 in the Southern District of New York, even though the Americas Plan provides that the Northern District of Georgia has exclusive jurisdiction over cases arising under the plan. <em>Diggs v. ING Groep N.V., </em>No. 09-cv-2038, 2009 WL 688758 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 2009). After being threatened with a motion to transfer, Diggs withdrew her action and filed here. <em>Diggs v. ING Groep N.V., </em>1:09-cv-1100, 2009 WL 3826743 (N.D.Ga. Apr. 24, 2009). Her case was consolidated with Sewright\u2019s, and plaintiffs filed an Amended Consolidated Complaint (\u201cACC\u201d) on June 8, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-7\">In the ACC, plaintiffs allege that defendants were ERISA fiduciaries pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(a)(1), or <em>defacto </em>ERISA fiduciaries within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A), and thus were bound by the duties of loyalty, exclusive purpose, and prudence. (ACC [21] at \u00b6\u00b6 222, 256, 267, 275.) Plaintiffs contend that defendants breached those duties by: (1) failing to prudently and loyally manage plans and assets, (2) failing to provide complete and accurate information to the plans\u2019 participants, (3) failing to monitor fiduciaries, and (4) failing to avoid conflicts of interest. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 220-272.) Plaintiffs also assert a claim for co-fiduciary liability. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 273-284.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-10\">Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the ACC pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Defs.\u2019 Mot. to Dismiss [34], [35].) Plaintiffs have filed a related motion to strike several exhibits to defendants\u2019 motion. (Pis.\u2019 Mot. to Strike [46].) Both of those motions are presently before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-11\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AY6\">I. <em>Motion to Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-12\">Plaintiffs move to strike exhibits J, K, L, M, N, O, P, and R to defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. (Mot. to Strike [46].) Plaintiffs request in the alternative that the Court convert defendants\u2019 motion into a motion for summary judgment and permit plaintiffs to conduct discovery. <em>(Id. </em>at 2.) Plaintiffs argue that the exhibits are not appropriate for consideration on a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because they go beyond the four corners of the complaint. <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiffs contend further that the exhibits are hearsay, and that the statements within the exhibits are double hearsay. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-13\">When deciding a motion to dismiss, the Court must limit its consideration to well-pleaded factual allegations, judicially noticed matters, and documents central to or referred to in the complaint. <em>La Grasta v. First Union Sec. Inc., </em>358 F.3d 840, 845 (11th Cir.2004). Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b) allows a court to take judicial notice of facts that are \u201c(1) generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). The Court may take judicial notice at any point in the proceeding, including during a motion to dismiss. Fed. R. Evid. 201(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">A.The Court Takes Judicial Notice of Generally Known Market Conditions During the Relevant Period: Exhibits J, K, M, N, O, and P</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">Plaintiffs concede that exhibits J, K, M, N, O, and P address generally known market conditions during the relevant time period. (Mot. to Strike [46] at 4.) Courts may take judicial notice of general economic conditions, stock prices, and market trends. <em>La Grasta, </em>358 F.3d at 842 (finding judicial notice appropriate because stock prices are \u201cnot subject to reasonable dispute\u201d). All of the referenced exhibits reflect general economic and market conditions. <em>(See </em>Mot. to Dismiss [34] at Exs. J, K, M, N, O, and P.) They are thus appropriately subject to judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-6\">Moreover, a court may consider a document that is \u201coutside the four corners of the complaint\u201d that is attached to a motion to dismiss if it is (1) \u201ccentral to the plaintiffs claim\u201d and (2) \u201cundisputed.\u201d <em>Horsley v. Feldt, 304 F.8d </em>1125, 1134 (11th Cir.2002). <em>See also Maxcess, Inc. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., </em>433 F.3d 1337, 1340 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (permitting consideration of documents outside the four corners of the complaint). Contrary to plaintiffs argument, these exhibits are central to the complaint because they show the condition of the market during the relevant time period. Accordingly, the court takes judicial notice of these exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-7\">B. The Court Takes Judicial Notice of Defendants\u2019 SEC Filings</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-8\">The remaining two exhibits, Exhibits L and R, are excerpted from publicly available SEC filings, one of which plaintiffs reference in their complaint. <em>(See </em>ACC [21] at \u00b6 140, referencing ING\u2019s Annual Report Form 20-F, attached as Ex. L to defendants\u2019 Mot. to Dismiss [34].) The Eleventh Circuit has found that \u201c[i]t is highly impractical and inconsistent with Fed. R. Evid. 201 to preclude a district court from considering [SEC] documents when faced with a motion to dismiss\u201d and when \u201cno serious question as to their authenticity can exist.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Avado Brands, Inc., </em>187 F.3d 1271, 1276-77 (11th Cir.1999) (finding that when deciding a motion to dismiss, a court may \u201cconsider public documents required by law to be and which actually have been filed with the SEC\u201d). Plaintiffs do not dispute the accuracy of any of the information in these exhibits. The Court thus takes judicial notice of this information. Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c) (\u201ca statement in a pleading may be adopted by reference ... in any other pleading or motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-9\">C. The Exhibits Are Not Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-10\">Finally, the Court rejects plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the exhibits violate the hearsay rule. As an initial matter, plaintiffs do not state specifically what statements are inadmissible hearsay. In any case, the exhibits were offered as evidence of the perception of the general condition of the marketplace during the relevant time period, and not to prove the truth of the matters asserted in the exhibits. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. 801(c) and <em>City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chem., Inc., </em>158 F.3d 548, 557 (11th Cir.1998). Even if the exhibits were hearsay, they would qualify as an exception to hearsay under Federal Rules of Evidence 803(8) (\u201c[p]ublic records and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>ports\u201d) and 803(17) (\u201c[mjarket reports, commercial publications\u201d). Fed. R. Evid. 803(8), 803(17).</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">D. The Court will not Convert the Motion to Dismiss into a Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">As indicated by the above discussion, judicially noticed matters are not \u201coutside the pleadings.\u201d <em>See Adamson v. Poorter, </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. -, -, 2007 WL 2900576, at *2 (11th Cir.2007) (noting that conversion to a motion for summary judgment is not necessary where the court \u201cproperly takes judicial notice of attached exhibits\u201d) and <em>In re Infonet Serv. Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>310 F.Supp.2d 1106, 1116 n. 10 (C.D.Cal.2003) (finding that the court did not need to convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment where the court could take judicial notice of analyst reports that gave context about the market during relevant time period). Accordingly, there is no basis for converting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. For all of these reasons, the Court DENIES the relief requested in plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Strike [46],</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-9\">II. <em>Motion to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-10\">A. Applicable Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-11\">In deciding a motion to dismiss, the Court assumes that all the allegations in the complaint are true and construes all the facts in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Scott v. Taylor, </em>405 F.3d 1251, 1253 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). That said, a complaint \u201cmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). A claim has \u201cfacial plausibility\u201d when it contains \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-15\">B. Plaintiffs Do Not Have Standing to Pursue Claims on Behalf of the ILIAC Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-16\">As a preliminary matter, plaintiffs have the burden to establish that they have standing to pursue their claims. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). In the ERISA context, standing has both a constitutional and a statutory component. To establish constitutional standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he suffered injury in fact. <em>Id. </em>at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130. To establish statutory standing, plaintiff must comply with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2), which provides that only a participant, beneficiary, fiduciary, or the Secretary of Labor has standing to pursue ERISA claims. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-17\">Plaintiffs cannot meet either of the above requirements as to the ILIAC Plan. As mentioned, plaintiffs do not allege that they were ever participants in or beneficiaries of the ILIAC Plan or even that they were employees of ILIAC, a prerequisite for participating in the ILIAC Plan. Therefore, because they were never members of the plan, they cannot establish injury in fact. <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Neither can plaintiff meet the statutory requirement limiting standing to plan participants, beneficiaries, and fiduciaries. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2). <em>See also Acosta v. Pac. Enter., </em>950 F.2d 611, 617 (9th Cir.1991) (finding that plaintiff \u201clack[ed] standing to challenge decisions affecting ERISA plans in which he d[id] not participate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-18\">Furthermore, the fact that this case is characterized as a class action does not cure the deficiency for either type of standing. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>343, 358 n. 6, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (\u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross\u201d) and <em>Prado-Steiman ex rel. Prado v. Bush, </em>221 F.3d 1266, 1280 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201ca claim cannot be asserted on behalf of a class unless at least one named plaintiff has suffered the injury that gives rise to that claim\u201d). Accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claims relating to the ILIAC Plan is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-4\">C. Plaintiffs Do Not Allege Sufficient Facts to Show that All Defendants are Fiduciaries</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-5\">Once standing has been established, the \u201cthreshold question\u201d in every ERISA breach of fiduciary duty case is \u201cwhether [the defendant] was acting as a fiduciary ... when taking the action subject to complaint.\u201d <em>Pegram v. Herdrich, </em>530 U.S. 211, 226, 120 S.Ct. 2143, 147 L.Ed.2d 164 (2000). ERISA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-6\">a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent (i) he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets, (ii) he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility to do so, or (iii) he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1410-7\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A). Defendants Burton and Smith do not meet the above definition for any of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and defendant Mclnerney does not meet the definition with respect to Counts 1 and</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-8\">1. <em>Defendants Burton and Smith are Not Fiduciaries</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-9\">In the ACC, plaintiffs vaguely allege that Burton and Smith are <em>de facto </em>fiduciaries by virtue of their exercise of discretionary authority, responsibility, or control with regard to certain aspects of the Americas Plan. (ACC [21] at \u00b6 51.) However, plaintiffs do not point to any provisions in the Plan giving Burton and Smith discretionary authority, responsibility, or control. Indeed, plaintiffs do not even generally describe the source of Burton and Smith\u2019s alleged discretionary authority, or the nature of Burton and Smith\u2019s responsibilities with respect to the Americas Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-11\">Plaintiffs allegations with respect to Burton and Smith are a classic example of a \u201cformulaic recitation [] of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949. <em>See also In re Coca-Cola Enter., ERISA Litig. (\u201cCCE\u201d), </em>2007 WL 1810211, at *12 (N.D.Ga. June 20, 2007) (Thrash, J.) (\u201cthe Complaint fails to allege that any individual [defendant held discretion in regards to the Plan or played a role in its administration solely by virtue of his role as an Officer.\u201d). Accordingly, defendants Burton and Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED as to all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-12\">2. <em>Defendant Mclnerney is Not a Fiduciary with Regard to Counts I or II</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-13\">In Counts I and II of the ACC, plaintiffs allege that defendant Mclnerney is a fiduciary because he is a member of the Executive Board of ING. (ACC [21] at \u00b6 26.) Mclnerney\u2019s position on ING\u2019s Executive Board does not, in and of itself, show that he is a plan fiduciary. <em>See CCE, </em>2007 WL 1810211, at *12 (\u201cBecause the Directors\u2019 only fiduciary responsibility was the appointment of Committee members, each of these individuals had no duty to inform Plan participants.\u201d) Plaintiffs do not allege any other basis for imposing liability on Mclnerney on Counts I and II. Accordingly the Court GRANTS Mclnerney\u2019s motion to dismiss Counts I and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>D. Count I: Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim for Failure to Prudently and Loyally Manage the Plans and Their Assets</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-5\">In Count I of the ACC, plaintiffs claim that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to \u201cprudently and loyally\u201d manage the Americas Plan and its assets. (ACC [21] at \u00b6\u00b6 220-42.) Plaintiffs bring this claim against ILIAC and the Committee defendants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 221.) The claim arises solely from defendants\u2019 decision to offer company stock as an investment option under the Americas Plan. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 220-42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-6\">1. <em>Defendants\u2019 Actions Are Presumptively Prudent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-7\">Although the Eleventh Circuit has not addressed the issue, other circuits have created a presumption of prudence standard for fiduciary duty cases which provides that investment in an employer\u2019s stock is presumed to be a prudent decision. <em>See Kuper v. Iovenko, </em>66 F.3d 1447, 1459 (6th Cir.1995) and <em>Wright v. Oregon Metallurgical Corp., </em>360 F.3d 1090, 1097 (9th Cir.2004). As the Ninth Circuit explained in <em>Wright:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-8\">Under [the prudence] standard, an EIAP fiduciary who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1411-9\">invests in employer stock is presumed to have acted consistently with ERISA; however, a plaintiff may overcome this presumption by showing that the fiduciary abused his or her discretion. To rebut the presumption, \u2018the plaintiff must show that the ERISA fiduciary could not have believed reasonably that continued adherence to the [plan\u2019s terms] was in keeping with the settlor\u2019s expectations of how a prudent trustee would operate.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1411-13\"><em>Wright, </em>360 F.3d at 1097 (quoting <em>Moench v. Robertson, </em>62 F.3d 553, 571 (3rd Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-14\">The Court does not expressly adopt the presumption of prudence/abuse of discretion standard, as articulated above. <em>See Pedraza v. Cocar-Cola Co., </em>456 F.Supp.2d 1262, 1276 (N.D.Ga.2006) (Evans, J.) (opining that the abuse of discretion part of the standard is contrary to the express provisions of ERISA). The Court nevertheless finds that, at the very least, defendants are entitled to a presumption that they acted prudently in complying with the terms of the Americas Plan and offering ING stock as an investment option. <em>Id. See also, Wright, </em>360 F.3d at 1097. Assuming the presumption of prudence applies, plaintiffs do not allege any facts sufficient to- overcome the presumption. <em>See Moench v. Robertson, </em>62 F.3d 553, 572 (3rd Cir.1995) (holding that plaintiffs can overcome the presumption of prudence if an employer is on the \u201cbrink of collapse\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, plaintiffs do not assert a \u201cfacially plausible\u201d claim of fiduciary liability in Count I of the ACC. <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-15\">2. <em>Defendants Were Not Fiduciaries</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-16\">In addition, it is apparent from the ACC that the defendants did not act as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>fiduciaries with regard to the decision to offer ING stock as an investment option. A person is an ERISA fiduciary only to the extent that he exercises, or has any, discretionary authority, control, or responsibility. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A) and <em>Cotton v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>402 F.3d 1267, 1277 (11th Cir.2005). The Americas Plan expressly required that participants be provided with the option of investing in ING stock. (Americas Plan at \u00a7 6.2(a), attached as Ex. A to Mot. to Strike <em>[34].) </em>As the ING option was mandated by the Plan, defendants cannot be liable for breach of fiduciary duty on the basis of their decision to offer ING stock. See <em>Pedraza, </em>456 F.Supp.2d at 1273-74 (\u201cWith respect to the ... choice of investment component ... no exercise of fiduciary duty was implicated. The Plan specifically required ... that Coca-Cola stock be offered as one of the choice of investment options.\u201d) and <em>CCE, </em>2007 WL 1810211, at *9 (\u201cBecause the Plan expressly establishes CCE stock as an investment option, the Committee has the discretion only to select additional investment options, not to eliminate CCE stock from the mix\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">3. <em>Defendants Did Not Have a Duty to Diversify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-5\">Even assuming that defendants were fiduciaries, they did not violate any duty under ERISA by offering ING stock as an investment option, or by failing to require that participants diversify their investments. As mentioned, the Americas Plan is an EIAP. (Americas Plan at \u00a7 11.1.) ERISA is clear that, with respect to an EIAP, \u201cthe diversification requirement ... and the prudence requirement ... [are] not violated by acquisition or holding of ... qualifying employer securities.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(2). Therefore, \u201cEIAP fiduciaries do not have a duty to diversify and do not act imprudently by not diversifying the assets of an EIAP.\u201d <em>Smith v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>422 F.Supp.2d 1310, 1325 (N.D.Ga.2006) (Evans, J.). <em>See also CCE, </em>2007 WL 1810211 at *9 and <em>Pedraza, </em>456 F.Supp.2d at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-8\">In short, the plain language of the plan required that participants be given the option of investing in ING stock. Defendants complied with this requirement, as mandated by the Plan. Their compliance did not involve the exercise of any discretion, and did not violate any duties imposed by ERISA. Moreover, their compliance is presumed to be prudent, a presumption that plaintiffs offer no allegations to rebut. Accordingly, defendants motion to dismiss the claims asserted in Count I of the ACC is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-9\">E. Count II: Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim for Failure to Provide Complete and Accurate Information to Plan Participants</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-10\">In Count II of the ACC, plaintiffs allege that the Committee defendants failed to provide complete and accurate information to plan participants and beneficiaries. (ACC [21] at \u00b6\u00b6244.) Specifically, plaintiffs claim that the Committee defendants breached their duties under ERISA by failing to warn plan participants about the potential risks associated with ING stock. (Id.) Their claim is primarily based on defendants\u2019 representations or omissions in various SEC filings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>1. <em>Representations in SEC Filings are not Actionable Under ERISA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">As a preliminary matter, representations in SEC filings are actionable not under ERISA, but rather under the securities laws. <em>See In re McKesson HBOC, Inc., </em>391 F.Supp.2d 812, 835 (N.D.Cal.2005) (\u201cparticipants do not need a remedy under ERISA to obtain relief for a fiduciary\u2019s false statements or omissions; indeed, they can invoke the securities laws\u201d). Only actions taken as a fiduciary of a plan can give rise to ERISA liability, and preparation of SEC filings is not such a discretionary act. <em>See Sutton v. Bell-South Telecomms., Inc., </em>189 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201ccorporate managerial decisions are not governed by ERISA because they do not involve discretionary acts regarding plan administration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-6\">Additionally, securities laws mandate that SEC filings be incorporated by reference into the prospectus for stock issued through an EIAP plan when employer stock is offered as an investment option.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such incorporation by reference does not give rise to liability under ERISA, however, because no defendant has any discretion in an ERISA fiduciary capacity. <em>See Kirschbaum v. Reliant Energy, Inc., </em>526 F.3d 243, 257 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhen it incorporated its SEC filings into the Forms S-8 and 10a Prospectus, [defendant] was discharging its corporate duties under the securities laws, and was not acting as an ERISA fiduciary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-9\">2. <em>Plaintiffs Fail to Allege Material Misrepresentations in SEC Filings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-10\">Assuming the SEC filings are actionable, plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged any \u201cmaterial misrepresentations\u201d in the filings. The misrepresentations alleged by plaintiffs sound in fraud. <em>See Next Century Comm\u2019ns Corp. v. Ellis, </em>318 F.3d 1023, 1030 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that the same principles apply to fraud and misrepresentation claims). Thus, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and its heightened pleading requirements apply. <em>See CCE, </em>2007 WL 1810211, at *4-6 (Rule 9(b) applies to alleged breaches of ERISA fiduciary duty to prevent \u201can impermissible fishing expedition by the Plaintiffs\u201d) and Fed. R. Crv P. 9(b) (\u201cIn alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-11\">To satisfy Rule 9(b), plaintiffs must identify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-12\">(1) precisely what statements were made in what documents or oral representations or what omissions were made, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-13\">(2) the time and place of each such statement and the person responsible for making (or, in the case of omissions, not making) same, and (3) the content of such statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiff, and (4) what the defendants obtained as a consequence of the fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1413-14\"><em>Ziemba v. Cascade Int'l, Inc., </em>256 F.3d 1194, 1202 (11th Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>tiffs do not come close to meeting this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">In the ACC, plaintiffs allege that defendants\u2019 communications were misleading for such vague reasons as: (1) ING\u2019s assets were \u201cimpaired to a much larger extent than ... disclosed\u201d and (2) the \u201cCompany\u2019s business model was not sound\u201d (ACC [21] at \u00b6\u00b6 131, 164). These statements, and others like them, do not identify any particular communications to plan participants that were allegedly false or misleading, and do not specify who made the communications or how the communications were false when made. <em>(See </em>ACC [21] at \u00b6\u00b6 128, 131, 134-36, 140-41, 145, 169,160, 163, 248-49.) Such conclusory statements do not support a claim for material misrepresentations. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crv. P. 9(b) and <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">3. <em>ERISA Does Not Mandate a Duty to Disclose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-6\">Finally, and contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 argument, ERISA does not impose an obligation to disclose broad categories of nonpublic financial information regarding publicly traded securities. <em>See Sprague v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>133 F.3d 388, 405 n. 15 (6th Cir.1998) (\u201c[W]hen Congress and the Department of Labor have carefully prescribed a detailed list of matters that must be disclosed to plan participants and beneficiaries, it ill-behooves federal judges to add. to that list\u201d) and <em>Bd. of Trustees of the CWA/ITU Negotiated Pension Plan v. Weinstein, </em>107 F.3d 139, 147 (2nd Cir.1997) (\u201cERISA does not require plaintiff Administrators to disclose actuarial valuation reports.\u201d). Plaintiffs do not allege that defendants failed to comply with any of the specific disclosure requirements of ERISA. Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot state a claim under ERISA for failure to provide complete and accurate information to plan participants. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the claims in Count II of the ACC is thus GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-7\">F. Count III: Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim for Breach of Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-8\">In Count III of the ACC, plaintiffs allege that Mclnerney and the Committee defendants breached their duty as fiduciaries by: (1) failing to monitor and (2) failing to provide adequate information to employees. (ACC [21] at \u00b6 221, 255.) For many of the same reasons discussed above, neither of these claims is viable under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-9\">1. <em>Failure to Monitor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-10\">A \u201cplaintiff cannot maintain a claim of failure to monitor when those to be monitored were acting prudently.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>422 F.Supp.2d at 1333. As discussed, defendants acted prudently as a matter of law when they offered ING stock as an investment option because they were simply adhering to the plain terms of the Americas Plan. <em>See CCE, </em>2007 WL 1810211, at *11 (\u201cBecause ... the Plan\u2019s investment in CCE stock was prudent as a matter of law ... there can be no cause of action for failure to monitor a fiduciary\u2019s conduct with respect to this investment\u201d) and <em>Pedraza, </em>456 F.Supp.2d at 1278 (holding that the committee\u2019s lack of a role in determining investment chores precluded plaintiffs\u2019 failure to monitor claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-11\">Furthermore, to prove a breach of a duty to monitor, the monitoring party must have \u201cnotice of possible misadventure\u201d by the other fiduciaries. <em>Pedraza, </em>456 F.Supp.2d at 1278 (\u201cthe duty to monitor ... is not breached without the monitoring party having \u2018notice of possible misadventure\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Newton v. Van Otterloo, </em>756 F.Supp. 1121, 1132 (N.D.Ind.1991)). However, plaintiffs never state how or when any defendant became aware of \u201cpossible misadventure\u201d by other plan fiduciaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>2. <em>Failure to Provide Adeqtiate Information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1415-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that defendants failed to provide adequate information also fails. Aside from the SEC filings mentioned above, which the Court has already found are not actionable, plaintiffs do not allege any inadequate information provided by defendants. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the claims in Count III of the ACC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-6\">G. Count IV: Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim for Failure to Avoid Conflicts of Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-7\">To state a claim for breach of the duty of loyalty based on conflicts of interest, plaintiffs must allege a specific conflict and harm resulting from the conflict. <em>See In re McKesson, </em>391 F.Supp.2d at 835 (\u201cNo case of which the court is aware has held that ERISA fiduciaries breach their duty of loyalty simply for \u2018placing themselves in a position\u2019 where they might act disloyally\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not meet either requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 conflict of interest claim is based entirely on defendants\u2019 dual roles as plan fiduciaries and corporate officers. For example, plaintiffs argue that defendants had a conflict of interest because their \u201ccompensation was directly tied to the performance of the Company and the price of Company stock.\u201d (ACC [21] at \u00b6\u00b6 189, 269) It is well-established that such dual roles do not alone create an actionable conflict of interest under ERISA. <em>See DiFelice v. U.S. Airways, Inc., </em>497 F.3d 410, 421 n. 6 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cMere officer or director status does not create an imputed breach of the duty of loyalty simply because an officer or director has an understandable interest in positive performance of company stock.\u201d) and <em>In re McKesson, </em>391 F.Supp.2d at 835 (fiduciaries must do more than simply put themselves in position to be disloyal).</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-9\">Plaintiffs similarly claim that there is a conflict of interest because defendants were motivated by a desire to \u201cincrease their salaries and incentive compensation.\u201d (ACC [21] at \u00b6 187.) However, this allegation does not support an alleged breach of a duty of loyalty under ERISA. Rather, \u201c[a]s opposed to creating a conflict, compensation in the form of company stock aligns the interests of plan fiduciaries with those of plan participants.\u201d <em>In re Huntington Bancshares, Inc., </em>620 F.Supp.2d 842, 849 n. 6 (2009). <em>See also In re Polaroid ERISA Litig., </em>362 F.Supp.2d 461, 479 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (\u201c[plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that \u2018a significant percentage of corporate Director and Executive Officer compensation is in the form of stock grants or stock option grants\u2019 is insufficient to allege a conflict of interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-10\">Neither can plaintiffs show any harm. Plaintiffs do not allege that any defendant sold the stock at an inflated price or benefitted in any other way. For this additional reason, plaintiffs\u2019 conflict of interest claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-11\">In short, because ERISA explicitly allows employers and corporate officers to be fiduciaries, plaintiff does not state a claim for a conflict of interest based solely on the fact that the plan fiduciaries were also corporate officers. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1108. There are no other allegations in the ACC to support this claim. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Count IV of the ACC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-12\">H. Count V: Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim for Co-Fiduciary Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-13\">Finally, plaintiffs allege that all defendants are liable under ERISA\u2019s co-fiduciary provision pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105. (ACC [21] at \u00b6\u00b6 274.) \u201cA primary breach must exist ... in order for there to be any liability under [ERISA\u2019s co-fiducia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>ry] provision.\u201d <em>CCE, </em>2007 WL 1810211 at *16. <em>See also Izzarelli v. Rexene Prod. Co., </em>24 F.3d 1506, 1525 n. 34 (5th Cir.1994) (holding same). Because plaintiffs have failed to state a claim of any underlying breach, the attempt to impose co-fiduciary liability fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">Furthermore, to state a claim under \u00a7 1105 for co-fiduciary liability, a plaintiff must plead that defendant possessed actual knowledge of the breach by another fiduciary. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a)(1), (3) (a fiduciary is liable for co-fiduciary liability only if he \u201cparticipates knowingly in, or knowingly undertakes to conceal, an act or omission of such other fiduciary, knowing such act or omission is a breach ... or has knowledge of a breach by such other fiduciary.\u201d). Plaintiffs state only that \u201c[e]ach [defendant knew of the breaches by the other fiduciaries,\u201d and that the defendants \u201cthrough their high ranking positions with [ING] knew or should have known that the Company\u2019s stock was an imprudent investment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 170, 172, 277.) Such conclusory statements cannot state a claim. <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949, Accordingly, the Court GRANTS defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Count V of the ACC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss [35] should be GRANTED, defendants\u2019 Motion for Leave to File Corrected Memorandum of Law [35] should be GRANTED, and plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Strike [46] should be DENIED.

After they filed their motion to dismiss, defendants filed a motion for leave to file a corrected memorandum of law in support of their motion. (Defs.\u2019 Mot. to File Corrected Memo, of Law [35].) The corrected memorandum includes an accidentally omitted table of authorities and addresses two formatting errors. <em>(Id.) </em>The Court GRANTS defendants' motion to file a corrected memorandum, and will refer to the corrected memorandum in ruling on the motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1411-10\">. The Court has already determined that this claim cannot stand against Burton, Smith, or Mclnerney, <em>see supra. </em>Also, plaintiffs bring this claim against several defendants who have not been served and Who are therefore irrelevant to the disposition of this motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1411-11\">. Several courts have rejected the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d part Of the <em>Moench </em>formula as conflicting with ERISA\u2019s statutory provisions exempting EIAP fiduciaries from liability based on over-investment in employer stock. <em>See Pedraza, </em>456 F.Supp.2d at 1276. In any case, plaintiffs do not, and cannot credibly, allege that ING was on the \u201cbrink of collapse.\u201d Plaintiffs concede that ING took measures to fortify its position in the market, and that its stock price rebounded from a low of $3.03 to $10.89 on the date that plaintiffs filed their complaint. (ACC [21] at \u00b6\u00b6 142, 145.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1412-6\">.
