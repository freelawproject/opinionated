In an action to recover for the value of materials sold and delivered, it is erroneous for the judge , to instruct the jury as a matter of law that the \u201cmaterials were delivered to the defendant,\u201d when it appears that they were not installed as a part of the plant for which they wore intended, and when the evidence upon the part of the defendant tends to show that before the materials were brought to his premises he notified the plaintiff \u201cnot to deliver them\u201d as they were \u201cnot needed\u201d and that the plaintiff said \u201call right.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-8\">On appeal from tlie Second District Court of the city of Newark.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b399-9\">Before Justices Trenchard, Parker and Minturn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-10\">For the appellant, <em>Michael J. Tansey.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-11\">For the appellee, <em>Will'mn Greenfield.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b399-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b399-13\">Trenchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX8\">This is the defendant\u2019s appeal from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff entered upon a verdict of a jury in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">The action was to recover for, first, work done, and second, for materials sold and delivered in connection with the steam heating plant in the defendant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">No doubt the motions to nonsuit and direct a verdict were properly denied. A part of the claim was for work done, and the evidence as to that presented a jury question. As we shall presently point out, the proofs upon the other branch of tfre claim likewise presented a jnry question as to that.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>But we think the charge of the court was erroneous and requires a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The defendant insisted that there was no delivery and acceptance of the materials.</p>\n<p id=\"ABB\">Of course, to recover in an action for the value of goods sold and delivered, there must be proof of delivery and acceptance. <em>Perdicaris </em>v. <em>Trenton City Bridge Co., </em>5 <em>Dutcher </em>367; <em>McNeal </em>v. <em>Braun, </em>24 <em>Vroom </em>617; <em>Lummis </em>v. <em>Millville Manufacturing Co., 43 Id. </em>25; 2 <em>Add. Cont. (Morgan\u2019s ed.), </em>\u00a7 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The learned trial judge charged the jury as a matter of law, that the materials \u201cwere delivered to\u00a1 the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">That was erroneous. The question whether there had been a delivery was, under the evidence, for the jury. The materials in question consisted of a \u201cfire pot\u201d and \u201csection\u201d of a steam boiler. The materials were never installed, and the evidence upon the part of the defendant tended to show that before the materials were brought to.his premises he caused the plaintiff to be notified \u201cnot to deliver them,\u201d as they were \u201cnot needed,\u201d and that the plaintiff said \u201cdll right.\u201d It was, therefore, erroneous for the judge to determine that question as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The judgment under review will be reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
