THE TOWNSHIP OF NEPTUNE, IN THE COUNTY OF MONMOUTH.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b196-8\">Submitted March 21, 1912</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A57\">Decided July 1, 1912.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b196-9\">.A municipal ordinance imposing license fees, which provides for a fee of $100 for express wagons or motor vehicles used in delivering express matter, and which exacts a fee of only $12 for like vehicles used in the business of delivering goods not in the express business, is discriminatory and unreasonable as against a prosecutor who is engaged in the express business.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-10\">On <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-11\">The prosecutor has procured to be allowed two writs of <em>\u25a0certiorari, </em>each removing an ordinance jmssed by the town\u25a0ship committee of the township of Neptune entitled \u201cAn 'Ordinance requiring licenses for.delivery automobiles, motor trucks, motor vehicles and express wagons, fixing fees therefor, and penalties for using the same without such licenses, in the township' of Neptune, in the county of Monmouth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-12\">The return to one of the writs sets forth the ordinance and the proceedings of the township committee in passing it. The return to the other writ shows a complaint made before a justice of the peace by the license collector of the township, charging the prosecutor with violating the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the ordinance, by engaging in the business of driving an express wagon and delivering express matter without a license from said express wagon, contrary to section 1, paragraph <em>b </em>.and section 6 of the ordinance aforesaid. Tire portions of the ordinance essential to the ease read as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-5\">\u201c1. jNo person or persons, corporation or company shall engage in or pursue the business of delivering goods, wares, merchandise or express matter into or within the township of jS'eptune unless lie, they or it shall first obtain a license and pay therefor the fee hereinafter prescribed and provided, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-6\"><em>\u2018\u2018(a)- </em>For each and every automobile, motor truck or motor vehicle used in the business of delivering goods, wares and merchandise not in the express business, the sum of twelve dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-7\"><em>'\u2018{b) </em>For each and every express wagon or motor vehicle-used in delivering express matter the sum of one hundred -.dollars. * * *.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-8\">\"T.

Lawrence.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b198-9\">Voorhees, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUd\">The return to the writ which removes^ the proceedings of the township committee, relating to the passage of the ordinance, shows no conviction or proceedings to enforce the ordinance against the prosecutor. Mo irregularities in its passage have been pointed out. Under the authority of <em>Rosencrans </em>v. Eatontown, <em>51 Vroom </em>227, the ordinance can be adjudged to be void, before conviction and before action to enforce it has terminated in a judgment, only where it appears that it is void <em>in toto. </em>The reasons assigned do not present a case of that breadth. The ordinance must stand as against this writ, which will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">The other writ presents a different problem, because the prosecutor has been convicted of a violation of the municipal by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">It is urged that the ordinance grossly discriminates between the two license fees, without reason or justification, in that it fixes $13 for a license for \u201cevery automobile, motor truck or motor vehicle used in the business of delivering goods, but not in the express business,\u201d while for every express wagon or motor vehicle used in delivering express matter a fee of $100 is exacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">Wagons and motors employed in an express business are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>burdened with a high exaction, while the same class o\u00a3 vehieles, when not engaged in the express business, escape with a nominal charge. The name of the business in which they are employed seems to be the test, while the character of the use, namely, transportation and delivery of goods, may be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The legislative warrant for imposing license fees found in chapter 285 of the laws of 1908 <em>(Comp. Stat., p. </em>3501, \u00a7 186) does not authorize the arbitra^ and oppressive distinctions here made. The law'is well settled that unwarranted discrimination in particular cases, or arbitrary charges, cannot be made by ordinances, hut that such regulations should be, as far as possible, general and impartial in their operation, and not such as to restrain trade or contravene the common right. <em>Dill. Mun. Corp., </em>\u00a7 322 <em>at seq.; Morgan </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>21 <em>Vroom </em>389; <em>Kolb </em>v. Boonton, 35 <em>Id. </em>163; other cases have been collected in 28 <em>Cyc. </em>(at <em>pp. </em>370, 750).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We are of opinion that the ordinance is not general, but in imposing a fee of $100 upon the prosecutor, while subjecting others using like vehicles for a similar end to a small fraction of that sum, is discriminatory and unreasonable, as against the prosecutor. This disposition of the case renders it unnecessary to examine the other reasons assigned for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The conviction of the prosecutor brought under review will be set.aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
