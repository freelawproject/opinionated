L. </em>1911, <em>p. </em>283, \u00a7 11), and, under section 9, a member is subject to removal if shown to be disqualified. Words spoken falsely imputing drunkenness while on duty, and unfitness for duty, to a member of such board, reflect upon his capacity, and tend to work a detriment from a pecuniary point of view by rendering his tenure precarious, and are actionable per <em>se. 25 Cyc. </em>346; <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Duff, </em>33 <em>Vroom </em>101.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">When words spoken are actionable <em>per se, </em>plaintiff is not required to introduce evidence of actual damage to entitle him to substantial damages, since in the absence of any evidence of damage the law presumes the damage. 25 <em>Cyc. </em>531.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">The case of <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1892), 1 <em>Q. B. </em>797, cited by the defendant, is not in point. There the office for which the plaintiff was said to be unfit was <em>not an office of profit, </em>and the distinction was there carefully drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">The award of substantial damages in the case at bar being justified, the judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
