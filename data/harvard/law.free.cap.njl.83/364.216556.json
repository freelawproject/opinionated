Tbougb tbe excise commissioners of tbe city Qf Oamden have discretionary power to grant or refuse licenses to sell intoxicating liquors, and though discretion means the exercising of the best of their judgment upon the occasion that calls for it, yet if this discretion be willfully abused it is criminal, and an indictment will therefore lie against such commissioners who grant or refuse such a license from corrupt and improper motives.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-7\">2.

An indictment charging the excise commissioners of the city of Oamden with misconduct in refusing a license for the sale of intoxicating liquors, which avers in effect that the defendants, with knowledge of the good character of the applicant and the fact that he had always conducted his tavern in accordance with the law, and \u201cnot regarding their duty but wrongfully and maliciously and corruptly intending to oppress, injure, hurt and aggrieve\u201d the applicant, by color of their office, did \u201ccorruptly, maliciously and unjustly\u201d refuse to grant such-license, will not be quashed upon the ground that it fails to charge any wrongful and corrupt design or intent.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-9\"><em>4. </em>The discretion to quash an indictment will 'not be exercised unless upon the clearest and plainest ground, but the defendant will be left to a demurrer, motion in arrest of judgment or writ of error.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-10\">Pour writs of <em>certiorari </em>to review indictments.

Three of them charge misconduct in granting licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors, and the fourth in refusing a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Motions are now made to quash each of them, and since they have been argued together, they will be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The principal grounds urged in support of the motions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\"><em>First. </em>That the commissioners had an absolute discretion in granting and refusing licenses, and that therefore there could be no breach of duty that would constitute a criminal offence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\"><em>Second. </em>That the indictments fail to charge any wrongful and corrupt design or intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">We grant that the defendants were vested with discretionary power to grant or refuse licenses. That is conceded by the state. But under the law this grant of discretionary power does not carry with it complete immunity from indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">With respect to licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors, the excise commissioners of the city of Camden have much the same powers as justices of the peace in England.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">In <em>Rex </em>v. Young, 1 <em>Burr. </em>556 (97 <em>Eng. Rep. Reprint </em>447), Lord Mansfield said: \u201cBut though discretion does mean (and can mean nothing else but) exercising the best of their judgment upon the occasion that calls for it; yet if this discretion be willfully abused, it is criminal, and ought to be under the control of this court.\u201d \u201cBut if it clearly appears that the justices have been partially, maliciously or corruptly influenced in the exercise of this discretion, and have (consequently) abused the trust reposed in them, they are liable to prosecution by indictment or information.\u201d Again, in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>3 <em>Id. </em>1317 (97 <em>Eng. Rep. Reprint </em>851), Lord Mansfield declared \u201cthat the court granted this information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>against the justices, not for the mere refusing to grant the licenses (which they had a discretion to grant or refuse, as they should see to be- right and proper), but for the corrupt motive of such refusal; for their oppressive and unjust refusing to grant them, because the persons applying for them would not give their votes for members of parliament as the justices would have had them.\u201d In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Hann, Id. </em>1716 (97 <em>Eng. Rep. Reprint </em>1062), Lord Mansfield again expresses himself upon this subject in the following language: \u201cThe court should never interpose against magistrates, unless they have acted from bad motives and <em>mala fide; </em>especially in such a c\u00e1se as this where they are entrusted with an absolute discretion. But, for that very reason, -this is the strongest case for the interposition of the court, if it appears that they have acted upon corrupt motives.\u201d In <em>King </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>692 (99 <em>Eng. Rep. Reprint </em>1324) : \u201cThe court were dearly of the opinion that an information should be granted against a justice as well for granting a license improperly as for refusing one in the same manner. * * * And, indeed, the mischief of granting a license improperly was infinitely greater than that of refusing one; for in the former case it might be productive of injury to the whole community, while in the latter lire grievance was felt only by tire individual. That the only ground of these applications was the improper conduct of the magistrates.\u201d In the State of New York, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>7 <em>Barb. </em>477, the court said: \u201cThe duty of-commissioners of excise in this state is extremely similar to that of justices of the peace'in England, in granting or refusing licenses to sell ale. The conduct of justices, in that respect, has frequently been the subject of investigation; and it seems clear, sajrs Mr. Russell, that though upon this matter they have a discretionary- jurisdiction given them by law, and though discretion means the-exercising the best of their judgment upon the occasion that calls for it, yet if this discretion be willfully abused, it is criminal, and under the control of the Court of King\u2019s Bench. That court will therefore grant an information against the justices who refuse, from corrupt and -improper motives, to grant such licenses, and information \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>will bo granted against them, as well for granting a license improperly, as for refusing one in the same manner.\u201d See, also, <em>King </em>v. <em>Sainsbury, </em>4 <em>T. R. </em>450 (100 <em>Eng. Rep. Reprint </em>1113); <em>King </em>v. <em>Borrow,, </em>3 <em>B. &amp; A. </em>432 (106 <em>Eng. Rep. Reprint </em>721) ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>54 <em>Barb. </em>311; <em>People </em>v. <em>Meakim, </em>133 <em>N. Y. </em>214; <em>People </em>v. <em>Worsley, </em>1 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>748.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">We conclude, therefore, that, though the excise commissioners of the city of Camden have discretionary powers to- grant or refuse licenses to sell intoxicating liquors, and though, discretion means the exercising the best of their judgment upon the occasion that calls for it, yet if this discretion be willfully abused, it is criminal, and an indictment will therefore lie against such commissioners who grant or refuse such a license from corrupt and improper motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Nor are we inclined to quash the indictments on the theory that they fail to charge any wrongful and corrupt design or intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The indictments alleging misconduct in the granting of licenses to Peier Kelly, Thomas Kelly and John Flood, respectively, each in effect set <em>forth </em>\u2014 first, that the defendants constituted the board of excise commissioners; <em>second, </em>their power to grant licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors; <em>third, </em>the application for a license; <em>fourlh, </em>the knowledge upon the part of the defendants that the applicant had \u201cpreviously violated the law relating to the sale of intoxicating liquors,\u201d and \u201cwas altogether an unfit person to be granted a license;\u201d <em>fifth, </em>that \u201cbeing minded and intending to maintain the number of inns and taverns in the city of Camden in defiance of their lawful duties\u201d and requirements of good order and government they \u201cdid iinlawfulty, wickedly, wrongfully and corruptly grant\u201d said license.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The indictment charging misconduct in refusing a license to one Leon Miller sets forth in <em>effect </em>\u2014 first, that the defendants constitute the hoard of excise commissioners; <em>second, </em>their power to grant licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors; <em>third, </em>the application for a license regular in all respects; <em>fourth, </em>the knowledge upon the part of the defendants of the good character of the applicant and the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>he had always conducted his tavern in accordance with the law; <em>fifth, </em>that \u201cnot regarding their duty but wrongfully and maliciously and corruptly intending to oppress, injure, hurt and aggrieve said Leon Miller,\u201d by color of their office, did \u201ccorruptly, maliciously and unjustly\u201d refuse to grant said license.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">It will be observed that the indictments charging misconduct in granting licenses aver that the defendants, <em>being minded and intending to maintain the number of inns and taverns in the city in defiance of their lawful duties and the requirements of good order and government, did wrongfully and corruptly </em>grant such licenses. It will also be seen that <em>the </em>indictment charging misconduct in refusing a license avers that the defendants, <em>not regarding their duty but wrongfully and maliciously and corruptly intending to oppress, injure, hurt and aggrieve the applicant, by color of their office, did corruptly, maliciously and unjustly </em>refuse to grant such license.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Surely, in the face of such averments, it cannot be said that it clearly appears that the indictments fail to charge any wrongful and corrupt design or intent. See <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Brooke, 2 T. R. </em>190, 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The rule is that the discretion to quash an indictment on motion will not be exercised unless upon the clearest and plainest ground, but the defendant will be left to a demurrer, motion in arrest of judgment, or writ of error. <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>State, </em>26 <em>Vroom </em>472; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>53 <em>Id. </em>330.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The motion to quash in each case will be denied, and the indictments will be sent to the Camden Quarter Sessions for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
