There was a reasonable inference of a negligent omission of the servant in failing to secure the rail property, deducible from the fact that it was out of the socket when the plaintiff grasped it.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">At the conclusion of the case the judge was requested to apply certain rules of law In accordance with the procedure pointed out in <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>30 <em>Vroom </em>15. In effect he refused to apply them. This was proper if they were either unsound or inapplicable to the facts in evidence. We think they were. The first and third were inapplicable, and the second, fourth and fifth were wrong in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">The judgment will he affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
