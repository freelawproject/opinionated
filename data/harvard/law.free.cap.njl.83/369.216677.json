Miller, while holding a license, continually opened his place of business before five o\u2019clock in the morning, contrary to an ordinance of the board of excise commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We are of opinion that the objections urged against the indictment are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"A05\">We have had occasion at this term, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sweeten, ante p. </em>364, to point out that, though the excise commissioners of the city of Camden have discretionary power to grant or refuse licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquor, and though discretion means the exercising of the best of their judgment upon the .occasion that calls for it, yet if this discretion be <em>willfully abused </em>it is criminal, and an indictment will therefore lie against such commissioners who refuse such a license from <em>corrupt and improper motives. </em>It follows, therefore, that anything tending to show a corrupt motive in refusing the license to Miller was material to the investigation of the complaint by the grand jury. ' If Miller had violated the ordinance relating to the sale of intoxicating liquors, it would tend to show that the action of the board in refusing him the license in question was in good faith. If, on the contrary, Miller\u2019s conduct in that regard had been blame<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>less, it would be a circumstance tending to show a corrupt motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Clearly, therefore, the testimony of the defendant to the effect that Miller, while holding his license, continually opened his place of business before live x/clock in the morning, contrary to the ordinance of the board of excise commissioners, was material to the investigation of the complaint by the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The motion to quash will be denied, and the indictment will he sent to the Camden Quarter Sessions for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
