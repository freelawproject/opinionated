The first letter reads as follows: \u201cReceiving your statement of costs in the ease of Irvin Carter, amount including settlement, $241.53, and in reply to same, beg to say, it was satisfactory with the exception of the charge for two experts, amount'$15, which the company will not allow. If you are willing to deduct this from the $241.53, kindly let me know and I will send you a release for $22(5.53.\u201d This letter does not indicate anything more than an offer to settle, based upon acceptance of terms offered. The second letter encloses a release\u2019with request to \u201chave same executed 'and return to this office and we will send you check to cover this amount.\u201d The declaration then avers that the plaintiff did accept the said sum \u201cin settlement of said claim of Irvin Carter against this defendant, and did receive from this defendant the release referred to, which release this plaintiff immediately forwarded to his principal, the said Irvin Carter, but who refuses to sign and deliver the release to this plaintiff.\u201d The pleader then proceeds to state certain legal principles which he avers entitle him upon the foregoing statement of facts to recover for Ills own use the aforesaid sum. The defendant demurred to the declaration, and the Circuit Court of the county of Burlington sustained the demurrer, and judgment final was entered which the plaintiff by this writ seeks to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">As legal conclusions set out in a pleading cannot be considered in determining its sufficiency', the only case made by the facts set out in this declaration seems to be that plaintiff was engaged to collect damages for his principal, which he compromised without the statement of any facts showing his authority to do this for his principal. In addition to this the written evidence of the compromise, as set out in the pleading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>and which must be taken as accurately setting forth the agreement <em>(Dick v. McPherson, </em>43 <em>Vroom </em>332), contains a condition precedent to be performed by the plaintiff, viz., the execution and return of the release of his principal to the defendant, the performance of which the pleader expressly negatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">This declaration is destitute of every element of good pleading, and the demurrer to it was properly sustained. The judgment under review will be. affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
