A motion lias been made to dismiss the appeal because not perfected in time; although we think the motion should prevail, yet we have considered the case upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">The state of the case settled by the judge is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-15\">\u201cNo witnesses were sworn, but the case was submitted on the admission of the attorneys for the respective parties and the records of this court in two former suits brought by defendant here against plaintiff, which were admitted in evidence by consent. In the first of those suits, defendant, who is plaintiff here, filed a set-off claiming the same amount on the same items of account set forth in his state of demand filed in this suit. Before judgment was rendered in that suit he withdrew his set-off and judgment was rendered for plaintiff therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\u201cIn the second of the former- suits mentioned defendant filed no- set-off. Those facts and records being admitted, defendant moved for a nonsuit. Pending that motion, plaintiff moved for leave to amend his state of demand by setting forth the common counts in <em>assumpsit </em>and claiming a right to recover on <em>quantum meruit </em>and <em>quantum valebat </em>the amount set forth in his state of demand made up of the same items of account. The motion to amend was granted by consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">\u201cPlaintiff then offered to prove that no- prices were agreed apon or stipulated for the work and materials mentioned in the said state of demand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">\u201cOn defendant's objection this offer was' overruled, and to the ruling plaintiff took an exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">\u201cDefendant then renewed his motion for nonsuit, and thereupon judgment of nonsuit was rendered in favor of defendant and against plaintiff, and to that\u2019 judgment plaintiff took exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The plaintiff sued for the value of painting and enameling done for the defendant, and the demand filed is in the ordinary form of an account. The grounds specified for reversal are that the nonsuit was erroneous, and that the court refused to permit the plaintiff to introduce evidence to establish his demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">The right of the defendant in an action in a District Court to discount or set-off any account or demand against the plaintiff <em>(Comp. </em>Slat., <em>p. </em>3970, \u00a7 60), has been denied to such accounts or demands as are for unliquidated damages <em>(Slaytor-Jennings Co. </em>v. <em>Paper Box </em>Co., 40 <em>Vroom </em>214), and the general rule is that only liquidated claims are the subject of \u2019 set-off. In the case\u2019 cited, it was held that by the above section of the District Court act, no different rule arose, but that it referred to claims having such characteristics as fall within the legal meaning of the term set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">If the plaintiff\u2019s claim .is of such nature and quality as permitted' it to be the subject-of set-off in the former suits, and he, as defendant in such former suits, did \u201cneglect or refuse to deliver a copy\u201d of it, he is precluded from main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>taining his present action thereon. <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>1971, \u00a7 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Without discussing any technical objections as to the order of proof, the plaintiff contends that his claim is for unliquidated damages, and therefore could not he made the subject of set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Whether a claim is of a nature connoted by the term \u201cset-off,\u201d and whether as to its liquidated or unliquidated character, capable of being the subject of set-off, is to be determined by applying the test, Will an action of <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>lie thereon ? If so, it is liquidated within the legal meaning of the word \u201cset-off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">This was settled by the Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Godkin </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>45 <em>Vroom </em>655, wherein the old ruling in <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Hann, 2 Harr </em>425, following <em>Howlet </em>v. <em>Strickland, Comp. </em>56, was approved and adopted. This is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Manifestly, the plaintiff\u2019s claim may be sued in <em>indebitatus assumpsit. </em>Chitty says (1 <em>Chit. PI. </em>318) :</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">\u201cWith respect to debts for work and labor or other personal services and for .materials used in performing the work, it is a rule that if preceded by the defendant\u2019s request, then, however special the agreement was, yet if it were not under seal, and the terms of it have been performed on the plaintiff\u2019s pari, and the remuneration was to he in money, it is not necessary to declare specially, and the common <em>\u25a0indebitatus </em>count is sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
