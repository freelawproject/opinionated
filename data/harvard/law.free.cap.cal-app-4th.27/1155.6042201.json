(Pen. Code, \u00a7 288.5.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends the trial court committed instructional and evidentiary error and that the verdicts are inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Jana G. was 11 years old at the time of trial. Her mother, Julia B., married appellant in 1987 and Jana referred to him as \u201cDad.\u201d The family lived in Dixon, Redding, Sacramento and at two different locations in Vacaville. In Vacaville appellant, Jana, her mother, grandmother and two brothers lived together from November 1989 until February 1991, when appellant moved out.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Jana testified that appellant first touched her \u201cprivate parts\u201d shortly after appellant and her mother were married, when she was seven years old. He continued to do so when they lived in Redding, Sacramento and Vacaville. The acts included rubbing her bare or clothed \u201cbottom,\u201d inserting his finger in her \u201cbottom,\u201d and rubbing, licking and inserting his finger in her vagina. She estimated that he rubbed her vagina more than 10 times. If Jana\u2019s brothers or grandmother were home, these acts would take place in appellant\u2019s locked bedroom. Otherwise, they occurred in Jana\u2019s bedroom or on the living room couch. The incidents sometimes lasted 45 minutes. Sometimes while touching her appellant would ask, \u201cAre you Daddy\u2019s girl[,]\u201d or ask if she was going to \u201ctell on him[.]\u201d On other occasions he would \u201cmake normal conversation.\u201d About five or six times he told her that if she told anyone \u201che would hurt [her] or someone else.\u201d She had seen him become violent with other family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Jana also testified that when she was three to five years old, \u201cRick,\u201d her stepfather prior to appellant, used to rub her vagina \u201ctoo hard\u201d with.his fingers while bathing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">After appellant moved out, Jana saw a television commercial about sexual abuse and told her grandmother about appellant\u2019s conduct. Prior to that time she was afraid to tell anyone because she had seen appellant push her grandmother into a closet and hurt her, and he had spanked Jana with a leather belt, leaving marks. Jana told her mother after telling her grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Jana\u2019s grandmother testified that in April 1991 Jana told her that appellant had \u201ctouched her . . . like he shouldn\u2019t have touched her, [and] that she didn\u2019t feel good about it.\u201d Shortly thereafter Jana told her mother that appellant had molested her, and her mother contacted the police. Her mother told the police that Jana said the molestation had gone on for approximately one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Officer Steven Hosking, Vacaville child abuse investigator, testified that Jana told him she was first sexually abused by appellant when they resided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>in Sacramento, and thereafter in Vacaville. She told Hosking appellant touched her buttocks and vulva, penetrated her vagina and anus, and touched her over and under her clothing. She recalled two specific incidents during the relevant time period. After police unsuccessfully attempted to interview appellant in California, he was arrested in North Carolina. After waiving his Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rights he admitted that on five or six occasions he rubbed Jana\u2019s buttocks and genitals after she approached him, lowered her clothing and complained that she had been hurt by a brother. He admitted that on one occasion he rubbed Jana\u2019s genitals, but stopped as soon as he felt himself becoming aroused.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">\n<em>The Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Appellant testified that he never molested Jana. He admitted that on one occasion while Jana was lying beside him on the couch watching a movie, he became aroused by the movie and got up. He also rubbed her buttocks when she had been kicked by a brother. He \u201c[did] not believe\u201d that he touched her bare buttocks. Appellant admitted a prior felony conviction in a \u201ccheck case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">I-III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Appellant next argues that CALJIC No. 10.42.6 was impermissibly slanted toward the prosecution. The instruction stated, in part: \u201cThe People have introduced evidence tending to prove that there are more than three acts of substantial sexual conduct or lewd and lascivious conduct upon which a conviction in Count I may be based. Defendant may be found guilty if the proof shows beyond a reasonable doubt and you unanimously agree that the defendant committed three such acts. It is not necessary that you unanimously concur on which acts constitute the required number.\u201d Appellant claims the phrase, \u201ctending to prove\u201d conveyed the impression that the court believed the evidence showed that more than three acts were committed, relieving the prosecution of its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Appellant\u2019s contention has merit. Instructing the jury that the People have introduced evidence \u201ctending to prove\u201d appellant\u2019s guilt carries the inference that the People have, in fact, established guilt. This inference would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>eliminated if the phrase \u201cfor the purpose of showing\u201d was substituted for \u201ctending to prove,\u201d so that the instruction would read: \u201cThe People have introduced evidence for the purpose of showing that there are more than three acts . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">However, an erroneous instruction requires reversal only when it appears that the error was likely to have misled the jury (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 460, 470 [110 Cal.Rptr. 906, 516 P.2d 298]), and whether an erroneous or inartfully phrased instruction misled the jury to the defendant\u2019s prejudice is determined by reviewing the instructions as a whole. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mardian </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 16, 46 [121 Cal.Rptr. 269]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 10, 20 [98 Cal.Rptr. 249].)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">In addition to the challenged instruction, the court instructed the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 2.90 that \u201c[a] defendant in a criminal action is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and in case of a reasonable doubt whether his guilt is satisfactorily shown, he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty. This presumption places upon the People the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The jury was also instructed pursuant to CALJIC No. 17.10 that \u201c[i]f you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged, you may nevertheless convict him of any lesser crime if you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of such lesser crime[,]\u201d and that its instructions should not be construed as an expression of the court\u2019s opinion on any of the facts. (CALJIC No. 17.31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In light of the entire body of instructions, it is not reasonably likely that CALJIC No. 10.42.6 misled the jury on the reasonable doubt standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">V, VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Peterson, P.
