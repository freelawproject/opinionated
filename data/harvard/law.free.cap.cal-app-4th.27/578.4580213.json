Code, \u00a7 187; count I),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> forcible rape (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2); count II), and rape in concert (\u00a7 264.1; count III). The jury found the murder occurred during commission of oral copulation and rape (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)) and defendant used a knife in committing the murder and rape (\u00a7 12022.3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant was convicted of attempted murder of the elderly man (\u00a7\u00a7 187, 664; count IV), robbery (\u00a7211; count V), and assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7245, subd. (a)(1); count VI). The jury found that the victim was a person over the age of 60 (\u00a7 1203.09).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate life term for the attempted murder, followed by a consecutive term of life without the possibility of parole for the first degree murder. A concurrent term of three years was imposed for the robbery. Sentences on the remaining counts and enhancements were stayed pursuant to section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In the published portion of this opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence enhancement for use of a deadly weapon \u201cin the commission of\u201d the rape (\u00a7 12022.3, subd. (a)) must be stricken because he did not use a deadly weapon against the victim until after he had completed his act of forcible sexual intercourse with her. As we shall explain, for the purpose of a weapon-use enhancement, the commission of rape does not end with completion of the sex act; the offense continues as long as the assailant maintains control over the victim. In reaching this conclusion, we disagree with the holding of <em>People </em>v. <em>Dobson </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 496 [252 Cal.Rptr. 423], which was followed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Funtanilla </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 326 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 875].</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">In the unpublished parts of our opinion, we find no merit in defendant\u2019s remaining contentions. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Since none of defendant\u2019s claims of error concern the convictions arising out of his offenses against the elderly man, we briefly state only the facts underlying defendant\u2019s convictions for rape, rape in concert and felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>With the assistance of Andrade, defendant orally copulated and then raped Jane G. When defendant was finished, he asked for the knife Andrade carried in a sheath on his belt. Andrade handed him the knife, and defendant stabbed the victim and slashed her throat. Defendant then walked over to where Andrade was standing and, at Andrade\u2019s request, returned the knife. After he gave Andrade the knife, defendant went to Andrade\u2019s car, which was parked nearby. Approximately five minutes later, Andrade rejoined defendant, who asked, \u201cDid you do it?\u201d Andrade replied he had stabbed the victim in the chest, and demonstrated by making a twisting motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Jane G. died several hours later. The cause of death was hemorrhage and shock resulting from multiple stab wounds. She suffered three major stab wounds: one in the abdomen, one in the chest, and one in the throat. She also had some superficial cuts on her neck, but these did not contribute to her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Defendant\u2019s theory of defense was that Andrade had inflicted the fatal wounds after the rape was completed and after defendant had returned to the car. Defendant claimed he did not intend to kill the victim and only faked cutting her throat after Andrade threatened to kill defendant if he did not kill Jane G.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">I-III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Defendant received a sentence enhancement for using a deadly weapon, i.e., a knife, in the commission of the rape. (\u00a7 12022.3, subd. (a).) Although the trial court stayed the rape sentence and weapon use enhancement pursuant to section 654, defendant contends this is insufficient,  He argues the enhancement must be stricken because the evidence establishes he did not use the knife until after he had finished raping the victim. Defendant relies primarily on <em>People </em>v. <em>Dobson, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d 496 to support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Dobson forced his victim to orally copulate him and raped her. Then he said he had to kill her because she could identify him. He used a rock and one of the victim\u2019s boots in an unsuccessful effort to beat her to death. At trial, Dobson conceded he committed the sex offenses but disputed the element of malice in the attempted murder count. He presented evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>his mental state was affected by his fatigue, overwork and drug abuse, and he claimed he lost his temper when the victim hit him. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dobson, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 499.) Dobson was convicted of attempted voluntary manslaughter, forcible rape and oral copulation, and was found to have used a deadly weapon in the commission of each offense and inflicted great bodily injury on the victim. In sentencing Dobson, the trial court imposed term enhancements for use of a deadly weapon and infliction of great bodily injury in the commission of the sexual offenses. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.3, subd. (a), 12022.8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">On appeal, Dobson claimed the enhancements should not have been imposed because his use of a deadly weapon and infliction of great bodily injury occurred solely during his later attempt to kill the victim. (205 Cal.App.3d at pp. 499-500.) The appellate court agreed, in effect determining that, where an accused uses a weapon in the commission of a nonsex offense which immediately follows a sex crime in which there was no weapon used, the weapon use does not also attach to the sex offense because that crime has been completed and the new offense has begun. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 501-502; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Funtanilla, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 326, 331.) The court noted that the completion of a sex offense has been defined narrowly to avoid the proscription of section 654 against multiple punishment for violations of the Penal Code based on the same act or occurrence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dobson, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 502.) This narrow definition permits a defendant to be punished for each separate sex act by construing each act as having been completed before the next act is begun rather than viewing the multiple acts as a continuous transaction. The <em>Dobson </em>court stated that the trial court \u201cincorrectly assumed the sex offenses were continuing at the time of the attempted manslaughter, a view contrary to the established law on this issue. To increase the scope of a sex offense here in order to increase punishment in this case would have the ultimate effect of reducing punishment in other sex offender cases because it would require the application of section 654 to such continuing conduct even though that conduct might constitute different sex offenses. Such a definition is contrary to the finiteness of the <em>act </em>contemplated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>[(1979) 23 Cal.3d 545 (153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63)] and the increased punishment deemed appropriate for the sex offender who commits multiple offenses against a single victim.\u201d (205 Cal.App.3d at pp. 502-503, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We are unpersuaded by the analysis in <em>Dobson, </em>which overstates the holding in <em>Perez </em>and overlooks the difference between the purpose of section 654 and the purpose of statutes providing sentence enhancements for use of a weapon during the commission of a felony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 59, 78 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 233, 851 P.2d 27] [a weapon-use statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\u201csimply enhances the term to be imposed for an offense,\" whereas section 654 \u201cexists to limit the number of terms which may be executed\u201d for multiple offenses]; see <em>Squaw Valley Ski Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1499, 1511 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 897] [it is a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that courts must construe statutes in context, keeping in mind their nature and purpose].)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Section 654 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn act or omission which is made punishable in different ways by different provisions of [the Penal Code] may be punished under either of such provisions, but in no case can it be punished under more than one . . . .\u201d  The purpose of this section is to ensure that a defendant\u2019s punishment is commensurate with his or her culpability. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Latimer </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1203, 1211 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 144, 858 P.2d 611].) Section 654 applies not only where there is just one act, but also where there is a course of conduct which violates more than one statute but nonetheless constitutes an indivisible transaction. (5 Cal.4th at p. 1208; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 551.) Whether a course of conduct is indivisible depends on the intent and objective of the actor. If all the offenses were incidental to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of the acts but not for more than one. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In <em>Perez, </em>the question posed was whether section 654 precludes multiple punishment for separate sex crimes committed during the same criminal venture pursuant to the same intent and objective, i.e., to obtain sexual gratification. The California Supreme Court held that multiple, separate sex crimes are not considered to be a single course of conduct under section 654 and thus each act may be punished separately. (23 Cal.3d at pp. 553-554.) The court explained that a defendant cannot escape separate punishment by claiming all of the acts were committed pursuant to a broad objective of achieving sexual gratification. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 552.) \u201cSuch an intent and objective is much too broad and amorphous to determine the applicability of section 654. Assertion of a sole intent and objective to achieve sexual gratification is akin to an assertion of a desire for wealth as the sole intent and objective in committing a series of separate thefts. To accept such a broad, overriding intent and objective to preclude punishment for otherwise clearly separate offenses would violate the statute\u2019s purpose to insure that a defendant\u2019s punishment will be commensurate with his culpability. . . . [U A defendant who attempts to achieve sexual gratification by committing a number of base criminal acts on his victim is substantially more culpable than a defendant who commits only one such act. We therefore decline to extend the single intent and objective test of section 654 beyond its purpose to preclude punishment for each such act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 552-553.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In other words, section 654 does not preclude separate punishment for multiple sex offenses which, although closely connected in time and part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>of the same criminal venture, are separate and distinct, and which are not committed as a means of committing any other sex offense, do not facilitate commission of another sex offense, and are not incidental to the commission of another sex offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 553-554; <em>People </em>v. <em>Catelli </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1434, 1446-1447 [278 Cal.Rptr. 452].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">While <em>Perez </em>held that, for the purpose of section 654, each sexual act is considered to be complete before the next sexual act begins, the opinion did not address how the temporal duration of a sex crime is to be measured for the purpose of enhanced punishment, such as the felony-murder rule or a weapon-use enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">If <em>Perez </em>is construed in the manner suggested by <em>Dobson, </em>then felony murder based upon a murder occurring in the commission of rape (\u00a7 189)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> would be eliminated except in cases where the accused killed the victim prior to withdrawing his penis because, after that point, he no longer would be engaged in the act of rape.  However, it is settled that a murder is deemed to occur in the commission of rape even after the rape is completed so long as the rape and murder are part of a continuous transaction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 348; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at pp. 949-952; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chavez </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 656, 669-670 [234 P.2d 632].) That the rape technically has been completed is irrelevant for purposes of the felony-murder doctrine. Rather, the question is whether, under the facts of the case, the relationship between the rape and the murder \u201c\u2018is sufficiently close to justify an enhanced punishment.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>at p. 951, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Fields </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 329, 365 [197 Cal.Rptr. 803, 673 P.2d 680].) This relationship may be satisfied where the culprit had control over the victim between the rape and murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>at p. 952 [a murder committed \u201calmost immediately following the rape,\u201d as the victim got up and began to walk away, constituted felony murder and supported a special circumstance allegation that the murder occurred during the commission of the rape; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 134, 171-173, 176 [266 Cal.Rptr. 309, 785 P.2d 857] [a murder committed within one or two hours after a violation of section 288 (lewd or lascivious act with a child under 14 years of age) while the victim was still under the culprit\u2019s control, either bound or locked in a trunk, constituted felony murder; \u201cdefendant\u2019s control over the victim was continuous and links the crimes\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Therefore, for the purpose of felony murder, the commission of rape may be deemed to continue so long as the culprit \u201cmaintains control over the victim.\" (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 171-172, 176; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1158, 1164-1165, fn. 7 [282 Cal.Rptr. 450, 811 P.2d 742] [a rape victim \u201cwould not agree that the crime was completed once the crime was initially committed (i.e., at the point of initial penetration)\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">We see no reason to treat the phrase \u201cin the commission of\u201d rape differently for the purpose of a weapon-use enhancement. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Heston </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 471, 479-480 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 26].) It is illogical to say that defendant murdered the victim in the present case during the commission of a rape, but that the knife\u2014the method by which defendant murdered the victim\u2014was not used in the commission of the rape. Instead, a broad construction of the phrase \u201cin the commission of\u201d advances the purpose of enhancements which provide for additional punishment when a weapon is used \u201cin the commission of\u201d a specified crime. (E.g., \u00a7 12022.3.) The purpose of these enhancements is to deter weapon use during the commission of crimes <em>(People </em>v. <em>King, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 78)\u2014which use increases the risk of physical injury to the victim (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Fierro </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 173, 226 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 426, 821 P.2d 1302]). This purpose is advanced by enhancing the penalty when a rapist uses a weapon against the victim after the sex act but while the rapist maintains control over the victim. Under these circumstances, the relationship between the rape and the weapon use is sufficiently close to justify an enhanced punishment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 951.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Hence, due to the different objectives of the statutes, a rape may be an independent \u201ctransaction\u201d for the purpose of section 654 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 551, 553-554) but, for the purpose of a weapon use enhancement, the commission of rape may continue beyond the physical completion of the act. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at pp. 949-952.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Here, immediately after raping the victim, defendant used a knife to stab her, undoubtedly to prevent her from identifying him. For the reasons stated above, this evidence establishes that defendant used a deadly weapon \u201cin the commission of\u2019 the rape within the meaning of section 12022.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">V, VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The judgment is affirmed.
