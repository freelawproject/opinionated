Allied Wheel Products, Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 47 [1 O.O.2d 190]. Mandamus is available only upon a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>State, ex rel. Haines, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 15 [58 O.O.2d 70]. Where the record contains some evidence to support their factual findings, the decision of the commission will not be disturbed. <em>State, ex rel. Humble, </em>v. <em>Mark Concepts, Inc. </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 77 [14 O.O.3d 275]. Appellant maintains that Dr. Moyes\u2019 report is not evidence that he suffers from no permanent disability. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">Dr. Moyes\u2019 report stated that appellant\u2019s disability was one percent at most and temporary in nature. Appellant argues first that these conclusions should not be considered at all because they were drawn in an examination conducted for the purpose of determining permanent <em>total </em>disability. The report, however, is couched in terms conducive to a general determination of disability. It was properly considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">In addition, appellant argues that, even if properly considered, Dr. Moyes\u2019 report is not evidence that he was not permanently disabled. This characterization, \u201c1% at most,\u201d implicitly includes zero. Although the evidence supporting the commission\u2019s conclusion appears only by way of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>ference, the law of Ohio, as stated above, requires no more. What can be inferred from Dr. Moyes\u2019 report clearly is evidence that relator was not permanently disabled. No abuse of discretion has been shown. The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b284-7\">Clifford F.

However, I must again express my disapproval with the use and dependence on the empty test of \u201csome evidence\u201d and all its related citations. (See my dissent in <em>State, ex rel. Kilburn, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>[1982], 1 Ohio St. 3d 103, at 105-106; and my concurrences in <em>State, ex rel. Berry, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>[1983], 4 Ohio St. 3d 193, at 196, and <em>State, ex rel. Paragon, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>[1983], 5 Ohio St. 3d 72, at 77.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
