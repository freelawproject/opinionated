We further concur in the board\u2019s conclusion that these violations merit an indefinite suspension from the practice of law. We are constrained to disagree, however, with the board\u2019s recommendation to the extent that it provides for a stay of respondent\u2019s suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The stay fashioned by the board and the procedural safeguards attendant thereto are not within the purview of Gov. R. V at this time. While the board correctly notes that this court has in the past approved professional probation, see <em>Stark County Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Weber </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 13 [23 O.O.2d 292], we refuse to extend <em>Weber </em>and specifically disapprove the conditional sanction imposed in that case. <em>Weber, </em>moreover, did not involve the relatively extensive supervisory procedures contained in the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">We are sensitive to the concerns that motivated the board to recommend that respondent be placed on professional probation and do not dispute the board\u2019s finding that respondent\u2019s rehabilitation has been successful. Nevertheless, the stay devised by the board with its related administrative respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>sibilities does represent a significant departure from the sanctions currently-contemplated by Gov. R. Y. The board\u2019s attempt to design a form of probationary discipline may well have merit. If a form of probationary discipline is to be adopted, however, it should be adopted formally by way of an amendment to the Supreme Court Rules for the Government of the Bar. In the absence of a formalized procedural mechanism to implement the board\u2019s recommendation, we cannot concur in the board\u2019s proposed sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Therefore, it is the judgment of this court that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b320-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
