The undisputed record evidence is otherwise. Respondent\u2019s letter to Clendenen on June 3, 1981 indicates that a $500 fee would be due <em>upon dismissal </em>of the lawsuit. However, the lawsuit was not dismissed until some time after respondent had used a portion of Clendenen\u2019s deposit for his own personal use. Moreover, after respondent used a portion of Clendenen\u2019s deposit claimed by respondent to be legal fees, respondent <em>billed </em>Clendenen for $500 in legal fees. In fact, it appears as though respondent and Clendenen became embroiled in a fee dispute which culminated with Clendenen paying $562.50 to respondent on January 4, 1982. The foregoing clearly belies any notion that a portion of the amount deposited by Clendenen into respondent\u2019s trust account on June 10, 1981 represented legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Respondent also objects to the degree of punishment recommended by the board. Respondent suggests that a public reprimand would be appropriate while relator urges that respondent be indefinitely suspended or, at a minimum, that respondent be suspended for one year. There are few ethical breaches which impact more negatively on the integrity of the legal profession than the misuse of a client\u2019s funds. As a consequence, we must reject respondent\u2019s plea for a less severe penalty. Past disciplinary proceedings would appear to indicate that the penalty for a violation of the kind committed by respondent may range from a one-year suspension to an indefinite suspension. For instance, indefinite suspensions were awarded in <em>Butler Cty. Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 48; <em>Columbus Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Pfefferle </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St. 2d 4 [19 O.O.3d 121]; <em>Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Canales </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 207 [16 O.O.3d 243]; <em>Akron Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 369 [75 O.O.2d 446]; and <em>Columbus Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Tuttle </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 183 [70 O.O.2d 341]. On the other hand, the attorneys in <em>Akron Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Jaynes </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St. 2d 276 [24 O.O.3d 363], and <em>Akron Bar Assn. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Goodlet </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St. 2d 140 [24 O.O.3d 243], were given one-year suspensions for their professional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">In this court\u2019s judgment, in view of the particular circumstances surrounding this case, the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s professional misconduct is a one-year suspension. We are satisfied that respondent\u2019s misconduct represented an isolated incident of mismanagement of his trust account. However, that does not lessen the gravity of respondent\u2019s professional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s objections to the report and recommendation of the board are overruled, the findings of the board are adopted, and respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under the provisions of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b289-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\"> Relator\u2019s complaint also alleged that respondent violated his ethical obligations when a check for legal fees drawn by respondent on his trust account and made payable to co-counsel was returned for insufficient funds after the client\u2019s award had been deposited in the account. The board made no specific finding as to that charge. We must presume from their silence that the board did not feel that respondent\u2019s conduct was a violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility. We are also constrained to concur in the board\u2019s finding in that regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
