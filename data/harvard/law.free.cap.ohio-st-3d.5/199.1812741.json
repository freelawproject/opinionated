He further asserts that the sanction sought to be imposed was not warranted by the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Upon examination of the record, it is our conclusion that the respondent\u2019s contentions must be rejected. First, although the testimony was conflicting, there was ample evidence to justify the board\u2019s findings that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4) and (6), DR 2-106, DR 2-107(A) and DR 9-101(C) of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Second, we do not agree that the sanction imposed is unduly harsh in light of the circumstances presented.
