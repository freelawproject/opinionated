Ohio E.D. No. C72-1052, unreported. Appellant concedes that the sixty-day rule was rejected on appeal in <em>Inmates </em>([C.A. 6, 1976], 541 F. 2d 633), but argues that the modification by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals should not apply in a situation where the sentence for the new intervening crime was suspended and probation granted. We find such argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">On appeal, <em>Inmates </em>declined to establish a specific time limitation for conducting a final parole revocation hearing when the parolee is arrested for committing a new crime. <em>Inmates </em>would entitle appellant to a hearing within a reasonable time after his request therefor <em>(id. </em>at 636), which in the present case was not made until June 15, 1982. Further, the nature and duration of the penalty imposed for the new crime which forms the basis for a parole revocation certainly are considerations respecting the reasonableness of time within which such hearing should be afforded. Cf. <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Daggett </em>(1976), 429 U.S. 78. In consideration of the above, the time set for the final parole revocation hearing, herein was not unreasonable or prejudicial to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals, denying the writ, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-11\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
