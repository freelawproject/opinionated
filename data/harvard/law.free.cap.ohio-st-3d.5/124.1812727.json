Respondents argue that any prejudgment interest belongs to the state, while relators maintain that the state admitted liability when it deposited the sum with the court and the interest which subsequently accrues inures to the relators, the prevailing party. We find respondents\u2019 argument well-taken and reverse the decision of the court of appeals to distribute the interest as attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">This court faced nearly the same issue in <em>State, ex rel. Home Care Pharmacy, Inc., </em>v. <em>Creasy </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 342 [21 O.O.3d 215]. There, certain pharmaceutical retailers sought a writ of mandamus to compel the payment of Medicaid reimbursements from the ODPW which had been delayed due to.-a state fiscal crisis. In addition, relators sought to compel the state to pay interest on the delayed reimbursements. We unanimously denied the writ and stated at page 344:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">i&lt;* * * &lt; &lt;&lt;pjn ^ absence of a statute requiring it * * * interest cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>adjudged against the state for delay in the payment of money.\u201d \u2019 <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 66, 67 [14 O.O.3d 269], quoting from the fourth paragraph of the syllabus in <em>State, ex rel. Parrott, </em>v. <em>Board of Public Works </em>(1881), 36 Ohio St. 409.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">While R.C. 2743.18(A)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does allow prejudgment interest to be assessed against the state, we have limited R.C. 2743.18(A) to cases arising in the Court of Claims:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u201c* * * This statute [R.C. 2743.18(A)] is part of the Court of Claims Act and is applicable only to actions brought in the Court of Claims.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">As a result, relators\u2019 argument that the state is not entitled to retain the prejudgment interest is without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals awarding the prejudgment interest to relators\u2019 attorneys as attorney\u2019s fees is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The next issue is whether the award of attorney\u2019s fees was proper in this case. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Kroeger </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 508 [21 O.O. 386], this court stated at paragraph three of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u201cIn such case [class action], a court exercising equitable jurisdiction may allow, in addition to costs between party and party, reasonable attorney fees, technically known as costs between solicitor and client, to be paid out of the fund under the control of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">The court in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Kroeger, supra, </em>at 515, further stated that the attorney who is eligible for attorney\u2019s fees is one \u201c \u2018who, at his own expense, has maintained a successful suit for the preservation, protection, and increase of a common fund or common property, or who has created at his own expense, or brought into court a fund in which others may share with him.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKtY\">In other words, where a fund has been created or preserved for the benefit of a class at the expense of one class member or a few class members, all members of the class may be required to share proportionately in the counsel fees incurred thereby. Thus, the court below had discretion whether to grant attorney\u2019s fees. However, any attorney\u2019s fees must come from the fund itself and may not be assessed against respondents in the absence of some exceptional conduct on respondents\u2019 part which would justify the imposition of attorney\u2019s fees as costs or damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">The facts of the case at bar mandate a remand to the court of appeals for a consideration of the propriety of awarding attorney\u2019s fees from the fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>created in this case. On remand, should the court of appeals determine that relators\u2019 counsel are entitled to a portion of the fund as attorney\u2019s fees, the court shall not award simply a percentage of the fund as attorney\u2019s fees, but shall award any attorney\u2019s fees solely upon a determination of the amount of reasonable compensation for the legal services rendered by counsel for relators.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Several questions must be answered by the court of appeals. The court below shall first consider the effect of the fact that the costs of this litigation were advanced to relators\u2019 counsel by the Ohio Health Care Association. Specifically, it must be determined whether the members of the class have in fact already financed this litigation through membership fees or dues in this organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">If the court below ultimately finds that attorney\u2019s fees are proper under these circumstances, the court will consider the following factors in arriving at the amount of allowable fees: (1) the time and labor involved in maintaining this litigation, (2) the novelty, complexity, and difficulty of the questions involved, (3) the professional skill required to perform the necessary legal services, (4) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys, and (5) the miscellaneous expenses of this litigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Finally, we address the court of appeal\u2019s construction of Am. Sub. H.B. Nos. 155 and 1546,111th General Assembly. That bill provided the method to compute the reasonable costs incurred by nursing homes in providing Medicaid services. The nursing homes were then reimbursed for these costs by the ODPW-administered Medicaid program. In part, the bill stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u201c(B) * * * Reimbursement for a cost of property and equipment * * * shall be on a reasonable cost basis, as follows: Facilities * * * constructed prior to and subsequently originally licensed prior to 1958 \u2014 $2.50 per available bed per day. Facilities * * * constructed and subsequently originally licensed after 1957 but prior to 1968 \u2014 $3.50 per available bed per day. Facilities * * * constructed and subsequently originally licensed January 1, 1968 and. after, $4.50 per available bed per day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The court below interpreted the phrase \u201cper available bed per day\u201d to refer to those beds occupied by Medicaid patients only. Additionally, the court construed the phrase \u201cconstructed and subsequently originally licensed\u201d to refer to the date of original licensure, not the licensure to a subsequent purchaser of the facility. We agree with both these interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">We find no merit to relators\u2019 assertion that the phrase \u201cper available bed per day\u201d means the number of beds, regardless of their occupancy by a Medicaid patient. If that were true, the state would be required to reimburse nursing homes with Medicaid money even if no services were rendered to a Medicaid patient. Contrary to relators\u2019 position, we find that the General Assembly intended that Am. Sub. H.B. Nos. 155 and 1546 only apply to beds used to render services to Medicaid patients. Accordingly, the court of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>peal\u2019s interpretation was correct and no error was committed in calculating respondents\u2019 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Relators also contend that the phrase \u201cconstructed and subsequently originally licensed\u201d should be construed to refer to the date a subsequent purchaser of the nursing home acquires a license to operate the facility. To the contrary, the bill specifically refers to <em>original </em>licensure, not any subsequent licensure. Thus it is clear that the General Assembly intended that the date of <em>original </em>licensure control for purposes of computing reimbursement under the Medicaid program. <em>Ergo, </em>the court of appeals properly construed Am. Sub. H.B. Nos. 155 and 1546 to be limited to the original licensure and not to extend to a subsequent licensure of the nursing home.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Accordingly, for the reasons expressed in this opinion, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed in part and affirmed in part, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
