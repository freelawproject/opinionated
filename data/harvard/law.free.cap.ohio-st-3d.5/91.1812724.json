Though the instant action presents what is, for this court, a novel question, the answer to this query may be readily gleaned from even the most perfunctory review of the applicable statute. Notwithstanding the fact that appellant has yet to cash the benefit checks the commission awarded her, the mere allowance of the claim forecloses her assertion of any additional legal or statutory remedies in the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">R.C. 4123.741 provides: -</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">\u201cNo employee of any employer, as defined in division (B) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code, shall be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute for any injury or occupational disease, received or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>tracted by any other employee of such employer in the course of and arising out of the latter employee\u2019s employment, or for any death resulting from such injury or occupational disease, on the condition that such injury, occupational disease, or death is found to be compensable under sections 4123.01 to 4123.94, inclusive, of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">The commission concluded that appellant\u2019s injury was \u201ccompensable\u201d under the relevant sections of the workers\u2019 compensation law. Thus, the very language of R.C. 4123.741 proscribes the maintenance and continuation of appellants\u2019 civil action against appellee. The applicable statutory provision is neither ambiguous nor confusing. It is not, therefore, this court\u2019s duty to interpret the statute; we need only apply its explicit decree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Crowl </em>v. <em>DeLuca </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 53, 58-59 [58 O.O.2d 107]; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Tressenrider </em>(1905), 72 Ohio St. 77, 90; <em>Slingluff v. Weaver </em>(1902), 66 Ohio St. 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Nonetheless, despite the straightforward wording of R.C. 4123.741, appellants insist that we indulge in alchemy to fashion an exception for those claimants who, by not negotiating their workers\u2019 compensation benefit checks, try to reject any benefits inuring from the commission\u2019s award. Appellants\u2019 argument fails for several reasons. First, appellant has indeed retained certain benefits, regardless of her refusal to cash the proffered checks, as the commission paid the medical bills which she incurred as a result of the accident. More importantly, however, the language of the statute renders her disposition of the warrants on the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund inconsequential. An injury need only be found \u201ccompensable\u201d for fellow-employee immunity to be activated. R.C. 4123.741 does not require that the claimant retain the benefits of the workers\u2019 compensation award for immunity to attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Appellants further assert that R.C. 4123.741, as applied herein, denies them access to the courts and due process of law in contravention of both the United States and Ohio Constitutions. This contention is particularly mystifying, given the fact that its very adoption would abrogate a provision of the Ohio Constitution. Section 35, Article II, thereof empowers the state to establish a fund which shall comprise the exclusive source of compensation for all injuries arising during the course of the injured worker\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the provision also grants the state authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>establish a board which shall determine the right of claimants to participate in the fund. As the commission is the body cloaked with exclusive authority to compensate workers for work-related injuries, its determination, like that in the case at bar, that an injury was occasioned during the course of the claimant\u2019s employment must \u2014 subject to the appropriate appeals process \u2014 be honored.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Appellants\u2019 real dissatisfaction, however, with the summary dismissal of their civil action does not lie in any genuine concern that their constitutional rights have been violated. What appellants actually seek is this court\u2019s approbation permitting them to assert before an administrative body that the subject injury is within its jurisdiction, argue the opposite to invoke the authority of a common-law tribunal, and then be free to pick the best offer. Our system for legal redress of injuries is not a shopping mart, however. A claimant must frequently make a binding choice between alternative forms of relief. Indeed, by electing to seek a potentially preemptive administrative remedy, appellant herein voluntarily jeopardized her right to have her claim adjudicated in a civil proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">For us to accept appellant\u2019s arguments would be to countenance duplicative, wasteful litigation. We refuse such an entreaty. This court joins with those in other jurisdictions that, faced with the same issue, have concluded that claimants enjoy no prerogative, constitutional or otherwise, to choose between workers\u2019 compensation and common-law remedies where the former has been legislatively deemed to provide the exclusive means of recovery. See <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Wagner Castings Co. </em>(1980), 81 Ill. 2d 229, 408 N. E. 2d 198; <em>Olson </em>v. <em>American Oil Co. </em>(D.N.D. 1978), 474 F. Supp. 560; <em>Kowcun </em>v. <em>Bybee </em>(1947), 182 Ore. 271, 186 P. 2d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Thus, we hold that a party who is injured as a result of a co-employee\u2019s negligent acts, who applies for benefits under Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statutes, and whose injury is found to be compensable thereunder is precluded from pursuing any additional common-law or statutory remedy against such co-employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Accordingly, \"the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, C. Brown, and J.P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b174-10\">W. Brown, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-7\"> Courts in other jurisdictions have similarly applied their fellow-employee immunity statutes.
