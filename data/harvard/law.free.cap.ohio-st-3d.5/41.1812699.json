Their motion to certify the record was denied on September 15, 1982. Upon this court\u2019s allowance of attorney Shillman\u2019s motion to certify the record in the present case, the township officials filed a brief which urged reversal of the judgment of the court of appeals. Appellees filed a motion to strike on the grounds that the parties had no standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">In overruling appellees\u2019 motion to strike, this court concludes that while the township officials are not, in fact, \u201cappellants\u201d in the instant cause, their brief may nonetheless be considered as that of <em>amici curiae. </em>See, Section 5, Rule V of the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b123-8\">Clifford F. Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMV\">Appellant argues that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>was applied in the present case so as to deny him an opportunity to raise material matters affecting the resolution of the certification issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, appellant\u2019s inability to address that issue directly results from the court of appeals\u2019 prior determination that the certification claim had <em>already </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>been litigated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the certification issue was decided improperly in the first instance, appellant\u2019s <em>res judicata </em>argument need not be considered.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The pivotal question in this litigation therefore becomes whether the certification issue was <em>ever </em>properly before the court of appeals. In order to resolve this matter, it is necessary to determine the applicability of Civ. R. 15(B) to the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Civ. R. 15(B) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u201cWhen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment. Failure to amend as provided herein does not affect the result of the trial of these issues. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">It is axiomatic that cases are to be decided on the issues actually litigated at trial. Although Civ. R. 15 allows for liberal amendment of the pleadings toward that end, the rule will only apply when, as stated therein, the amendment would \u201cconform to the evidence\u201d and when the issue is tried by either the \u201cexpress or implied consent of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">In the instant case, appellees proceeded to trial, resting their case upon the claim that one of the trustees had engaged in conduct violative of R.C. 2921.42(A)(1) and (4) and that therefore the resolutions under which Shillman was engaged were void. At no point either before, during, or after the trial did appellees seek to amend their complaint to include a charge that the resolutions were void for failure to comply with R.C. 5705.41. Although .testimony relevant to this issue was elicited by one witness,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> counsel for ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>pellees gave no indication that he planned to use such evidence to support a charge that the Shillman resolutions were void under R.C. 5705.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">This court is not convinced that appellees introduced such testimony in an effort to establish a violation of R.C. 5705.41. Indeed, appellees\u2019 reliance on R.C. 5705.41 as grounds for relief appears to be an afterthought. It was not until their motion for a new trial that appellees argued that the \u201cuncontroverted evidence\u201d showed that the township clerk had failed to certify the availability of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In rejecting that argument in its denial of appellee\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial court alluded to Civ. R. 15(B) and specifically stated that it did not consider the certification issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In view of the scant testimony admitted on this issue and the trial court\u2019s explicit statement that it did not consider the issue, it can only be concluded that certification was <em>not </em>an issue in the case until the court of appeals rendered its opinion. Any amendment made at that time, therefore, was not one \u201cto conform the pleadings to the proof,\u201d but was to inject a new and different issue as to which different and additional evidence would have been relevant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">It can be argued that since appellant did not object to the introduction of the testimony relating to the certification issue, that such issue was tried by his implied consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">An implied amendment of the pleadings will not be permitted, however, where it results in substantial prejudice to a party. See <em>Head </em>v. <em>Timken Roller Bearing Co. </em>(C.A. 6, 1973), 486 F. 2d 870; <em>Dozier </em>v. <em>Chupka </em>(S.D. Ohio E.D. 1975), 395 F. Supp. 836. See, generally, 6 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure (1971), Section 1493 and 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice (1978), Paragraph 15.13[2], which interpret Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Various factors to be considered in determining whether the parties impliedly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>sented to litigate an issue include: whether they recognized that an unpleaded issue entered the case <em>(e.g., Parsons </em>v. <em>Doctors for Emergency Services </em>[D. Del. 1979], 81 F.R.D. 660); whether the opposing party had a fair opportunity to address the tendered issue or would offer additional evidence if the case were to be retried on a different theory <em>(e.g., Monod </em>v. <em>Futura, Inc. </em>[C.A. 10, 1969], 415 F. 2d 1170; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. </em>[C.A. 10, 1979], 609 F. 2d 436); and whether the witnesses were subjected to extensive cross-examination on the issue <em>(e.g., In re Ace Sales Co. </em>[E.D. Mo. E.D. 1973], 357 F. Supp. 936).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Under Civ. R. 15(B), implied consent is not established merely because evidence bearing directly on an unpleaded issue is introduced without objection. Rather, it must appear that the parties understood the evidence was aimed at the unpleaded issue. <em>MBI Motor Company, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lotus/East, Inc. </em>(C.A. 6, 1974), 506 F. 2d 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">As previously stated, we find nothing in the record from which it can be inferred that any party or the trial court regarded the issue as one then being tried: the issue was first brought to the attention of the trial court in appellees\u2019 motion for a new trial; in denying that motion, the trial court specifically stated it did not consider the certification issue, and appellant failed to present any of the testimony and exhibits ultimately offered on remand or any of the arguments and authorities subsequently set forth in this appeal to show the inapplicability of R.C. 5705.41 to his employment. Under the circumstances, appellant cannot realistically be said to have given his implied consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">In conclusion, we note that the implication of Civ. R. 15(B) is that a trial court may not base its decision upon an issue which was tried inadvertently. Whether an unpleaded issue is tried by implied consent is to be determined by the trial court, whose finding will not be disturbed, absent showing of an abuse of discretion. See <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Newman </em>(C.A. 6, 1957), 243 F. 2d 804. In view of the trial court\u2019s explicit explanation that the unpleaded issue of certification was not, in fact, considered, the court of appeals clearly exceeded its authority in reversing the trial court\u2019s dismissal of appellees\u2019 complaint.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the court of appeals is reversed and the original judgment of the trial court dismissing appellees\u2019 complaint is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b127-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
