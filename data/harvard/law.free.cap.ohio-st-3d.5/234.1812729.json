In <em>Huff, </em>this court did not decide the issue of whether an attorney is an officer of the court for the purpose of providing \u201c* * * all papers and property to which the client is entitled * * *\u201d (DR 2-110), and thus amenable to an action in mandamus. We need not reach that issue in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
