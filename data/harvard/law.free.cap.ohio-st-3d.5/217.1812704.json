Such authentication and supervision is accomplished through the continuing jurisdiction of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Then, in <em>Cherry </em>v. <em>Cherry </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 348 [20 O.O.3d 318], this court stated at page 355:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">\u201c* * * A trial court must have discretion to do what is equitable upon the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">\u201cOf course, a trial court\u2019s discretion, though broad, is not unlimited. A reviewing court may modify or reverse a property division, if it finds that the trial court abused its discretion in dividing the property as it did. Section 3 (B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution; App. R. 12.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">The issue before us in this cause is whether the court of appeals was correct in reinstating the sustenance alimony payments terminated by the trial court. Stated differently, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in terminating alimony payments to the appellee in the modification decision of March 20, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">A trial court in any domestic relations action has broad discretion in fashioning an equitable division of marital property, <em>Berish </em>v. <em>Berish </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 318 [23 O.O.3d 296]; and when appropriate, in awarding alimony based on need. <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Wolfe, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-16\">In the instant case, the court of appeals did not apply the proper standard of review in reversing the trial court\u2019s termination of sustenance alimony payments. The trial court\u2019s judgment cannot be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Koegel </em>v. <em>Koegel </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 355, at 357 [23 O.O.3d 320]; <em>Cherry </em>v. <em>Cherry, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>at 355; <em>Berish, supra, </em>at 319. See, also, <em>Dennison </em>v. <em>Dennison </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 146, 150 [59 O.O. 210].</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d was defined by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 151, 157 [16 O.O.3d 169]:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>Steiner </em>v. <em>Custer </em>(1940), 137 Ohio St. 448 [19 O.O. 148]; <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Conner </em>(1959), 170 Ohio St. 85 [9 O.O.2d 480]; <em>Chester Township </em>v. <em>Geauga Co. Budget Comm. </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 372 [2 O.O.2d 484].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Although <em>Adams </em>dealt with \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d in a criminal law context, our citation of <em>Conner </em>implies that the term has the same meaning when applied in a domestic relations context.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The appellate court in the instant case was incorrect in substituting its judgment for that of the trial court. Given the evidence in the record that was carefully reviewed by the trial judge, we cannot find that the decision to terminate sustenance alimony to appellee was either unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The trial judge in the case <em>sub judice </em>found sufficient changed circumstances which he believed justified a termination of sustenance alimony payments, when he made his specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. In particular, with reference to the factors enumerated in R.C. 3105.18,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial judge found that appellee had acquired employment at an annual salary of approximately $11,500 per year with fringe benefits such as medical insurance and a pension plan; that she had sold the marital home and obtained a profit which enabled her to purchase a new home free of mortgages or en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>cumbrances; that she was able to loan a friend $2,100; that she had at the time of the hearing, $47,000 in various bank accounts; and that she was netting a little in excess of $7,000 per year on rents from a parking lot that she received in the original property settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Taking into account all of these factors, the trial judge held that \u201c[appellee\u2019s] income exclusive of the alimony payments exceeds her needs by her own testimony.\u201d These changed circumstances stand in stark contrast to the situation the appellee confronted at the time of the divorce, when she was suffering from mental and emotional difficulties, was unemployed and was in need of alimony payments to at least meet her expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">In <em>Wolfe, </em>this court declined to set up a rule whereby post-divorce unchastity, standing alone, would be sufficient grounds to terminate sustenance alimony. By the same token, by holding that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in terminating the sustenance alimony payments, we are not suggesting that the acquisition of gainful employment automatically eliminates the need for sustenance alimony. However, it is a factor which could and should be considered in a modification or termination proceeding. As we noted in <em>Cherry, supra, </em>at 355:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u201c* * * it is ill-advised and impossible for any court to set down a flat rule concerning property division upon divorce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Similarly, we find it ill-advised to set down a <em>per se </em>rule concerning spousal employment with respect to an alimony modification proceeding. In addition, our decision today should not be interpreted as a foreclosure to appellee for any possible reinstatement of alimony in the future. Under the continuing jurisdiction of the trial court, the appellee can move to reinstate the alimony upon proper pleading and proof of need therein. <em>Wolfe, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Taking into account the totality of circumstances as contained in the record, along with the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth by the trial judge, we hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in terminating the alimony payments in the modification proceeding below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Therefore the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Celebrezze, C.J., Patton, Locher, Holmes, C.
