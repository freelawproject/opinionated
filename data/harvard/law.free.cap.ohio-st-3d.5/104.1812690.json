Moreover, the materials submitted herein by relator reflect that his request to respondent was for a transcript of his revocation proceedings. Furnishing a copy of such transcript, if any, of parole revocation proceedings is not set out as among the minimal due process requirements of <em>Morrissey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">Thus, relator has not shown a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, and the writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b184-16\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
