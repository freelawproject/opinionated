We do not have jurisdiction to review that determination. <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005). The BIA rejected Runtu\u2019s request for withholding because the Immigration Judge found that his testimony of past persecution was not credible. The determination that Runtu was not a credible witness is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">However, neither the BIA nor the IJ addressed Runtu\u2019s alternative argument, which he claims is supported by various institutional reports and news articles, that there is a pattern or practice in Indonesia of persecuting Christians. Runtu\u2019s credibility is not relevant to the question of whether the information contained in those reports is accurate or sufficient to satisfy the high burden of demonstrating that a Christian is more likely than not to face persecution on return to Indonesia. For that reason, we grant Runtu\u2019s petition for review with respect to the withholding of removal claim based on a pattern or practice of persecution. On remand, the BIA should address the limited question of whether Runtu has satisfied the requirements of 8 C.F.R. 208.16(b)(2)(i)-(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART, GRANTED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
