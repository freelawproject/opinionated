Delgado also argues that the BIA erred in denying her protection under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legal determinations of the BIA, and factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). Under the substantial evidence test, we affirm the BIA\u2019s findings of fact unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">Based upon review of the record and the briefs of the parties, we find that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Delgado failed to establish that she was entitled to asylum. Delgado did not establish that she was qualified for asylum based on past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. She was also unable to establish her entitlement to withholding of removal or CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
