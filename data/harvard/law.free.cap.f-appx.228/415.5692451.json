He also moves for the appointment of counsel. With the benefit of liberal construction, he argues that his continued detention is unlawful under <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001), that there is no reasonable likelihood of his removal in the foreseeable future, and that the district court erroneously denied his request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Zadvydas, </em>533 U.S. at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491, that it is presumptively constitutional for an alien to be detained for six months after a final order of removal. The Court created no specific limits on detention, however, because \u2018\u201can alien may be held in confinement until it has been determined that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>An alien must provide good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal, and the Government must then respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">Adefemi has remained in custody following the final judicial review of his removal order on September 28, 2004. <em>See Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1024 (11th Cir.2004)(en banc). The Government presented evidence that Adefemi\u2019s removal was imminent in January 2006 when it obtained travel documents from the Nigerian government. It was unable to remove Adefemi, however, because Adefemi had moved to reopen his immigration proceedings, and the Bureau of Immigration Appeals had granted his request to stay the removal. The Government presented evidence that travel documents would be reissued upon completion of the immigration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">Based on the current appellate record, Adefemi has failed to show good reason to believe that there is no likelihood of his removal. <em>See Zadvydas, </em>533 U.S. at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491; <em>cf. Demore v. Kim, </em>538 U.S. 510, 531, 123 S.Ct. 1708, 155 L.Ed.2d 724 (2003). We note that Adefemi\u2019s immigration proceedings, which have since been reopened, remain ongoing and that he has presented alleged new evidence along with his reply brief purporting to show that the Nigerian government will not issue travel documents for his repatriation. This court does not receive new evidence, however, and we do not ordinarily review new arguments raised in a reply brief. <em>See Cavallini v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>44 F.3d 256, 260 n. 9 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Flores, </em>887 F.2d 543, 546 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Strain v. Harrelson Rubber Co., </em>742 F.2d 888, 889 n. 2 (5th Cir.1984). Ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>femi remains free to file a new \u00a7 2241 petition should he develop good reason to believe, in light of changed circumstances or new evidence, that his removal is not likely in the reasonably foreseeable future. Adefemi\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">AFFIRMED. MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
