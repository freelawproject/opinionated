We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir.2004) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Kourouma\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We retain jurisdiction, however, to consider the denial of Kourouma\u2019s request for withholding of removal. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2006). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that [s]he faces a clear probability of persecution because of h[er] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s holding that Kourouma failed to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\"> Kourouma does not challenge in this appeal the denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture, and therefore has abandoned that claim. <em>Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 326 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
