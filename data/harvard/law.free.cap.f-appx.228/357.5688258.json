She appeals, claiming, first, that the district court improperly admitted certain hearsay evidence, and second, that the district court failed to exercise its discretion in imposing a sentence under the now-advisory sentencing guidelines. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Oladapo\u2019s conviction but vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">The evidence presented at Oladapo\u2019s trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, <em>see United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 854 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc), was as follows. In April 2004, the United States Postal Service began an investigation of stolen bulk mail, including bank documents, credit cards, and credit convenience checks. The investigation focused on Oladapo\u2019s husband Kehinde Oladapo because he worked for Southwest Airlines at its cargo warehouse located at BWI airport\u2014which investigators had determined to be the source of the stolen mail\u2014and he had a documented pattern of using Express Mail from the BWI post office to mail small, lightweight packages. The packages were addressed to two different addresses in New York and each had fake return addresses on the labels. Based upon this evidence, a search warrant was issued for the Oladapo residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-18\">Evidence seized during the search of the Oladapos\u2019 home included four stolen Shell Oil Company credit cards, a stolen Citgo credit card, Express Mail receipts, several receipts for money orders made payable to \u201cShola Oladapo\u201d; and a daily planner that had an entry for \u201cBabayemi Babatayo, 2501 Nostrand Avenue, Number 3G, Brooklyn, New York, 11210.\u201d Postal Inspector Mark Carr testified that this was the name and address used on many of the Express Mail packages that were later found to contain hundreds of stolen credit cards and checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Claudette Moser, a fraud investigator for Citigroup Investigative Services, testified that, based upon notations on the account statement made by the cardholder, one of the Shell Oil cards was used without the cardholder\u2019s authorization.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over Oladapo\u2019s objection, the account statement was shown to the jury, with the customer\u2019s handwritten annotation disputing the charges. Finally, again over Oladapo\u2019s objection, Moser testified that based on her investigation into Kehinde\u2019s work schedule, the charges were made while he was at work (thus implicating Oladapo). Oladapo objected to the introduction of Kehinde\u2019s work records because Moser was not employed by Southwest Airlines and, therefore, she was not the appropriate witness to introduce those documents. The district court overruled her objection, noting that Moser \u201chas the requisite background,\u201d and that counsel would have the opportunity to cross-examine for any inaccuracies.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The Government also introduced the testimony of a postal clerk who stated that, over the course of a four-year period, Oladapo sent and received Express Mail envelopes at least once per week. Finally, cooperating co-defendants Odukale and Sogbesan testified as to Kehinde and Oladapo\u2019s participation in the stolen check and credit card operation. Odukale testified that he sent money orders to Oladapo as payment for stolen checks and credit cards that she had mailed to New York, and also as payment for profits made on those cards. Sogbesan testified that Kehinde provided Oladapo with stolen checks and credit cards to mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Based on this evidence, the jury convicted Oladapo of one count of possession of stolen mail (count 3). The district court sentenced her to sixty months imprisonment\u2014the statutory maximum. Oladapo timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Oladapo argues, first, that the district court erred in admitting, through Moser and Inspector Carr, the Shell cardholder\u2019s handwritten notation and Kehinde\u2019s employment attendance records. This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision as to the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion and will not find an abuse unless a decision was \u201carbitrary and irrational.\u201d <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>282 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002). We find that both the handwritten notation on the Shell statement and Kehinde\u2019s employment attendance records satisfy the criteria for the business records exception to the hearsay rule provided by Fed.R.Evid. 803(6). The district court properly found that Moser was qualified to testify as to the results of her investigation of unauthorized use of stolen Citibank credit cards. Oladapo does not challenge the authenticity of the documents at issue\u2014indeed, the parties stipulated that the documents were authentic. Moreover, Oladapo\u2019s attorney was able to cross-examine both witnesses. In any event, any error in admitting the evidence was harmless in light of the independent and overwhelming evidence of Oladapo\u2019s guilt. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 558 (4th Cir.1998) (noting that \u201cimproper admission of evidence which is cumulative of matters shown by admissible evidence is harmless error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Next, Oladapo challenges the sentence imposed, arguing that the district court judge did not exercise his discretion to impose a sentence outside of the advisory guidelines range. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Oladapo\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 188-235 months imprisonment. However, because the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction is sixty months, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>became the guidelines sentence. After Oladapo\u2019s attorney argued for a below-guidelines sentence, citing her family obligations (Oladapo and Kehinde have two young children), and relatively minor role in the conspiracy, the district court made the following concluding statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">This is a case in which I am looking at sentencing guidelines that are not binding but are advisory. I\u2019m looking at a crime that is, in the global sense, very serious....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">If I look at the guidelines, there\u2019s two ways to look at the guidelines. I mean, the guideline sentence is 60 months because that\u2019s the statutory maximum. The guideline sentence would be way above 60 months without that statutory maximum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">I\u2019ve got to come to this conclusion. I have a case that\u2019s subject to appeal by either side. I do not believe that the Fourth Circuit would affirm a deviation from the guidelines here. I do not think that the Fourth Circuit would find it reasonable or would allow me to find it reasonable to deviate from the guidelines in a case where the guidelines sentence is something like 15 years, or something like that. I think I would deviate from that. I certainly would. I certainly did in the case of Mr. Oladapo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">I want the record to be clear. If the Fourth Circuit is going to review this on appeal, <em>they should know that, in my judgment, I believe that it could be reasonable to deviate from the guidelines and to reduce the sentence somewhat. But I don\u2019t think they would affirm it. </em>And I don\u2019t think it is appropriate for me to do something that I honestly believe they will not affirm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">So, I think I\u2019m required to, and I will have to, impose the sentence of 60 months that is the guideline sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court reviews a district court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cConsistent with the remedial scheme set forth in <em>[Booker </em>], a district court shall first calculate (after making the appropriate findings of fact) the range prescribed by the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546. Next, the district court must consider this range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a) and impose a sentence. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47 (citations omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">A <em>post-Booker </em>sentence may be unreasonable for procedural and substantive reasons. \u201cA sentence may be proeedurally unreasonable, for example, if the district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons or fails to make a necessary factual finding.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.) (citations omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). While a district court must consider the various factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and explain its sentence, it need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. \u201cThis is particularly the case when the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>court imposes a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">However, \u201ca district court\u2019s explanation should provide some indication (1) that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with respect to the particular defendant; and (2) that it has also considered the potentially meritorious arguments raised by both parties about sentencing.\u201d <em>Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d at 380 (citations omitted). \u201c[I]n determining whether there has been an adequate explanation, [the Court does] not evaluate a court\u2019s sentencing statements in a vacuum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381. Rather, \u201c[t]he context surrounding a district court\u2019s explanation may imbue it with enough content for [the Court] to evaluate both whether the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and whether it did so properly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">On the record before us, we are unable to discern whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or whether it did so properly. Accordingly, although we affirm Oladapo\u2019s conviction, we vacate her sentence and remand for resentencing in order to allow the district court to articulate its reasons for imposing sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\">. The Shell Oil credit cards were issued by Citibank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\"><em>. </em>We note that the district court sentenced Oladapo prior to our decisions in <em>Moreland, Johnson, </em>and <em>Montes-Pineda, </em>and thus did not have the benefit of the guidance provided by those cases. We further note that the district court is free on remand to impose the same sentence or a different one; nothing in this opinion should be read to suggest that we have formed any view regarding the appropriate outcome of Oladapo\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
