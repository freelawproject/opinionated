In our <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s ruling, we first resolve all issues of material fact in favor of the plaintiff, and then proceed to the legal question of whether the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity under his version of the facts. <em>Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1190 (11th Cir.2002). Under Manning\u2019s version of the relevant facts, Clark and Pangle \u201cjimmied\u201d the front lock of his house and searched the premises without a warrant, and in the absence of any exigent circumstances. If proven at trial, these facts would compel the conclusion that Clark and Pangle, acting in a discretionary capacity, committed a \u201cclearly established\u201d constitutional violation, <em>Crosby v. Monroe County, </em>394 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.2004). Therefore, they are not entitled to qualified immunity and the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AzZ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
