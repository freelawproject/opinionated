Blackman appeals. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-23\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b438-24\">Blackman, a pro se litigant, filed suit against Global Industries Offshore (\u201cGlobal\u201d) in 2005 alleging wrongful termination based on numerous state and federal grounds, among them, sexual harassment, race and age discrimination. After an investigation, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) concluded that Blackman, who was a lift boat employee, was discharged when Global terminated all of its lift boat employees because it sold its lift boat division.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-25\">On September 9, 2005, Blackman filed a Motion for Appointment of Counsel. <em>Although </em>he did not specify the statutory provision under which he was applying, the Magistrate Judge interpreted his motion as being filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>5(f)(1), which provides for appointment of counsel in Title VII suits \u201cin such circumstances as the court may deem just.\u201d On June 21, 2006, the district court denied Blackman\u2019s motion, holding that he was not entitled to appointment of counsel under either \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) or 28 U.SC. \u00a7 1915(e)(1) (providing for appointment of counsel in proceedings in forma pauperis). Blackman appeals the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">We review for abuse of discretion the refusal to appoint counsel for a Title VII plaintiff. <em>Jackson v. Dallas Police Dep\u2019t, </em>811 F.2d 260, 261 (5th Cir.1986). The district court should consider \u201c(1) the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claims of discrimination; (2) the efforts taken by the plaintiff to obtain counsel; and (3) the plaintiffs financial ability to retain counsel.\u201d <em>Id. Gonzalez v. Carlin, </em>907 F.2d 573, 580 (5th Cir.1990) (citing <em>Caston v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>556 F.2d 1305, 1309 (5th Cir.1977)). No one factor is conclusive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">It is well-established that \u201cpro se complaints are held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d <em>Miller v. Stanmore, </em>636 F.2d 986, 988 (5th Cir. Unit A Feb.1981). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1), the court may appoint an attorney to represent a litigant in federal court. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). In evaluating whether the appointment of counsel is proper, the district court considers the type and complexity of the case, the litigant\u2019s ability to investigate and present the case, and the level of skill required to present the evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 213. We review the denial of appointment of counsel under \u00a7 1915(e)(1) for abuse of discretion. <em>See Jackson, </em>811 F.2d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that Blackman failed the \u201cmerits\u201d prong of the \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) test for appointment of counsel in a Title VII case was not an abuse of discretion. We find appellant\u2019s arguments that the EEOC investigation file is incomplete and that it did not conduct a full investigation to be without merit in regard to his appointment of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Although Global argues that Blackman failed to raise his \u00a7 1915(e)(1) in pauperis claim below, we nevertheless consider the claim because of the \u201cless stringent standards\u201d governing pro se appeals, because Blackman, in his September 9, 2005 letter to the court, did not specify which statutory provision he was relying on for his request, and because the district court considered the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">In <em>Romero v. Becken, </em>256 F.3d 349, 354 (5th Cir.2001), this court upheld the denial of a \u00a7 1915(e)(1) in pauperis claim because it agreed, after a review of the record, with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff had the present \u201cability to investigate and present the case.\u201d Similarly, here, the district court found that Black-man is \u201ccapable of articulating his claims and adequately representing his interests in this case.\u201d After reviewing the record, we likewise agree with the district court\u2019s assessment and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Blackman\u2019s \u00a7 1915(e)(1) in pauperis claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
