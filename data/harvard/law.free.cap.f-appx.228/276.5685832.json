Horne\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), acknowledging the absence of any meritorious issues for appeal,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but questioning whether the district court erred in failing to impose a sentence below the guideline range. Horne was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not file one.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">In sentencing a defendant after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court must calculate the advisory guideline range and then consider whether that range \u201cserves the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 3553(a) [West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006] and, if not, select a sentence that does serves those factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). This court reviews a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence \u201cto determine whether the sentence is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-23\">Here, Horne\u2019s concurrent 168-month prison sentences fall within the statutorily prescribed range of ten years to life, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), and within the properly calculated guideline range of 160 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. In sentencing Horne, the district court considered the advisory guidelines, the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and the arguments of Horne\u2019s counsel for a sentence below the guideline range. Our review of the record convinces us that Horne has faded to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded to sentences within the properly calculated guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-24\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Horne\u2019s convictions and sentences. This court requires that counsel inform Horne, in writing, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Horne requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Horne. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-13\"> Although counsel notes that there is a waiver contained in Horne\u2019s plea agreement, the government does not seek to enforce the waiver. Because the government has not relied on the waiver provision to assert that appellate review is precluded, the waiver does not bar Horne\u2019s appeal. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
