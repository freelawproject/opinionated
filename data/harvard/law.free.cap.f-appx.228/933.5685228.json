Lara argues on appeal, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court failed to consider properly the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, fashioned a sentence that is greater than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing, and imposed an unreasonable sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\"><em>Post-Booker, </em>we have established a two-part process for district courts to use in sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 786. First, the district court must consult and correctly determine the advisory guidelines range set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>Second, the district court must impose a reasonable sentence by considering the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>Included among the \u00a7 3553(a) factors are (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (4) the need for deterrence; (5) the need to protect the public; (6) the Sentencing Guidelines range; and (7) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). However, the district court is not required \u201cto state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">Upon review of the record and the sentencing hearing transcript, and consideration of the briefs filed by both parties, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">First, there is no dispute on appeal that the district court correctly computed the advisory guidelines range. Second, the district court listened to Lara\u2019s arguments regarding his background and reasons for re-entering the United States. The district court stated that it had considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court was not required to address separately each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, even though it addressed some of them. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">Third, Lara\u2019s 70-month sentence is at the low end of the advisory guidelines range and well within the statutory maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Although the district court acknowledged that Lara had a unique immigration status, no ties to Mexico, and that sending him to Mexico would be like sending him to a foreign country, the district court also acknowledged the seriousness of Lara\u2019s lengthy criminal history, which is a proper factor to consider under \u00a7 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Moreover, Lara\u2019s argument that the district court gave too much weight to his criminal history is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-14\">In sum, we conclude that Lara has not shown that his 70-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-18\">. According to Lara, his first name is properly spelled \"Rolando.\u201d However, we use the incorrect spelling \"Ronaldo\u201d since it is the name used throughout the record and the parties\u2019 briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b962-6\">. Although Lara objected in the district court to his criminal history category and requested a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, he does not raise these issues in his brief. Therefore, we deem them abandoned. <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
