Carter argues that the ALJ failed to review an unsworn statement of a coworker and contends that the district court erred when it found that the ALJ implicitly determined that the statement was <em>not </em>credible. Because the denial of Carter\u2019s application for supplemental security income was supported by substantial evidence and the ALJ applied the correct legal standards, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">Carter filed an application for disability insurance and supplemental security income benefits on April 21, 2003, and alleged that he became disabled on April 2, 2003, because of coronary vascular disease. At the hearing before the ALJ, Carter testified that he had a heart condition that caused him to have high blood pressure resulting in dizzy spells, shortness of breath, heart racing, chest pain, lightheadedness, and extreme fatigue. Carter also submitted into the record an unsworn statement from Terrie S. Culver, who worked with Carter at the Pierce County Department of Family and Children\u2019s Services, where Carter was required to work as a recipient of benefits from the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program. Culver\u2019s unsworn statement of one paragraph repeated Carter\u2019s complaints of \u201cphysical ailments as he suffers problems with breathing and reports to us chest pain that has required him to leave and seek medical attention.\u201d Culver stated that Carter had been \u201cunable to attend work [at their] site on some days due to having medical problems associated with his heart condition.\u201d After reviewing the evidence, the ALJ concluded that Carter retained the residual functional capacity to perform light work and found Carter not disabled. The ALJ stated in his decision that he considered Carter\u2019s subjective allegations of disability, but found the allegations only partially credible. In making his findings, the ALJ stated that he had carefully considered the entire record.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">Carter commenced an action in the district court and alleged that the ALJ improperly denied Carter\u2019s claim for disability benefits. Carter argued that the ALJ erred when it failed to consider Culver\u2019s unsworn statement. The district court concluded that, because Culver\u2019s statement duplicated Carter\u2019s subjective testimony, the ALJ implicitly considered and discredited Culver\u2019s statement in his ultimate finding of no disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>We review a social security appeal to determine whether the decision of the ALJ is supported by substantial evidence and whether the ALJ applied the correct legal standards. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Crawford v. Com/m\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as the reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Walden v. Schweiker, </em>672 F.2d 835, 838 (11th Cir.1982). We review <em>de novo </em>the decision of the district court regarding whether substantial evidence supports the findings of the ALJ. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The district court did not err when it concluded that the ALJ implicitly determined that Culver\u2019s unsworn statement was not credible. \u201c[T]here is no rigid requirement that the ALJ specifically refer to every piece of evidence in his decision.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005). We do not require an explicit finding about credibility; instead findings may be by implication if they are \u201cobvious to the reviewing court.\u201d <em>See Tieniber v. Heckler, </em>720 F.2d 1251, 1255 (11th Cir.1983). Because Culver\u2019s unsworn statement duplicated and corroborated the subjective complaints and testimony of Carter and the ALJ explicitly found that Carter\u2019s testimony was not credible, it is obvious that the ALJ rejected Culver\u2019s unsworn statement by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
