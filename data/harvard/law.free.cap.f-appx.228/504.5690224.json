The district court applied a ten-level increase to the base offense level because Masters was responsible for more than $120,000 of intended loss. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(F) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">For the first time on appeal, Masters argues that the district court\u2019s estimate of the amount of intended loss is not supported by the record. He argues that there is no evidence that he or his co-aider and abetter, Debra Sheffield, intended their theft of the mail to result in loss equaling the $153,408 worth of checks and money orders contained therein and that there was only evidence that Sheffield cashed $300 worth of money orders. This argument is substantially different from those Masters raised in the district court and, thus, it is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir.2005); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">For the purpose of \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2), intended loss is \u201cthe pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(ii)). \u201c\u2018Pecuniary harm\u2019 means harm that is monetary or that otherwise is readily measurable in money.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(iii)). \u201cThe court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss\u201d based on available evidence. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In determining the amount of intended loss, the district court relied on the USPIS agent\u2019s testimony that the opened mail found in Masters\u2019s and Sheffield\u2019s motel room and in the motel dumpster had contained checks and money orders with the total face value of $153,408. The agent also testified that Sheffield admitted to cashing two money orders worth $300 taken from the stolen mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Masters has failed to show that the district court erred in determining that Masters intended losses equaling the face value of the checks and money orders missing from the stolen mail which he and Sheffield had possessed. Moreover, the district court\u2019s calculation of the amount of loss is a question of fact and \u201c \u2018questions of fact capable of resolution by the district court can never constitute plain error.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Chung, </em>261 F.3d 536, 539 (5th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). Accordingly, Masters has not shown that the district court committed error, plain or otherwise, in estimating the amount of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b532-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
