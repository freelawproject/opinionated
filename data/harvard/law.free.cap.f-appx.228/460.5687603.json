He argues that the district court erred in applying a sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) because he did not commit the Texas felony offense of manslaughter. Deleon also contends that his non-guidelines sentence is unreasonable because the district court improperly considered a factor for which there was no evidentiary support. Specifically, Deleon argues that the record did not support a finding that he knew the firearm was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error, we find that the district court did not err in applying the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203, n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 910, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). Deleon\u2019s statement contained in the presentence report indicated that he knew the firearm was defective, that he had taken methamphetamine earlier in the day, that he was cleaning a loaded gun in close proximity to another person, and that he was illegally possessing the firearm. Considering these facts, we hold that the district court did not err in concluding that Deleon reckless<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>ly caused the death of Audra Fuentes, thereby committing the Texas felony offense of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Deleon\u2019s non-guidelines sentence is not unreasonable based on the district court\u2019s consideration of the fact that Deleon knew the gun was defective. Deleon\u2019s argument that the record does not contain evidence of Deleon\u2019s knowledge as to the firearm\u2019s defect is erroneous. His statement in the presentence report indicates that he was aware of the defect. The district court did not give significant weight to an improper factor. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
