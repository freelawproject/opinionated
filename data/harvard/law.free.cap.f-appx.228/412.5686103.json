We affirm. Howard\u2019s original complaint, filed against Lossie Edward Hopkins, the executrix of the will, and against Sharion Fisher, an attorney involved in the probate of that will, asserted various general allegations that Hopkins and Fisher \u201cconspired and confederated together and fraudulently collected certain monies\u201d from the estate. Howard\u2019s amended complaint, submitted in response to a court order seeking clarification of Howard\u2019s claims, alleged that Hopkins and Fisher \u201cacted under color of law and used the state laws to violate the plaintiffs constitutional rights.\u201d The magistrate judge to whom the case was assigned recommended that Howard\u2019s claim be dismissed, and the district court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-24\">Howard\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed. Hopkins and Fisher are private citizens, not government employees. Although private persons willfully participating with the state act under color of state law, the complaint does not contain facts showing that either Hopkins or Fisher did so. <em>Sarmiento, D.V.M. v.
