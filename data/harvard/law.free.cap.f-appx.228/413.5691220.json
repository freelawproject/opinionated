Gonzalez-Silva, </em>166 Fed.Appx. 150, 151-52 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (unpublished opinion). On December 11, 2006, the Supreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). <em>See Gutierrez-Tovar v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 828, 166 L.Ed.2d 662 (2006). On remand, we conclude that Gonzalez\u2019s appeal is now moot as a result of his release from prison and subsequent deportation, and we dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Gonzalez was convicted of attempted illegal reentry after a previous deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Applying the then-mandatory version of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d), the district court calculated Gonzalez\u2019s total offense level as thirteen and his criminal-history category as III, yielding a sentencing range of eighteen to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment. The court\u2019s calculation of Gonzalez\u2019s total offense level included an eight-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) for a prior aggravated-felony conviction; Gonzalez\u2019s prior conviction was a Texas felony conviction for marijuana possession. The district court imposed a sentence of eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">On appeal, Gonzalez argued (1) that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); (2) that the eight-level Guidelines enhancement for a prior aggravated-felony conviction was improper; and (3) that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) were unconstitutional facially and as applied. We rejected Gonzalez\u2019s third argument as foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and consequently we affirmed his conviction. We also rejected his second argument as foreclosed by <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). But concluding that the district court erred by sentencing Gonzalez pursuant to a mandatory Guidelines scheme, we vacated his sentence and remanded for re-sentencing. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">On remand, the parties alert us to the fact that Gonzalez has completed the confinement portion of his sentence and has apparently been deported from the United States, although his term of supervised release is ongoing. A condition of Gonzalez\u2019s supervised release is that he not illegally reenter the United States during the term of his supervised release. Thus, assuming arguendo that there is <em>Lopez </em>error, Gonzalez is prohibited from reentering the United States (without permission from the Attorney General) to be present for a resentencing proceeding before the district court. But Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires Gonzalez\u2019s presence at resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">This court recently addressed the status of an appeal with nearly identical circumstances in another case remanded by the Supreme Court in light of <em>Lopez. </em>In <em>United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>we concluded that such an appeal was moot because there was no relief we could grant the defendant. 483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007). We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-13\">Because Rosenbaum has completed the confinement portion of his sentence, any argument that the prison term should be reduced is moot and the only portion of the sentence remaining for consideration is the defendant\u2019s term of supervised release. In order to resen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>tence the defendant to correct any error in the defendant\u2019s term of supervised release, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 requires the defendant to be present and have the opportunity to allocute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">Both parties advise, however, that the defendant has completed his term of imprisonment and has been deported.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">Because the defendant has been deported to the Republic of Mexico and is legally unable, without permission of the Attorney General, to reenter the United States to be present for a resentencing proceeding as required by Rule 43, there is no relief we are able to grant him and his appeal is moot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 382-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\"><em>Rosenbaum-Alanis </em>controls our decision in this case. Accordingly, Gonzalez\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
