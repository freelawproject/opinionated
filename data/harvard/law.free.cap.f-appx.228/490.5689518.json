Goodin appeals his guilty-plea conviction and 18-month sentence for possession of an unregistered firearm. Goo-din contends that the district court erred in denying his motions to suppress. Goo-din has waived this issue by entering an unconditional guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Wise, </em>179 F.3d 184, 186 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 914, 916-17 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Goodin avers that his sentence was unreasonable and that the district court erred in declining to depart downward. This court does not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Goo-din\u2019s motion for a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">However, we do have jurisdiction to review \u201cwhether the district court\u2019s imposition of a guideline sentence instead of a non-guideline sentence was reasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.2007). The district court properly calculated the applicable guideline sentencing range and considered the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-20 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, Goodin has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
