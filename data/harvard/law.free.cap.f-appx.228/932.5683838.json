Hurt argues that there was insufficient evidence to allow a rational fact finder to conclude that the b eyonda-reasonable-doubt standard had been met. Upon <em>de novo </em>review, and after reviewing the briefs and record, we find that there was more than sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find Hurt guilty of the crimes with which he was charged. The testimony of Adam Hill, the only passenger in the car when Hurt was arrested, and the testimony of Connie Simms, Hurt\u2019s former girlfriend who resided at the home where police found drugs that Hurt had stashed, both support the verdict. Moreover, the jury could have found Hurt\u2019s testimony in his own defense incredible. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
