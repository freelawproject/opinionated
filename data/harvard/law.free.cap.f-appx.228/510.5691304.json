Garcia claims the district court erred, under the advisory Guidelines, by enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based upon its determination that his 1995 convictions under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a) for indecency with a child were crimes of violence. Garcia contends that his convictions under \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) did not constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because the Texas statute criminalizes consensual sex between minors of the same sex and sex between a 19-year old on the eve of his or her 20th birthday and a child two days shy of his or her 17th birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-22\">The \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601 (5th Cir.2000), held that a violation of \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) is \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as that term is used in its \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>common meaning.\u201d Although <em>Zavala-Sustaita </em>involved an enhancement imposed under a previous version of \u00a7 2L1.2, its reasoning remains sound law and is applicable here. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 273-75 (5th Cir.) (quoting <em>Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d at 604), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). Accordingly, the district court did not err in enhancing Garcia\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Garcia also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors, rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Garcia\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would now overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Garcia concedes this claim is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and raises it here only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
