The presentence report recommended a base offense level of thirty-two pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (2004), an enhancement of two levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 (b)(1) because Barrett possessed a firearm, and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Barrett\u2019s total offense level of thirty-one and his criminal history Category IV resulted in a sentencing range of 151 to 188 months. Barrett objected to the two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm on the ground that the evidence did not show any connection between his drug dealing activities and the possession of the firearms. The district court overruled Barrett\u2019s objection and sentenced him to 151 months of imprisonment, and Barrett timely appealed. On appeal, Barrett asserts that the improper two-level enhancement of his offense level for possession of a firearm amounts to an upward departure and renders his sentence unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The Guidelines provide for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s base offense level \u201c[i] f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). \u201cThe adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), cmt. n. 3. \u201cIn order to prove that a weapon was present, the Government need show only that the weapon was possessed during the relevant illegal drug activity.\u201d <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s determination that a firearm or other weapon was present and justifies the enhancement is a factual question that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Apple, </em>915 F.2d 899, 914 (4th Cir.1990). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court did not err in imposing the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Falesbork, </em>5 F.3d 715, 719-20 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201c[A] district judge must look to the entire course of relevant criminal conduct, not merely the narrow offense of conviction, in deciding whether to apply a \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement.\u201d). Because the district court correctly enhanced Barrett\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and sentenced Barrett within the Guideline range, his argument that the sentence resulted from an upward departure is also without merit. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Barrett\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conclusions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
