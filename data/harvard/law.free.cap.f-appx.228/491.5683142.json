He argues that his Georgia aggravated assault conviction did not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) and that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-24\">Using a \u201ccommon sense approach,\u201d we hold that the generic, contemporary meaning of the offense of aggravated assault includes the intentionally-caused apprehension of injury, 2 W.R. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>Substantive Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 16.3 (2d ed.2005), and that Gonzalez\u2019s Georgia offense falls within that generic, contemporary meaning. <em>United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378-79 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409, 411, 414 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 315, 166 L.Ed.2d 237 (2006). We therefore hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>that the crime-of-violence enhancement was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Gonzalez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Gonzalez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Gonzalez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b519-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
