The district court dismissed his complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). After the district court entered judgment in this case, the United States Supreme Court clarified that exhaustion of remedies is an affirmative defense that need not be pleaded and proven in a prisoner\u2019s initial complaint. <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 910, 918-22, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). It is unnecessary to remand this case to the district court because we conclude that the dismissal of the complaint may be affirmed on other grounds. <em>See Sojourner T. v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992). It is clear from Fitch\u2019s complaint and his appellate brief that his claims concern malpractice and disagreement with his medical treatment. These allegations do not establish the constitutional violation neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>sary for a plaintiff to prevail in a <em>Bivens </em>action. <em>See Estelle v.
