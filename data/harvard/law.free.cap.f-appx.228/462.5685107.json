Although some evidence suggested that another co-defendant was the leader or organizer, in light of the evidence as a whole, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Zertuche was a leader or organizer. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 (5th Cir.2005). Assuming arguendo that the evidence supported a finding that Zertuche\u2019s co-defendant warranted an enhancement as a leader or organizer, we note that such a finding would not preclude a finding that Zertuche also was a leader or organizer. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.1 comment. (n. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-17\">Zertuche argues that the district court erred by imposing a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in connection with the offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Again, although there is some contrary evidence, in light of the evidence that the firearm was found in Zertuche\u2019s closet along with a quantity of cocaine, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in imposing this enhancement. <em>See United States v. Eastland, </em>989 F.2d 760, 770 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-18\">Zertuche argues that the district court erred by imposing a two-level enhancement for use of a minor to assist in avoiding detection of the offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.4. In light of the undisputed evidence that a co-defendant was to smuggle a quantity of cocaine hidden in an infant carrier seat and that the co-defendant\u2019s infant child was brought to the bus station, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that this enhancement was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-19\">Finally, Zertuche argues that the district court erred by denying him the benefits of \u00a7 5C1.2, which provides for an exception to certain mandatory minimum sentences and a two-level reduction in of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>fense level. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5C1.2; \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(7) (2005). Zertuche\u2019s argument is premised on the assumption that the district court erred in finding that he was an organizer or leader. Because we find that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Zertuehe was an organizer or leader, the district court did not clearly err in finding Zertuehe ineligible for relief under \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 963-64 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
