We conclude from a review of the record that the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence that Asanga\u2019s testimony and evidence lacked credibility. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). Because the findings regarding the untrustworthiness of Asanga\u2019s testimony are supported by substantial evidence, this court cannot replace the BIA\u2019s credibility determinations with its own. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">The adverse credibility determination caused the BIA to doubt the evidence of past torture allegedly inflicted upon Asanga, to find questionable her explanation of human rights violations occurring in Cameroon, and to discredit all of the corroborating evidence she offered. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79. Because Asanga failed to provide any credible evidence in support of her claims of persecution, she failed to provide the necessary specific, detailed facts, showing that she was singled out for persecution because of her political opinions or memberships, that her three beatings rose to the level of persecution, or that she possessed a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 343, 349-50 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 304-05 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-17\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b462-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
