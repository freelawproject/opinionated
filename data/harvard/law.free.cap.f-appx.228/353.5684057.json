Counts Two through Six also alleged aiding and abetting the charged offenses, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-19\">Reigle\u2019s jury trial began on November 28, 2005. At trial, Thomas Evered testified that he met Reigle on the internet in 1997. Evered eventually traveled to Pennsylvania with his desktop computer to trade child pornography collections with Reigle. Reigle had photographs of SH, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>SH\u2019s younger, nine-year-old brother AH, and another boy, SB, in his collection.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Evered also testified that during this trip Reigle had sent a video depicting the three boys engaged in sexually explicit conduct to a friend who had copied it and made digital clips that could be traded on the internet. In 1998, Evered became an over-the-road truck driver. Evered testified that he always kept his child pornography collection in his truck with him, and that his collection included images he got from Reigle. Reigle was aware of these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">On November 23, 1999, Reigle was arrested on charges of child molestation. On September 23, 2002, Reigle reported to the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland (hereinafter \u201cFCI Cumberland\u201d). At some point, Reigle called Evered from FCI Cumberland and asked him to copy his child pornography collection onto CDs and keep constant possession of the CDs so that he would have no trouble getting his collection back upon his release. Evered testified that he retrieved Reigle\u2019s hard drive and approximately thirty-five CDs and maintained them at all times on his truck. Evered further testified that he traveled into Maryland on November 18, 2002, and March 4, 2003, while driving his tractor-trailer rig. On each occasion, Evered had his laptop with all of the pornographic images of AH, SH, and another boy, D, as well as the videos of AH, SH, and SB.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">At trial AH and SH also testified. They testified as to how they met Reigle. AH testified that Reigle taped him engaged in sexual activity with SB and SH, identified the videos presented by the Government, and testified that Reigle made the videos. AH also identified himself in photographs that have come to be known as the \u201cAnthony Collection.\u201d SH testified that Reigle photographed him and directed him to photograph Reigle and AH engaged in sexual acts. SH also identified various Government exhibits including a photograph and two videos.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The Government also introduced the testimony of SB, JB, and TB, who were molested by Reigle. SB identified Reigle as the adult male in two photographs depicting an adult male with a partially obscured face performing fellatio on a minor. JB testified as to how Reigle molested him. JB also identified Reigle in the same photos shown to SB. Finally, TB testified as to how he met Reigle and how Reigle molested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">At trial the Government introduced evidence that photographs from the \u201cAnthony Collection\u201d were found on a computer in Edgewater, Maryland. Also, Special Agent Kathleen Kornek downloaded from a computer in Texas pictures from the \u201cAnthony Collection\u201d and two video clips to a computer in Calverton, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Reigle was ultimately convicted on all six counts. At sentencing, the district court dismissed Count Six based on Reigle\u2019s motion for acquittal due to lack of venue. The court then sentenced Reigle to life imprisonment on Counts Four and Five and forty years on Counts One, Two, and Three. All sentence were to run concurrently. Reigle timely appealed, alleging that the district court erred in not granting his motion for acquittal based on improper venue for each count in the indictment and that the court erred in admitting the testimony of SB, JB, and TB.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">The prosecution bears the burden of proving venue by a preponderance of the evidence, and where, as here, a defendant is charged with multiple crimes, venue must be proper on each count. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>States v. Ebersole, </em>411 F.3d 517, 524 (4th Cir.2005). In determining whether the government has established venue by a preponderance of the evidence, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Burns, </em>990 F.2d 1426, 1437 (4th Cir.1993)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Count One of the indictment alleged that Reigle conspired with Evered to transport and ship in interstate commerce visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct and to possess such depictions. Venue was proper in Maryland for Count One as three overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred in Maryland. <em>Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 646-47, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489; <em>United States v. Snead, </em>527 F.2d 590 (4th Cir.1975). Reigle entered the conspiracy while in Maryland by calling Evered from FCI Cumberland, and Evered twice transported Reigle\u2019s collection into Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Venue in Maryland was also proper for Counts Two and Three as Reigle conspired with Evered and aided his transportation of the child pornography. <em>United States v. Kibler, </em>667 F.2d 452, 455 (4th Cir.1982). On two dates, Evered possessed child pornography at Reigle\u2019s request. Reigle thereby aided Evered\u2019s interstate transportation of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Finally, venue for Counts Four and Five was proper in Maryland. Reigle created the visual depictions of his victims in his home in Pennsylvania. Several of these depictions were discovered on a computer at a home in Edgewater, Maryland on May 5, 2004. The Government established that these images were downloaded from the internet onto the computer. Thus, venue for Count Four was proper. Also, Special Agent Kathleen Kornek downloaded child pornography created in Pennsylvania by Reigle from a computer in Texas. Kornek\u2019s downloading in Maryland made venue in Maryland for Count Five appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Additionally, the district court properly admitted evidence of Reigle\u2019s molestation of other children. Rule 404(b) decisions by the district court are discretionary and will not be overturned unless arbitrary and irrational. <em>United States v. Powers, </em>59 F.3d 1460, 1464 (4th Cir.1995). We find that the testimony of SB, JB, and TB at issue was admissible both as intrinsic evidence and as evidence of Reigle\u2019s identity and motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Count Five charged Reigle with production of child pornography. SB testified that he appeared in the video that formed the basis for Count Five and that he engaged in genital to anal sex with another minor in the video at Reigle\u2019s direction. Reigle\u2019s molestation of SB was therefore inextricably intertwined with the creation of the video that was subsequently downloaded by the FBI. <em>United States v. Chin, </em>83 F.3d 83, 87-88 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Also, the testimony of SB, JB, and TB was properly admitted to establish Reigle\u2019s identity. SB, JB, and TB\u2019s testimony corroborated AH and SH\u2019s testimony and established Reigle as the person who created the child pornography. Finally, the probative value of the testimony of SB, JB, and TB was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice to Reigle. <em>See United States v. Boyd, </em>53 F.3d 631, 637 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">As the district court did not err in admitting the testimony of SB, JB, and TB or in denying Reigle\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>terials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\"> All boys in this opinion are referred to by their initials as they were at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
