Garcia\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that the sentencing court erred by imposing a higher than minimum sentence based on Garcia\u2019s failure to disclose his real name prior to the presentence investigation. Garcia was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. Our review of the record discloses no reversible error; accordingly, we affirm Garcia\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We find that Garcia\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered after a thorough hearing pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. Garcia was properly advised of his rights, the offense charged, and the mandatory minimum and maximum sentences for the offense. The court also determined that there was an independent factual basis for the plea and that the plea was not coerced or influenced by any promises. <em>See United States v. De-Fusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Garcia argues that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court considered his failure to provide his real name as a sentencing factor when there had not been an adjustment for obstruction of justice. We find that the district court properly applied the Sentencing Guidelines and considered the relevant sentencing factors before imposing the 128-month sentence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006); <em>see United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). Additionally, we find that the sentence imposed-which was in the middle of the properly calculated guideline range-was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (\u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated [guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Accordingly, we affirm Garcia\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Garcia\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\"> The judgment from which the appeal is taken, as well as the dockets of both the district court and this court, show Appellant\u2019s name as Roberto Gil Garcia, a/k/a Don Beto. At sentencing, counsel for the government informed the court that Appellant\u2019s true name is Alberto Lopez Lopez. We refer to Appellant as Roberto Garcia to be consistent with the name used on the judgment from which the appeal is taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
