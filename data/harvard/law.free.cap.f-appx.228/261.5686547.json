Under the terms of her plea agreement, Lee waived the right to appeal \u201cwhatever sentence is imposed,\u201d and specifically waived the \u201cright to appeal from any sentence within or below the advisory guidelines range resulting from an adjusted base offense level of 25....\u201d At sentencing, the district court determined that Lee\u2019s adjusted offense level was twenty-five and departed downward to criminal history category I, which yielded an advisory guideline range of 57-71 months. Our review of the record discloses that Lee was advised about the waiver at the guilty plea hearing, and that the appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 402 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-26\">We therefore dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
