Jackson was sentenced to 24 months of imprisonment and a two-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">This court will uphold a jury\u2019s verdict if a reasonable trier of fact could conclude from the evidence that the elements of the offense were established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>256 F.3d 264, 273-74 (5th Cir.2001). The evidence, both direct and circumstantial, is viewed in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict; all credibility determinations and reasonable inferences are to be resolved in favor of the verdict. <em>United States v. Resio-Trejo, </em>45 F.3d 907, 910, 911 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">At trial, Jackson stipulated that he is a convicted felon and that the firearm found at the scene was in, or affected, interstate commerce. Consequently, the only fact for the jury to decide was whether Jackson was in knowing possession of a firearm. <em>See United States v. Ybarra, </em>70 F.3d 362, 365 (5th Cir.1995). Jackson argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him because none of the Government\u2019s witnesses testified that they saw him in possession of the firearm on the day of his arrest. Jackson also argues that there was no evidence that the area where the firearm was found could not have been accessed by the public, and contends that although the Government could have obtained fingerprint, DNA, or other forensic evidence, to link him to the firearm, it failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Given the evidence, however, the jury could have drawn the plausible inference that Jackson had a gun in his possession and attempted to conceal it from police. <em>See United States v. McCowan, </em>469 F.3d 386, 390-91 (5th Cir.2006). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, a reasonable trier of fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Jackson possessed the firearm. <em>See United States v. Delgado, </em>256 F.3d 264, 273-74 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Resio-Trejo, </em>45 F.3d at 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b513-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
