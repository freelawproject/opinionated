He now appeals. His attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. Califor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>nia, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Jones has also filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Jones first attacks the sufficiency of the evidence. In reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence, we consider whether there is substantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, to support the verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We do not review the credibility of witnesses, and we assume the jury resolved all evidentiary contradictions in favor of the Government. <em>United States v. Sun, </em>278 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002). Our review of the trial transcript convinces us that there was sufficient evidence to support both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Jones also claims that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). \u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guideline range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006) (internal quotations marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Here, the life sentence is statutorily authorized. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000). Moreover, the advisory guideline range was correctly calculated. With regard to the guideline calculation, it is abundantly clear that Jones was the leader or organizer of an organization involving five or more people. Therefore, the four-level enhancement of his offense level for his role in the offense was proper. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.1 (a) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">The district court imposed a sentence that was both within the statutory range and the properly calculated advisory guideline range. Additionally, the court considered the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006) in imposing sentence. We conclude that the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires counsel to inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy of the motion was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately set forth in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-10\"> In his informal brief, Jones complains about his convictions on firearm charges, contending that there was no evidence that the gun in question traveled in interstate commerce. We note that Jones was neither indicted for nor convicted of a firearm offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
