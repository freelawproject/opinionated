The advisory guidelines range was 46-57 months of imprisonment and the statutory maximum was ten years of imprisonment. Hernandez-Gomez argues that the district court expressed his disagreement with the guidelines range and imposed an unreasonable sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-19\">\u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both that record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen we review a sentence for reasonableness, we do not, as the district court did, determine the exact sentence to be imposed.\u201d <em>Id. \u201cWe </em>must evaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-20\">The district court did not err. The district court correctly recognized that its general disagreement with the Sentencing Guidelines was not a legitimate reason to vary from the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1366 (11th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 06-7352 (U.S. Oct. 19, 2006). The district court considered the factors in section 3553(a) and sentenced Hernandez-Gomez well below the statutory maximum and at the low end of the guidelines range. That sentence is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-21\">Hernandez-Gomez\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b958-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
