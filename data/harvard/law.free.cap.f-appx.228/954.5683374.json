Zuniga was involved in the transportation of large quantities of cocaine from Colombia into the United States, via the Caribbean.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">Zuniga argues that the district court clearly erred by applying a three-level aggravating role enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. Zuniga asserts that the district court incorrectly found that he and co-conspirator Cesar Augusto Mantilla Chavez were on the same level in the conspiracy, where the evidence showed that Zuniga was Mantilla\u2019s subordinate. Zuniga contends that he was merely a middleman with no control over the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">\u201cA district court\u2019s upward adjustment of a defendant\u2019s Guidelines offense level due to his status as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 is a finding of fact reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>287 F.3d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Section 3B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for enhanced offense levels for defendants with aggravating roles. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. \u201cIf the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants\u201d then a three-level enhancement is to be applied. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). The assertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement. <em>See United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in applying a three-level aggravating role enhancement to Zuniga. There is no dispute that the instant drug-trafficking conspiracy involved five or more participants. The evidence makes it clear that Zuniga \u201casserted] control or influence\u201d over the distribution of cocaine once it was delivered from Colombia to Jamaica, using others to unload, transport, and sell cocaine in Jamaica, and over the delivery of drug-sale proceeds back to Colombia, using others to personally transport the money. This is sufficient to support the three-level aggravating role enhancement. <em>See Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d at 1251. Accordingly, we affirm Zuniga\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
