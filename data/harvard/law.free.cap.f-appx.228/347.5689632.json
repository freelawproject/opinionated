Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed2d 202 (1986); <em>Evans v. Technologies Applications &amp; Serv. Co., </em>80 F.3d 954, 958 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">After thoroughly reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the joint appendix, including the transcript of the summary judgment hearing, we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Gricco v. Carver Boat Corp., LLC, </em>No. l:04-cv-01854-JFM (D. Md. Dec. 15, 2005 and Aug. 9, 2006). We grant the consent motion to submit the case on briefs and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-25\"> The Appellants initially alleged four causes of action, and the district court granted their motion to amend the complaint to allege three additional claims. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the first four claims; by memorandum opinion and order, the district court granted the Appellee's motion and denied the Appellants\u2019 motion. The parties also filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the final three claims; after a hearing, the district court orally granted the Appellee\u2019s motion and denied the Appellants' motion. The district court entered judgment for the Appellee. On appeal, the Appellants challenge the district court\u2019s rulings on two of the seven claims: negligent misrepresentation and a violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
