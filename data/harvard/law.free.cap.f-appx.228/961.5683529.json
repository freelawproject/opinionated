Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1270-71 (11th Cir.2005) (stating when a defendant fails to raise a constitutional challenge in the district court, we review for plain error). \u201c[W]e may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Even if we hold these three prongs are satisfied, \u201cwe will exercise our discretion to rectify the error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-21\">We have expressly held that \u00a7 924(c) does not violate the Commerce Clause. <em>United States v. Ferreira, </em>275 F.3d 1020, 1028 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. DePace, </em>120 F.3d 233, 235 n. 2 (11th Cir.1997). Thus, the district court did not err, much less plainly err, in convicting Winn under \u00a7 924(c). <em>See id. </em>To the extent Winn contends we should overrule these cases, this argument is without merit because only this Court sitting en banc or the Supreme Court may overrule a prior panel decision. <em>Walker v. S. Co. Servs., Inc., </em>279 F.3d 1289, 1293 (11th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm Winn\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-18\">. Winn does not contest his conviction for conspiracy to rob a federally insured bank, which did not involve 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b989-19\">. To the extent Winn may have sought to challenge \u00a7 924(c) as unconstitutional as applied to him, he abandoned the issue by failing to offer any argument or analysis of it in his brief. <em>See Flanigans Enters., Inc. v. Fulton County, </em>242 F.3d 976, 987 n. 16 (11th Cir.2001) (holding when a defendant fails \"to elaborate or provide any citation of authority in support,\u201d he abandons the argument for appellate purposes); <em>Allison v. McGhan Med. Corp., </em>184 F.3d 1300, 1317 n. 17 (11th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>1999) (stating issues \"not clearly outlined in an appellant\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
