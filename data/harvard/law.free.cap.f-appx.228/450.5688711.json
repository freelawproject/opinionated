Florence, Mississippi prisoner # 32311, has filed a motion for leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis (IFP) following the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). By moving for IFP, Florence is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted because the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Florence\u2019s IFP \u201cmotion must be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Florence merely asserts that any absence of sufficient facts to state a claim was due to his unskilled pro se pleadings. He has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal would be frivolous was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith and denying Florence IFP status on appeal, we deny the motion for leave to proceed IFP, and we dismiss Florence\u2019s appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5TH CIR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Florence\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel to challenge the district court\u2019s certification is denied. Although in the context of direct criminal appeals we would appoint counsel to challenge the certification, <em>see Johnson v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 565, 77 S.Ct. 550, 1 L.Ed.2d 593 (1957) (per curiam), there is no automatic right to appointment of counsel in a civil rights case. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). Florence\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s certification does not present \u201cexceptional cireumstances\u201d that would require the appointment of counsel. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock County, Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Florence\u2019s action and our dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Florence that should he accumulate three strikes, he will be unable to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">IFP DENIED; APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
