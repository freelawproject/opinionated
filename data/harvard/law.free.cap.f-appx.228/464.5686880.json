He contends that the district court erred by finding that the conduct that resulted in revocation, possession of a small amount of cocaine, was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Grade B violation rather than a Grade C violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">A conviction for possession of any amount of cocaine could have resulted in Bishop\u2019s imprisonment for more than one year under Texas law. <em>See </em>Texas Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.112; Texas Penal Code \u00a7 12.35(a). The conduct therefore constituted a Grade B violation, and the sentence was within the proper advisory guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2), 7B1.4(a)(table).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In any event, the sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum, and the district court considered the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when choosing the sentence. The sentence was thus neither \u201cunreasonable\u201d nor \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1083, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b492-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
