On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issue: whether Garrett\u2019s sentence was erroneous. Because we find that Garrett\u2019s sentence is not plainly unreasonable, <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006) (stating review standard), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007), this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-21\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>including the issues raised in Garrett\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. We deny Garrett\u2019s motion to reheve his counsel. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
