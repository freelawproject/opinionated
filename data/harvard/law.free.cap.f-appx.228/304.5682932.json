The district court sentenced Ford to sixty months\u2019 imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and ordered payment of a $100 statutory assessment. Ford has appealed, challenging the district court\u2019s admission of evidence and asserting that his federal sentence should run concurrently to his state sentence because his judgment order did not specify whether it was to run concurrently or consecutively. We affirm Ford\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">We review the district court\u2019s admission of evidence pursuant to Fed.R. of Evid. 404(b) for abuse of discretion, and will not overturn the court\u2019s decision to admit such evidence unless it was \u201carbitrary or irrational.\u201d <em>See United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 995 (4th Cir.1997). Ford challenges the district court\u2019s decision to allow law enforcement witnesses to testify concerning their investigation of, and Ford\u2019s statements relative to, a prior shoot-out on the ground that the testimony was introduced simply to demonstrate Ford\u2019s criminal propensities or bad character. Contrary to Ford\u2019s assertions, we find no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. The evidence was directly probative of Ford\u2019s motive, intent, and absence of mistake with regard to possessing a firearm four days later, the evidence was limited insofar as Ford was identified only as a \u201cperson in interest,\u201d with no mention of the fact that arrest warrants had been issued for him relative to that incident, the district court instructed the jury that it was to limit its consideration of the challenged evidence to the allowable issues pursuant to Rule 404(b), the facts presented were not in dispute, and the prejudicial effect of the testimony did not outweigh its probative value. <em>Id. </em>at 994-95, 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">We likewise reject Ford\u2019s contention that because the district court\u2019s judgment order is silent as to the relationship between his federal sentence on the instant offense and a state sentence, his federal sentence should run concurrently with his state sentence. Pursuant to the provisions of both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) (2000), and <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>Manual, </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(a) (2004), Ford\u2019s federal sentence on the instant offense and his previously-imposed but undischarged state court sentence on a separate offense are considered multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times that are to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Ford\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
