He now appeals, seeking a new trial on the grounds that the district court abused its discretion (1) in precluding him from introducing into evidence payroll records purportedly indicating that he was working at the time an undercover agent said he observed him at his residence during a controlled drug buy, and (2) in limiting his attorney\u2019s cross-examination of prosecution witnesses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no merit in either ground and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">The evidence of guilt in this case was overwhelming. The evidence\u2014much of it consisting of the testimony of drug traffickers and users\u2014established that throughout the time frame indicated in the indictment, appellant\u2019s residence was used to cook crack cocaine and as a place where drug sellers and buyers met to consummate their transactions. On many occasions appellant was present and tacitly, if not explicitly, approved of what was going on.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-18\">Appellant was a city firefighter whose working hours were such that he was able to hold several odd jobs on the side: car detailing (which he did in his yard), apartment maintenance, floor waxing and lawn work. His residence was, as police officers described it, a \u201chot spot\u201d for sales of crack cocaine, \u201ca bee-hive of activity,\u201d and \u201cone of the hottest locations in town\u201d for drug trafficking. The trafficking spanned at least a decade. One drug user bought crack at appellant\u2019s home at least 40 or 50 times from 1994-1997, and a Jamaican drug dealer delivered narcotics to the house on approximately 100 occasions from 2002-2008. Given the frequency of drug dealing at appellant\u2019s residence, officers obtained two search warrants and videotaped their execution. The first search occurred in 1995, at eleven o\u2019clock at night, and uncovered crack cocaine, marijuana, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>drug paraphernalia, a .380 caliber pistol, and cash.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Three individuals were arrested, charged with drug offenses, and convicted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Drug trafficking at appellant\u2019s residence abated for a while following this incident, but by 1998, the police had enough concrete evidence of drug dealing there to obtain another search warrant. Executing the warrant, the officers found crack cocaine and various items of drug paraphernalia. They arrested appellant later in the day; he told them that he knew drugs were being dispensed at his home, but that he had no control over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Drug dealing at appellant\u2019s residence continued. Drug users testified that when they went to the house to purchase drugs, appellant would call his children or his daughter\u2019s boyfriend\u2014so they could handle the deal. If they failed to respond, he would sell the users the crack cocaine they were seeking.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Appellant\u2019s first ground for a new trial is that the court abused its discretion in barring the admission of Pawn City payroll records which, appellant submits, indicated that he was working during the afternoon of July 8, 2004, when, according to a DEA agent\u2019s testimony, he was present at his residence while the agent and a confidential informant (Cl) were there to purchase two ounces of crack cocaine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The payroll records showed that, on July 8, appellant was paid $65 for unspecified work at one Pawn City location and $25 for cutting grass at another Pawn City location.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court excluded the records in response to the Government\u2019s objection that appellant, in waiting until the second day of trial\u2014 during the defendant\u2019s case\u2014had failed to produce them as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">The parties had reciprocal discovery obligations under Rule 16. A district court has the authority to remedy a party\u2019s failure to comply with the rule\u2019s discovery requirements, including barring \u201cthat party <em>from </em>introducing the undisclosed evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(d)(2)(C). Appellant\u2019s attorney offered the court no justifiable reason for his delay in providing the Government with the payroll records. The records were readily available; in fact, counsel had been to Pawn City to retrieve the records yet failed to obtain them and turn them over to the prosecution. Allowing the records to come before the jury would have prejudiced the Government. Although the Government could have asked the court for a recess so it could examine the records and prepare to meet them, the trial was about to conclude\u2014as soon as appellant rested his defense. Under the circumstances at hand, we find no abuse of discretion in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>court\u2019s refusal to allow the records into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Even if we were to assume that the court should have allowed the records to come before the jury, we would be hard pressed to hold that the court\u2019s ruling prejudiced appellant\u2019s substantial rights. As noted above, the evidence of guilt was overwhelming, and the July 8 episode was merely one of many drug transactions that spanned a ten-year period of continuous drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Appellant complains of the court\u2019s limitation of his cross-examination of prosecution witnesses. The cross-examination at issue concerned statements appellant made to police officers regarding his knowledge of the drug trafficking taking place at his residence. As noted in the margin, appellant only objected to the court\u2019s limitation of his cross-examination of Gantry Habersham. His attorney cross-examined Habersham about his prior felonies and that his cooperation with the Government led to charges being dropped.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On several occasions, the Government objected to counsel\u2019s questions\u2014 usually because Habersham had either already answered them or was obviously unable to do so\u2014and the court sustained the objections. On the second day of trial, counsel argued that the court should have allowed him further latitude in cross-examining Habersham about the criminal charges that had been lodged against him. In response, the court stated that counsel could recall Habersham to the witness stand for that purpose. For reasons not disclosed by the record, counsel chose not to recall him.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s handling of appellant\u2019s cross-examination of this witness. Counsel was fully able to impeach Habersham\u2019s credibility. In the end, in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt, further cross-examination would have done nothing to avoid an adverse verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">In sum, we find no lawful reason for granting appellant an new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-13\">. Appellant\u2019s attorney objected to the court\u2019s action in limiting cross-examination with respect to one witness only, Gantry Habersham. As for the other witnesses, appellant voiced no objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\">. Appellant was not present when the officers arrived to execute the search warrant. But his children were. They called him at the fire station, and he arrived at the scene a short time later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b894-9\">. Before leaving appellant\u2019s residence that evening, a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent told appellant that his house was \u201ca known drug distribution area,\u201d subject to forfeiture, and cautioned him to \"take control\u201d of the place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b894-14\">. The agent and (Cl) purchased the crack from appellant\u2019s daughter's boyfriend, Kerry Lipsey, who cooked it in appellant\u2019s kitchen while they waited. Gantry Habersham, a drug dealer (unconnected to the controlled buy), said that appellant was present in the kitchen while Lipsey was cooking the crack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b894-15\">. No one at Pawn City could testify that appellant worked for Pawn City on July 8, and if he did for how long, or was simply paid that day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b895-8\">. The court properly stopped counsel from impeaching Habersham with an inadmissible DEA report.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
