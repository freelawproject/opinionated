Thomas\u2019s petition included a claim that the Florida Parole Commission had committed an <em>ex post facto </em>violation by performing only biannual parole reviews, where annual parole reviews had been required at the time of Thomas\u2019s conviction in 1969 for second-degree murder. The district court concluded that this claim was properly brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and denied it as not being cognizable under \u00a7 2254. The district court also denied all other claims in Thomas\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-18\">On October 23, 2006, we granted Thomas a certificate of appealability on one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-19\">Whether the district court erred in determining that appellant\u2019s challenge that the retroactive application of the amended Florida parole guidelines allowing for a parole review every two years, instead of every year as provided in the guidelines in effect at the time appellant was convicted, constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>violation was not a cognizable claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-20\">The Supreme Court has held that habeas remedies do not take the place of \u00a7 1983 actions when success in the suit would not necessarily result in a speedier release. <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). In <em>Wilkinson, </em>two state prisoners challenged the constitutionality of state parole procedures under \u00a7 1983. The Court discussed its precedent, concluding that \u00a7 1983 remains available to a prisoner whose success in the action \u201cwould not necessarily spell immediate or speedier release for the prisoner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81, 125 S.Ct. at 1247. Because the prisoners\u2019 challenge in <em>Wilkinson </em>would only invalidate the parole eligibility procedures, success would not spell an earlier release. <em>Id. </em>at 82, 125 S.Ct. at 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-21\">In <em>Hutcherson v. Riley, </em>468 F.3d 750 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 467, 166 L.Ed.2d 333 (2006), we held that \u201c[a]n inmate convicted and sentenced under state law may seek federal relief under two primary avenues: a petition for habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and a complaint under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>\u201cthese avenues are mutually exclusive: if a claim can be raised in a federal habeas petition, that same claim cannot be raised in a separate \u00a7 1983 civil rights action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">We agree with the district court that Thomas\u2019s challenge to the parole eligibility procedure is not properly brought under \u00a7 2254. The Court in <em>Wilkinson </em>held that claims like Thomas\u2019s are cognizable under \u00a7 1983. Because \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 2254 are mutually exclusive, Thomas\u2019s claim cannot be brought under \u00a7 2254. <em>Hutcherson, </em>468 F.3d at 754. Therefore, the district court correctly denied Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
