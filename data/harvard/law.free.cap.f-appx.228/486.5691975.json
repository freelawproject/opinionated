He now appeals the district court\u2019s holding he failed to demonstrate there was no reasonable likelihood of removal in the foreseeable future. According to Sacko, his continued detention beyond six months violates the rule from <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-22\">It appears the district court did <em>not </em>err in concluding Sacko hampered the Government\u2019s efforts to remove him. We need <em>not </em>reach that issue, however. Instead, we note the district court ordered the Government to obtain travel documents from Burundi within six months. That period has now passed, rendering moot any dispute over the rationale for the district court\u2019s order of continued detention. Therefore, we vacate and remand to the district court to determine whether, given the current status of the case, \u201cthere is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491; <em>see also Gul v. Rozos, </em>163 Fed.Appx. 317 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-23\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
