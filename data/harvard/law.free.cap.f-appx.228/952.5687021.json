Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). Here, the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, and stated that it agreed that Beldorati had not shown that he feared future persecution. Accordingly, we review both the BIA and IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-17\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal to a country if \u201cthe alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). In order to be entitled to withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>removal, the alien must demonstrate that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would suffer persecution on account of one of the protected grounds should he be returned to his native country. <em>Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 766. An alien that can prove he suffered past persecution in his native country \u201ccreates a rebuttable presumption that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would again be threatened upon removal to the proposed country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have defined \u201cpersecution\u201d as \u201can \u2018extreme concept\u2019 requiring \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation ... [m]ere harassment is not persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">The IJ has discretion to determine whether past incidents amount to persecution; however, where an alien presents evidence that he suffered past persecution, \u201cthe regulations do not give the IJ the discretion to refrain from making a determination regarding past persecution altogether.\u201d <em>Antipova v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1265 (11th Cir.2004). In <em>Antipova, </em>we remanded the case to the BIA where the BIA left us unable to \u201cundertake] meaningful judicial review of the merits of [the] order\u201d because it failed to detail whether the petitioner had suffered past persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1265. We instructed that the IJ had to make a finding regarding past persecution if the applicant seeking withholding of removal \u201csets forth credible evidence\u201d of past persecution. <em>Id. </em>An applicant that presents sufficient evidence to prove past persecution is entitled to a favorable presumption of future persecution that the government must then rebut. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">After reviewing the record, and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the BIA and the IJ failed to address whether Beldorati suffered past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">In his decision, the IJ concluded that Beldorati\u2019s testimony and the background information submitted prior to the hearing failed to show that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would incur future persecution. The IJ did not, however, discuss whether the mistreatment endured by Beldorati amounted to past persecution. If Beldorati had suffered past persecution then he was entitled to a rebuttable presumption in his favor that he was likely to suffer future persecution. Thus, we grant Beldorati\u2019s petition and remand this case to the BIA to determine whether Beldorati suffered past persecution and, if so, whether the presumption of future persecution was rebutted by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">PETITION GRANTED AND CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-11\">. We dismiss his appeal as to the denial of asylum because we do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA's and IJ\u2019s discretionary decision not to waive the one-year time limit to apply for asylum. In his petition, Beldorati does not challenge the IJ and BIA\u2019s finding that he is not entitled to protection under the CAT. Thus, any argument is waived. <em>Huang v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>429 F.3d 1002, 1007 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
