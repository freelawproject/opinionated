Espinosa argues that the district court did not address all of the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing sentence and did not address the reasons that Espinosa ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>vanced for a downward departure or variance from the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The Government argues that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary denial of Espinosa\u2019s motion for a downward departure or variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The court lacks jurisdiction to review a discretionary decision not to depart downward from the guideline range. However, the court must still determine whether the imposition of a guideline sentence instead of a non-guideline sentence was reasonable. <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Espinosa has demonstrated no error in the guidelines computation, and the district court gave appropriate reasons for the sentence. We therefore give great deference to the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Given Espinosa\u2019s serious prior drug conviction and his illegal return to the United States after serving a 40-month sentence and being deported to Mexico, and the deference due to the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion, the sentence imposed is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Espinosa\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Espinosa contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Espinosa properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
