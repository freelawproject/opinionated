Winston and a number of other persons, claiming to be creditors of the Midlothian Coal Mining Company, and suing for themselves and all other creditors and stockholders of said company who would come in and make themselves parties in the cause, filed their bill in the Circuit court of the city of Eichmond, in which they allege that they are creditors of the company to the auiount of about $40,000. That, in 1866, the directors of the company had issued its bonds to the amount of $60,000, secured by a deed of trust upon the real property of the company in the county of Chesterfield, in which deed Eobert A. Lancaster and Charles S. Mills were the trustees. That these bonds were placed in the hands of Lancaster &amp; Co., who were brokers, for sale upon commission. That in March, 1867, the said board of directors directed the issue of not more than $75,000 of the bonds of the company, which were secured by another deed upon the said property of the company, in which the said Lancaster and James E. Branch were the'trustees. That $60,000 of these bonds were issued and placed in the hands of Lancaster &amp; Co. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>for sale. And that another deed was executed, conveying all the unincumbered property of the company to Lancaster and Mills, to secure certain negotiable .notes executed by the directors of the company individually, to the amount of $15,000, for the benefit of the company. They charge that there was both usury and fraud in the mode of Lancaster &amp; Co.\u2019s dealings with these bonds, which they set out; and that they had sold to one Burrus a large amount of them at a great sacrifice, they being at the same time the agents of the company to sell, and the agents of Burrus to buy. They insist that the bonds and deeds of trust are void because of the frauds practiced, and because they are in contravention of the act of Assembly of Virginia, and the bankrupt law of the United States; \u25a0or under the former the plaintiffs are entitled to share -equally with the creditors, attempted to be secured by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b719-7\">They state, further, that the trustees in the deeds of trust had advertised to sell the property on the next \u2022day, and if the sale is made it must be, under the circumstances, at a ruinous sacrifice; and in fact can only be purchased by Burrus, to be paid for by the bonds of the company which he holds. And making the trustees in said deed, the directors of the company, Lancaster &amp; Co. and Burrus, parties defendants, and calling 'for a discovery from Lancaster &amp; Co. and Burrus, they pray that Lancaster &amp; Co. may be required to render \u2022an account of all their dealings and transactions in the premises with the said Midlothian Coal Mining Company; that the alleged sales of said bonds, as against the said company and the complainants, may be decreed to be null and void, and that they may be required to be given up and cancelled; that said deeds of trust may be declared void; that an account may be taken by one of the commissioners of the court, of all \u25a0the said dealings and transactions; that the plaintiffs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>as creditors of said company, may in any event be let into and have equal benefit under said deeds of trust with Lancaster &amp; Co. and others, if said deeds or any of them shall be held to be valid; that the trustees and all others may be enjoined from selling the said property until the further order of the court; that a receiver may be appointed; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b720-9\">Before filing the bill in the clerk\u2019s office, the plaintiffs presented it to the judge of the Circuit court for an injunction, which he awarded. But whilst the clerk was making out the.process, another order of the judge was presented to him, by which it was ordered, that if' any of the defendants in said bill, or any one for them, shall execute and file with the clerk of the court a bond in the penalty of $60,000, with good security, with condition to comply with the decree which may be rendered by the court on the hearing of the cause, then the sale may take place in accordance with the terms of the advertisement. And this bond was executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b720-10\">On the 20th day of May, 1869, George L. Bidgood and others, creditors and stockholders of the Midlothian Coal Mining Company, filed their petition in the cause, in which they prayed to be admitted as plaintiffs therein. They adopt the allegations of the bill, and the stockholders who unite in said petition, pray for themselves and of other stockholders, that the sale of' the property may be enjoined. Upon the filing of this petition the judge awarded a peremptory injunction restraining and forbidding the trustees from selling the-property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b720-11\">The process issued on this last injunction was served, on Milla at 20 minutes past ten o\u2019clock of that day, by leaving a copy at his dwelling-house, and on Branch at 15 minutes past eleven o\u2019clock, in the same way. Lancaster was returned not found, and no inhabitant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b720-12\">On the 12th of June, 1869, Julia A. \"Wooldridge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Thomas C. and John C. Howard, filed their petition in the cause, asking to he made parties; they claimed as large stockholders in the company. After setting out their interest, they stated that the trustees, notwithstanding the injunction, and that they were notified of it by written notice from the counsel of the plaintiffs, had proceeded to sell the property, and that Burrus had become the purchaser at $145,000, with notice that the injunction had been issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b721-6\">It appears that the plaintiffs proceeded regularly to mature [the case for a hearing; process was issued which was served on the company and on several of the directors, on Lancaster &amp; Co., and on the three trustees, and at the rules held on the last Monday in June, the bill was taken for confessed as to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b721-7\">It appeared in the case that the real estate of the Midlothian Mining Company, and the personal property included in the deeds of trust, was located in the county of Chesterfield; but the principal office of the company was in the city of Biehmond. The trustees, Mills and Branch, two of the partners of the firm of Lancaster &amp; Co., and several of the directors of the company, lived in the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b721-9\">On the 21st of July, 1869, Lancaster and Mills filed their motion in writing in the cause, praying that the injunction awarded on the 19th of May and on the 20th of May, 1869, be dissolved, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 bill be dismissed. And they assigned, as the ground of the motion, that the bill in the cause is a bill for an injunction to restrain a sale apprehended by the plaintiffs, which was to take place in the county of Chesterfield; and that the orders awarding said injunctions were improperly directed to the clerk of the Circuit court of Biehmond. That jurisdiction of the bill was in a Circuit, County or Corporation court of Chesterfield; and that the Circuit court of Biehmond had no jurisdiction of this bill. This motion the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>overruled. But on the 13th of October, 1869, on the motion of Lancaster <em>&amp; </em>Co. to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the bill and petitions, on the ground that coul\u2019t had no jurisdietion of the suit; the court did ^sso^ve injunction. And though in that order the question of dismissing the bill was reserved, yet on the next day it was taken up; and the bill and petitions were dismissed. Brom these orders the plaintiffs obtained an appeal from a judge of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b722-6\"><em>Lyons, J. Alfred Jones </em>and <em>John Hoioard, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b722-7\"><em>Neeson, Meredith </em>and <em>Ould $ Carrington, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b722-8\">Joynes, L,</author>\n<p id=\"Acv\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Though the bill in this case prays an injunction to restrain the sale of the property of the Midlothian Company then about to be made, it also prays that the deed of trust under which the sale was to be made, may be set aside for usury and fraud. The prayer for the injunction was merely ancillary to the other and principal relief prayed for, its object was only to hold .and preserve the property until the title to it could be litigated and decided. Our opinion is, that section 4, eh. 179, of the Code, does not apply to a case like this; but applies only to what may be called a pure bill of injunction: that is to say, to a bill which has no other \u2022object than an injunction. It is hardly necessary to add, that if it should appear in any case that the prayer for other relief beyond the injunction is merely colorable, and thrown in to give jurisdiction, it will not be allowed to take the case out of the provision of section 4, ch. 179, of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">The Circuit court of Bichmond, therefore, had jurisdiction of the case, and its order dissolving the injunction and dismissing the bill must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The decree was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">The court is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing and filed with the record, that though the bill in this case prays an injunction, it also prays other relief, to which the prayer for an injunction is ancillary; and that the orders of the said Circuit court of Richmond, \u25a0dissolving the injunction and dismissing the bill are erroneous. Therefore it is decreed and ordered that the said orders of the Circuit court of Richmond, dissolving the injunction and dismissing the bill, be reversed and annulled, and that the appellees pay to the appellants their costs by them expended in the prosecution of this appeal; and the cause is remanded to the Chancery court of Richmond for further proceedings, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">Decree Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
