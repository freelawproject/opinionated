Where the record of a court appears on its face to have been regularly signed by the judge who presided at the trial of a cause, parol evidence is not admissible to shew that the proceeedings had not been read in court, and that the record was not signed by the judge until some days after the adjournment of the court for the term.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b170-13\">2. A judge by military appointment in Virginia, holding a court and trying a criminal after the admission of the State into the Union, his act is valid.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-14\">At the February term 1870, of the Hustings court of the city of Richmond, James Quinn, \u00a5m. Clarke and James Logan were indicted for house-breaking. They were tried at the same term of the court, and on the 25th of February were found guilty, and the jury ascertained their term of imprisonment in the penitentiary at three years. They thereupon moved the court for a new trial, which motion was continued until the 12th of March, during the same term, when the motion was overruled by the court: and the prisoners excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-15\">In April, 1870, the prisoners applied for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>to the judge of the Circuit court of the city of Richmond, alleging that they were illegally detained in custody by the sergeant of the city, for transmission to the penitentiary; and they state two grounds of objection to the legality of their imprisonment. The first is, that the order under which they are held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>in custody, purports to have been made by the judge of the Hustings court on the 12th of March, 1870, whilst, in fact, said order was made and signed in the clerk\u2019s office of said court (the court not being then in session), on the 22d day of March, 1870; ten days after the term had expired at which the order purports to be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-6\">The second objection was that C. H. Bramhall, who signed the proceedings of the Hustings court, and claimed to act as judge of the court, was not in law and in fact the judge of the court, and that he exercised the functions of said office without authority of law, at the time of said trial and conviction of the petitioners; and that all his acts as such judge were illegal, null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-7\">The writ was awarded; and upon the hearing the petitioners proposed to introduce parol evidence to prove the fact alleged in the petition, as the ground of their first objection. The introduction of this evidence was objected to by the attorney for the Commonwealth; but the objection was afterwards waived, with the reservation of the benefit of the objection upon the hearing of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-8\">It was then proved by the clerk and deputy clerk of the court, that the minutes of the court of the 12th of March, 1870, were not read in open court and signed by the judge thereof on the same day; but that they were written in full as they now appear upon the order book, and prepared for signature on that day; but they were not in fact signed until the 22d of March subsequent. That the said Bramhall, after the adjournment of the court, on the 12th of March, 1870, left the city, as they understood, for the city of Washington, and did not return in time to hold the March term of the Hustings court upon the first day appointed by law for the holding thereof; that on the day afterwards, to wit: the 22d of March, 1870, he came to the court<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>house, and in the clerk\u2019s office adjoining the courtroom in the presence \u00f3f the clerk, signed his name to the minutes of March 12th; and that the record of said 12th of March was not at anytime before-signing read in open court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-6\">On the second objection,it appeared from the record that Charles H. Bramhall had been appointed by General Stoneman, commander of District Ho. 1, judge of the Circuit court of the city of Richmond; and had duly qualified as such; and that he had been transferred by an order of General Canby, made on the 8th of November, 1869, to be judge of the Hustings court of the city of Richmond; and had duly qualified as such; and as such judge he presided on the trial of the prisoners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-7\">The judge refused to discharge the petitioners, and remanded them to the custody of the sergeant of the city; and they thereupon applied to this court for a writ of error; which was allowed them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b172-8\"><em>Turner, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9z-\">to sustain the first ground of objection to the validity of the judgment of the Hustings court, referred to Styles\u2019 Practical Register, 302; 10 Viner\u2019s Abr. 62, \u00a7\u00a74, 5, old paging; 14 Id.

That is only to be proved by producing it; and it imports absolute verity. He referred to 2 Tuck. Com. 278; <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>The Commomoealth, </em>17 Gratt. 386; <em>Calwell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>Id. 391; <em>The Life and Fire Ins.

They applied to the judge of the Circuit court of said city, for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>which was awarded; and upon a final hearing the petitioners were remanded to the custody of the proper officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The case is before this court upon a writ of error to the order of the Circuit judge. The petitioners base their application for a discharge, upon two grounds: First, that the Hon. Charles H. Bramhall, who presided at said term, being a military appointee of the Federal government, was not authorized to exercise the functions of a judge after the restoration of civil government in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>17 Wisc. R. 521, it was held that where a party was indicted, convicted and sentenced, at a term of a Circuit court held by a person who exercised the office of judge of said court, under an appointment by the governor without authority of law, there being another person entitled to said office, the sentence was, nevertheless, valid and binding. It was so decided upon an application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>after a judgment of ouster had been pronounced against the judge, upon the ground he had been so illegally appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">In the <em>People </em>v. <em>White, </em>24 Wend. R. 520, it was said that where an officer, having an apparent authority to do the act, had rendered judgment between the people and the prisoner, neither party can, in a collateral way, call in question the title pf the judge. The government may try the title by <em>quo warranto; </em>but until that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>is done his acts are valid and effectual, so far as the public and third persons are concerned. And at the \u25a0 present term a majority of this court have decided that the military appointees of the Federal government, exercising judicial functions in this State after its admission into the Union, were <em>de facto </em>judges, and their acts and decisions as such must be respected and obeyed as fully as though they had been officers <em>de jure. </em>And while two of the judges held that the decisions rendered by those who were exercising the functions of judges of the Appellate court might be reviewed by this court, under the provisions of the Enabling Act, they were clearly of opinion that the effect of that act was to make valid the decision of every other court held in Virginia by military appointees after the restoration of civil authority in the State. This decision must be regarded as conclusive against the petitioners upon the question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">The second ground urged for the discharge of the petitioners, is, that the record of the proceedings of the February term was not read in open court by the clerk, nor signed by the judge before the adjournment of the court; but was in fact signed by him in the clerk\u2019s office more than ten days after the adjournment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Petitioners offered parol testimony to establish this fact, which was objected to by the Commonwealth, but was afterwards admitted by consent, with the understanding that the objection might be renewed or insisted on at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">The provisions contained in section 5, chap. 12, Code of 1860, require that the proceedings of every court shall be entered in a book and read in open court. After being corrected, where it is necessary, the record shall be signed by the presiding judge or justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">The statute does not, in express terms, prescribe the time when the record is to be signed. The reasonable inference to be deduced from the language is, that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>to be done immediately after tbe proceedings are read and corrected, and on tbe last day of tbe term, immediately before tbe adjournment. But tbe failure of the judge to comply with the directions of tbe statute could not impair tbe rights of tbe Commonwealth, or those of a citizen, in tbe record as an instrument of evidence, or a muniment of title, or an absolute guaranty against a second prosecution and conviction for an offence already passed upon by a jury. Had tbe petitioners been acquitted, they could never have been questioned a second time for tbe same offence, although tbe judge bad failed to sign tbe recoi'd. In tbe event of such failure, or a refusal on bis part so to do, be might be compelled by <em>mandamus </em>to perform that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">However that may be, if it is essential to tbe validity of a record, it should be read by tbe clerk and signed by tbe judge before tbe adjournment, and nothing upon tbe face of tbe record indicates tbe contrary, tbe law conclusively presumes it was so read and signed; and no averment to tbe contrary will be received. Being regular upon its face, it cannot be assailed by testimony tending to show it is not what it purports to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Tbe effect of the evidence offered by the petitioners was to utterly invalidate the writing as a record, and to deprive it of all faith and verity as such, or it was entirely irrelevant for any purpose. Its admission would have violated a rule universally recognized by tbe courts, that a record imparts such absolute verity that no person against whom it is pronounced shall be permitted to aver anything against it. In 1st Inst. 260, Lord Coke says, tbe rolls being tbe memorials of tbe judges, impart in themselves such absolute verity as they admit of no averment to tbe contrary. And if such a record be alledged, and it be pleaded there is no such record, it shall be tried only by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Carlile, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Ad. 971, 23 Eng. C. L. R. 226, tbe defendant bad been convicted of a seditious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>libel, and brought a writ of error in the Queen\u2019s bench, assigning for errors in fact, that there was but one of the justices named in the command present when the-jury gave their verdict. It appeared, however, from recorc^ a sufficient number of justices were present; and the court held it. not competent to question the fact so stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In <em>Carper </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>5 Gratt. 212, 236, the clerk of the County court endorsed upon a deed that it was acknowledged before him in his office by the parties, and admitted to record, when in fact the deed was executed and acknowledged in .an attorney\u2019s office, some distance from the clerk\u2019s office, though in the same village. It was objected the deed was not good as a recorded deed. Judge Baldwin, delivering the opinion of the court, entered into an elaborate review of all the authorities. He said there might be some force in the objection if the defect appeared on the face of the certificate, but that the proceeding being the final act of. an exclusive jurisdiction, regular upon its face, and manifestly <em>that record </em>evidence which the law appointed for the very purpose, could not be impeached by extraneous testimony. numerous decisions of this court establish the same principle. <em>Harkins v: Forsyth, </em>11 Leigh 294; <em>Taliaferro v. Pryor, </em>12 Gratt. <em>277; Vaughn &amp; als. </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>17 Gratt. 386; and other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The case of <em>Bias &amp; als. </em>v. <em>Floyd Governor, </em>7 Leigh 640, relied on by petitioners\u2019 counsel, asserts nothing in opposition to these views. In that case a recognizance had been taken by a justice of the peace for the appearance of the accused before the Circuit court, and was altered without the consent of the parties, in a material manner, after acknowledgment. In its original form the recognizance was utterly void, for the reason that it did not specify the offence with which the prisoner was charged. As amended, it bound the sure<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ties for the appearance .of their principal to answer a specific charge of felony. Judge Tucker said the authorities were abundant to prove that where a record had been falsified by erasure or interlineation it might be amended and restored to its original form. The absolute verity attributed to records could not be used to give sanction to a forgery, or a fraudulent erasure of the record. It was also held in that case, that the verity of a record could not be assailed incidentally or by plea; but only by motion or rule to correct it in the court where the record is.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">It is obvious there is not the slightest analogy between this case and the one under consideration. The petitioners do not pretend they were not regularly tried and convicted, or that they were prejudiced by the failure of the judge to attach his signature in the manner prescribed by the law. If such were the fact the remedy in the one case would be by writ of error, and in the other by motion or rule in the court where the record is, to make the necessary amendment. All the reasons forbidding the introduction of testimony to contradict the material averments contained in a record equally conspire to forbid its introduction, in the case under consideration, for the purposes indicated. What would the solemn adjudications of the courts avail parties if at any distance of time they are liable to be assailed by parol evidence, resting upon \u201c the uncertain testimony of slippery memory?\u201d What security for the protection of property, or the punishment of crime, would the judicial tribunals afford if one of the parties to eveiy controversy might refuse obedience to the most solemn judicial sentence, or a criminal might demand his discharge from confinement, upon parol proof, that the judge who held the court had omitted the observance of some formality, or even material statutory requirement, regarded as essential to the validity of the record of his proceedings, or the jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tion of Ms court? In the language of judge Tucker, in <em>Harkens </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>\u201cthe demon of mischief could, not suggest a notion better calculated to tM\u2019ow all things, in relation to titles, into their original chaos, than the establishment of the principle here contended for. For these reasons the second .error relied upon by petitioners is overruled, and the judgment of the Circuit court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Christian, J. concurred in the opinion of <em>Staples, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Moncure, P. and Anderson, J. concurred, with the explanation that Bramhall was judge only because confirmed by the act of March 5,1870, called the enabling act.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Judgment arrirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
