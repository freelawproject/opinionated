At the August term, 1870, of the court, the. case was removed to the Corporation court of the city of Alexandria. In that court the case was continued from time to time, for the defendant, until January, 1871, when he was arraigned, and pleaded a special plea to the jurisdiction; which was disallowed; and he then pleaded the general issue. Upon the trial the jury found the defendant guilty of unlawfully, hut not maliciously, wounding with intent to disable, and fixed the term of his imprisonment in the county jail at six months, and assessed his fine at fifty dollars. The defendant then moved in arrest of judgment; but the court overruled the motion, and sentenced him in accordance with the verdict.
