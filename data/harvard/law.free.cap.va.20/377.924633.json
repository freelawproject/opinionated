The cash payment, and first and second notes, are paid in Confederate money, the third is paid four months before it fell due by a compromise, S. taking for it \u00a72,000 in U. S. currency. Bill to enjoin the sale of the house and lot for the payment of the fourth note, alleges that it was given with reference to Confederate currency as the standard of value, and prays that S. might be required to receive payment according to the value of that money at the time of the contract. S. denies this was the contract, and says he was to be paid in the currency of the time the note fell due, and asks the court to adjudicate the question.

Shields sold to Meyer Kraker a house and lot in the city of Richmond, for the sum of $14,500; of which the sum of $4,500 was paid down, and for the balance, $10,000, four negotiable notes were given, at twelve, twenty-four, thirty-six, and forty-eight months after date, each for the siim of $2,500, with interest added from the date to'the maturity of the note: the first being for-$2,650, due 21st November, 1863; the second being for-$2,800, due 21st November, 1864; the third being -for $2,950, due 21st November, 1865; and the fourth being-for $3,100, due 21st November, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">On the day of sale the property was conveyed to thepurehaser, who thereupon conveyed it to a trustee to secure the deferred instalments of the purchase money., Nothing is said in the notes or the deeds about the currency in which payment of the money was to be-made, but the money is described generally as so many dollars. The cash payment was made in Confederate notes. The first deferred instalment, due 21st November, 1863, and the second, due 21st November, 1864, were paid at maturity, in Confederate notes. The third, due 21st November, 1865, was settled more than four-months before it became due, by a compromise effected through the agency of Mr. Wellington Goddin, employed by Kraker for that purpose. By that compromise the sum of $2,000 in legal currency was paid and received in discharge of the note of $2,950. When the fourth and last deferred instalment became due,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>which was on the'21st of November, 1866, Shields demanded payment in legal currency, but Kraker refused to pay in such currency, and insisted that the amount of the note should be scaled, according to the provisions of the act of the General Assembly passed March 3, 1866, Session Acts 1865-6, p. 184, chap. 71; the said Kraker contending that the contract was, according to the true understanding and agreement of the parties, to be fulfilled or performed in Confederate States treasury notes, or was entered into with reference to such notes as a standard of value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-4\">The parties being thus at issue as to their relative rights and obligations in regard to the last note, James M. Taylor, the trustee named in the deed of trust, proceeded, at the request of Shields, to execute the trusts of the deed, by causing the property thereby conveyed to be advertized for sale on the 8th day of April, 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\">On the 28th day of March, 1867, Kraker filed his bill in chancery against Shields and Taylor, in which he said that he was \u201cready and willing to pay off the said last note at the rate of one dollar in legal tender notes for three of Confederate treasury notes; that the contract for the purchase of the said real estate, according to the true understanding and agreement of the parties, was to be performed in Confederate States treasury notes, and was entered into with reference to such notes as a standard of value; and your orator is advised that, by the law of the land, he is not required to pay at a greater rate than that above- mentioned.\u201d He charged that, notwithstanding the premises, the said Taylor, trustee in the said deed of trust, had \u201cadvertised the said property to be sold at public auction on the 8th:day of April next, as will appear by the printed advertisement bearing date March 27th, 1867,\u201d and exhibited with the bill. He said he was advised that if he had no other ground upon which to injoin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>sale, \u201che might do so upon the sole ground that the advertisement does not conform to the requirements of the deed of trust, in this, that the deed requires that the property shall be advertised for twenty days before sale, and the said Taylor has only given twelve days\u2019 notice at most:\u201d and therefore, to the end that full and complete justice might bo done in the premises, he prayed that the said sale might be enjoined, that the said Shields might be compelled to receive payment of the said last note as above proposed by the complainant, and that the latter might have general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-9\">An injunction was accordingly aivarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-10\">On the 6th day of May, 1867, the defendants filed their answers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-11\">The defendant Shields denied \u201cthat the contract for the purchase of said real estate, according to the true understanding and agreement of the parties, was to be performed in Confederate States treasury notes, and was entered into with reference to such notes as a standard of value.\u201d On the contrary, he charged \u201c that the true understanding and agreement of the parties was, expressly, that the said notes, for the deferred instalments of purchase money, were to be paid in the money current at the time the said notes respectively matured.\u201d He said that he, \u201c in good faith and in accordance with the said last-mentioned understanding and agreement, did receive Confederate States treasury notes in payment of all the notes that matured while that money was current in Richmond, although the same had become greatly depreciated, as compared with the value of that money when the said sale was made.\u201d He charged and claimed, \u201c that according to the true undei'standing and agreement of the parties, at the time of said contract and sale, the said note for $3,100, now due and unpaid as aforesaid, was to have been, and ought to be, paid in full, in the legal-tender notes now current, and ought not to be scaled at all.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>He charged further, \u201c that, in consequence of the agreement and understanding as to the currency in which payment was to have been made, and the fact \u2022 that they extended through a period of four years from the date of said sale, and the parties conld not anticipate the character of money in which the payments would be made, there was not the difference between the actual value of said property in coin and its value in Confederate money that was usually made in the sales of real estate in the fall of 1862.\u201d He admitted \u201c that the said deed of trust does require that the property therein mentioned shall be advertised for twenty days, and that the said Taylor, as trustee, only gave about twelve days\u2019 notice, as alleged in said bill.\u201d He said he was informed, and believed that the said sale \u201c was so advertised through inadvertence and mistake of the said trustee.\u201d But, admitting this, he prayed the court \u201c to adjudicate and settle the questions in controversy between the complainant\u201d and himself, \u201cindependent of and additional to that involved in the advertisement of the sale above mentioned,\u201d as he was advised \u201c that said questions are, all of them, the proper subjects of equitable jurisdiction and relief, in such a case as this.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-4\">The defendant Taylor, in his answer, showed that \u201c it was through inadvertence and mistake that only about twelve days\u2019 notice of the sale was given in the advertisement, instead of twenty days, as required by the deed of trust.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\">On or about the 28th of Hovember, 1868, three depositions were taken and filed in the cause; that of Wellington Goddin, in behalf of the plaintiff; and those of James W. Shields, one of the defendants, and D. J. McCormick, in behalf of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">1. Wellington Goddin proved that from November 1st, 1862, to April, 1865, Confederate treasury notes were the only currency in circulation in Richmond, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>and all other parts of the State under the control of the Confederate government. During that period, he - was extensively engaged in the sale of real estate in the said city, and nearly if not all the sales made by him were made with reference to funds current in the several,banks then in existence in the city; and as these banks received and paid out nothing but Confederate treasury notes, that was the kind of currency he expected to receive for all payments made to him during the period aforesaid: as far as his exjierience went, in the absence of any special contract to the contrary, the purchase money was to be paid in such funds as the several banks in Bichmond were in the habit of receiving on deposit at the time of the maturity of the obligation, or the time of the payment of the debt. Being asked by the counsel for the plaintiff, \u201c when sales of real estate were made during the period mentioned, unless it was expressly understood otherwise between buyer and seller, were or were not the deferred payments universally understood to be payable in Confederate treasury notes?\u201d he answered: \u201cNo, sir; according to my experience during that period, if the terms of sale required cash, Confederate treasury notes would have been received in payment, be'eause such funds were current in all the banks of the city at that time; if the terms of sale were partly cash and partly on credit, the credit payments were to be discharged in such funds as the said banks were in the habit of receiving at the time of the maturity of such payments.\u201d Being asked, on cross-examination, \u201c\"What was the currency or circulation receivable in the banks of Bichmond in November, 1865, and November, 1866?\u201d he answered, \u201cBy the fall of the Confederacy, in April, 1865, all the State banks then in Virginia were destroyed; in a few months thereafter a few national banks were established in the city; and in November, 1865, and November, 1866, Federal currency, some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>times called greenbacks, constituted tbe only currency in this city.\u201d Tbe witness then gave an account of the compromise he had effected, as agent of the plaintiff, with the defendant Shields, of the third deferred instalment due on the 21st of November, 1865; after which he stated that he was well acquainted Avith the value of the house and lot in question in November, 1862, and also in November, 1865 and 1866. According to his best judgment, the specie value of the property before the war was about $10,000, and he thought it was worth in specie, in November, \u201962, what it was worth prior to the war. In the summer of 1865, and thereafter till the close of the year, real estate in the city sold at higher prices than had been obtained for many years before. In his opinion, this property would have sold, in November, 1865, for between $15,000 and $16,000. Neal estate continued to sell high till the spring of 1866, when it began to recede, and has continued since to decline. In his opinion, in November, 1866, the property would have brought, in \u201cgreenbacks,\u201d from $10,000 to $12,000. Such was the depressed condition of real estate in the city at the time of giving his deposition, that the property would not then sell for more than $7,000 or $7,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-4\">2. I). J. McCormick proved that he has resided in Niehmond since March, 1862. A week or a few days before Kraker purchased the lot of Shields, Kraker and witness went to the workshop where Shields was working, to see about the property. \"Witness gave the following account of that visit and interview: \u201cWe talked a great deal on the way going there, and at the workshop.\" I do not recollect that there were any terms asked for concerning the property, but I remember telling Mr. Kraker, at the shop, to buy the property, if possible, for cash. If. not, to make as short notes as possible\u2014short time as possible; telling him, at the same time, that the war would be over in per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>haps less than two years, and Mr. Shields, after the-war, would have as much interest in the property as it \u25a0 would then he worth. I told him that I thought Mr., Shields was a very smart man, and that if he would sell all his property in that way he would do well, as. he would have a large income during the war, and his property, perhaps, he of full value after the war, with these notes resting upon him.\u201d Witness proved that Kraker offered to pay Shields cash for the property, hut Shields refused, saying he would not sell for cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-9\">3. Janies W. Shields deposed, among other things, as follows: \u201c Mr. Kraker came to me, and desired to. purchase the middle tenement of the Mansion House, owned by me, on Main street, and desired to know on what terms I would sell it. I told him, as well as I recollect, that I would take $14,500 : I think, $4,500-cash, the balance in one, two, three and four years, secured by deed of trust, with four negotiable notes, hearing even date therewith, and with interest from the date, negotiable and payable in bank, in whatever was current at the time the notes became due. He then demurred from that, and desired to purchase for cash. I declined to sell on any other terms than the terms, stated. He said that he would give me a decisive answer the next day. He called and concluded to purchase the property on those conditions, and I sold it to. him on those conditions; and, since the making of the contract, I have received the depreciated currency for the notes as they became due, consisting of two notes in full, and the third note, a part of it was received by way of compromise in \u201c greenbacks.\u201d He desired to-give me his individual note, with personal security, for the fourth note, payable in greenbacks, if I would release the deed of trust. The contract for the house was made about the 18th of November, 1862, and executed about the 21st of November, 1862.\u201d \u201c I had an offer from Mr. Litchenstein of $14,000 cash. This was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u25a0some few months before I sold to Kraker, and refused it. I would not sell for cash. I hacT5, also, an offer from Mr. Jacobs to purchase for <em>cash; </em>but, as I peremptorily told him I would not sell for cash, no particular amount was named.\u201d Being asked, \u201cWhy would you not sell for cash ?\u201d witness answered, \u201c Because money was depreciating every day, and I expected that, in a year or so at most, I would get a better currency.\u201d Being asked, \u201cDid you assign any reason to Mr. Kraker for declining to take cash, and, if so, what reason?\u201d witness answered, \u201c I think I told Mr. Kraker, am pretty certain of it, it is a long time since, that I wouldn\u2019t sell for cash, because I thought that in a year or two the currency would be better. If he chose to take it at that risk, he could do so. I wasn\u2019t anxious to sell the property.\u201d <em>After </em>stating that he had received the cash payment, and first two deferred instalments, falling due in November 1863 and 1864, in Confederate currency, and the third instalment, falling due in November 1865, in part in greenbacks by a compromise, he was asked, \u201c How did this compromise or settlement occur between you?\u201d to which he answered, \u201c I was pressed for money at that time, and went to him a little while before this third note was due.. I offered to knock off \u00a7150 from the face of that note, if he would cash it and pay me the balance. He told me he would give me an answer that evening. He went to Mr. 'Wellington Goddin, and employed him to manage the matter for Mm. Mr. Goddin said that any settlement <em>he </em>would make, Mr. Kraker would abide by. The money was paid in the presence of Mr. Goddin, by his award and settlement between us.\u201d Being enquired of, as to the grounds of the compromise, he answered, it was \u201c according to the value, as well as I recollect, of the property.\u201d Being asked whether either of the houses adjoining on either side of the tenement in question was sold in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>1865, lie answered, \u201c There was one about three doors below. I think Straus\u2019s house was sold in 1865 or \u20196, a much inferior house, for $17,000, at public auction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-9\">In this state of the cause, it came on to be heard on the 8th day of February, 1869, on the bill and exhibits, the answers and general replications thereto, and the depositions of the witnesses aforesaid, when the court decreed \u201c that this cause be referred to one of the commissioners of this court, to ascertain and report, whether the contract for the purchase of the real estate in the bill and proceedings mentioned, according to the true understanding and agreement of the parties thereto, was to be performed in Confederate States treasury notes, and was entered into with reference to such notes as a standard of value; or whether the notes given by the complainant, as .alleged in the bill and proceedings, for the deferred instalments of the purchase money of said real estate, were to be paid, according to the true understanding and agreement of the parties, in whatever money was current at the time the said deferred instalments, respectively matured, and became due and payable. And the said commissioner is also required to ascertain and report which, if any, of said deferred instalments of purchase money are now in arrear and unpaid, and the amount thereof, as appears by the face of the papers; and what money was current at the time the same became due and payable.

That the notes given by the complainant, as alleged in the bill and proceedings, for the deferred instalments of the purchase money of the said real es-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>late, were to be paid, according to tbe true understanding and agreement of the parties, in whatever money was current at the time the said deferred instalments, respectively matured, and became due and payable; 2dly. That the fourth or last of said deferred instalments, amounting, as appears by the face of the papers, to $3,100, with interest thereon from the 24th day of November, 1866, until paid, is now in arrear and unpaid; and, 3dly. That at the time the said <em>deferred </em>\u25a0instalment, which is still in arrear and unpaid, became due and payable, federal currency, sometimes called greenbacks, constituted the only currency in the city of Richmond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-4\">To this report two exceptions were taken by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-5\">On the 25th of February, 1869, the cause came on again to be heard upon the papers formerly read, and upon the report of commissioner Pleasants and the exceptions thereto, on consideration whereof the court recommitted the said report to the said commissioner \u2022on the exceptions thereto, and directed him to report to the court the reasons upon which the conclusions in his said report are founded. And the said comrnis.sioner was further directed to take any additional evidence that might be offered by either party, and to report to the court his proceedings under the said order, with any matter deemed pertinent by himself or required to be reported by either of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-6\">On the 5th of March, 1869, commissioner Pleasants made his report under the last mentioned order, and there were returned with his report two depositions taken before him, both of them in behalf of the plaintiff; to wit, the deposition of the plaintiff himself, Meyer Eraker, and that of his brother Julius Eraker. M. Eraker deposed that there was no understanding between himself and Shields, except what was in the \u2022contract, about the kind of money in which the pay-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>meats were to be made. The property, at the time he-bought it, was worth about five thousand or five thou- \u25a0 sand five hundred dollars in gold. It was in very bad condition at that time, and when he took possession of it, about half a year thereafter; the repairs have cost him about $2,000 in good money. He did not offer to pay Shields for the property in cash in Confederate money. Mr. McCormick advised witness to pay cash for the property, telling him that it would be a great thing for him to do so. But witness had not the money to pay for the property in cash, and so told Mr. McCormick.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-9\">Julius Kraker deposed that he was well acquainted, with the property, and presumed that its value in gold at the time of the said purchase, was between five and six thousand dollars. There were also two papers returned with said report marked \u201cY\u201d and \u201cX,\u201d the former being an extract from the books of the auditor\u2019s office in Richmond, showing that the said property was assessed on thqse books for 1860 at $8,992; and the latter being an extract from the deed conveying the said property to Shields, dated 20th February, 1854, showing the consideration of the deed to be $7,800. The commissioner* reported his reasons at length for his former report, and that upon the new evidence taken, there did not appear to be any ground for changing it. He therefore readopted his former report, and made it a part of his last report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-10\">To this last report the plaintiff\u2019s counsel again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-11\">On the 9th of March, 1869, the cause came on again to be heard, when the court overruled the complainant\u2019s said exceptions to the -said reports respectively, and decreed that the said reports be confirmed, and that the .defendant Shields recover against the plaintiff' Meyer Kraker the sum of $3,100, with legal interest thereon from the 21st day of Hovember, 1866, until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>paid, and Ms costs by bim about Ms defence in that behalf expended; and the court further decreed that the injunction be dissolved and the bill dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">On the 12th of March, 1869, \u201cit appearing to the satisfaction of the court that the several deferred instalments of purchase money in the bill and proceedings mentioned were, according to the true intent and meaning of the parties, to be discharged in the money current at the times of the maturity of said instalments respectively, and that all of said instalments have been paid except the last, which is the subject of litigation in this cause; that said last instalment matured on the 21st day of November, 1866, on which last named day the money known as United States legal tender notes, and the notes issued by the several national banks of the United States, constituted the money current at that time, and which were of equal value, the court \u2022ordered that the said decree of the 9th of March, 1869, in favor of the defendant Shields against the plaintiff Meyer Kraker, should be so amended and modified as that the same may be discharged in such lawful money \u25a0of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">From the said decree the plaintiff applied for an \u2022appeal to this court, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-6\"><em>Hallyburton </em>and Lyons, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-7\"><em>Henry A.

But, before I do so, it seems to be proper, by way of explanation, to say something in regard to Minnie H. Kraker, wife of Meyer Kraker, and a co-plaintiff in the suit and co-appellant in the appeal. A great deal is said about her in the record; and in the earlier-period of the litigation her interest in the subject seemed to be a matter of some importance. Her husband caused the property to be conveyed to <em>her, </em>and the notes and deed of trust to be executed in <em>her name; </em>the vendor, Shields, believing that the property was conveyed to her husband, and that the notes and deed of trust were executed by him and in his name.. Shields complained that a fraud was practiced upon him in this respect; but Kraker denied that any such fraud was intended. But however that may be, it seems to be conceded by the parties, and properly so, that her rights, if she have any, and whatever they may be, are in subordination to those of Shields, to whom her husband and the property are liable for the purchase money, just as if the property had been conveyed, to him in his own name, and as if he, in his own name,, had executed the notes and deed of trust. Her name, therefore, need not be noticed, either in the statement of the ease or in this opinion, though possibly I may have occasion to refer to it again before I conclude. I. will now proceed to consider the assignments of error;; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">1st. That \u201cthe case was one not proper for a reference to a commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">The Code, chapter 175, \u00a7 2, provides for the appointment of commissioners in chancery, but does not prescribe their particular duties, except as to taking ae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>counts. It declares that \u201ceach court may, from time to time, appoint commissioners in chancery, or for stating accounts, who shall he removable at its plea- - sure; there shall not he more than three such commissioners in office at the same time, for the same court.\u201d \u00a74 declares that \u201cevery commissioner shall examine and report upon such accounts <em>and matters </em>as may he referred to him by any court.\u201d The act to establish Circuit Superior courts, passed April 16th, 1831, provided that the said courts \u201c shall have power to appoint commissioners in chancery, not exceeding two for each court, for taking and reporting such accounts <em>or other matters </em>as such courts shall commit to them to be examined, stated and reported.\u201d Sup. to B. Co. 1819, p. 164, \u00a7 76. The duties of a commissioner in chancery in this State are considered to he, generally, the same with those of a master in chancery in England, whose duties are set forth in the books of chancery practice in that country; as, for instance, in 2 Daniel\u2019s Chancery PI. and Pr., sec. 7, pp. 1345-1503. That writer, in pointing out the course to he pursued in the Master\u2019s office, upon the particular reference before Mm, says: \u201cThe objects, however, for which references to a Master may he made, are so numerous and various, that it would he impossible, in a treatise of this nature, specifically to detail the course of proceeding which should he adopted in each;\u201d and he therefore confines his attention to the most usual subjects of reference, by analogy to which the proper steps to he pursued in other cases may he inferred. \u201cDeferences to the Master upon decrees or decretal orders,\u201d he says, \u201care either\u20141. To make enquiries; 2. -To take accounts and make computations; or, 3. To perform some special ministerial acts directed by the court. Inquiries by the Master are directed either to persons or to facts, though sometimes they are directed to matters of law; hut it is, in general, in those cases only where the law comes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>in as a matter of fact, as in the case of an enquiry into the law of a foreign country, that the Master is ever - directed to enquire into the law; the habit of the court not being to refer abstract questions of law to the opinion of the Masters. Sometimes, however, questions of law are so mixed up with the fact to be ascertained, that it is not possible to decide upon the one, without giving an opinion as to the others. In such case, the Master is bound to give his opinion upon the law, as well as upon the matter of fact referred to him; as, in the case of a reference to a Master to enquire whether a good title can be made to'land, &amp;c. The most usual cases in which inquiries as to persons are directed to be made by a Master, are those in which it is necessary to ascertain the heir at law or next of kin of a deceased person. The same sort of enquiry is also frequently directed for the purpose of ascertaining the individuals forming a particular class,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cA similar inquiry is also necessary where it is referred to the Master to take an account of the debts due by a particular individual, such account involving, necessarily, an inquiry who the creditors are, as well as into the amount of their claims.\u201d Id. p. 1399-1400. See also 1 Smith\u2019s Ch. Pr., pp. 10 and 11, and 2 Id. p. 96; 1 Barbour\u2019s Ch. Pr. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The question when it is proper, or may be useful, to resort to the aid of a commissioner, is one which addresses itself to the sound discretion of the court, and as to which a large latitude of discretion must be allowed to the court; though of course the court ought to exercise such discretion soundly, to prevent unnecessary expense or delay; which seem to be the chief, if not the only evils, -of an improper reference. The court is responsible for the correct decision of the cause, and cannot shift such responsibility from its own shoulders to those of a commissioner. But it can avail itself of the assistance of a commissioner to prepare the cause and jdaee it in the best possible state to ena<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>He the court to decide it correctly. The most invaluable assistance may be afforded to the court by the agency of an intelligent, skilful, and experienced com- \u25a0 missioner. He has often an advantage, which the court has not, in seeing and hearing the witnesses give their testimony, and being thus better able to judge of its weight. And where he acts only on the proofs already in the cause, as he often does, he may afford important aid to the court by deducing the material facts of the case from a large mass of testimony, and enabling counsel, by means of exceptions to his report, to make up and present to the court the only issues requiring its decision in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">According to the foregoing principles, I do not think the Circuit court erred in referring the cause to one of its commissioners, \u201cto 'ascertain and report whether the contract for the purchase of the real es-' tate in the bill and proceedings mentioned, according to the true understanding and agreement of the parties thereto, was to be performed in Confederate States treasury notes, and was entered into with reference to \u25a0such notes as a standard of value; or whether the notes given by the complainant, as alleged in the bill and proceedings, for the deferred instalments of'the-purchase money of said real estate was to b.e paid, according to the true understanding and agreement of the parties, in whatever money was current at the time the said deferred instalments, respectively matured, and became due and payable;\u201d nor in the other directions given to the commissioner, by the decree off the 8th of February, 1869. If there were any such error, it was certainly not to the prejudice of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">2d. That \u201c the court should have ordered an issue to be tried before a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">I do not think that the cas\u00e9 was a proper one for an issue. There was no conflict of testimony in the case when it was referred to a commissioner. The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>testimony then .taken, was that of Goddin, for the plaintiff, and that of Shields and McCormick, for the - defendant. And, even after the depositions of the two Krakers, Meyer and Julius, were taken by the commissioner, there was not such a conflict in the testimony as to make an issue necessary or proper. Even where there is a conflict of evidence, it does not necessarily follow that there must be an issue; but the court-may decide the cause without one, if its conscience is satisfied. 2 Rob. Pr. old ed. 354, and cases cited. In the case of a bill? contesting the validity of a will, a court of equity is bound to have the issue which is; made up tried by a jury. But, in other cases, the: court will determine, according. to its discretion, whether it does or does not want the assistance of a-jury. Id. p. 352. Of course the court must exercise-its discretion soundly. The court may often, at it&amp; election, direct an issue,- or refer a question to a commissioner. There are some questions which seem more properly to belong to a jury, if indeed they do-not belong exclusively to a jury, in case the conscience of the court is not satisfied; such, for example, are-questions involving fraud, or the genuineness of a. deed. Id. On the other hand, there are questions which seem more properly to belong to a commissioner, although they may be made the subjects of an issue: as, for instance, a question as to -rents and profits of land in controversy in a suit in equity. Id. 362; Green, J., in <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>2 Rand. 93, 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">3d. That \u201c it was error to render a decree in favor ofi the defendant againt the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">It is a general rule that no person but a plaintiff can. entitle himself to a decree; but it is admitted that there are exceptions to this rule. In. a bill in equity-for an account, both parties are deemed actors, when the cause is before the court,upon.its merits; and, if a, balance is ultimately found in favor of the defendant,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>he is entitled to a decree for such balance against the plaintiff. 1 Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7 522. A plaintiff, by applying to a court of equity for an account, subjects himself to a decree for any balance which may be found due from him to the defendant.- 2 Sob. Pr. old ed. p. 405. This is not 'the only exception to the rule; but any case, falling within the same principle, is for the same reason an exception to it. This case falls within the same principle. The plaintiff might have filed his bill solely upon the ground that less than twenty days notice of the sale, as required by the deed, had been given by the trustee; and upon the admission in the answer of the fact of such defective notice, a sale under that notice would have been perpetually enjoined. Indeed, if that had been the only ground of 'the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, he might have obtained relief without coming into court for it. The defective notice was no doubt given by inadvertence merely, as the defendants alleged; and the error would, therefore, have been corrected on request. But the plaintiff had other grounds of complaint, which would have carried him into a court of equity to stop a sale under the deed of trust, if there had been no ground of objection to the notice. He charges in his bill, \u201cthat all the notes mentioned in the said deed of trust, except the last, have been fully paid off by your orator, and he is now ready and willing to pay off the said last note at the rate of one dollar in legal tender notes for three of Confederate treasury notes; the contract for the purchase of the said real estate, according to the true understanding and agreement of the parties, was to be performed in Confederate States treasury notes, and was entered into with reference to such notes as a standard of value; and your orator is advised that, by the law of the land, he is not required to pay at a greater rate than that above mentioned.\u201d And he prays, among other things, that the court would compel the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Shields to accept the sum in legal tender notes, as above proposed, and grant such other and further re- - lief as the case might require. On the other hand, the defendant Shields, in his answer, \u201c denies that the contract, for the purchase of said real estate, according to the true understanding and agreement of the parties, was to he performed in Confederate States treasury notes, and was entered into with reference to such notes as a standard of value. On the contrary,\u201d he \u201c charges that the true understanding and agreement of the parties was, expressly, that the said notes for the deferred instalments of purchase money were to be paid in the money current at the time the said notes respectively matured.\u201d And he prays the court \u201c to adjudicate and settle the questions in controversy between \u201d the parties, <em>\u201c </em>as he is advised that the said questions are all of them the proper subjects of equitable jurisdiction and relief in such a case as this.\u201d To this answer the plaintiff replied generally; and the parties, being thus at issue upon these questions, proceeded to take evidence to sustain their respective views, and the case progressed to a final decree, which turned out to be in favor of the defendant. He is entitled to the benefit of it, as he would have been bound by it, if it had turned out to be against him. Both parties invoked the decision of the court upon their controversy, which was a proper subject of equitable jurisdiction, properly brought before the court, and both ought to abide the result. <em>\u201c </em>The court,\u201d it is said, <em>u </em>had no authority to render any decree, except to perpetuate the injunction, or dissolve it and dismiss the bill. The re.eord now exhibits,\u201d it is- further said, \u201c the singular case of a bill dismissed, with costs, which put the case out of court, and yet a moneyed decree in favor of the defendant, with no bill or petition to sustain it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">The true relative position of the parties to the suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>was reversed by the manner in which the controversy arose. The defendant was the creditor, and was in substance the plaintiff; while the nominal plaintiff was \u25a0 the debtor, and was in substance the defendant in the suit. The court, having adjudicated the controversy and determined that the plaintiff owed to the defendant a certain sum of money and interest, properly rendered a personal decree therefor, notwithstanding the real estate for which the money was due was also liable for its payment. If any other reason were required to vindicate the propriety of such a decree, it might be found in the fact that the plaintiff caused the property to be conveyed to his wife, who may therefore be entitled to it unless the sale of it be necessary to satisfy the defendant\u2019s demand, in case the personal decree rendered therefor should prove ineffectual in whole or in part. If it' could be said in this ease, as was said in <em>Mettert\u2019s adm\u2019or </em>v. Hagan, 18 Gratt. 231, that according to the strict rules of pleading, a cross bill was necessary, it might at least as well be said here as there, that the answer \u201c may, for that purpose, be treated as a cross bill, so as to enable the court to do complete justice in this cause.\u201d The dismission of the bill was irregular. But that irregularity can easily be cured by amending the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">I do not think there is anything in the case of <em>Medley </em>v. <em>Pannill\u2019s </em>adm\u2019or, 1 Rob. R. 63, cited and relied on by the learned counsel of the appellants, to show that it was. error to render a decree in favor of the defendant against the plaintiff in this case, which is at all in conflict with what I have said .on the subject. The decision in that case was founded on peculiar circumstances which are set forth in the opinion of Judge Allen therein, and do not exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">4th. That \u201cthe decree is erroneous, in being for interest upon the whole sum called for by the note, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>part of it being interest, and therefore not bearing it, such interest being compound.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">There was no agreement to pay compound interest. The interest on the deferred instalments for the time they had to run was added to the principal, and notes taken for the aggregate amounts respectively. Default having been made in the payment of the last note, the whole amount of it properly bears interest from the day it became payable. There is nothing usurious or illegal in this. In fact, the interest included in the notes is a part of the purchase money of the land, and in effect principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">5th. That \u201cthe decree, upon the testimony, should have been in favor of the plaintiff, if any was rendered without a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">The bill alleges that \u201cthe contract for the purchase of the said real estate, according to the true understanding and agreement of the parties, was to be performed in Confederate States treasury notes, and was entered into with reference to such notes as a standard of value.\u201d The answer denies this allegation in the Very words in which it is made; and charges, on the contrary, \u201cthat the true understahding and agreement of the parties was, expressly, that the said notes for the deferred instalments of purchase money were to be paid in the money current at the time the said notes respectively matured.\u201d If the case had stood alone upon bill and answer when the decree for a reference was made, there could have been no doubt of the defendant\u2019s right to a decree, according to his version.of the contract. How was that right affected by the evidence which was then in the cause? But three witnesses had then been examined; one of them, Wellington Goddin, for the plaintiff, and the other two, McCormick, and Shields himself, for the defendant. God-din knew nothing about the contract, and testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\u2022chiefly as to a compromise of the third note before it' became due; which has no material bearing upon the case. But being asked by the plaintiff \u201cWhen sales of real estate were made during the period mentioned,\u201d which was from November 1, 1862, to April, 1865, \u201cunless it was expressly understood otherwise between the buyer and seller, were or were not the deferred payments universally understood to be payable in Confederate treasury notes?\u201d He answered, \u201cNo, sir; according to my experience, during that period, if the terms of sale required cash, Confederate treasury notes would have been received in payment, because such funds were current in all the banks of this city at that time. If the terms of sale were partly cash and partly on credit, the credit payments were to be discharged in such funds as the said banks were in the habit of receiving at the time of the maturity of such payments.\u201d This evidence certainly supports the view taken in the answer. As to the two witnesses examined for the defendant, McCormick testified that he urged the plaintiff to buy the property, if possible, for cash; if not, on as short credit as possible; and that the plaintiff accordingly offered to pay cash, but Shields refused to sell the property for cash. The reason of the witness for giving this advice is plainly apparent, \u2022and must have been known to the plaintiff. Witness \u2022says he told \u201c him, at the same time, that the war would be over in perhaps less than two years, and Mr. Shields, \u2022after the war, would have as much interest in the property as it would then be worth.\u201d The defendant, \u2022Shields, testified to the facts stated in his answer. He .said that some few months before he sold the property to the plaintiff, Mr. Latehenstein offered him $14,000 \u2022cash for it, but he would not sell for cash. He had also an offer from Mr. Jacobs to purchase for cash, but peremptorily told him he would not sell for cash. His .reason for not selling for cash was, because money was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>0 depreciating every day, and he expected that in a year or so, at most, he would get a better currency. He - said that the plaintiff offered to purchase from him for cash, and was very anxious for him to take it; but he refused, for the reason before mentioned. Being asked, \u201cDid you assign any reason to Mr. Kraker for declining to take cash, and if so, what reason?\u201d his answer was: \u201cI think I told Mr. Kraker\u2014am pretty certain of it\u2014 it is a long time since\u2014that I wouldn\u2019t sell for cash, because I thought that in a year or two the currency would be better. If he chose to take it at that risk he could do so. I wasn\u2019t anxious to sell the property.\u201d This testimony in behalf of the defendant also strongly sustains his answer; and the Circuit court, in that state of the case, would have been well warranted in rendering a decree against the plaintiff for the amount of the last note and interest, payable in the currency which existed at the time of its maturity. But, instead of that, the court referred the case to a commissioner; which could only have been done for the benefit, if not at the instance, of the plaintiff. Certainly, that decree was not to the prejudice of the plaintiff; though I do not mean to say that, under the circumstances of the case, it was not a proper decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">The commissioner made a report sustaining the defendant\u2019s claim; to which report the plaintiff excepted, and the report and exceptions were recommitted to the commissioner with directions to report the reasons for \u2019 his conclusions, and to take any additional evidence that might be offered by either party. The commissioner made another report under that order, giving his reasons, reaffirming his former conclusions, and returning with his report two depositions taken before him in behalf of the plaintiff, to wit, the depositions of the plaintiff himself, Meyer Kraker, and of his brother Julius. These depositions do not materially vary the case. The plaintiff testified that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>no understanding about tbe kind of money in which the payments were to be made, except what was in the contract. And that when he was negotiating with Mr. Shields for the purchase of the property he did <em>not </em>offer to pay him in cash for it in Confederate money; though he admitted that Mr. McCormick advised him if possible, to buy the property for cash, and told him it would be a great thing for him to pay for it in cash. <em>We </em>have seen that both McCormick and Shields testified that the plaintiff did offer to pay cash for the property. But, however that may be, I think the decree which has been rendered against him is plainly right. The sale was made in November, 1862, at a time when Confederate money had already depreciated to two and a half for one, compared with gold, and was rapidly depreciating in value. The property was sold for $14,500, of which the sum of $4,500 was paid in cash in Confederate notes, and for the balance, $10,000, with interest from the date, negotiable notes were given, payable at one, two, three and four years after date. It was evident, from these long credits, that Shields expected that before they would all mature there would be a better currency, and intended that the notes should be payable in the money current at the time they respectively matured. And it is certain the plaintiff knew that such was the expectation and intention of Shields. For the plaintiff admits that McCormick advised him to buy the property, if possible, for cash, and told him it would be a great thing for him to' pay for it in cash. How could it be so except that by paying cash for the property he would avoid the risk of loss from an improvement in the currency before the notes, or some of them, would mature? Probably no man in the South, in November, 1862, expected the war to last four years longer. Most persons expected it to end in a much shorter time, perhaps in one or two years, and all, no doubt, believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>that however the war might terminate it would be followed by a better currency. The parties, in their contract, therefore, speculated upon the duration of the war and change of the currency. It turned out that the war lasted until April, 1865; longer, no doubt, than either party expected; and that Confederate money continued to be the currency of the country until the end of the war, although it rapidly depreciated in value all the time. Besides the cash payment of $4,500, which was made in Confederate money, the first two deferred instalments matured during the war, and were also paid in Confederate money, then, and especially when the second note became due on the 21st of November, 1864, reduced to a very low ebb. The last two notes, the'third and fourth, matured after the war, in November, 1865 and 1866. The third was compromised and settled more than four months before it became due, by the payment of $2,000 dollars in greenbacks, though the nominal amount of the note was $2,950. The fourth now only remains due, and is the subject of controversy in this suit. I think the plaintiff is bound to pay the amount of it, with interest from the time of its maturity, in the money which was current at that time, according to the decree of the Circuit court. It was argued that if an improvement of currency was contemplated by the parties, it was of <em>Confederate </em>currency, and that it could not have been expected or intended that payment should be made in <em>Federal </em>currency. No doubt these parties believed, as did most people in the Confederate States, that the war would terminate favorably to them, and, therefore, that any improvement which might take place in the currency would probably be of Confederate currency. But they also knew that the war might terminate otherwise; and, however it might terminate, it must have been intended by the parties, as is certainly right and proper, that the vendor should be paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>for Ms property by tbe vendee who enjoys it. The terms of the contract, the justice of the case and the presumed intention of the parties alike, apply to currency existing at the time of the maturity of the notes, whether it was Confederate or Federal. On this subject see what is said by this court in <em>Boulware </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>18 Gratt. 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Upon the whole, I think there is no error in the decree of the Circuit court to the prejudice of the appellant. But I think there are two defects in the decree which ought to be corrected, and wMch may be corrected by an amendment. In the first place, the bill ought not to have'been dismissed, and so much of the \u2022decree as dismisses it ought to be set aside. In the second place, the decree ought to be so amended as to reserve liberty to the defendant Shields, in case the \u2022decree rendered in his favor against the plaintiff personally should prove ineffectual in whole or in jiart, to \u2022apply to the court, by petition or motion in this cause, for further relief by a sale of the property for the satisfaction of the said decree, or so much thereof as may remain unpaid. I am therefore for affirming the decree, when so amended, with damages and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of <em>Mon-cure, </em>P.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Decree <em>amended and affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
