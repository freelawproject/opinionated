In 1863, the council sold the bonds of the city, to be issued, at public auction for Confederate money, and for a bond of $5,000, bearing sixjper <em>cent, </em>interest, and payable at the end of twenty years, the purchaser gave $11,050; Confederate currency being at the time as ten for one of gold. This is usury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-11\">This was an action of assumpsit, in the Circuit court of Pittsylvania, brought in February, 1867, by \"William T. Sutherlin against the town of Danville, to recover three years\u2019 interest upon a certificate of debt of said town for five thousand dollars, bearing date the 1st of September, 1863, and payable in twenty years from its date, with interest at the rate of six <em>per cent, per annum, </em>payable semi-annually. The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>and usury; upon which pleas issues were joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-12\">On the trial the jury found a special verdict, from which it appeared that, on the 10th of August, 1863, the council of the town of Danville adopted a resolution that the president of the council be authorized to sell bonds of the corporation, in sums of $500 and $1,000 each, to the amount of $30,000, as follows: ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>thousand payable each in ten, fifteen and twenty years, interest payable at six <em>per </em>centum, semi-annually, on the 1st of January and 1st of July of each year; to be sold at public auction or private sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIU\">In pursuance of this resolution, John W. Holland, president of the council, advertised in the Danville <em>Register </em>a sale to be made on the 26th of August, in the town of Danville, at the auction store of Heal &amp; Sword, of corporation bonds of the town of Danville, to the amount of $30,000, payable with six <em>per </em>centum, semi-annually, in ten and\u2019twenty years. And in pursuance of this notice, Holland proceeded to sell at auction the said bonds, when 'William. T. Sutherlin purchased a bond of $5,000, payable at twenty years, at the price of $11,050, which he paid at the time of the sale in Confederate currency; that being the only currency then in use in the State, and being at a discount of ten in such currency for one dollar in gold. The certificates were not then prepared, but they were prepared soon after, and a certificate for $5,000, payable to Sutherlin at the end of twenty years, with interest, as directed by the resolution, was delivered to him. On the face of the certificate it is said to be according to the provisions of an ordinance passed by the council of the said town of Danville, in pursuance of an act of the General Assembly passed the 7th day of March, 1862.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-7\">The act of March 7, 1862, to amend the charter of the town of Danville, \u00a7 22, provides that the \u201ccouncil may contract loans and issue certificates of debt, and provide a sinking fund for the payment of the same; but no loan contracted shall be irredeemable for a longer period than thirty-four years; nor shall the outstanding debt of said corporation at any one time exceed the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars.\u201d And the same power existed under the charter of 1854.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-8\">Hpon this special verdict, the Circuit court rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>a judgment for the plaintiff for nine hundred dollars, with interest thereon from the 12th day of August, 1867, till paid, and his costs. And thereupon the town \u25a0 of Danville took the case to the District court of appeals at Lynchburg, where the judgment was affirmed; and there was then an application to this court for a supersedeas, which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b589-4\"><em>Ould Carrington </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-5\">I. The town of Danville had no authority, under its charter, either to pass the resolution of the 10th of August, 1868, or to issue the bonds named therein. It had no right either \u201cto contract loans or cause to be issued certificates of debt or bonds,\u201d for the purposes mentioned in said resolution. The bonds being issued without authority, and certifying in their endorsement the illegal ordinance under which they were issued, are null and void. <em>Zabriskie </em>v. <em>Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad Co., </em>23 How.

The authority \u201cto contract loans and issue certificates of debt or bonds,\u201d does not confer the right, to sell the certificates or bonds. <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Town of Sterling, </em>23 New York R. 456, 460.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-7\">HL Even if the transactions set forth in the record, were those of purchase and sale, being speculative in their character, they were <em>ultra vires. </em>The city had no. right, under its charter, to traffic in depreciated securities, and especially in the promissory notes of its citizens. The power to contract loans, or to issue certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>cates of debt or bonds, does not include tbe authority purchase a depreciated circulating medium, or promissory notes to be paid in depreciated currency. See <em>Tallmage </em>v. <em>Pell, </em>3 Seld. R. 325, and the authorities cited on first point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">IV. <em>The transactions set forth in the record are usurious.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-8\">1. It is admitted that a <em>bona fide sale 'or purchase of notes or stocks of third parties </em>for more than their market value, not exceeeding par, is not usurious, though the strong presumption in any such cases, where the parties know that more than the market value is paid, is that the transaction is not in fact a sale, but a loan. The burthen of proof in such case is on the vendor, to rebut the presumption of a loan by the facts. Where the transaction is found in contemplation of law, or in fact, to be a loan, whatever it may be called, the mere fact that more than their market value is given or agreed to be given, makes the transaction usurious. <em>In all cases of loan, </em>whether so-called or not, the taking of more than lawful rates <em>on value </em>is usurious. <em>Mumford </em>v. <em>Amer. Life Ins. Co., </em>4 Comst. R. 463, 474, 476.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-9\">2. Some transactions are necessarily loans, whatever they may be called. Thus a party cannot sell his own obligation, nor can any person purchase it from him. The first is a <em>borrower of the value </em>which he receives, and the latter is a lender or investor of that value. If more than legal rates on value be taken, the transaction is usurious, how much soever both parties may insist it is a sale and purchase. The nature of the transaction is not changed by calling it \u201c an exchange of securities\u201d or an \u201cexchange of credits,\u201d or a \u201csale of a commodity,\u201d as the appellees have done in these cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-10\">So, there cannot be such a thing <em>as a sale or purchase on credit, </em>even of stocks or other securities, including -the obligations of third parties, for more than their market value, <em>and exceeding par; </em>no matter what may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>be the form of such a transaction, or the name given to it by the parties, it is necessarily a loan, and usurious. 3 Comst. R. 358, 368.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-4\">3. If this case is tested by the rule which is applied to stocks, bonds and notes of third parties, and those classes of securities, the transaction must be declared usurious. But it is submitted, that the true rule which ought to be applied to this case, in determining whether the transaction is usurious, is that which governs money itself. The usury laws control not only money, <em>but its substitute. </em>Confederate money, at the date of these transactions, was the universal currency. If, in point of fact, there be one rule for money and another for securities and commodities of that character, Confederate notes, as to the period of the war, should be controlled by the former rather than the latter. \"When a circulating medium in its uses supplies the place of gold and silver or legal tender, it should be governed, so far as the question of usury is concerned, by those rules and principles which apply to gold and silver and legal tender, rather than those which apply to collateral securities. Wliile Confederate notes may be a commodity, it is also a currency and a substitute for money, and should be governed by the laws which control the use of money. 14 New York R. 115, 119; 3 Comst. R. 358, 359, 361, 362, 363.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-5\">4. Independently of the fact that the bonds were those of the city itself, the other facts clearly show that there was no sale of Confederate money as a commodity by the defendant. The subject of negotiation, or barter, or traffic in these cases, was <em>not the Confederate money, but the bonds of the city. </em>If the Confederate money had been the subject, the obligations of the city would have made their first appearance after the conclusion of the negotiation or sale. Such is the case both at private sale and at auction. If the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>had advertised his surplus Confederate notes for sale at auction, and the city had hid for them successfully, and had given its obligation, there might have been some countenance to the theory of a sale of Confederate money, though even in that case, if the negotiation had been at a greater rate than six per <em>cent, </em>on the market value, and so known to both parties, the transaction would have been usurious, or at least <em>prima facie </em>usurious. But such was not the fact. The bonds of the town were made the subjects of the pretended sale, and the Confederate currency made to perform the function of money, in measuring their value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-9\">5. These transactions were loans. There was an application by the town for a loan, under the form of an auction sale of its bonds, a negotiation between the town and the appellee in relation to a loan, and an actual loan to the town. <em>Schermerhorn </em>v. Talman, 14 New York R. 93, 115; <em>Dry Dock Bank </em>v. <em>Amer. Life Ins. Co., </em>3 Comst. R. 344; Ord. 23, 69, 77; <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>Douglas R. 736; <em>Warfield\u2019s Adm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Boswell, </em>2 Dana R. 224.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-10\">6. The authority of the charter extends only to the funding of an old debt or the making of a new one. The first is done by an \u201cissue of certificates or bonds,\u201d the latter by \u201c contracting a loan.\u201d It is true that certificates or bonds may he given in both cases, hut if the certificate is not given for a debt already contracted, it must he in pursuance of a contract of loan. These bonds not having been given for a debt already contracted, must have been in consideration of a loan. It was not a case of funding, hut of borrowing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-11\">7. There was no sale of the bond or certificate to the appellee, nor could there have been, as they could not he the subjects of sale. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Fearson, </em>7 Peters U. S. R. 103; <em>Schermerhorn </em>v. <em>Talman, </em>14 New York R. 117; <em>Whitworth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>5 Rand. 333.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-12\">8. If not a loan, it was at least a case where, upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>negotiation for a loan, there was a sale of a commodity, wherein a loan was made dependent on a sale, and the sale made at a price above market value. Such a transaction is usurious within the rule laid down by Judge Carr in <em>Bank of the Valley </em>v. <em>Stribling, </em>7 Leigh 59. Where the commodity is a circulating medium, the case is much stronger. Byles on Bills, 467; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Fristoe, </em>1 Call 62; <em>Skipwith </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Mun. 490; <em>Bank of Washington </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>3 Gratt. 173; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nicholas, </em>8 Leigh 330; <em>White </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Cress. R. 273.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-4\">9. If the bonds of the town could have been the subjects of sale, and there was a sale of them, yet, as they were made for the purpose of being sold, and as that fact was known to the appellee and expressed in the endorsement, the transaction was usurious if the bonds were sold at a greater discount than six per cent. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Bruce, </em>Gilmer 42; <em>Whitworth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>5 Rand. 333; <em>Brummel </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Enders, &amp;c., </em>18 Gratt. 873; <em>State Bank North Car. </em>v. <em>Cowan, </em>8 Leigh 238.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-5\">10. Where an obligation is given for the transfer of depreciated currency, other than the promises of the party making the transfer, at a greater discount than six per cent, on the market value at the time of the negotiation, the market value being known to both parties, the transaction will be deemed a usurious loan, even though it may take the form of a sale; more especially is this the case where the depreciated -currency is the exclusive circulating medium. <em>Bondurant </em>v. <em>Commercial Bank Natchez, </em>8 Smedes &amp; Marsh R. 533; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bank of Lexington, </em>Id. 544; <em>Archer </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>12 Id. 286; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Meek, </em>Id. 495; <em>Maury </em>v. <em>Ingraham, </em>28 Miss.

The contract between the town and the appellee was not that of risk or hazard, as no contract can be where there is an <em>obligation to pay money at all events. </em>Eisk and hazard can only be applied to a contract where there is an inherent contingency as to payment in any event, or where the obligation is to repay in something else than money. But it is submitted that if the contract is relieved of the taint of usury on the ground of' its inherent risk and hazard, then it is thus shown to be void for want of authority to make it. <em>Steptoe adm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Harvey\u2019s ex\u2019 or s, </em>7 Leigh 501; <em>State Bank of North Car. </em>v. <em>Cowan, </em>8 Leigh 238; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nicholas, </em>8 Leigh 330; <em>Bank of United States </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>2 Peters U.

The statute of usury applies not only to the \u201cloan of money,\u201d but to the loan of any \u201cother thing.\u201d Under the statute there may be a direct loan of a thing, or the loan of a thing under the form of a sale, without usury, provided not more than six <em>per cent, </em>upon the value of the thing be taken. But if there be a direct loan of a thing, or the loan of a thing under the form of a sale, and more than six <em>per cent, </em>on the value of the thing be taken, it is usury. The usury, therefore, in the case of a loan of a thing does not depend upon the fact that the parties resorted to the artifice of a sale, but upon the excessive charge upon value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-11\">13.

Where A makes an application to B for a loan, which is not <em>bona fide </em>declined, but a negotiation endues between them in relation thereto, the result of \u25a0which is an accepted offer to- transfer a commodity at \u2022a pnlee exceeding its market value, which is to be piaid at all events, and in money at a future day, with six pier cent, interest from date, the transaction is usurious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-6\">2. Where a piublic proposal is made for a loan by A, and without further negotiation in relation thereto, B, in respionse to such piropiosal, offers to deliver a commodity at a price well known to both piarties to be in \u2022excess of its market value, and which is to be pi\u00e1id at all events in money at a future day, with six per cent, interest, semi-annually from date, and such offer is accepted by A, the transaction is usurious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-7\">3. Where an obligation of A to^ piay money at all \u2022events, with six pier cent, interest from date, then in his possession or thereafter to be made by him, <em>is made the subject of negotiation </em>between A and B, and the result \u2022of that negotiation is a transfer of such obligation to B for a consideration, whether that consideration be money or a commodity, such a transaction is a loan, \u2022and not a sale of the consideration by B to A; and when in such a case the market value of the considera,tion, if it he a commodity, at the time and place of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>negotiation, is less than the face of the obligation, the- , transaction is usurious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-9\">4. Where A, with a view of raising an amount of' notes, which, though greatly depreciated, constituted the only circulation in use at the time and place, and with which he proposed to make purchases of real estate, makes a contract with B (who is cognizant of such contemplated purchase by means of the notes so to be raised), by which B agrees to furnish a certain amount of such circulation, and A agrees, in consideration thereof, to give his obligation, payable in money at all events, at a future day, with six <em>per cent, </em>interest from date, for a sum largely in excess of the market value-of the said notes at the time of said contract, such a transaction is usurious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-10\">By \u201cmarket value\u201d in each of these propositions, we mean value in the community, according to a money or other legal tender standard.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-11\">If either one of these propositions is sustained, the-case is with the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agy\">14. Both at law and in commercial circles, persons-who invest in bonds or securities of this description are regarded as lenders, and the other parties as borrowers.

R. 378, Justice Story says, \u201cIf the contract, on its face, stipulate for it (usury), there is no further enquiry; otherwise it must be shewn that there was some agreement or shift <em>dehors </em>the written contract to cover usury.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-4\">. Unless a Confederate treasury note is different from hank stock, unless State stock is a commodity, and the \u2022notes of the Confederate States is <em>money, </em>and not a \u2022commodity, there cannot, we humbly submit, be a \u00a1shadow of doubt, under the rulings of the courts of this State and the Supreme court of the United States, that the mere exchange of the notes of the town for the Confederate treasury notes; or a sale be either for \u25a0the other (for it is immaterial what name is given to the transaction) is not <em>usury per se. </em>And the reason of these decisions is, as we conceive, money is not act-u-\u25a0ally loaned by such a transaction, it being a note given for a commodity, and to constitute usury it must be shown further that it was substantially a loan of money, under the pretext of a sale or exchange. But he the reason of these rulings what it may, the courts referred to have certainly arrived at the conclusion as thoroughly <em>res adjudicata, </em>that the sale of stock or any other commodity, at whatever price, is not usury <em>per \u25a0se, </em>and that individuals may give their bonds payable .at a future day, for depreciated stocks for their face value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-5\">Carr, J., in <em>Selby </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>3 Leigh 625, says, \u201cWe have decided often, that the sale of stock, or any other .property, at whatever price, does not, of itself, constitute usury; and further, on the same page, he adds, in <em>Stribling </em>v. <em>Bank of the Valley, </em>5 Rand. 132, we decided that the sale of stock at <em>twenty per cent, </em>above the market price, was usury, because <em>{solely because) </em>there was indissolubly linked to that sale a loan of money <em>by </em>the seller to the buyer.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-6\">In <em>Brockenbrough\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Spindle\u2019s adm\u2019s, </em>17 Gratt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>21, the case of <em>Selby </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>ivas especially referred to by Moncure P., as settling .the principles, as announced above by a unanimous court. The same judge, in the same case, on p. 33, says, \u201c That State bonds may lawfully be sold, on a credit, at par, in the market, is admitted, and cannot be denied. Nothing is better settled, in Virginia and elsewhere, than that stock, bonds and notes may be sold, like any other-property, at. any price not above par, which may be agreed upon between the parties;\u201d on p. 34, Ibid, lie-adds,-\u201c there is nothing unreasonable or unfair, in appearance, at least, in a sale or exchange of these bonds-for the bond of an individual, of like amount, payable three years after date; it may well be supposed that-the market value of the former was at least equal to-that of the latter.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-9\">It will scarcely be urged that Confederate treasury-notes are not commodities, and ought to be put on a different footing from stocks and other commodities,, because they had a circulation as money. Is it less a-commodity because used as a circulating medium?\u2019 Surely not! Their circulation cannot alter their intrinsic character as a commodity. They had fewer attributes of money than many other commodities.. Certainly fewer than depreciated bank notes, which are adjudged to be commodities in the <em>Bank of U. S. </em>v. <em>Waggener, </em>9 Peters R. 395.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-10\">They were constantly fluctuating in value\u2014they were not made a legal tender. They rose and fell,, with the success and disaster of the Confederate arms. If the revolution or rebellion had succeeded, and the-government retained its faith and ability to pay, they would have been redeemed, but their collection could not have been coerced in any legal forum; and if the-rebellion proved unsuccessful, which has happened,, these notes would be [as they are] worthless. They were a commodity for speculation, each individual fix<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>ing Ms own idea of value upon them, which was greatly influenced by Ms belief of the success or failure of the war. The very and only object of the usury law is to prevent speculation in <em>money. </em>The law regards it as the only thing that never rises in value\u2014 that it has an immutable value from the inception to the due day of every contract, and having fixed its value by law, one cent above tbe legal rate of interest at any distant day, is more than it is worth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-4\">This cannot be predicated of anything else, and particularly of Confederate stocks. Men are not subjected to tbe fearful penalties of usury laws, for speculating in commodities of varying and uncertain value, unless they do it to conceal a loan of money in disguise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-5\">\n<em>Was the transaction then a shift to evade the statute f Is it a loan of money in disguise ?</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-6\">In tbe <em>Bank of the United States </em>v. <em>Waggener </em>tbe court decided, in tbe language of tbe Syllabus, that \u201c tbe mere fact that tbe note was given for an equal amount of bank notes, whose market value was depreciated, does not amount to usury.\u201d Tbe same decision was made in <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>4 McLean R. 243.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-7\">It may be well, before proceeding further, to advert to an effort to advance tbe argument on tbe other side, by denying that there was a <em>sale </em>of tbe Confederate notes to tbe town. As there was no money that passed in tbe transaction, we do insist that it is most properly denominated an exchange of tbe town scrip, or tbe notes of tbe town, for tbe Confederate notes. But grant that there bad been no public auction of these certificates of debt, and tbe parties met, and Sutberlin gave Confederate notes, payable two years after a ratifiation of peace, &amp;c., to tbe amount on their face of $11,050 to tbe town, and tbe town gave its bond for $5,000, bearing interest at five per cent., tbe principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>irredeemable for twenty years. Is there any usury in this?</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-7\">In <em>Selby </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>Selby gave his bonds, payable in two or three years, and received the stock for them. In <em>Brockenbrough\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. Spindle, Brockenbrough parted with his stocks and took Spindle\u2019s bonds on time, and the judges, in the two last cases mentioned, and in the case of <em>Bank of United States </em>v. <em>Waggener, </em>speak of these transactions indiscriminately as a <em>sale </em>or an <em>exchange </em>of securities. Judge Mon cure, on p. 34, speaks of \u201c sale or exchange of the State bonds for the bonds of an individual,\u201d and on p. 35, \u201chere State bonds were <em>exchanged </em>for the bond of an individual.\u201d And in <em>Bank of United States </em>v. <em>Waggener, </em>9 Peters 395, Story J. said, \u201cIt was a <em>bona fide exchange of credits, </em>and is not <em>per se </em>illegal, though it may be so if it is a mere shift or devise to cover usury,\u201d p. 401.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-8\">We will continue the enquiry, <em>is it a shift to cover usury ? </em>The case seems entirely destitute of any of those features that have been termed badges of usury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-9\">There was no disguise to cover a loan of money; neither party wanted money; no conversion of. the Confederate notes into money, as is frequently done with bank and other stocks as soon as the transaction is closed and money is raised: (and even such cases not pronounced usurious). The sale was made at public auction, in the open face of day\u2014no previous negotiation for a loan of money. The auctioneer stated that the sale was to be made for Confederate States treasury notes. The town was not in search of <em>money, </em>and under no urgent necessity to procure <em>Confederate notes. </em>There was no advantage-taken of its necessities. The public had a fair opportunity of bidding, and the result of the bidding showed that in open market one dollar of the certificates of. indebtedness of the town, payable . in twenty years, was worth about two dollars of the notes of the Confederate States, payable two years after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>a favorable close of the war. The town wanted this commodity to invest in, or exchange for, land; and from what may be judicially known to the court, they made a profitable use of the Confederate bonds, as all \u25a0did who invested them in real estate during the war. The evidence shows that a portion of them was applied in liquidation of old debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-4\">The town received these Confederate notes, and immediately, according to assumptions on the other side, committed usury on their neighbors, by buying bonds for less than .their market value in gold. \u201cIf the application be not for a loan of <em>money, </em>but for an exchange \u25a0of .credits or commodities\u201d (and we might add, or for an exchange of credits for commodities), which the parties <em>bona fide </em>estimate at equivalent values, it seems difficult to find any ground on which to rest a .legal objection to the transaction. Because an article is depreciated in the market, it does not follow that the owner is not entitled to demand-or require a higher price for it before he consents to part with it.\u201d Story, J., in the case last cited, p. 401. He was speaking of depreciated bank notes. Further, on p. 402, he adds, \u201cfor many purposes they may pass current at par, in payment of - his own debts, or in payment of taxes.\u201d Sutherlin could use, at that date, these Confederate notes, either in payment of his own debts, or in taxes due the Confederate States. The proof is, the town applied some of them in liquidation of its own debts. Moncure J., in <em>Brockenbrough\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Spindle\u2019s adm\u2019rs, </em>p. 34, uses language as pointed, and to the same purport as the language of Justice Story. . He states, \u201cthere was nothing unreasonable or unfair, in appearance at \u2022 least, in a sale or exchange of these bonds,\u201d (referring to State bonds) \u201cfor the bonds of an individual, of like amount, payable three years after date. It may well be supposed that the market value of the former, as at least equal to that of the latter.\u201d Sutherlin .certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>gave the market value, for the sale was made in open market, and the public valued the Confederate treasury, to the town notes, running twenty years, as about tivo to one. So that the transaction has not even the feature of a sale .'of bank stock <em>above its market value: </em>as was the case in <em>Selby </em>v. <em>Morgan.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-10\">And we ask especial attention to the fact that the charge of usury is built on the idea, not that the exchange of the two securities, as to their market value, was not fair and equal, but when the Confederate treasury notes were <em>reduced </em>to the standard of <em>gold </em>(that is, the market value of the Confederate notes in <em>gold), </em>that the <em>gold </em>value would be less than the face value of the town notes. This is a concession that the Confederate notes is a commodity, whose value has to be reduced to <em>money. </em>How hazardous would it be to sell or exchange any commodity of fluctuating value, and take for it the bond of the party, payable in the future, if the penalty of usury is incurred by taking the bond for more than the gold value of the commodity at the precise date of the transaction! And we will remark, in this connection; whenever a case of usury is made out, under cover of a pretended sale of stocks, as where part of the consideration is for money loaned, and part the sale of stocks, the stocks must be sold or exchanged for less than the market value; exorbitant gain enters into the idea of usury. The bond is given for more than the market value of the stock, and in ordinary times it is right to regard as the market value their value in <em>gold and silver. </em>\u201cBut gold (to use the apt language of Joynes J. in another connection), it is well known, was not a currency, but an article of traffic during the late war. Scarcely any article had a value that was less stable and uniform. It went up, and sometimes went down, for short periods, very suddenly, according to the vicissitudes of the war and. the demands of speculation and adventure. Its value was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>not uniform in different places at tlie same time. At points remote from the cities, the people paid little or no attention to its fluctuations, and were not governed in their dealings hy any reference to its value.\u201d Joynes J., in <em>Dearing\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>18 Gratt. 425, 435. Or, to use the language of another, \u201c The value of gold, as marked hy these treasury notes, fluctuated daily and hourly, and was different in different parts of the State. While it was twenty, thirty, or forty, to one, these treasury notes had an exchangeable power of two, three, or four, to one, in the different species of property.\u201d We respectfully submit, as the contract is not usury on its face, and resort must he had to the extraneous matter of valueing the commodity in gold, in order to have the contract even a <em>gainful one, </em>it would he wrong to bring the contract to the gold value to prove the <em>animus </em>of usurious gains, when the people were not governed in their dealings hy any reference to its value, and when it was really a good contract to the town, and they were getting Confederate treasury notes to invest in land, in reference to which these Confederate notes had an exchangeable power of about two to one. Ten dollars in Confederate treasury notes would then have bought an acre of land intrinsically worth, or worth before the war, five dollars. It was the exchangeable value of these notes for land and personal property that made them practicably valuable. Gold was hut little thought of, and to bring the Confederate notes down to the gold standard, to make them worth less than the notes of the town, is an attempt to establish the <em>animus </em>of usury hy a technicality, without reason.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-5\">It is useless again to refer to the decisions of our own courts. We know of no decision in Virginia in conflict with <em>Selby </em>v. <em>Morgan; Brockenbrough\u2019s Ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Spindle\u2019s Adm\u2019rs; Bank of U.

An example of the second : where part of the consideration is for an antecedent debt, is <em>Bank of Washington </em>v. <em>Arthur et als., </em>3 Gratt. 173.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-10\">We will notice specially the case of <em>State Bank of North Carolina </em>v. <em>Cowan, </em>8 Leigh 238. Cowan in this case made an offer to the State Bank, if they would discount a note for him he would exchange an equal amount of northern funds, then good, for North Carolina bank notes, all depreciated in market. The proposition was accepted, a draft or bill of exchange was drawn on a Virginia firm and accepted, the bill and note offered for discount were both discounted by the bank, with a further condition that Cowan\u2019s <em>note </em>to the bank should be paid in Virginia bank notes or other northern funds. .At this time the North Carolina banks, although required to pay in specie, had suspended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-11\">The court decided that the contract was not usurious. Tucker, L, only dissenting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-12\">After quoting from the opinions of the judges who decided this case, they say: \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-13\">There is a peculiar feature in this case, that would seem to give it more the appearance of a loan in disguise, than a mere exchange of \u25a0 bills of a different market value from their value. It was not only agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>to exchange an equal amount of northern funds for Horth Carolina bank notes, if the note should he discounted, hut there was a further condition that Cowan\u2019s note, when due, should he paid in Virginia hank notes or other northern hank notes; these were generally as good as specie. So the transaction did not stop at a single exchange of commodities, and when the transaction was with a.hank hound to pay its own notes in gold, it might have been considered by the judges, from all the surroundings, a <em>shift </em>to cover a loan, <em>except </em>for the view taken by Judges Cabell and Brooke; hut, at all events, if, according to the view taken by those judges, it could under no circumstances he adjudged usury, it was very unnecessary to argue the question, whether in an ordinary case the exchange of a bond of an individual or corporation for depreciated stocks is, <em>per se, </em>usury. In fact, as we have before stated, the two judges named did not regard this case as a case of such exchange, because, while it was conceded that the market value of the North Carolina hank notes was less than the northern or Virginia funds of hank notes, Judges Cabell and Brooke were of opinion that the North Carolina hank notes paid to Cowan were equivalent to gold and silver, both to the bank and to Cowan. They were of opinion, that a hank hound to pay its notes in specie could not commit usury by taking the note of a customer for the face value of the hank notes paid to him when the note is discounted. They, therefore, considered it unnecessary to argue the question which Judge Tucker argued, whether, under all the surroundings of this ease, it was a shift to avoid the statute. Judge Tucker himself seemed to concede that an exchange of hills or commodities of unequal value was not usury of itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-4\">\n<em>Are there any decisions to the effect that the giving of a note or bond for the nominal amount of depreciated bank </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\n<em>notes or for stocks or commodities whose market value is less than their face value is usury per se ?</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9e\">It is admitted that there are\u2014particularly in Mississippi Some rule, that if a bank gives its <em>own </em>notes, depreciated in market, and takes a note from a customer for face value of the notes given, it is <em>not </em>usury; but, if it takes the depreciated notes of other banks, it is usury; as in <em>Maury </em>v. <em>Ingraham, </em>28 Miss.

There are cases of usury arising from a <em>bona fide loan </em>(to be returned) of a thing\u2014a commodity. A contract to borrow stock for five years, and then to be returned, valued atemore than the market price, and pay six per cent, interest on this valuation, might be usury. Usury, by the express words of the statute, is taking more than six per cent, interest for the loan of a \u201cthing.\u201d Thus, in <em>Forrest </em>v. <em>Elwes, </em>4 Ves. R. 402, annuities were loaned for six months, and the question of usury raised. The person borrowing, of course, generally disposes of the stock, but agrees to replace; buy and replace at the expiration of the limit of the loan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-5\">In <em>Parker </em>v. Ramsbottom, 5 Dowl. &amp; R. 138, 3 Barn. &amp; Cres. R. 257, cited by Parsons, vol. 3, p. 110, was decided to be usury, on what might be termed <em>forbearance </em>for the use of stock; the time for which the stock had been loaned had expired, and was worth at that time in market only 84,000 pounds sterling, but the borrower of the stock was released from his contract to return the stock, but it was agreed should account for it in money at the value of ten thousand pounds sterling, paying legal <em>per cent, </em>interest thereon, until the principal and interest should be repaid. There is no pretence of a <em>loan </em>of Confederate stock by Sutherlin, to be <em>replaced. </em>The only semblance for a charge of usury is a loan of <em>money </em>under the guise of a <em>sale </em>of stock; or that Confederate treasury notes is money, and it is usury direct; both of which propositions we have discussed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-6\">Judge Rives, in <em>Boulware </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>18 Gratt. 717, says: \u201c And this court, as in cases of depreciated bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>notes, has treated these notes as a <em>commodity </em>in trade,. while the common understanding, and the literal form of the transaction, justified the court below in deseribbag it as a <em>loan </em>in Confederate treasury notes of $5,000, we must look beyond the mode of expression into the actual substance of the contract. Had the contract, contemplated, the repayment of that, sum in the same-currency in which it was received, then it would have been substantially a <em>loan\u201d </em>The judge means to say, that when a person passes Confederate treasury notes,, and takes the bond of the transferee, he does not loan <em>money. </em>But, if the Confederate notes are to be returned in kind, he loans the Confederate notes as a commodity. There is, therefore, no pretext that this, transaction was a <em>loan </em>of a \u201c thing \u201d or commodity, but, the exchange or sale of a <em>thing </em>or commodity for the. note of the town.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-7\">\n<em>Did the town exceed its power \u25a0under its charter ?</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-8\">Having already protracted this note to a considerable length, we do not propose to argue this question of' <em>ultra vires </em>as much in detail or on authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-9\">The charter of the town of Danville, granted in. 1854, gave authority to the council to contract loans and issue certificates of debt. The same authority is. conferred by the amended charter of the 4th March,, 1862. See Sess. Acts of 1861-2, p. 114. If a question is made as to the validity of the acts of 1862, as not, passed by a constitutional Assembly, then the act of' 1854 was operative at the date of the contract. But the act of 28th February, 1866, gave validity to all contracts made under laws of Virginia enacted during the war. See Sess. Acts 1866, p. 187.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-10\">The question is raised whether, under the power-\u201cto contract loans and issue certificates of debt,\u201d the town could issue certificates of debt for Confederate treasury notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-11\">The town has the general authority \u201c to issue cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>tificates of debt.\u201d It is not limited as for what purpose it may issue them. It would seem that, if it was indebted by contract for paving a street, or building a courthouse, it would be entirely competent for the town to give its note or certificate of debt for masonry for their streets or for the courthouse. Why not for Confederate treasury notes or any other commodity purchased for its legitimate use? The Confederate notes were used to exchange, or, in the popular language of the day, to <em>invest </em>in parks and burying-grounds, which were legitimate subjects of investment for the town. If the town could only give its bonds or notes for money borrowed, and be forced to pay all of its engagements with borrowed money, it would be put to great disadvantage. The town, like every other corporation, has many sources of income; some own stocks and buildings to rent, and derive revenue from taxation. Their moneys come in at different times, and it is competent to make contracts and give their bonds, to anticipate their revenue and credit. Some towns work their own streets, and give their notes for material and timber, and hire workmen; the expression, \u201c issue certificates of debt,\u201d means to give their notes for the obligations they choose to incur.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-4\">But it seems to us that this question is put to rest by sec. 24 of chap. 54 Code of Virginia. This provision is not found, so far as we have been able to ascertain, in many States where the question of <em>ultra vires </em>is made. By this section every town is declared to be a <em>corporation, </em>and all the corporate powers thereof shall be exercised by the council; and by the 25th section [same chapter] the council may make ordinances to carry into effect their general powers, as well as the powers therein enumerated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-5\">Chancellor Kent says, \u201cwhen a corporation is duly created, many powers, rights and capacities are attached to it.\u201d \u201cSome of them,\u201d he continues, \u201care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>deemed, necessary and inseparably incident to a corporation, by tacit operation without any express provisions.\u201d <em>Kent\u2019s </em>Comm. vol. 2, 9th edi., top p. 325. He mentions, as one of their ordinary powers, the right \u201cto hold land and chattels.\u201d In note \u201cA,\u201d on the next page [326], it is stated that \u201cevery corporation has a capacity to take and grant property and to contract obligations;\u201d \u201cthat it may make all contracts necessary and useful in the course of the business it transacts, as means to enable it to effect such object unless prohibited by law or its charter. To attain its legitimate object it may deal precisely as an individual who seeks to accomplish the same end.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b610-9\">With such power the town of Danville could surely make any contract for a chattel, give its notes for a treasury note or for money borrowed; especially when the treasury notes are procured for the purpose of buying, or exchange for, grounds and parks useful to the town, and which they may lawfully acquire and hold. Ho corporation has a necessity for the exercise of more enlarged powers to make contracts than a town; powers necessary and inseparably incident to its existence. Every, town, almost daily, is under necessity to make contracts and payments as an individual.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b587-13\">Judge Anderson was interestedin tbe question involved in this case, and therefore declined to sit in it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b610-10\">Staples, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvVC\">Heitker party claims, that this is a Confederate transaction. Sutherlin treats the certificate as a security for the payment of its nominal amount in lawful money of the United States. The plea of usury is a tacit admission, on the part of the defendant, that this is a proper construction of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">The special verdict does not find that this contract, - according to the understanding of the parties, was to be fulfilled in Confederate notes, or that it was entered into with reference to such notes as a standard of value; nor have the jury found any fact from which this court can infer it. We must therefore consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the certificate as a promise to pay the sum of $5,000 iu legal currency. The question presented for our consideration is, whether this transaction is usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">With an anxious desire to arrive at a correct conclusion upon this point, I have carefully considered the arguments, oral and written, which have been made. I have attentively read the authorities to which we have been referred, and the conviction- is forced upon my own mind, that this contract cannot be sustained by the courts. In giving the reasons which have led me to this conclusion, I prefer to present my own views in connection with the argument of the counsel for the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">It is not unworthy of remark, that the counsel do not agree among themselves as to the character of this transaction. By one it is said to be what it professes\u2014 a sale of bonds; by another a sale of Confederate notes; by another an exchange of securities; by another admitted to be a loan, but not usurious, because usury \u2022cannot be predicated of a loan of Confederate currency, because the nominal amount of the notes advanced is larger than that of the obligation for their repayment. And thus the transaction, Proteus like, has the distinguishing faculty of assuming whatever form or shape the exigencies of the occasion may require. But the courts must look at the real nature and substance of the contract, and not at the name or title the parties or their counsel may be pleased to-bestow upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">As I have just stated, it is insisted that this contract is a sale of corporate bonds, which the common council might make at any discount without trenching upon \u25a0the statute against usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">There is no doubt, whatever, that the owner of a note has the right to sell it for the most he can get; as he would have the right to sell any goods or wares he -owned. But, on the other hand, it is quite as certain that no one has a right to make his own note and sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>that for what he can get; for this, while in appearance the sale of a note, is, in fact, the giving a note for money. It is a lending and a borrowing, and nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">It is said, in Whitworth v. <em>Adams, </em>5 Rand. 333: \u201cIf A, wishing to raise money, were to make his note payable to B, and then go to B and offer to sell it to him; and B, supposing that a man might lawfully sell his own note, were to give the money for it, verily believing-he was purchasing a note, and not lending his money on the security of a note, this would unquestionably he a loan; on the ground that he had intentionally done that which the law makes a loan. And this intention would, if the note' were taken at a high discount, he a corrupt intent sufficient to vacate the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">This principle of law is in conformity with leading adjudicated cases, and is recognized universally by the elementary writers. Parson's Mercantile Law 265; <em>Brummel &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Enders, Sutton &amp; Co., </em>18 Gratt. 873; <em>Brockenbrough\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Spindle, </em>17 Gratt. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">The reason of this rule is obvious. In every sale there must he not only parties, hut a thing to he sold. A man cannot sell his own promise to pay, because such an obligation is'not the subject of sale. So long as it remains in his own possession it is payable to no one, and hinds no one. It is the delivery alone that gives it vitality, and when delivered it then becomes, and not till then, a promise to pay according to the contract. The sale of .the maker\u2019s own note to the party advancing the money for it, is precisely the same as an advance of money upon a promise to secure its repayment by the execution of a note. All'the authorities agree that in either case the transaction is a loan, whatever may he the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">That these principles apply as well to corporations as to individuals, is conceded by all the authorities I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>have seen. Indeed when corporations effect loans they do so by sales of their bonds or certificates. This is the customary mode recognized in the commercial world, and by the statutes conferring authority to borrow money.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The purchaser of such bonds understands he is lending his money to the corporation. He knows that the offer to sell is but an application for a loan, made to any who have funds to invest upon the faith of such securities. The case of <em>Rogers </em>v. Burlington, 3 Wall. U. S. R. 654, is a direct authority upon this point. The city of Burlington loaned to the Burlington and Missouri Railroad Company $75,000, in its own bonds. A part of these bonds passed into the hands of holders for value, and not being paid, were put in suit. It was insisted the city was not responsible, because the bonds shewed, on their face, they were issued as a loan of the credit of the city, and not for any municipal purpose. The Supreme court, in answering this objection, said, \u201cTechnically speaking, it maybe said that the transaction, as between the company and the city of Burlington, was in form a contract of lending; but as between the city of Burlington and the persons who purchased the bonds in the market, it was undeniably a <em>contract of borrowing money. </em>The cases of <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Burlington, 4 </em>Wall. U. S. R. 270, 275; <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Allegheny County, </em>37 Penn. R. 237, are to the same effect. <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>City of Jeffersonville, </em>24 How. U. S. R. 289, 290; 34 Penn. R. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">I hold then that the \u201ctown of Danville\u201d intended to effect a loan; that the advertisement of the sale of the bonds or certificates of the corporation was in law an application for a loan; and the sale subsequently made was the final negotiation and settlement of the terms of that loan, and the certificate given the security provided for its repayment; and further, that Sutherlin, as a matter of law, must be held .to be aware of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>nature and legal effect of the contract to which he was a pai\u2019ty. The certificate given him purported, on its face, to he issued in conformity with the act of March ?th, 1862. That act authorized the common council to contract loans and issue certificates for the same; but it gave no authority to purchase depreciated paper, or to exchange its obligations for other securities. If the common council could buy Confederate currency,, could traffic in depreciated paper money, what was to-prevent its acquiring, by purchase or exchange, Confederate or individual bonds; what to restrain it from dealing in land, stocks or merchandize? It can. scarcely be necessary to say that no such power is conferred upon the corporate authorities of the town of' Danville; that the rule applicable to all other corporations applies to them; that is, they exercise such? powers only as are within the terms of the charter.. If the common council of Danville, under the authority <em>\u201cto </em>contract loans,\u201d may sell the corporation bonds or certificates, it is only because such sale-amounts in law to, and is substantially, a loan. It is-, only by considering this transaction a loan that the courts can hold the certificate in question obligatory upon the town of Danville. Once divest it of the features and properties of a loan; ascertain judicially that, it is entirely a different thing, it will he vain to search the charter for a provision under which this transaction can be sustained. When the plaintiff establishes that his contract is not a loan, he also establishes that it was made without authority.</p>\n<p id=\"AU9\">But it is said that the law infers a loan only where-money is advanced upon the discount of the maker\u2019s'own note.; and that Confederate currency was a mere commodity, and not money. I am free to admit, according to the uniform decisions of this court, that money, in a legal sense, is the coin issued or adopted by the sovereign authority, and made a lawful tender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>in the payment of debts. It must he remembered, however, that the usury laws apply to the loan of money or other thing. And, in ascertaining whether the transaction be a loan, it is difficult to perceive any substantial distinction between the sale of a note by the maker for money, and a sale for currency, received and recognized as money. \"When the cases say that an advance of money to the party offering his note for sale constitutes a loan, I think it is quite certain they mean, not only coined money and legal tender notes, but anything which passes current as the common medium of exchange, and measure of value for other articles, whether it be government issues or bank notes. Money is defined, by writers on commercial law, to be cash, that is, gold or silver, or the lawful circulating medium of a country, including bank notes when they are known and approved of, and used in the market as such. Burwell Law Dictionary; McCulloch Com. Dictionary, Title Money &amp; Banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Race, </em>1 Burr. R. 452, 457, Lord Mansfield said, in reference to bank notes: \u201c They pass by a will which bequeaths all the testator\u2019s money or cash. They are never considered as securities for money ; but as money itself They are not goods nor securities, nor covenants for debts; nor are they so esteemed ; but are treated as money, as cash, in the ordinary course and transaction of business, by the general consent of mankind, which gives them the credit and currency of money, to all intents and purposes.\u201d See also <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Mann\u2019s Ex\u2019or, </em>1 John. Ch. R. 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">At the time of this transaction Confederate currency was the only money circulating in Virginia. It was exclusively used in the payment of taxes, State and Confederate, and in the purchase of property. Bor it the merchant sold his goods, the broker his gold, and the farmer the products of his farm. By the laws of the land, by general consent, and in a large majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>of the transactions of men, it became a circulating medium and a standard of value. For nearly four years it performed all the functions of money, and was 80 by the people, not only from motives of patriotic devotion to the cause in which they were engaged, but by the command of a government as potential in Virginia as that which now hears sway over the people. This view is sustained by the opinion of this court in <em>Dearing\u2019s Adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>18 Gratt. Joynes, J., said it was undoubtedly tru e that the \u201c parties in that case, and the people generally, dealt with Confederate notes, to a certain extent, as money. They regarded their relation as that of debtor and creditor, and not that of buyer and seller.\u201d In <em>Thorington </em>v. Smith, 8 Wall. U. S. R. 1, it was said by Chase, Ch. J., \u201c that Confederate notes were the only measure of value which the people had, and their use was a matter of absolute necessity.\u201d It was argued that, as these notes were not convertible into gold, and were greatly depreciated, they cannot he treated as money. At an early period of the war, Confederate notes were at par, and readily converted into gold. According to the test suggested, they were at that period money, and so governed by the laws that regulate loans of gold and silver. In September, 1868, however, when at a depreciation of ten for one, they ceased to he money, and became a mere commodity. And the' transaction, which, in 1861, would have been a loan, must, if occurring in 1863, be treated as an exchange of securities or the sale of a commodity. And yet, in 1863, Confederate currency constituted the circulating medium of the State more generally than in 1861. True, the depreciation was greater in the latter <em>period; </em>but the only effect of such depreciation was an enhancement of prices: gold and all other commodities commanding higher nominal rates than in 1861.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The counsel for the appellee place much reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>upon a remark made by Judge Rives in <em>Boulware </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>18 Gratt. 708, to the effect that the transaction there was not to be treated as a loan, but as an engagement to pay for a commodity. Now, this remark, as applicable to that case, may have been, and no doubt was, correct. But I am sure Judge Rives did not mean to assert that every advance of Confederate money, upon the discount of a note, is to be regarded as the sale of a commodity; that proposition is not sustained by the decisions of this court. It is especially in conflict with the opinions expressed by all the judges in <em>Dearing\u2019s Adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Rucker. </em>I have already quoted the views of Judge Joynes. Moncure, P., said: \u201c The lender had no idea of selling, nor the borrower' of buying, Confederate notes; but the transaction was purely one of a lending and borrowing of money, having reference to Confederate notes as a standard of value, and as a medium and measure of the loan; because, and only because, it was then the \u2022only, or almost only, currency of the country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The same rule prevails in regard <em>to </em>a loan of Confederate notes as any other currency. Nor does it require argument or authority to show that the same rule prevails in regard to the loan of currency as the loan of coined money. Whether it be a bank note, or a Confederate issue, or stock advanced, once stamp the transaction with the impress of a loan, and the law denounces it as usurious if a greater value than the legal rate of interest be reserved. This proposition is sustained by the entire current of American authorities. See <em>Bank of State of North Carolina </em>v. Ford, 5 Ired. R. 692; <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Lode, </em>7 Paige R. 557; <em>Bondurant </em>v. <em>Commercial Bank Natchez, 8 </em>Smedes &amp; Marsh. R. 533, 544; <em>Maury </em>v. <em>Ingraham, </em>28 Miss. R. 171; and the cases collected in a note to the 3d vol. Parsons on Contracts; <em>State Bank of North Carolina </em>v. <em>Cowan, </em>8 Leigh, 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Another view, urgently pressed upon our attention,, requires a somewhat extended notice. It was said that an anomalous and extraordinary state of affairs existed during the war; that gold was subject to sudden fluctuations; that it disappeared from circulation and ceased to be a standard of value, and should not be.applied as a standard to Confederate contracts. The scarcity of' the precious metals, and the fluctuations to which they were subject during the war, though unusual occurrences, are by no means without precedents in history. In 1797, the Bank of England suspended specie payments, and did not resume until 1822. Gold and silver disappeared from circulation; contracts were not made with reference to them, nor payments received in them; and during all that time, a period of immense operations in commerce and war, the entire business, and revenue of the country were carried on with the-aid of paper currency alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">It is a fact familiar to all, that in 1836 the banks in this country suspended specie payments, and did not resume until 1842 and 1843; that gold and silver ceased to circulate as money, and the country was flooded with depreciated bank paper, producing unusual distress and embarrassment. In the State of Kentucky, at one period, the issues of the Bank of the Commonwealth constituted almost the entire circulating medium of the State, and gave rise to innumerable controversies for\u2019 alleged violation of the usury laws. Illustrations might be drawn from the States of Mississippi and Illinois also, at certain periods of whose history the precious metals disappeared from the channels of circulation. In none of these instances has it been held, so far as L am informed, that gold and silver ceased to be the standard of value; that contracts then made were not to be tested by the rules of law applicable to contracts made in times more auspicious for the debtor class of' the community. Look at the Federal States during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the recent struggle. With all their vast wealth, credit and resources, their currency rose and fell with the rapidly-varying fortunes of the contest, until, at one \u25a0 period, its depreciation was in the proportion of two dollars and ninety cents for one. This fact, alone, ineontestibly shows that gold, as a circulating medium, was withdrawn from the channels of trade and commerce, and was the subject of traffic and speculation, as other commodities.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">With us of the south, after the disastrous campaigns of 1862, the depreciation was more rapid; but there was not a period during the war when the currency was not available in tlie purchase of gold, either from individuals or the government. We say that the Confederate treasury notes were depreciated. How depreciated? With reference to what standard? By what rule are we to ascertain the extent of the depreciation? Certainly not by other commodities. Provisions and the means of subsistence were scarce, difficult to be obtained, and commanding exorbitant prices. On the other hand, lands and slaves, thrown upon the market by the necessities of those who were forced into the armies or were chiven from their homes, were purchased without difficulty at extremely low rates. The price of commodities is not a safe or reliable standard. All must agree that gold was the standard of value during the earlier period of the war. When did it cease to be such? When did the usury laws cease to operate? What day, or month, or year, in that eventful history is to be designated, when it may be said that all contracts for the loan of money or currency, before such day, are to be controlled by the general rules of law; but if made thereafter, they shall be pronounced legal and valid, no matter how exorbitant the rate of interest reserved. The principle asserted will constrain us to proclaim a -suspension of the usury laws in regard to all contracts made during the war. The same rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>of construction must be applied to loans of bank paper, and even of gold and silver. For how can usury be predicated of any contract in communities having 110 standard of values? It was attempted to make Con'^e&lt;^era^e n\u00b0tes a legal tender in the payment of debts; but the effort was unsuccessful, and the people of the State could not fail to understand that gold and silver were the only constitutional currency, and, as such, legally, the representative and standard of values.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">This principle has been repeatedly recognized, both by the legislative and judicial departments of the State. The acts of 1865 and \u20196 authorize the nominal amount of Confederate debts to be reduced to their true value; aud this court, in <em>Dearing\u2019s Adm\u2019x </em>v. Rucker, 18 Gratt., unanimously applied the gold standard in ascertaining the scale of depreciation. \"Were this a Confederate contract, we should have no difficulty in applying the same standard, in order to fix a just measure of recovery. Are we precluded from so doing because the lender has imposed upon the borrower the hard alternative of paying the debt in United States currency ? Is the creditor to be heard, in one breath, to say there was no standard of value, no constitutional currency in existence during the war, to screen his contract from the arm of the law, and in the very next breath to claim that this contract was made with reference to that very standard, and that very currency he seeks to repudiate. It seems to me we must adopt the gold standard from sheer necessity. It is impossible to advance a step in construing contracts, settling controversies and rendering verdicts and judgments, without a resort to some standard. However scarce gold may have been, however fluctuating its value, it is the only safe and reliable standard for the adjustment of the contracts made during the war. Just or unjust, no other has been adopted by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>It lias been said there can be no usury unless the parties know all the facts which constitute the usury; and in this case it does not appear that they were in- \u2022 formed of the value of the Confederate notes when the transaction took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">It is unnecessary to decide whether this proposition is law to the extent asserted. Concede that it is: is it to be presumed, is the idea to be for a moment entertained, that the common council, entering the market to buy or borrow $40,000 in Confederate currency, and that Sutherlin, having in his possession $20,000 in like currency to lend or sell, were not apprized of the value of the money or the commodity in which they were dealing. ~Were they alone ignorant of facts relating to this currency, well known to every person in Virginia possessed of ordinary intelligence ? Hot only the depreciation, but the extent of the depreciation, forced itself, daily and hourly, upon the observation of all men at that eventful period. It is a part of the public history of the country. How does it appear in any case that parties are informed of the market value of the article in which they traffic ? I have seen no decision which goes to the extent of holding that this fact is to be established by independent, affirmative evidence. It seems to me the courts have the right to in-, fer that parties dealing in depreciated paper, making it the subject of sale or loan, are aware of that depreciation. Any other inference would attribute to them the grossest ignorance of matters about which they are presumed to be informed, and tend to encourage usury, by adopting rules' calculated to screen it from judicial investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">It is said, however, there is no case where an obligation, given for a depreciated currency, in greater nominal amount than the obligation, has been adjudged usurious. The researches of the counsel have not produced a case in which it has been decided that such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>obligation for that reason is not usurious. What real difference is there, with reference to the question of usury, between the loan of $1,000 in notes, depreciated <em>Per cent-&gt; </em>taking the obligation of the borrower for that sum, and the loan of a like amount in notes depreeja^e\u00bf 50 <em>jper cent., </em>taking the obligation of the borrower for $750, with interest. In the one case the lender contracts to receive $1,000 for $750 in value, and in the other $750 for $500 in value. In either case the lender unlawfully gains, and the borrower loses, the difference, by the terms of' the agreement. In <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Ramsbottom, </em>5 Dowl. &amp; Ryl. R. 138; 3 Barn. &amp; Cres. R. 273, the defendants being indebted to the plaintiff for \u00a318,000 in stock previously advanced, it was agreed between the parties that the defendants should be released from replacing the stock; and that, instead thereof, they should account for it in money, at the value of \u00a310,000, paying six <em>per cent, </em>thereon. At the date of this agreement the market value of the stock was only \u00a38,400. The court held that the statute evidently applies to loans of goods or anything that is called money\u2019s worth, as well as loans of money itself; and, as the plaintiff was lending \u00a318,000 in stock worth \u00a38,400 only, and stipulating to be repaid \u00a310,000, with legal interest on that larger sum, the contract was usurious. The authority of this case has never been questioned, so far as I am informed. In <em>Judy\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Gerard et al., </em>4 McLean R. 360, the defendant had executed his note for $500, in consideration of an advance of $1,000 in notes of the Bank of Illinois, worth only thirty-seven and a-half cents, as compared with gold. It was held that the contract was not usurious, not because, however, the nominal amount advanced was greater than the note, but for the reason that the transaction appeared to be a <em>bona fide </em>sale of the Illinois notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">These cases show that, to bring a contract within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>\u00a1statute, it is only necessary it should be for the repayment of a greater value than the amount of the loan, with an advance thereon at the rate of six <em>per cent.; </em>\u25a0and the result is not changed, in the slightest degree, by the fact that the nominal amount lent is a larger quantity than that of the obligation executed for its repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">It is also contended that the transaction is a contract of sale, in which Sutherlin was the vendor and the town of Danville the vendee of Confederate treasury notes as a mere commodity.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">It is not denied that Confederate notes, besides being a currency, may have been the subject of sale under all the modifications that affect dealings in other articles ; but such cases were exceptional and not general. As was said in <em>Dearing\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>the people generally dealt with Confederate notes as money, regarding their relation as that of debtor and creditor, and not that of buyer and seller. The opinion of the Supreme court of Kentucky in <em>Warfield\u2019s adm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Boswell, </em>2 Dana R. 224, though specially directed to the subject of depreciated bank paper, has a strong application to this question here. The Chief Justice said, \u201cAlthough bank notes current as a circulating medium, like those of the Bank of Kentucky in 1822, are vendible, nevertheless they are more frequently the subject of loan than of sales on credit; and when they are actually sold on credit it is not reasonable to presume that the purchaser will agree to give double their value and interest also. <em>We </em>cannot doubt that when one man lets another have, as in this case, depreciated current bank notes of the value of $1,500, upon a promise to refund the nominal amount and legal interest in specie, nothing else appearing, the transaction should be deemed <em>prima facie </em>a loan. This would be the only probable or rational conclusion or deduction from the intrinsic character of such isolated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>facts. A, desiring to use immediately $100 in bank notes worth only $50 in specie, applies to B for the notes. B delivers to him a bank note of the denominati\u00b0n of $100, worth only $50, and takes his note for in sPec^e; payable in oiie year, with legal interest ' from date, no other fact appearing. A affirms the transaction a loan, and B insists it was a sale. Can there be a reasonable doubt that loan is impressed on its face ? It has all the features of a loan, and if it should not be deemed a loan until the contrary be made to appear by proof <em>aliunde, </em>no transaction could ever be considered a loan unless the words borrowing and lending be expressly used in the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In the present case, Sutherlin did not propose to sell nor the town of Danville to purchase, Confederate notes. A sale of currency was not contemplated by either of the parties. The certificate was the subject of negotiation and sale, and the Confederate notes the medium of payment. Throughout the transaction the notes were treated as money. They were advanced on the one hand and received on the other under a statute authorizing the corporation of Danville to borrow mo.ney; and they were to be used as money in the immediate purchase of property. The special verdict finds, as fact, that the president of the common council was authorized to make-sale of the certificates; that the <em>sale was </em>made; that the certificate in question was sold to \u00a5m. T. Sutherlin, he being the highest bidder; that he <em>paid </em>therefor $11,050 in Confederate notes to ' the agent of the corporation. In the face of these plain facts, this court is asked to assume that Sutherlin, in bidding for the certificate, was in fact making sale of his Confederate notes. It is true, upon well settled principles of law, that the corporation of Dan-ville could not sell its own promise to pay. We are not, therefore, authorized to say that Sutherlin sold, or intended to sell, his currency without a fact found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>by the jury, or even a scintilla of evidence in the record, warranting such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Again, it has been urged that this was a mere exchange of securities. The case of the <em>Bank of United Staten </em>v. <em>Waggener, </em>9 Peters U. S. R. 378, was strongly relied on in support of this proposition. As this is the leading case cited, it may be proper to examine it with care and attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\"Waggener executed his note to the Bank of the United States, at Lexington, for $5,000. The consideration of this note was an advance by the bank to Waggener, of the Bank of Kentucky notes, to the nominal, amount of $1,100, and a check upon the Bank of Kentucky for $3,900, which was paid in notes of like description. These notes were then depreciated 40 per <em>cent. </em>At the time of this transaction, the Bank of Kentucky was indebted to the United States Bank in the sum of $10,000, and was credited with the amount of the check just mentioned, and a short time thereafter paid the Bank of the United States the balance of the $10,000 in gold. The Supreme Court of the United States held the contract was not usurious. The decision was based upon the ground: 1st, there was no device to evade the statute; 2d, whether the transaction was a <em>loan </em>or <em>exchange of securities, </em>there was no usury, because the parties estimated their respective securities as of equivalent value, and the notes of the Bank of Kentucky, though depreciated in market, were of the full value of their numerical amount to the United States Bank, and were so treated by the borrower. The Bank of Kentucky was solvent and able to pay its debts, and the holders of its notes could have recovered the amount thereof, with interest in gold, from the.Bank of Kentucky. The plaintiffs could not, by the negotiation, entitle themselves to more interest than they were already entitled to against the Bank of Kentucky. The court, in commenting upon the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>struction asked for by defendant, say, it was objectionable because it put a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, on the ground that depreciated bank notes were loaned at their nominal value, without reference to the fact whether there was a design to commit usury, or whether the notes were in reality of a higher intrinsic value to the parties; which were the turning points in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">If it appeared, in the case under consideration, that Sutherlin\u2019s Confederate notes were of equal value with the certificate, and were so treated by the parties; that Sutherlin could not, by the negotiation, entitle himself to a higher interest than he was already entitled to against, the Confederate government; and that the amount of these notes might, by the use of due diligence, have been recovered in gold; the cases might be regarded as analogous, and brought under the influence of the same principies. But, in point of fact, the securities were not of equal value, and were not so considered by the parties. Two dollars and twenty-one cents of Confederate money were estimated as of equal value with one in gold, when the real value was in the proportion of ten for one. In other words, Sutherlin advances to the town of Danville $10,000 in currency, bearing no interest, worth $1,000 in gold, and takes the obligation of the town to repay $5,000 in gold or legal tender notes, with interest thereon from date, payable semi-annually. He therefore lent a thing of the value of $1,000 only, stipulating for a return of $5,000 with interest. Ho interest was due and payable upon the Confederate notes; nor could they, by the exercise of any sort of diligence, have been converted into gold at their full value, as they were only payable two years after the ratification of a treaty of peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">All the cases in which the courts have held the transaction an exchange of credits or securities, show that the securities exchanged were <em>bom fide </em>estimated by the parties as of equal value, and the depreciated pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>per advanced as readily convertible into coined money. In the absence of these features, an advance of depreciated paper at its nominal value, to the party offering - his note for the same, is called a loan unless evidence is adduced to satisfy the mind that something else was intended. In the case already cited, the Supreme Court of the United States say, \u201cIf A and B mutually execute their obligations to each other for $ 100 with interest, usury cannot be predicated upon such a transaction. If, however, one note bore interest and the other \u25a0did not, or if one charged a commission for the use of his note, such a transaction would be called a loan, and \u25a0usurious, whatever the parties might term it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">In <em>Dry Dock Bank </em>v. <em>American Life Insurance Co., </em>3 Comst. R. 344, the court use this language: \u201c The company advanced their post notes, for these certificates are nothing else, as cash, at their nominal value, in the same manner that a bank of issue would receive and discount a note for a customer. In both cases there would be an exchange of promises. In each ease the property in the note issued would vest in the receiver. In neither case would any money be paid. But in both cases a substitute, by the understanding of the parties, Is advanced by the lender, and accepted as money by the borrower. Every transaction of the kind, when \u25a0analysed, will be found to be a loan of money, whether designed or not, under the form of exchange.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In <em>Schermerhorn </em>v. <em>Talman, </em>14 New York R. 93, 117-18, Selden, Judge, said: \u201cIt maybe said, admitting a mere exchange of obligations not to be a sale, neither is it a loan, and hence it is entirely without the statute of usury, unless brought within it by extrinsic evidence that an evasion of the statute was intended. .It is true that, literally, the transaction is neither a \u2022sale nor a loan, but an exchange. I apprehend, however, that, legally, in reference to the question of usury, it must be regarded as a loan or as a sale. Ho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>other distinction has ever heen applied to such transactions by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"APs\">In <em>The State Bank of North Carolina </em>v. <em>Cowan, </em>already cited no application was made for a loan, but an advanee of depreciated paper requested. It was claimed in the argument, that the transaction was a mere exchange of securities. But not a word fell from either of the judges that gave countenance or support to that proposition. The decision was based upon the ground that the funds in which Cowan\u2019s note was payable, though at par when the contract was made, might be depreciated in market to the extent of the bank paper' loaned, by the time Cowan\u2019s note arrived at maturity. It was also said, these notes of the bank, though then depreciated, were the representatives of so much coin, and Cowan might instantly, upon receiving them, have demanded the coin from the bank. But for these features, the contract would have been held a palpable violation of the usury laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">It seems to me that this case is authority for the proposition that this contract cannot be sustained in Virginia, upon any pretence of an exchange of securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">I can well understand that if two persons mutually execute their obligations to each other in like sums, such a transaction is ordinarily a mere exchange of credits. But it is difficult to understand how an advance of depreciated bank notes to a person executing or transferring his own obligation therefor, can be termed an exchange of securities. In the first place, according to the authority of Lord Mansfield, a bank note is not considered a security for any purpose. In the second place, as a man cannot sell his obligation, so neither can he exchange it. There is nothing in existence that can be the subject of exchange. A sale is a transmutation of property from one man to another for money. An exchange is a transferring of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>'goods or property by way of barter. Chitty on Contracts page . But the obligation of a person in Ms own possession is not <em>property </em>nor a <em>security. </em>When delivered it becomes- simply a contract to pay, and nothing more. If it is not a contract to pay upon a \u25a0sale, it must of necessity be a contract to pay upon a loan. A delivers to B his bond, and the latter delivers to A a chattel. The presumption is, that this is a sale of the chattel; because, ordinarily, a chattel is not the subject of a loan; and because the contract of A is to pay the price agreed on, and not to repay money loaned. This presumption will be rebutted by evidence shewing that a loan and an evasion of the statute were intended under color of a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">But if A delivers to B his bond, and the latter, in return, delivers a bank note circulating as money, the presumption is, that the transaction is a loan, because such currency is usually the subject of loan rather than sale. It is true the agreement is not to repay the bank note or notes of like kind. It is, however, a contract to repay the money of which the bank note is the representative. This presumption of a loan may also be rebutted by evidence shewing that the bank note was <em>Iona fide </em>the subject of purchase and sale. If, however, the bond is the subject of negotiation and sale, then the transaction is a loan, for the reason, as I have heretofore endeavored to shew, that a party cannot sell Ms own obligation or promise to pay. The distinction between a purchase of such an obligation and that of a third person, is founded upon the soundest principles of law. In the latter instance a subsisting debt is the subject of negotiation and sale, and the obligation is merely the evidence of the debt. Where, however, the party sells his own promise or obligation there is no debt in existence which can be the subject \u25a0of sale. In such case the purchase of the obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>is simply an advance of money upon the security of tiie parties to the instrument. The transaction in law is a borrowing and lending, and nothing else. This. principle is recognized by all the authorities, bio solid reason'tias ever been assigned why the same rule is not \u2018 applicable toan advance of currency constituting a circulating medium, and performing all the functions of money. . With what reason can it be said that if a note is-discounted for the maker, at par or below par in gold, it is a loan; if it is discounted 25 <em>per cent </em>below par in legal tender notes it is a loan; but if bank notes or other depreciated currency he given for it, the transaction is not a loan, but a sale or exchange of securities? In either case, the object of one party is to lend; that of the other to borrow money or its equivalent.- In the one case there is a loan of money; in the other a loan of currency\u2014the substitute for money\u2014so recognized and treated by the parties; and as such, the transaction is directly within the statute which applies to-the loan of money or other thing. In the absence of' evidence tending'to impress upon the contract a different character, it seems to me, it is to be presumed, that an advance of a depreciated currency to the party executing therefor his own obligation, is a loan. This, presumption,' according to many of the adjudicated cases, is materially strengthened by the reservation of interest payable from the date of the contract. It is. very justly said that different persons estimate paper-money very differently; that one person, supposing it might be equal to specie on a particular day, might be-willing to purchase it for his own note, payable at that period; but that a party purchasing upon such a contingency would scarcely contract for the payment of interest in the meantime; and that such a reservation is a strong indication of a loan, and, unexplained,, should be conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>In <em>Moore\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Vance, 3 </em>Dana\u2019s R. 361, Judge Marshall, delivering the opinion of the Supreme court of Kentucky, said: \u201cIf there was any doubt that the transfer of the executions was intended as a loan, the fact that the party was to pay interest upon their nominal amount from the date, which would he considered as conclusive if the hank notes themselves had been transferred, must also he taken as conclusive as to the transfer of the executions.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\">The present transaction, tested by these rules, must he considered a loan; and as, by the terms of the agreement, a greater value is reserved than legal interest, it must he held to he a usurious loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">In conclusion, it is proper to state there is nothing in the record tending to show any corrupt motive or intention on the part of the plaintiff. I have no doubt the contract was made without a thought on his part of violating the statute against usury. It is well settled, however, that if the lender intends to take more than legal rate of interest, the law will infer the corrupt motive, however innocent the parties may he of any design to violate the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Martindale, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pull. R. 154, Lord Alvanley said: \u201cThough the jury have found that Sir Charles Marsh did not think he was acting contrary to law, there is nothing in that finding to prevent us from examining the transaction and declaring it to he corrupt, if it appear to us to he so in point of law, without sending the case hack to a jury to find the corrupt intent. It is needless to multiply the authorities upon this point, as the law is too Well settled to be called in question at this day. The principle pervading the decisions, almost without exception, show that the facts being agreed by the parties, or found by the jury, or arising upon a demurrer to the evidence, the inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>of the law as to the intention of the parties and' the character of the contract devolves on the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ArI\">Christain, J., concurred in the opinion of <em>Staples, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">,, _ Moncure, P., dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
