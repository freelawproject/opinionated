C. Jameson and others, \u25a0for the purpose of building thereon a courthouse, \u2022clerk\u2019s office and jail for the county, applied to the County court of that county for the appointment of commissioners to value the land. The commissioners were appointed, and they returned their report to the county court in December, 1870. At the January term of the court, upon the motion of the supervisors to confirm the report of the commissioners, Joseph B. \u25a0Gorrell, and seven other persons, claiming to be citizens of the county, owners of real estate and taxpayers therein, but not claiming to have any interest in the land proposed to be condemned, moved the court to allow them to be made parties to the proceeding, and to file exceptions to the report; which they exhibited. On this motion, the judge of the County court\u2014J. W. Bell\u2014delivered the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A24\">The board of supervisors of Culpeper county having determined upon a site on which to locate the courthouse, clerk\u2019s office and jail, and desiring to condemn \u2022that site or parcel of land and purchase the same, applied to this court to appoint five disinterested freeholders of the county, for the purpose of ascertaining a just compensation for such land. Notice of such application was given, and service thereof acknowledged by the owners and occupants of the land; and upon its \u25a0appearing that such notice had been given, and no one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>appearing to oppose it, the court appointed the commissioners suggested by tlie board, and, in the order -of appointing them, designated the day for them to-meet. It appears they took the oath prescribed by the statute in such cases provided, met upon the land on the day designated, viewed the same, and ascertained what would be a just compensation for it, and made their report accordingly. Ho person appeared on the-ground to contest it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-9\">At a subsequent term of the court, the report and the proceedings are presented to the court, and a confirmation of the same is asked for by the board. An attorney at the bar rises in his place, opposes the motion, and gives notice to the board of supervisors, through its chairman, that in the name of certain citizens, tax-payers and real estate owners of the county, and in their behalf, he will contest the confirmation of the report, and ask the court to allow them to file their exeejfiions, and show cause against it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-10\">It was suggested by the court to the attorney for the tax-payers, that his exceptions should be reduced to writing, so that the objections to the whole-proceedings on the part of the board of supervisors could be more readily seen and understood. They were reduced to writing, and on the next morning brought into court. In the meantime, however, by an-understanding between the counsel for the board and counsel for the tax-payers, the exceptions themselves-were not to be discussed by the bar, or considered by the court, until the single preliminary question should be disposed of, viz: \u201cHave these persons, as tax-payers, citizens and real estate owners, and in that character alone, a right to be heard here, to show cause against the confirmation of the report of the said commissioners?\u201d This is the single, isolated proposition for this-court now to determine. It is one of unqualified novelty with us, growing out of the revolutionized consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>tution of government under which, we now live, and which we are bound to observe and execute. It is <em>res integra </em>here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-4\">Owing to the newness and difficulties of this question, I had hoped to receive the notes and authorities promised at the bar, but regret to say have not, to this moment, although solicited by me, gotten the first note or suggestion, or authority, from a single lawyer except Mr. Lewis, who furnished me with a short note and authority, to which I shall hereafter allude\u2014Mr. Gibson referring me to the same. There is certainly a great dearth of authority upon this question, or any one similar to it, elementary or in the decision of the courts\u2014at least after the most industrious researches in all the libraries at this place and in \"Warrenton (some of them quite large), I have not been able to discover a single case wherein this distinct question is raised, save one. In 16 Pickering\u2019s Report (Massachusetts), the point is raised at the bar, and disposed of by Judge Shaw in two <em>words\u2014uSed qucere.\u201d </em>It must, therefore, be determined, as best I may, upon reasoning and analogy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-5\">It will be observed that these \u201c citizens, tax-payers and real estate owners,\u201d do not come in by petition, setting forth and manifesting an individual interest which the court would be bound to take notice of, and defend and protect, and ask to be made <em>parties </em>on the record, as plaintiffs or defendants; but merely ask in the character of \u201c citizens, tax-payers and real estate owners,\u201d to show cause against the confirmation of the report of the commissioners. They do not show or set forth any other interest than what the descriptive character they have assumed would indicate, viz: \u201c citizens, tax-payers and real estate owners,\u201d an interest which it must be admitted, is of the most general, uncertain and indefinite kind. They do not even set forth that they, or any one of them, is a creditor of the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>owners, or that they are <em>lien </em>holders, or have the remotest pecuniary interest in the land proposed to he condemned, <em>even if that fact could avail them, at all. </em>They certainly do not pretend that they are tenants of the freehold, or owners or proprietors of the land, or that they are interested as residuary legatees and devisees under William Major\u2019s will. If it appeared that they or either of these exceptants was a \u201ctenant of the freehold,\u201d or his \u201c guardian or committee,\u201d and that legal notice has not heen served on <em>him,, </em>then the proceedings, to that extent, would be defective. The court would refuse to confirm the report, cause notice to be served on the proper party, and bring him properly before the court. He would then be a <em>party in interest, </em>and have a right to be heard and show cause against the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-9\">The 10th section of the law under which this proceeding is had, reads as follows: \u201c The commissioners, after viewing the land and hearing such proper evidence as <em>either party </em>may offer, shall ascertain what will be a just compensation for said land,\u201d &amp;c. To whom do these words <em>\u201ceither </em>party\u201d refer?\u2014to the people of the county in a body, individually and collectively?\u2014 to <em>any </em>citizen, tax-payer and land owner of the county ?\u2014 to any <em>uninterested </em>person? I cannot think so; but, manifestly, to a \u201cparty\u201d having an interest as \u201ctenant of the freehold,\u201d his guardian or committee; or to \u201cthose entitled to the land,\u201d in the language of the statute itself, on the one part, and the company, or county, or town council, on the other part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-10\">The 11th section reads as follows: \u201cThe said report and certificate of the Justice shall be forthwith returned to the court of the county or corporation, and unless good cause be shown against the repoi\u2019t, the same shall be confirmed and recorded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-11\">The 12th section reads as follows: \u201cIf, however, good cause be shown against the report, the court may, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>without further notice, as often as to it seems proper, appoint other commissioners, and the matter may he proceeded in as before.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-4\">The 14th section says: \u201cIf the sum ascertained by the report which is confirmed, he not more than the sum ascertained by the first report, the party applying for the appointment of other commissioners shall pay the costs occasioned by such application.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-5\">How, taking these four sections together, and construing the words \u201cunless good cause he shown against the report,\u201d and the word \u201cparty\u201d as used therein, I cannot resist the conviction that the intention of the law was to confine all exceptions to, and all contests respecting the assessment of the land sought to he condemned, to individuals to whom such notice must he given by law; viz: to the tenant of the freehold, his guardian or committee, or those entitled to the land; and the applicant, that is to say the company, county \u25a0or town, in this case, to the hoard of supervisors, the \u2022corporate body representing the county. What strengthens me in the propriety and reasonableness of this construction is, that in the 11th \u201c section it is jirovided that the sum ascertained to he a just compensation\u201d may he paid to the <em>\u201cpersons </em>entitled thereto, or into court;\u201d and again, in the 16th section, \u201cto enable the court to dispose properly of any money so paid into court, it may appoint a commissioner to ascertain what <em>persons </em>are entitled thereto, and in what proportion,\u201d and require <em>\u201call interested </em>to appear before the commissioner, that their respective claims may he passed upon.\u201d The word <em>\u201cperson,\u201d </em>throughout the statute, wherever used, is, in my judgment, used not in apposition to, hut in contradistinction to, the word \u25a0\u201cparty\u201d\u2014\u201call interested,\u201d\u2014that is, all persons interested, not in the land, but in the <em>condemnation </em>money Tor the land, which is always done when land is taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>without the owner\u2019s consent hy an incorporated company, county or town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-9\">The term \u201cparty\u201d or \u201cparties\u201d is understood to include all persons who are directly interested in the <em>subject matter </em>in issue, who have a right to make defence,, to control the proceedings or to appeal from the judgment. Persons not having these rights are regarded as <em>strangers </em>to the cause. 20 Howell\u2019s St. Trials 538,-1 Greenleafs Evidence 523.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-10\">This is my construction of these statutes, arrived at. with much diffidence I confess. It applies as well to the case at the bar as to any ease wherein private property was taken for public uses hy an incorporated company, county or town. Many cases have arisen under it in Virginia, which have gone through the judicial ordeal from the lowest to the highest courts of the State; and in no one case can I find where one or a dozen or more of the <em>public </em>have ever presumed to ask to appear and contest the report of the commissioners in such cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-11\">It was suggested at the bar hy one of the counsel for the citizens and tax-payers, that an <em>amicus curiae </em>would have a right to ask to be heard in open court, except to the report, and show cause against its confirmation hy the court. Although not favored with any authority to* support this proposition, I am with one which meets it very fully and establishes the negative. In a case that went from the District court to the Court of Appeals there was an inqusition of escheat for the want of heirs. The inquisition found that Jackson was seized of the premises, and died without a will, or disposing of his property, and that no person had ever claimed the land as lineal or collateral heir. Dunlop,, as <em>amicus curiae, </em>moved the court to quash the inquisition; this the court refused. Dunlop filed a hill of exception, stating the inquisition and motion to quash it, and appealed from the judgment of the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>court to the Court of Appeals\u2014Randolph for Dunlop \u2014Nicholas, attorney-general, for the Commonwealth. The case was argued by both counsel, and Lyons, judge, delivered the opinion of the court. He dismissed the appeal \u201cbecause it had been improperly granted: that the <em>amicus curiae </em>could not move to quash an inquisition, when it did not appear <em>that he had any interest </em>himself,, <em>or represented any one who had.\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-4\">In this case the court would not <em>presume </em>an interest in the <em>amicus curiae. </em>That Dunlop was a \u201c citizen,\u201d there was no question; that he was a \u201ctax-payer,\u201d they were bound to presume; that he was a real estate owner does not appear; but it does appear that he made his motion because of the interest he felt to prevent its being set aside at a future day, and purchasers from being injured; so that the case at bar is covered entirely by the case of <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>2 Call. 284. His (Dunlop\u2019s) interest was to prevent any defect in the proceedings, <em>and to protect the interests of the Commonwealth, </em>as well as those of the purchasers. The alleged interests of the exceptants in the case at the bar, is to protect the interests of the county and the citizens thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">It is laid down in the case of <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>The Tawvale Railway and Dock Company, </em>13 Beav. a vol., which I have not been able, however, to find, but referred to in Brightly\u2019s TI. S. Digest, that \u201ca plaintiff cannot sue as one <em>of the public,\"to </em>restrain a company from closing their railway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\">In the <em>People </em>v. <em>Cutting, </em>3 John. R. 1, it was decided that \u201ca mere stranger,\u201d that is, a man without a fixed and definite interest, \u201c cannot interpose a traverse vs. the people;\u201d but in the same case the court said that a <em>possessory </em>right was sufficient for that purpose. In these two cases two propositions are decided. 1st. That an indifferent, iminterested man\u2014\u201cone of the public\u201d\u2014a \u201cmere stranger\u201d\u2014cannot interpose himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>between <em>parties </em>litigant, for the reason that he has no interest. The 2d, the converse proposition that a <em>right </em>- <em>in the subject </em>was sufficient for the purpose. These ex-ceptants here set up no right, claim no interest, present or prospective, either for themselves or in behalf of any one else. They do not allege an interest in the matter themselves; nor, in the language of <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>do they make a suggestion on behalf of any person who is \u201cbefore the court and <em>concerned in interest.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-9\">Again, in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Supervisors of Albany City, </em>12 John. R. 414, a motion was made to lay out a road to suit the applicants\u2019 convenience. It was opposed on the ground that the commissioners had the discretion to lay it out as they saw fit; and that a <em>mandamus </em>would not lie; the applicant <em>having no legal or precise right.\u201d </em>See also <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Supervisors of Oneida County, 19 </em>John. R. 259.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-10\">In <em>John Giles\u2019 case, </em>2 Strange 881, a <em>mandamus </em>was moved- for to certain justices, to grant him (John Giles) a license to keep an ale house. It was opposed on the ground -that it was discretionary in the justices; and the court refused it, saying, \u201c'there never was an instance of such a <em>mandamus.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-11\">In <em>The People </em>v. <em>Champion &amp; others, </em>16 John. R. 61, \u201c any person conceiving himself aggrieved by a decision of the court of Highways, may appeal to the judges of the court of Common Pleas. But the right of appeal by \u201c any person,\u201d will be found to be given by <em>statute.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-12\">In our own State, \u201c any inhabitant \u201d of the county, on ten days\u2019 notice to any merchant who has obtained a certificate to get an ordinary license, may move the court which granted it to revoke the same. But this is by virtue of <em>express statute </em>also. See ch. 38, sec. 37, title 12, Code of Virginia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-13\">By an act of Assembly, passed in 1870, fifteen voters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>were authorized to make their complaint of \u201c an undue election, or false return,\u201d two of whom shall take and subscribe an oath to the truth of the same, and the court shall proceed upon the merits, and determine the same; and the complaint shall not be regarded by the court if not filed within ten days after said election. See Sess. Acts 1870, p. 95.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-4\">Again, by an act passed July, 1870, providing for the reassessment of the lands of the Commonwealth, page 339, any person feeling himself aggrieved in the assessment of his land, may apply to the court to have the assessment corrected; and this, on <em>affidavit sworn to </em>by the person or his agent, that the assessment is excessive. Other cases might be cited, but it is deemed unnecessary. Enough has been shown in the way of legislation to show, most <em>persuasively </em>at least, that it never was the intention of the Legislature, in cases like these, or like the one at the bar, to allow <em>any per</em>son., any one of the public, either as <em>amicus curiae, </em>or as <em>amicuspopuli, </em>on a fancied interest, or in cherished hostility, either to <em>facilitate </em>or <em>obstruct </em>the execution of the laws; and to that extent to interfere with the administration of the government through its agents or otherwise. Can it be supposed that it was ever contemplated by the Legislature that any man, of his own accord, prompted it might be by feelings of the most captious sort, should have it in his power, by raising frivolous and capricious objections in proceedings of this kind, to arrest and delay a great and useful enterprise ! If it had been, we think, from what has already been shown, that it would have provided for it, and not left it to inference or argument, or to the whims and caprices of the citizen, and delays and uncertainties of the courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-5\">It was asked by one of the attorneys for the exceptants, if the board of supervisors could erect a bowling alley at the expense of the county? \"While it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>be confessed that, as a corporate body, they are clothed with very large and extensive powers respecting the - care of the county property, and the management of the business and concerns of the county, yet, it is one thing to have exclusive, and another and a very different thing to have <em>absolute </em>powers; and hence, I answer, <em>no! </em>That would be plainly a gross perversion of their powers, for which they would be liable on their bonds in <em>damages.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-9\">It was also urged, with earnestness, ingenuity and ability, by counsel for the exceptants, that there might be <em>collusion between the board and the owners of the land, </em>or those interested in the condemnation money, and in that way (I presume they meant to say) the assessment might be inordinate and excessive. The ready reply to this most improbable presumption is, that that collusion could be of no practical avail whatever, unless it were participated in by the five commissioners, chosen for their intelligence, disinterestedness and character, and who would be as much interested to keep down the assessment as any other tax-payer and real estate owner in the county. But this would be a violent presumption of fraud, contrary to all the rules of evidence in law and equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-10\">In considering this question, I have tried to steer clear of the merits of the exceptions, save so far as they were connected with it inseparably. In coming to the conclusion I have, I have done so with diffidence and distrust. If I had consulted my own inclinations, it would have been to admit these complainants, and hear them upon the merits of these exceptions. But I had a duty to perform, and upon the best consideration I have been able to give to it, as one of <em>legal right and legal powers, </em>I am brought to the conclusion, that if they have, as citizens, tax-payers and real estate owners,\u201d any right to be heard upon this subject, it is not in this court, in this shape and form, but in another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>forum. I therefore overrule the motion to file the ex- ,. ceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-6\">To the opinion of the court overruling their motion \u2022and confirming the report, Gorrell and his associates filed a bill of exceptions; and applied to the judge of the Circuit court for a supersedeas to the order of the County court; which was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-7\">The supervisors thereupon applied to this court for a writ of prohibition to the judge of the Circuit court,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-8\">Gorrell and the other parties, to forbid them to proceed upon said supersedeas. A full statement of the case is made in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-9\">The case was argued by <em>Gibson, </em>for the petitioners, and by <em>James Green, </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b527-10\">Moncure, P.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHG\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AMX\">This is a ease of novelty, not only on account of the nature of the proceeding, but of the questions which it involves. It is a case of prohibition, brought in this court as a court of original jurisdiction. By the constitution, article VT, \u00a7 2, this court is invested with \u201c appellate jurisdiction only, except in cases of <em>habeas corpus, mandamus and prohibition.\u201d </em>And this provision of the constitution in regard to <em>mandamus </em>and <em>prohibition, </em>is carried into effect by chapter 160, \u00a7 4 of the Code, as amended by the act approved June 23, 1870, Acts of Assembly, 1869-70, page 219, chap. 171, which declares that \u201c the said Supreme court, besides having jurisdiction of all such matters as are now pending therein, shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of <em>mandamus </em>and <em>prohibition </em>to the Circuit and Corporation courts, and to the Hustings court and the Chancery court of the city of Richmond, and in all other cases in which it may be necessary to prevent a failure of justice, in which a <em>mandamus </em>may issue, according to the principles of the common law. The practice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>proceedings upon such writs shall he governed and regulated in all cases by the principles and practice \u25a0 now prevailing in respect to writs of <em>mandamus </em>and <em>prohibition, </em>respectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">This is the second case of prohibition that has ever been brought in this court, as a court of original jurisdiction; the first being that of Ellyson <em>ex parte, </em>brought and decided within the last year. <em>Supra </em>p. 10. There have been several cases before this court as an <em>appellate </em>court. The first of which was <em>Mayo, mayor, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>James, </em>12 Gratt. 17; since which are the cases of <em>Warwick, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>15 Id. 528; and <em>West </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>16 Id. 270. There were several cases before the General court during its existence. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>1 Va. Cas. 158; <em>Hutson </em>v. <em>Lowry, </em>2 Id. 42; and <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>Id. 636. The questions upon the merits involved in this case, relate to the nature and extent of the powers and duties of boards of supervisors of the counties, under the constitution and laws of the State. In order that all the questions arising in the case may be properly presented and well understood, we deem it necessary to set forth, substantially, the proceedings which have been had in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">During the present term of this court, to wit: on the 9th day of March, 1871, \u201c the board of supervisors of the county of Culpeper,\u201d by their counsel, presented a petition to this court, representing, in substance, that, by the laws of the State, they have sole control, power and care of and over all the corporate property of said county, and where none exists they are required to procure and provide all such as may be necessary; that when they came into their said office, they found that the courthouse, the jail, the clerk\u2019s office, and most of the public square, on which said buildings had stood, had all been sold, and the buildings themselves torn down and removed; that finding the portion of the lot remaining undisposed of insufficient and wholly made<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>quate for the county purposes, they proceeded, in accordance with a decision of this court upon their powers in this matter, to sell the balance of said lot, and from the proceeds of these sales realized some $18,000; that then, by virtue of their aforesaid powers, and in discharge of their aforesaid duties, they proceeded to select other suitable ground, and to commence thereupon the buildings required of them by law; that they selected a most suitable and proper spot within the corporation of the town of Culpeper, and, thinking it most prudent, called upon the county court, in accordance with the general provisions relating to corporations, council of towns, &amp;c., to have the damages assessed and the title perfected; that legal notice was given to the tenants of the freehold, and commissioners were appointed, who legally discharged their duties and made their report to the said court. Whereupon sundry citizens, by name \u201cJoseph B. G-orrell,\u201d &amp;e. (eight in number, naming them), styling themselves \u201c citizens, tax-payers and real estate owners,\u201d who had entered into a conspiracy for the purpose of hindering and harassing the said board in the discharge of their said duty, and for selfish purposes to compel your petitioners to put these public buildings on lots adjoining and adjacent to their stores and other property, came into the said court, offered to make themselves parties on the record, and asked leave to file sundry formal exceptions to the report of said commissioners, denying the powers of the said hoard, &amp;c.; that the said court refused to hear them in this manner, and confirmed the said report, and condemned the lot therein described; that thereupon they appealed to His Honor, Henry Shackelford, judge of the Circuit court of Culpeper county, who granted them an order of supersedeas; the effect of which has been to arrest and delay them in the discharge of their duties and powers aforesaid. Bor the verification and more full explanation of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>these statements, reference is made to an official copy of the record, which is marked \u201cA\u201d and filed with the petition as a part thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The petitioners further aver, that prior to the said order of Judge Shackelford they had entered into a contract for the erection of the aforesaid buildings, by which the county became liable to pay between eighteen and nineteen thousand dollars by the first day of July, 1872; that the contractor is now at work under said contract, and unless something is speedily done to prevent, the said county will become liable to heavy damages for her failure under her contract. They say they are advised that the said Judge Shackelford had no jurisdiction in this matter; because the power to do whatever is necessary in relation to corporate property is given by law to' the board of supervisors, without any right of appeal, except as therein specified; and because, if this were not so, these persons aforesaid, not being parties, could not appeal, so as to give Judge Shackelford jurisdiction; and further, that if he had any jurisdiction, it was only as to the amount of the damages, the law having denied him all jurisdiction to stop said public work. They therefore pray this court to award a writ of prohibition against the said Henry Shackelford, judge as aforesaid, and the said Joseph B. Gorrell, and other persons named as aforesaid, commanding them to proceed no further under the aforesaid order; and that the latter shall not further plead, and the former shall not further entertain, any pleas in \u25a0and upon the matters aforementioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Annexed to the petition is an affidavit of the truth of the facts therein stated, made by Thomas B. Halle, who appears to he chairman of the board of supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Hpon the presentation of the said petition, it was ordered by this court that a rule he issued against the said Joseph B. Gorrell and the other persons com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>plained of therein, including the said Henry Shackle-ford, judge of the Circuit court of Culpeper county, to appear here on the 17th day of March, 1871, and shew cause why a writ of prohibition should not be awarded against them, according to the prayer of the said petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The rule was accordingly issued, and service thereof was duly acknowledged by all the persons against whom it was entered. On the return day of the rule, to wit, the 17th day of March, 1871, three of the said persons, to wit, Charles Waite, John G. Miller, and the Hon. Henry Shackleford, failed to appear, as required by the rule. The other six of the said persons, to wit, Joseph 33. Gorrell, Lewis P. Helson, Edward 33. Hill, E. 13. Johnson, J. H. Armstrong and Thomas S. Alcocke, appeared by counsel and filed an answer to the said petition and rule. After saving all benefit of exception and demurrer to the said petition and the affidavit of Thomas 33. Halle, thereto annexed, the respondents, in their answer, say, it is not true, as alleged in said petition, \u201cthat when they (the said supervisors) came into their said office they found that the courthouse, the jail, the clerk\u2019s office, and most of the public square on which said buildings had stood, had all been sold, and the buildings themselves torn down and removed.\u201d On the contrary, no part of the clerk\u2019s office has been torn down or removed, but is now, and has been, continuously used as such, for a period of not less than half a century; that the portion of the public lot remaining unsold when the said supervisors came into office, was amply sufficient for the erection of a new courthouse and jail; that the nearest of the lots sold off theretofore is more than eighty feet distant from the site of the old courthouse; that it is not true that the said supervisors have sold the balance of said public lot; on the contrary, a portion of the said public lot remains to this day unsold; that it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>true that the said supervisors realized from the sales made by them some $18,000; on the contrary, all the \u25a0 cash they have received from said sales is $425, out of' which-they have paid sundry charges and expenses of sale. The credit instalments of said sales amount only to the sum of $4,875, no part of which is yet due. It is not true that they selected other suitable ground and commenced thereupon the buildings required of them by law; on the contrary, the lot selected by them is not suitable, nor have they, to this day, commenced any buildings thereupon, nor has any material for building been deposited on said lot, to give the slightest color to said allegation. It is not true that legal notice was-given in the jn\u2019oceedings to condemn said lot to the tenants of the freehold; on the contrary, no notice-whatever was given to any tenant of the freehold, nor did the commissioners appointed to assess the damages-proceed according to law in order to pass the title to-said lot; that said respondents are citizens, tax-payers and real estate owners within the county of Culpeper; that it is not true that they had entered into a conspiracy for the purpose of hindering and harrassing said board in the discharge of their duties, and for selfish-purposes, to compel said board to put the public buildings on lots adjoining and adjacent to their own stores, and other property; on the contrary, the steps they have taken were taken to prevent, by an appeal to the. law, public .officers from proceeding contrary to law, to prevent their own money to be raised by taxation and otherwise, from being expended on a lot to which no title would be acquired by the proceedings in the County court; that it is true these respondents came, into the- County court of Culpeper, offered to make themselves parties on the record, and asked leave to file sundry., exceptions to the confirmation of the report of said commissioners; and that said court refused to allow them to show cause against the confir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>mation of said report, but confirmed said report without hearing them; and that they obtained from Judge Shackleford a supersedeas to said order of the County \u25a0court. They insist that the Circuit court of Culpeper has jurisdiction in the premises, and they pray that the [said rule may be discharged. If, however, this \u2022court shall be of opinion that said rule ought not to be discharged, then they insist that the said petitioners be required to proceed regularly, and to declare in prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The answer is supported by an affidavit of the respondents, thereto annexed, of the truth of the facts therein stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">On the filing of the said answer, the respondents, by their counsel, moved to discharge the said rule; and the cause thereupon came on to be heard upon the said petition and the said motion, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, the court is of opinion as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">I. The first question which arises in this case is, as to the powers of the board of supervisors of a county, under the constitution and laws of the State; and whether they have power, to acquire land; and if so, in what mode, for the erection thereon of a court-house, \u2022clerk\u2019s office and jail, and for other public county purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The office of supervisor was unknown to the constitution and laws of Virginia until the adoption of the present constitution, which went into effect during the last year. It results from the system of county organization, taken, substantially, from the constitutions of some of the northern and north-western States, and engrafted upon our constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The provision of the constitution which relates to the subject is the second section of the seventh article; which, so far as it is material to be stated, is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u201cEach county of the State shall he divided into so&gt; many compactly-located townships as may be necessary, not less than three,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cThe supervisors of each township shall constitute the board of supervisors, for that county; and shall assemble at the court-house thereof on the first Monday in December in each year* and proceed to audit the accounts of said county, examine the books of the assessors, regulate and equalize the valuation of property, fix the county levies for the ensuing year, apportion the same among the various townships, and perform such other duties as shall be prescribed by law.\u201d Acts of Assembly 1869-70, p.. 624.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">In the act appi\u2019oved July 11, 1870, entitled \u201cAn act prescribing the duties and compensation of certain township officers,\u201d Id. page 269, chap. 188, are the following, among other provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">\u201c 5. The board of supervisors of each county in this State shall have power at the meeting on the first Monday in December in each year:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-11\">\u201cFirst. To audit the accounts of the county; to settle with the county treasurer his accounts for the year, in the manner prescribed by law; to settle with the sheriff his accounts upon the collection of fines or other-monies accruing and belonging to the county; to receive, audit and approve the report and accounts of the superintendent of the poor; and, generally, to settle with any other officer who may have an account with the county, and to take such steps as may be necessary to secure a full and satisfactory exhibit and settlement of the affairs of the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-12\">\u201cSecond. To examine the books of the assessors and regulate and equalize the valuation of property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-13\">\u201cThird. To fix the county levies for the ensuing year, upon the information afforded by the above settlements, and to apportion- the same among the various townships of the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u201c 6. The said board of supervisors of each county of the State shall have power, at said meeting in December, or at any other legal meeting:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-3\">\u201cFirst. To make such orders concerning the corporate property of the county as they may deem expedient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">\u201c Second. To examine, settle and allow all accounts chargeable against such county, and when so settled they may issue county warrants therefor, as provided by law. But the board of supervisors of any county shall not issue in any one year a greater amount of county warrants than the amount of the county tax levied in such county for such year; and no interest shall ever be paid by any county on any county order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\u201cThird. To build and keep in repair county buildings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201cFourth. To cause the county buildings to be insured in the name of the board of supervisors of said county and their successors in office, for the benefit of the county, if they shall deem it expedient; and in case there are no public buildings, to provide suitable rooms for county purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\u201cFifth. To direct the raising of such sums of money as may be necessary to defray the county charges \u00e1nd expenses, and all necessary charges incident to or arising from the execution of their lawful authority, if the same has not been provided for at the December meeting, and is necessary under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">\u201c Sixth. To represent the county, and to have the care of the county property, and the management of the business and concerns of the county in all cases where no other provision shall be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">\u201c Seventh. To perform all other acts and duties which may be authorized and required by law, not embraced in this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">It will thus be perceived that, under our new internal organization of the State, the most important pow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ers and duties, in regard to the police and property of the counties, are devolved on the boards of supervisors thereof respectively. The first section of the act referred to makes them a <em>quasi </em>corporation, with capacity to sue and to be sued. The seventh section declares that they may have a seal; that they shall sit with open doors, and that all persons conducting themselves in an orderly manner may attend their meetings. By subsequent sections, the attorney for the Commonwealth is required to represent the county before the board of supervisors, who are clothed with important judicial functions, and from whose decisions only a limited right of appeal is allowed. The 20th section provides for their compensation and travelling expenses; and. the 21st section requires them to give bonds conditioned for the faithful discharge of their duties; and for any violation of the condition thereof makes them and their sureties liable thereon for damages to any party injured thereby, and subjects them to a penalty for refusing or neglecting, without just cause, to perform any of their official duties. The supervisors are to be elected annually by their respective townships; and looking to the great importance of their office, and the deep interest which the people have in its faithful execution, it may fairly be presumed that the most intelligent, discreet and virtuous men, in the community in which they live, will be elected to the office, and that if any of them should turn out to be unfaithful or unfit, they will not be reelected.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Having made these general observations in regard to the powers of the board of supervisors, under the constitution and laws of the State, let us now proceed to the particular enquiry with which the question under consideration closes; that is: whether they have power to acquire land, and if so, in what mode, for the erection thereon of a court-house, clerk\u2019s office and jail, and for other public purposes of the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>And, in the first place, have they power to <em>acquire </em>land for those purposes ?</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Ho <em>express </em>power is given them to acquire land for any purpose. But power is expressly given them \u201cto build and keep in repair county buildings;\u201d \u201cand, in ease there are no public buildings, to provide suitable rooms for county purposes;\u201d and \u201c to represent the county and to have the care of the county property, and the management of the business and concerns of the county, in all cases where no other provision shall be made.\u201d How can they discharge these express powers and duties, without the power to acquire land? Suppose a county is without a courthouse, clerk\u2019s office or jail, and without ground on which to build them: how are the board of supervisors to perform their express power and duty in such a case, \u201cto build and keep in repair county buildings,\u201d without first acquiring the ground on which to erect these necessary buildings ? The implied power to acquire the ground is as plainly given as the express power to erect the buildings. In the construction of the most naked powers, to which the strictest rules of construction are \u25a0applied, there is no better settled rule than this, that every power necessary to the execution of an express power is plainly implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">But this very question has, in effect, been settled by a unanimous decision of this court, in a recent case, to which the board of supervisors of the county of Culpeper were parties. Robert D. Keerl, and four other citizens of said county, obtained an injunction to restrain the said board of supervisors from selling the land on which the public buildings of the county were standing; upon the ground, alleged in the bill, that the said board had no power to sell or convey said public lot, or any portion thereof; that the fee simple title to the land was in the county; and that the said Id oar d had no title, and could pass none whatever, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the property. Upon the answer of the board of supervisors, claiming power by law to sell the property, the- \u2022 injunction was dissolved by Judge Shackleford. An application was made to this court by the plaintiffs, for an appeal from the said order of dissolution. And on the 9th day of November, 1870, this court, being of' opinion that the said order was plainly right, refused to grant such appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Now, there is no <em>express </em>power to sell the land given by law to the board of supervisors, any more than <em>express </em>power given them to acquire land. The power-to sell land in the case referred to was implied, chiefly from the express power \u201c to make such orders concerning the corporate property of the county as they may deem expedient.\u201d The implication in this case, of the power to acquire land, seems to be stronger, if' possible, than the implication in that case of the power-to sell land. After the exercise of the power of sale,, which was accorded to them in that case, the power to-acquire land became indispensably necessary to the exercise of the express power \u201c to build and keep in repair county buildings.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">It is argued by the counsel for the defendants, that-the power to acquire land, on which to erect the public buildings of the county, when necessary, is vested by law in the county court, instead of the board of supervisors of such county. He cites, in support of that argument, chapter 50, \u00a7 1 of the Code, which declares, that <em>\u201c </em>there shall be provided by the court of every county, and by the council of each town wherein there-is a corporation court, a courthouse, clerk\u2019s office and jail; the cost whereof, and of the land on which they-may be,- and qf keeping the same in good order, shall be chargeable to the county or corporation, and may be levied for by such court or council. The fee simple-of the land shall be in the county or corporation, and the court thereof may purchase so much land as, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>what it may before have had, will make two acres, whereof what may be necessary shall be occupied with the courthouse, clerk\u2019s office and jail, and the residue planted with trees, and kept as a place for the people of the county to meet and confer together.\u201d And he contends that this law has not been altered by subsequent legislation, but, on the contrary, has been thereby continued in force. In proof of which, he cites chapter 38, \u00a7 3, of the act approved April 2, 1870, which declares that \u201cthe powers, duties, authority and jurisdictiosi of said courts (the County courts), shall be and continue as now provided by law, except in so far as the same are modified by the constitution of the State.\u201d And he contends that it was by design, and for a reasonable purpose, as well as in accordance with the plan of the Legislature in other similar cases, to vest powers in reference to the same subject in different agents, so as to operate as salutary checks and balances.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">We think the effect in this case would be more likely to produce discord and embarrassment where unity and concert are eminently required. \u00a5e think that the whole law on this subject must be construed together; that the act just cited must be viewed in connection with the act subsequently passed during the same session of the Legislature, prescribing the powers and duties of the board of supervisors; Id. 269; and, when there is any conflict between the two, the act posterior in date must prevail. According to this rule of construction, the power of the board of supervisors to acquire la3id for the purposes aforesaid, is, we think, plainly implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">And now the question comes up, How is the acquisition to be made ?</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Of course it may be made by purchase, in the ordinary way of acquiring title to land. But to make a purchase, it is necessary that the owner of the land ' should be competent to sell it, and willing to do so, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>terms which the purchaser may he willing to accept. If the owner he under a disability, as, for instance, be an infant or a feme covert, or be unwilling to sell on terms on which the person wishing to make the purchase is willing to buy, then, to acquire title to the land, some other means must be resorted to than an ordinary contract of purchase and sale between competent parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Such appears to have been the case here. The owners, or some of them, of the land selected by the board of supervisors for the location of the county buildings of Culpeper, were under disability, and the board of supervisors thought it necessary or proper to resort to legal proceedings to acquire title to the said land. They accordingly proceeded in the mode prescribed by the Code, chapter 56, \u00a7\u00a7 6-16, pp. 324-326. The 6th section provides, that, \u201c If the president and directors of a company incorporated for a work of internal improvement, the court of a county, or the council of a town, cannot agree on the terms of purchase with those entitled to lands wanted for the purposes of the company, county or town, five disinterested freeholders shall, be appointed by the court of the county or corporation in which such land, or the greater part thereof shall lie (any three of whom may act), for the purpose of ascertaining a just compensation for such land.\u201d The remaining sections referred to prescribe whatever else is to be done to complete the acquisition of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">These provisions of law are not confined to cases in which competent contracting parties cannot agree on the terms of purchase, but extend also to cases in which there can be no such agreement, on account of the disability of any of the owners, or otherwise. .</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">But it is argued that these provisions authorize the <em>court of a county </em>to . acquire title to land in the mode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>and for the purposes thereby prescribed, but not the <em>board of supervisors </em>of a county.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">We think that the board of supervisors of a county being now exclusively invested by the constitution and laws of the State, as we have already shewn, with the power and duty of providing public buildings for such county, and procuring the necessary land for that purpose, it follows, as a necessary consequence, that they must have power to proceed in the mode prescribed by the provisions aforesaid; that being the only mode whereby a good title can be acquired to the land selected by them for the location of the public buildings of the county. \"It was surely not designed to take away from a county the right it had to select the most suitable location for its public buildings, without regard to the ownership of the land, and to confine it to such a location only as could be acquired by agreement with the owner. These provisions . authorized the <em>County court </em>to institute proceedings for the condemnation of land for county purposes, because that court was then the agent of the county for providing county buildings, and procuring the necessary land for that purpose. But the new constitution and laws having created another agency for the purpose, and having transferred the duty of providing county buildings and procuring land for the purpose, from the county court to_ the board of supervisors, these new agents have implied power to use the means provided by law for the condemnation of land, when necessary to enable them to discharge that duty. The power to acquire land by purchase, and the power to acquire it by condemnation for county purposes, ought to be in the hands of the same agent. And as the former is now in the hands of the board of supervisors, it is fair to presume that it was intended to place the latter there also.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The board of supervisors of the county of Culpeper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>had power, therefore, to acquire title to the land selected by them for the location of the public buildings of the county in the mode prescribed by the provisions aforesaid. And we proceed to consider the next question arising in this case, which is,</p>\n<p id=\"ACr\">\u00dc. \"What is the nature of the proceeding instituted by pbe said board of supervisors for the condemnation of the said land, and had the defendants in this cause a right to appear and show cause against the confirmation of the report as they proposed to do in that case?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The proper mode of acquiring title to land which is needed for public purposes, is to purchase it in the ordinary way, if that can be done on reasonable terms. But if that cannot be done, the only other mode which can be pursued is the one prescribed by the 56th chapter of the Code, which was pursued in this case. The provisions of that chapter which relate to this subject are those embraced in sections 6-16, pp. 324-\u20195 and \u20196. Their only object is to ascertain the value of the land and to vest the title thereto in the public for the purposes for which it is needed. They do not involve any question as to the propriety of the selection made by the board of supervisors, when they are the parties proposing to condemn the land. That is a question which the law refers to their discretion only; and whe-fcher that discretion be wisely or unwisely exercised in the selection made by them, cannot be enquired into in the proceeding instituted to condemn the land. They can select any land which they think most suitable for the purpose for which it is needed, no matter who owns the land, nor whether he be willing to part with it or not, nor whether he be under a disability or not, nor whether he be a resident of the country or not, nor whether the title be in controversy or under a \u25a0cloud or not. The eminent domain of the Commonwealth exists in all the land within her limits, and is \u25a0jprior and paramount to the title of any individual; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>and it is in virtue of that right of eminent domain, that land is taken for public purposes. The law has provided the most summary and simple mode of pro- \u25a0 ceeding to acquire title to the land, and at the same time has taken special care to secure just compensation to the owner. One chief object of the law is to avoid delay and to secure to the public the immediate and uninterrupted possession and use of the land. Bive disinterested freeholders (any three of whom may act), are to be appointed by the court of the county in which the land shall lie, for the purpose of ascertaining a just compensation for such land. \u00a7 6. It is not necessary, as in the case of a chancery suit, to convene all persons interested in the subject as parties to the proceeding. It is not even necessary, in all cases, to .give any notice of the proceeding to the owner of the land. \u201c\"When it is intended to apply for such appointment (of freeholders) ten days previous notice thereof shall be served on the tenant of the freehold, or his .guardian or committee. But if there be no such tenant, guardian or committed within the county or corporation, the notice, instead of being thus served, may be published once a week, for four weeks, in some convenient paper, and posted at the door of the courthouse of the county or corporation on the first day of the term next preceding the application.\u201d \u00a7 7. \u201c tenant of the freehold,\u201d as here used, means tenant in possession, appearing as the visible owner. Such was held to be the meaning of the word \u201cproprietor,\u201d in <em>Pitzer </em>v. <em>Williams, 2 </em>Bob. B. 241. The proceeding in that case was to condemn land for the abutment of a dam, proposed to be made by a person desiring to build a machine useful to the public. \u201cBo man\u2019s property\u201d (says Judge Allen, in whose opinion the other judges concurred), \u201c should be taken without just compensation. The law provides the mode by which that compensation is to be ascertained, leaving it to the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>plicant to pay to the party entitled at his peril. Unless this were so, land for public improvements or other necessary public purposes, could not he con-clemne(l where the owner was unknown; and thus enterprises of great utility might he arrested for this cause. This law itself merely requires notice to proprietor or his agent, when found in the county; hut the land of any person may he condemned, no matter whether he he found in the county or not; and when it is so condemned, and the money is paid to the party entitled, the applicant becomes seized in fee simple. This proves that, in the contemplation of the Legislature, it was not essential that the true owner should he a party to the proceeding by which he is divested of the fee for purposes of this' character; that where notice can readily be given, it should he done; hut whether it be given or not, a just compensation should he secured to him. I think, therefore, that notice to the tenant in possession as the visible owner was sufficient.\u201d These observations apply with increased force to this case, in which the object was to condemn land for the purpose of erecting thereon a court-house, clerk\u2019s office and jail. The 8th section of the chapter before referred to requires the day for the meeting of the freeholders to be designated in the order appointing them. The 9th section requires them to take an oath before executing their duties, and requires it to he certified in a prescribed form. The 10th section requires them, after viewing the land and hearing such proper evidence as either party may oiler, to ascertain what will he a just compensation for the said land, and for the damages to the residue of the tract, beyond the peculiar benefits to he derived in respect to such residue from the work to he constructed, and to make report in substance as prescribed in the said section. The 11th section provides that the said report and the certificate of the justice shall he forthwith returned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the court; \u201cand unless good cause he shown\u2019 against the report the same shall he confirmed and recorded. The sum so ascertained to he a just compensation may he paid to the persons entitled thereto, or into court. Upon such payment, the title to that part of the land for which such compensation is allowed shall he absolutely vested in the company, county or town, in fee simple,\u201d &amp;c. When the owner is known, and at hand, and under no disability, the money will generally he paid to him. But when he is not known, or absent, or under a disability, or there is any controversy about the title, the money will he paid into court; and in either case a good title is thereby acquired. The 12th and 13th sections are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">\u201c12. If, however, good cause he shown against the report, or if the commissioners report their disagreement, or if they fail to report within a reasonable time, the court may, without further notice, as often as seems to it proper, appoint other commissioners; and the matter may he proceeded in as before prescribed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201c13. Whether any such new appointment he made or not, the company, county or town, on paying into court the sum ascertained by the previous report, may, notwithstanding the pendency of proceedings, enter into and construct their work upon or through that part of the land described in such previous report. Andno order shall he made, nor any injunction awarded by any court or judge, to stay the proceedings of the company, county or town, in the prosecution of their work, unless it he manifest that they, their officers, agents or servants, are transcending their authority, and that the interposition of the court is necessary to prevent injury that cannot he adequately compensated in damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The latter of these two sections plainly expresses the intention of the Legislature, that the proceedings therein referred to are not to be delayed or obstructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>by litigation or otherwise without the greatest necessity. And in <em>The James River and Kanawha Company </em>v. <em>Anderson and </em>others, 12 Leigh 278, it was unanimously held by this court that it is not competent to a court of chancery to award an injunction to stay the proceedings of the company in the prosecution of its works of any kind, unless it be manifest, <em>both that </em>it is transcending the authority given by its charter, <em>and </em>that the interposition of the court is necessary to prevent injury that cannot be adequately compensated in damages. The two circumstances must concur, to warrant a court in awarding such process. The observations of Tucker P. and Allen J. in that case are very emphatic, and apply with great force to the case we now have under consideration; but it is unnecessary to repeat them here. See, also, the case of <em>The Tuckahoe Canal Co. </em>v. <em>The Tuckahoe Railroad Co., </em>11 Leigh 42, in which the same doctrine was held. The 14th and 15th sections provide for what is to be done in case of another report after the money reported to be due by a former one is paid into court. The 16th, being the last section of the series referred to, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">\u201cTo enable the court to dispose properly of any money so paid into court, it may have enquiries by a commissioner, to ascertain what persons are entitled, thereto, and in what proportions; and may make an order of publication, requiring all interested to appear before the commissioner, that their respective claims may be passed upon. After such reference to a commissioner and such publication, the court shall make such disposition of the money so paid into court as may seem to it right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">We see here what careful provision is made by law to secure the payment of the money into the proper hand to receive it; and it can rarely if ever happen that the money will be paid into improper hands. Should it so happen, however, the only consequence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u25a0could be that the company, county or town seeking to have a condemnation of the land, might have- to pay \u25a0for it over again. There would be no danger of losing \u2022the buildings or works constructed on the land, or of being delayed in the construction of the work The \u25a0claim of the owner, at most, would only be for the 'value of the land without the works; to which value he might be entitled on the ground that private property cannot betaken for public uses without just compensation to the owner. Whether he would be so entitled, under such circumstances, is a question which does not arise, and is not intended to be decided here.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">And now we come to that part of the question we have under consideration at present, which is, had the defendants in this cause a right to appear and show \u25a0cause against the confirmation of the report, as they proposed to uo ?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The board of supervisors of Culpeper county, having selected two acres of land .in the town of Culpeper, belonging, as they say, to Eliza T. C. Jameson and \u2022others, for the purpose of having the public buildings of the county erected thereon; and finding it necessary \u2022 to have the same condemned for that purpose, according to law; proceeded accordingly, after giving due notice to the said alleged owners, to have five disinterested freeholders of the county appointed by the County court thereof, who, or any three of whom, being first duly sworn, were to go upon said land, on a designated day, and ascertain, faithfully and impartially, what would be a just compensation for so much thereof as was proposed to be taken by the county of Culpeper for its purposes, and make report to the court, according to law. Three of the said freeholders, accordingly, after being first duly sworn, went upon the said land, ascertained what would be a just compensation for so much thereof as was proposed to be taken as aforesaid, and, on the 9th of December, 1870, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>made and returned a report of their proceedings, in which report the boundaries of the two acres of land proposed to be condemned as aforesaid, were specifically set out, and the sum of six hundred dollars was stated to be a just compensation for the land to the owners thereof. On the 20th day of January, 1871, on motion of the board of supervisors, to confirm and record said report, Joseph B. Gorrell and seven others, defendants in this cause, claiming to be citizens of the county of Culpeper, tax-payers and real estate owners-therein, moved said court to allow them to shew cause against the confirmation of said report, by filing 12 exceptions in writing for that purpose, which they exhibited. But the court being of opinion that they had no right to be heard in the said proceeding, overruled their said motion to be allowed to shew cause against said report, refused to allow said exceptions to be filed, confirmed the said report, and ordered the same to be recorded. But, on motion of said Gorrell and others, the said judgment was suspended for thirty days, to allow them to apply for an appeal from and supersedeas to the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">The exceptions referred to are as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">1st. Because the hoard of supervisors of said county have no power to condemn private property, or to ask for a condemnation of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">2nd. Because the County court of Culpeper have no-power, at the instance of the said board of supervisors, to condemn private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">3rd. Because the tenants of the freehold of said two acres of land mentioned in said report of said commissioners, had no notice of the application of said board of supervisors to said County court to appoint commissioners to condemn said two acres of land. The said two acres of land, formerly belonged to said John Jameson, who, by deed dated the day of , conveyed the tract of land, embracing said two acres, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>to William Major and William Emerson, upon certain trusts therein specified. Said deed is duly recorded in the clerk\u2019s office of the County court of Culpeper, an office copy of which is herewith filed, to prove that \u2022said Eliza T. C. Jameson, Philip L. Jameson, in his own right, and as committee of John Jameson, and John W. Jameson, are not tenants of the freehold.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">4th.. Because Eliza T. C. Jameson, Philip L. Jame-son, in his own right, and as committee of John Jame-son, and John W. Jameson, have no legal title whatsoever to said two acres of land, as is shewn by said deed mentioned in third exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">5th. Because, by the decree of the Circuit court of Culpeper, made in the chancery suit now pending in said court, of Major\u2019s ex\u2019ors <em>v. </em>Jameson and others, the said two acres of land, together with the tract of land \u25a0of which it is a part, was decreed to be sold to satisfy a debt due from the said trust estate to tbe estate of said William Major, trustee, amounting to about $20,000. The beneficiaries in the estate of said William Major are John C. Major, Thomas B. Halle and Columbiana his wife, in right of said Columbiana, and Eliza T. C. Jameson, and William Major, whose interest has been vested in Lewis E. Higby, his assignee in bankruptcy, subject to liens theretofore acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">6th. Because the said Couuty court cannot divest the said Circuit court of Culpeper of its jurisdiction over said property; the latter having taken jurisdiction and entered decrees in said suit for a sale of said property; which decree of sale has been enjoined at the instance of said Philip L. Jameson.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">7th. Because said two acres of land are not sufficiently described in said report.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">8th. Because it does not appear, by any of the proceedings, that said board of supervisors could not agree on the terms of purchase with those entitled to said two acres of land, or that it made any effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>purchase said two acres of land from those entitled thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">9th. Because it appears on the face of the order of the 80th of November, 1870, appointing said commissioners, that parties interested in said two acres of land, and not the tenants of the freehold, had legal notice of said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">10th. Because the said commissioners did not take the oath prescribed by law before proceeding to ascertain a just compensation for said two acres of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">11th. Because the said two acres of land are wholly unfit for their said purposes, to wit: the erection of a courthouse and other buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">12th. Because the assessment of six hundred dollars as just compensation for said two acres of land is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">There is nothing in any of the said exceptions to* show, nor is it pretended, that thefparties on whom the-notice was served were not in actual possession of the land, and the only persons in such possession; in which, case they were, as we have seen, tenants of the freehold within the meaning of the law, on whom it was proper to serve the notice. Nor is there anything in the said exceptions to show, nor is it pretended, that the exceptants, or any of them, had any interest whatever in the land sought to be condemned; nor that any person who had any interest in, or title to the land, legal or equitable, was opposed to its condemnation or-to the confirmation of the said report. From what has already been said, it must therefore be manifest that' the said exceptants had no right to become parties to-the said proceedings and file the said exceptions; that the said county coutt had no jurisdiction to receive* and decide upon the said exceptions; and that the said court was right in overruling the motion of said ex-ceptants to be allowed to show cause against the said report, and refusing to allow said exceptions to be filed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>And this brings us to the consideration of the next question arising in the case, which is,</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">3H. Had the Circuit court of the county of Culpeper jurisdiction to award to the said exceptants a writ of error and supersedeas to the judgment of the county court of said county, for the condemnation of the said two acres of land for the use of said county, as aforesaid?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u201dWe are of opinion that the Circuit court had not such jurisdiction, and for two reasons: 1st, because the said exceptants were not parties to the said judgment nor to'the proceedings in which it was rendered; and, 2dly, because the nature and object of said proceeding, and the policy and provisions of law concerning it, forbid that a supersedeas should be awarded in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">1st. It is well settled that a person who is not a party to the proceeding in which the judgment of the court below complained of was rendered, cannot obtain a supersedeas to such judgment. The word \u201cperson,\u201d in the law giving the right to obtain an appeal, writ of error, or supersedeas, has been construed to mean \u201cparty;\u201d and the word \u201cparty\u201d is, itself, also used in that law: \u201cAny person who is a party to any case\u201d is a part of the language of that law. Acts of Assembly 1869-\u201970, p. 221, \u00a7 2; 1 Rob. Prac., old edition, pp. 656, 657; and the cases cited, especially <em>Sayre </em>v. <em>Grymes, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Mun. 404; and <em>Wingfield </em>v. <em>Crenshaw, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Mun. 245. <em>Holcomb </em>v. <em>Purcell, &amp;c., </em>decided by this court in 1802, and referred to in 1 Rob. Pr. <em>supra, </em>is, as that author truly says, a strong case upon this head. \u201cIn that case the court held that a principal obligor in a forthcoming bond, against whom the judgment in the original suit was rendered, but against whom no judgment was rendered on the forthcoming bond, was not entitled to appeal from a judgment against a surety in the forthcoming bond. Upon the face of the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>it must have appeared that the principal obligor was <em>collaterally </em>interested, since the surety would be entitled to recover of him the amount of the judgment wheneyer surety should discharge the same; but not being immediately a party to the judgment, the court dismissed the appeal.\u201d Id. p. 656. A person must n0^ on]y kg a <em>forty </em>to the proceeding in the court below, but he must also be <em>aggrieved </em>by the judgment rendered therein, to entitle him to obtain a supersedeas to such judgment: The two circumstances must concur. Id. p. 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Here the persons who obtained the supersedeas to the judgment of the county court were\u2019not parties to the proceeding in which that judgment was rendered. Hor would they have been proper parties, as has already been shown. \u25a0 They proposed to show cause against the confirmation of the report, and to file certain exceptions thereto for that purpose; but the court properly refused to permit them to do so.. They were not, therefore, parties to the judgment; nor were they aggrieved thereby. They had not such an interest in the object of the proceeding as entitled them to be parties. It was a mere enquiry, <em>ad quod </em>damnum,; a proceeding to ascertain the value of certain land in which they had no interest whatever. Any indirect interest they may have had in the subject as citizens, tax-payers, and landholders of the county, was not sufficient to make them proper parties. They did not become parties by merely <em>offering </em>to become so, when that offer was rejected. If they became parties to anything, it was merely to the order of rejection; and not to the order confirming the report. And their supersedeas, if they were entitled to any, would only be to the said order of rejection, and not to the said order of confirmation. But they were not entitled to a supersedeas to the former order, for they were not aggrieved thereby. The order of the County court, made after the rendition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the judgment, suspending it for thirty days to allow the exceptants to apply for an appeal and supersedeas, did not make them parties to the proceeding in the County court. To give it that effect would he to make the court do, indirectly, what it had just before expressly refused to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">2dly. The object of the proceeding was merely to asceitain the value of land required by public necessity. The immediate possession of the land was necessary for the public use; and the policy and provisions of the law require that the public should not he unnecessarily or improperly delayed or obstructed in taking or holding possession of the land. On this \u25a0subject enough has already been said; and what has been said need not be here repeated. If this hoard of supervisors have done any wrong; if they have been .guilty of any fraud, or abused their trust, or are doing, or about to do, anything to the injury of the county or \u25a0any of its citizens, persons thereby aggrieved must seek for any redress to which they may be entitled in \u2022some other form of proceeding than that which has been pursued by the defendants in this case. The law \u2022expressly declares, in regard to proceedings for the \u2022condemnation of land for the public use, that no order shall he made, nor any injunction awarded by any \u25a0court or judge to stay the proceedings of the company, county or town in the prosecution of their work, unless it he manifest that they, their officers, &amp;c., are transcending their authority, <em>and </em>that the interposition of the court is necessary to prevent injury that cannot he adequately compensated in damages. <em>Both </em>of these two things, we have seen, must concur, to render such \u2022an order or injunction proper; and we think that neither exists in this case. To allow a supersedeas in such a case, therefore, the effect of which might he to \u2022delay indefinitely the execution of a work of immediate public necessity, would be a direct violation of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>express mandate of the law. We therefore think the Circuit court had no jurisdiction to award the said \u2022 writ of supersedeas. And now we come to the next, enquiry, which is,</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">IV. Whether prohibition is the proper remedy in such a case as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">A prohibition is a proper remedy to restrain an inferior court from acting in a matter of which it has no jurisdiction, or from exceeding the bounds of its jurisdiction. A Circuit court cannot review a judgment of a County court except in the cases and in the mode prescribed by law. If a Circuit court, <em>ex mero motu, </em>undertake to review a judgment of a County court, it is an act of usurpation for which prohibition lies; so, if a Circuit court undertake to review such a judgment on the petition of one who is not a party to it, the same remedy lies. A writ of error or supersedeas cannot be awarded on the petition of an <em>amicus </em>curiae. <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>2 Call. 284. It can only be awarded on the petition of a party thereto who is aggrieved thereby, or his representative. We have seen that the writ of error and supersedeas complained of in this case was awarded on the petition of persons who were not parties to the judgment superseded, nor aggrieved thereby. It follows, therefore, that prohibition is the proper remedy in the case. That a writ of error or supersedeas would lie to a judgment of the Circuit court in the case, does not show that prohibition does not also lie. They may be concurrent remedies; but certainly the remedy by prohibition is the better one in such a case as this. It prevents the mischief' before it is done, and avoids the great evil (which the law has so carefully sought to prevent) of the delay and interruption of a necessary public work. And now we come to the last enquiry, which is,</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">V. Whether it is necessary for the plaintiff to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>declaration in this case, the respondents insisting upon their alleged right to have one filed?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">' It certainly seems to he settled, at least as a general rule, both in England and in this country, that a writ of prohibition will not be awarded without first requiring the plaintiff (if the defendant insist upon it) to file a declaration. 7 Comyn\u2019s Dig. Prohibition I; <em>Remington </em>v. <em>Dolby, </em>2 Q. B. 176, 58 Eng. C. L. R. 174, <em>178; Arnold </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>5 Dana\u2019s R. 18; <em>Mayo, mayor </em>v. <em>James, </em>12 Gratt. 17, 24. The reason for that rule, in its origin, is well stated thus in 3 Black. Com. p. 113 : \u201c Sometimes the point may be too nice and doubtful to be decided merely upon a motion: and then, for the more solemn determination of the question, the party applying for the prohibition is directed by the court to <em>declare </em>in prohibition; that is, to prosecute an action, by filing a declaration, against the other, upon a supposition or fiction (which is not traversable), that he has proceeded in the suit below, notwithstanding the writ of prohibition. And if, upon demurrer and argument, the court shall finally be of opinion that the matter suggested is a good and sufficient ground of prohibition in point of law, then judgment, with nominal damages, shall be given for the party coinplaining, and the defendant, and also the inferior court, shall be prohibited from proceeding any farther.\u201d The Code, p. 658, ch. 155, while it recognizes the propriety or necessity of a declaration in some cases, simplifies the form of it, and strips the subject of the fictions which were incident to it at common law. It is manifest that the main object of the rule requiring a declaration, is to put the very point in issue on record, so that the decision of the court upon it may, if necessary, be reviewed by an appellate court. That reason applies to cases of prohibition arising in an inferior court; where they all arose at common law, and, until recently, in this State. \"We mean, by inferior court, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>court lower than the highest appellate court. In England, the House of Lords is the highest appellate court, but it has no original jurisdiction in a case of prohibition. The courts at Westminster Hall have original jurisdiction in such a case, and an appeal lies from their decision to the House of Lords. But no appeal lies from a decision of this court to any other, even in a case decided by this court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction. There is not, therefore, the same reason or necessity for a declaration, in a case of prohibition in this court, as in such a case in an inferior court. We will not say that a declaration is never necessary or proper in a case of prohibition brought originally in this court. We only mean to say that there is not the same necessity or propriety for it in this as in other courts. It would certainly be not only unusual, but inconvenient, to have a case prosecuted here by declaration and other pleadings, and triable by the court on demurrer, and by a jury on issues of fact. And where there is no necessity for such a mode of proceeding, and no possible benefit to be derived from it, we think it may properly be dispensed with. How, here the facts on which we decide this case are undenied and undeniable: being in fact matters of record ; and no good purpose can possibly be attained by requiring a declaration. On the contrary, it would be attended with expense and trouble to the parties, and produce delay, which in such a case is a very great evil, only to be encountered when it is necessary, or for the purpose of avoiding a greater evil. A declaration in a case of prohibition is required by the statute to \u201c set forth, in a concise manner, so much only of the proceedings as may be necessary to shew the ground of the application.\u201d The petition fully does that, and more fully perhaps than would be required in a declaration. A declaration in this case, repeating the very words of the petition, would no doubt be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>held sufficient: It would be the vainest thing in the world, therefore, to require a declaration; and the most that could be proper would seem to be to order the petition to be treated as a declaration. But there is no necessity for that. The defendants, or such of them as have chosen to do so, have fully answered the petition; and the parties on both sides have been fully heard by counsel on the merits. Ve are of opinion, therefore, that the plaintiffs ought not to be required to file a declaration in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Upon the whole, we are of opinion that a writ of prohibition be awarded, according to the prayer of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The order of the court was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The court, for reasons stated in writing and filed with the record, is of opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">1st. That'the board of supervisors of the county of Culpeper have power, under the constitution and laws of the State, to acquire land in the town of Culpeper, for the erection thereon of a court-house, clerk\u2019s office, and jail, and to have the said land condemned for that purpose, in the mode prescribed by the Code, chapter 56, sections 6-16, pages 324-326.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">. 2d. That the County court of said county properly overruled the motion of the said Joseph B. G-orrell and others to be allowed to show cause against, and file exceptions to, the report of the commissioners appointed by the said court to ascertain a just compensation to the owners of the land proposed to be taken by the said board of supervisors for the purpose aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">3d. That the said Henry Shackelford, judge of the Circuit court of said county, had no authority to award to the other defendants a writ of error and supersedeas to the judgment of the County court of said county, condemning the said land for the purpose aforesaid; and the said Circuit court has no authority to entertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>jurisdiction of the said writ of error and supersedeas.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">4th. That prohibition is the proper remedy for the plaintiffs in such' a case as this; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">5th. That it is not necessary for them to file a declaration in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Therefore, it is adjudged and ordered that the said motion to discharge the said rule be overruled, and that a writ of prohibition be awarded, according to the prayer of the said petition, directed to the said defendants, <em>commanding </em>them to proceed no further upon the writ of error and supersedeas, awarded by the said Henry Shackelford, judge as aforesaid, in favor of the other defendants, to a judgment of the County court of said county, obtained on the 20th day of January, 1871, by the said board of supervisors, against Eliza T. C. Jameson and others, for the condemnation of two acres of land for the use of said county; and <em>superseding </em>the said writ of error and supersedeas, and all proceedings which have been had under the same. And it is further adjudged and ordered that the service of an office copy of this order upon the said defendants shall have the same force and effect as the execution upon them of a writ of prohibition, issued in pursuance hereof. And it is further adjudged and ordered that the plaintiffs recover against the defendants, except the said Henry Shackelford, judge as aforesaid, their costs by them expended in the prosecution of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Which is ordered to be certified to the said Circuit court of Culpeper county.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">Writ or prohibition awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
