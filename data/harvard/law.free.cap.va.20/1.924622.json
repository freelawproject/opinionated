In a suit for partition, the court has no authority to order a sale of the land, unless it is made to appear by an enquiry before a commissioner, or otherwise, that partition cannot be made in some of the modes provided by the 2d and 3d sections of ch. 128, of the Code. But when it did not so appear, and no such enquiry was asked in the court below, a party who promoted the suit and at whose instance the decree was made, will not be allowed to raise the objection for the first time in the appellate court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b33-15\">2. When the commissioner appointed by a decree in a partition suit to sell the land, becomes himself the purchaser, the purchase is voidable at the election of any party interested in the land sold. And the law is the same where the purchase is made nominally by a third person, who is reported by the commissioner to the court as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>the purchaser, but who really purchased for the commissioner and conveyed the land to him accordingly, after the purchase as reported had been confirmed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b34-9\">Where a party interested in the land, with a full knowledge of all the facts, elects to affirm the sale, he will be concluded by it, and in this case the acceptance, without objection, of his share of the proceeds of sale in Confederate money (for which the sale was made,), was held to he such an affirmation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b34-10\">4. Where any of the parties interested elect to avoid the sale, while it has been affirmed by other parties, the entire property, and not merely the undivided interest of the parties objecting to the sale, must be resold; and the original purchaser will be entitled to the shares of the proceeds of the resale, which would otherwise have belonged to those who have elected to affirm the original sale.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b34-11\">5. Where land is resold in cases of this sort, the usual and proper course is to offer the property at an upset price, to be fixed by the* decree, according to the cases of <em>Buckles v. Lafferty, </em>2 Rob. R. 292, and <em>Baily's adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Robinsons, </em>1 Gratt. 4. But this rule is intended for the protection of the parties who elect to avoid the first sale; and where the decree for resale directed a sale in general terms, without fixing an upset price, it cannot he assigned as error in the appellate court, either by the original purchaser, or by any party who has elected to affirm the first sale.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b34-13\">6. A bill was filed, during the late war, for a partition of real, estate among coparceners, some of whom were non-residents and so continued until after the war, and were proceeded against by publication. A decree for sale was made, and a sale made under it, at which M became nominally the purchaser. The commissioner reported to the court he had made the sale\u2014that M was the purchaser, and desired to pay all the purchase money down, without awaiting the terms of credit provided by the decree, and that he had, under a provision in the decree, accepted the purchase money from him accordingly. In fact, M was only nominally the purchaser, the commissioner himself being the real purchaser, to whom M conveyed the land as soon as the sale was confirmed. The sale was confirmed, and the shares of the non-resident parties were, by direction of the court, invested in their names in the bonds of Bloyd county, issued during the war. All this was done during the war. After the war the non-resident defendants, instead of appearing in the original suit, as provided by sect. 13, ch. 170, of the Code, filed their original bill, impeaching the original sale, and asking a resale. Held : They were entitled to file an original bill, because,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b34-15\">1. The commissioner, by purchasing at his own sale, did an act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>which a court of equity treats as a fraud upon the parties interested. And,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b35-3\"><em>9 </em>By reporting to the court that M was the purchaser, and concealing the fact that he was himself the real purchaser, he was guilty of an actual fraud upon the court and the nonresident parties; and thereby obtained from the court a confirmation of the sale, which might not otherwise have been decreed, and ought not to have been, if at all, without further enquiry.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b35-12\">Held, also, that the investments in the bonds of Floyd county were at the risk of the purchaser, and that the bonds should be surrendered to him as his property, the obligees being required, if desired, to assign them to him without recourse.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-13\">John <em>~W. </em>Helms, of the county of Floyd, died in August, 1862, intestate, leaving eleven children his heirs at law and distributees; and leaving a valuable tract of land and a number of slaves. His son-in-law, Fleming Howery, and his son, George M. Helms, qualified as his administrators..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-14\">In September, 1862, a bill was filed in the name of Fleming Howery and his wife, three of the sons, and the husbands of two daughters and their wives, against Hambleton Helms and four others of the children, all of whom lived out of the State, and wore proceeded against by publication, for the sale of the land and the slaves of which John <em>W. </em>Helms died possessed. In their bill the plaintiffs alleged that the land could not be divided among the eleven children without materially impairing the value of the separate interests.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-15\">At the February term, 1863, of the County court, \u00e1 \u25a0decree was made, by which Fleming Howery and George M. Helms were appointed commissioners to \u25a0sell the land and slaves\u2014the land upon a credit of one .and two years, and the slaves upon a credit of six months; or the commissioners might deduct the interest and receive the whole amount in cash if the purchasers desired it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-16\">Subsequently (but the record does not give the date) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Fleming Howery returned a report, in which he stated that on the 20th of March, 1863, he had made sale of land and slaves; and, among the other purchases,. pg rep0rted that the home tract of land, containing-four hundred and forty-seven acres, was sold to John W. Helms at $30 per acre, equal to $13,410; that he-had deducted the interest, as authorized by the decree;. and had received in cash, on this tract, $12,203 10.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-6\">He made a supplemental report, stating that proceedings had been instituted against him in Floyd circuit court, by Hambleton Helms\u2019 creditors, to get his share-of the proceeds of the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-7\">The cause afterwards coming on on the report, it was confirmed by the court and a conveyance to Helms, was ordered, and the commissioners were directed to collect the bonds given for the slaves, and after paying the expenses of sale and costs of suit, and their commissions, to pay over the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the land and slaves, one-eleventh thereof to each of the children of John H. Helms\u2014the commissioners to retain the share of Hambleton Helms until it is ascertained who is entitled to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-8\">In February, 1867, Hambleton Helms and the other-parties who had been proceeded against as absent defendants, in the suit above mentioned, as well as Holey Simmons and Malinda his wife (the latter a daughter of John M. Helms, deceased, who had been plaintiffs in the previous suit), instituted a suit in the Circuit-court of Floyd county against Fleming Howery and Eliza his wife, George M. Helms, John <em>~W. </em>Helms and. Tazewell Helms, and in their bill they charged thatHowery purchased the tract of four hundred and forty-seven acres at the sale made by himself, and reported to the court that the land was sold to John W. Helms; that this report was confirmed and a conveyance was. directed to be made to John \"W. Helms. They insist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>\u2022that this was a fraud, that the sale was void, and they \u2022ask that it may be set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-4\">The bill was dismissed as to Simmons and wife at their own instance, and they filed their answers as defendants, taking the same grounds as were taken in the bill; and they say that they have not received any money under the decree in the first suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-5\">Fleming Howery, George M. Helms and Tazewell Helms answered the bill. They objected to the juris\u2022diction of the court, on the ground that the previous cause was still pending in the County court, in which \u2022all the parties to this cause were parties. They said the land was purchased by John W. Helms and the sale reported to the court and confirmed, and Howery was -directed to pay the money to the parties, and also to \u2022convey the land to John \"W\". Helms. That he had collected the money and paid to John \u2018W. Helms, George M. Helms, and Tazewell Helms and his wife, their full \u2022distributive shares of said estate. That Howery, under the direction of the judge of the Circuit court of Floyd, \u25a0funded the shares of the non-resident defendants and \u2022of the home defendants who would not receive the money, in bonds of the county of Floyd, in their names \u2022respectively. That it is true Howery did bid for the land, but his bidding made it sell for much more than it otherwise would have done. They filed with their \u2022answer the deed from Howery to John W. Helms, \u25a0dated , 1863, but recorded September 29th, \u2022and also a deed from John <em>~W. </em>Helms to Howery, dated December 27th, 1863, and the Floyd county bonds, in which he had invested the shares of the estate of the parties who lived out of the State or refused to receive the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-7\">There was no doubt that Howery purchased the land \u25a0at the sale made by himself; and that it sold for a full price. The sale was, of course, during the war, and for Confederate money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>When the cause came on to be heard, the court made a decree, setting aside the sale, and the deeds from Howery to John W. Helms and Helms to Howery, and Howery was directed to convey the land to the heirs of John W. Helms. And after directing an account of rents, the court being of opinion that the said tract of land cannot be conveniently partitioned, decreed a sale thereof on terms mentioned in the decree, with directions to the commissioners to report to the court. From this decree Howery obtained an appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-10\"><em>The Attorney-General, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ\">insisted that a sale by a commissioner to himself would not be set aside as a mere matter of course, but that there must have been something unfair in the mode of conducting' the sale. <em>Custis </em>v. <em>Snead, </em>12 Gratt., 662; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>McMullin, </em>14 Id. 82; 2 John. Ch.

That a sale by a commissioner to himself was a fraud in law, for which the sale would be set aside. <em>Davoue </em>v. <em>Fanning, </em>2 John. Ch.

That it was no objection that the decree was for a resale out and out, and not at an outset price. That rule is for the benefit of the party who complains of the sale, and the appellee could not complain.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b33-16\">He had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-14\">Joynes J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXg\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-15\">The court is of opinion that it appears, from the-evidence in the cause, that the appellant, Fleming' Howery, was the real purchaser of the land in the' proceedings mentioned, at the sale made by him on the 20th day of March, 1863, as commissioner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>County court, under the decree of that court, rendered at February term, 1863, although John <em>W. </em>Helms was the nominal purchaser, and was by the said Howery reported to the said county court as the real purchaser, and that such purchase by the said Howery, at his own sale, was fraudulent in contemplation of law; and that any party interested was entitled to have the said sale set aside and annulled, as of course, without proof of actual fraud, according to the principles recognized by this court in the cases of <em>Buckles </em>v. Lafferty, 2 Rob. R. 292; and <em>Baily\u2019s adm\u2019x v. Robinsons, </em>1 Gratt., 4. And further, that the said Fleming Howery was guilty of a fraud upon the said County court, as well as upon the plaintiffs in this cause, in falsely reporting to the said County court that the said John <em>W. </em>Helms was the real purchaser; and in procuring from the said County court, by means of the said false representation, a confirmation of the said pretended sale to the said John <em>~W. </em>Helms.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The court is further of opinion that, by reason of the said illegal and fraudulent conduct of the said Fleming Howery, it was competent for the- plaintiffs in this cause to file their bill in the Circuit court, to have the said sale, and the deed from the said Fleming Howery, commissioner, to the said John \"W. Helms, and the deed from the said John <em>W. </em>Helms to the said Fleming Howery, set aside and annulled, without resorting to the said County court for relief; and the more especially, since the said plaintiffs were non-residents of this Commonwealth, and were ignorant of the said illegal and fraudulent conduct of the said Fleming Howery until after a final decree had been rendered in the said County court at September term, 1863.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The court is further of opinion, that it was competent for the said Circuit court to proceed in this cause to give the plaintiffs full relief, by a partition or sale of the land in the proceedings mentioned; and that, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>though, in a suit for the partition of land, it is the duty the court, before making a decree for a sale, to ascertain by an enquiry by a commissioner, or otherwise, ^at partition cannot be made in some of the modes provided by the second and third sections of chapter one hundred and twenty-four of the Code, without a sale; yet, inasmuch as no such enquiry was asked in the Circuit court, and the appellants did not suggest to the said court, in their answer or otherwise, that partition of the said land could be made without a sale, and as the appellants procured the decree for sale made in the County court, the appellants cannot raise the objection in this court that the propriety of a sale was not ascertained by the Circuit court, and insist upon it as a ground for reversing the decree of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The court is further of opinion that, although it is the usual and proper course in ordering a resale, in cases like the present, to direct the property to be offered at an upset price, that practice is adopted for the advantage of the parties interested in the property, and for whose benefit the resale is to be made, so that the said Fleming Howery cannot object to the decree of the Circuit court upon the ground that it contains no such direction. And as the appellants, George M. Helms, John <em>~W. </em>Helms, and Tazewell Helms, have received from said Fleming Howery their several shares of the proceeds of the sale made under the decree of the County court, and with a full knowledge of all the facts, insist that the said sale ought to stand and be confirmed, the court is of opinion that they must be taken to have ratified the said sale, and that the shares of the proceeds of the sale to be made under the decree of the Circuit court, which would otherwise have belonged to them, will belong to the said Fleming Howery; so that the said appellants cannot object to the decree of the Circuit court, because it does not direct the property to be offered at an upset price.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The court is further of opinion that, inasmuch as the sale of the land, and the title of the appellant, Fleming Howery, are set aside and annulled in consequence of the illegal and fraudulent conduct of said Fleming Howery, he has no right to throw upon the appellees any risk of loss from the investment in the bonds of Floyd county; and that all that he can properly ask is that said bonds shall be delivered to him as his own property, as directed by the said Circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The court is therefore of opinion that there is no error in the principles of the said decree of the said Circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">But the court is of opinion that the said Circuit court ought to have directed an enquiry to ascertain what is the interest of Hambleton Helms in the land in the proceedings mentioned, and that the said land should not be sold until after such enquiry had been made and the result thereof ascertained; and further, that the said Circuit court should not have directed the said Fleming Howery to convey the land in the proceedings mentioned to the heirs of John \"W. Helms, dec\u2019d, as such a conveyance is not necessary, and it would have the effect of vesting interests in the said land in the appellants, George M. Helms, John W. Helms, and Tazewell Helms, who are not entitled to any such interest; and that the said decree of the Circuit court ought to be corrected and amended in those particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Therefore, it is decreed and ordered that the said decree of the said Circuit court be amended in the particulars before mentioned, and that the said decree, as so amended, be affirmed; and that the appellants pay to the appellees their costs by them expended in this court, and thirty dollars damages; which is ordered to be certified to the said Circuit court of Floyd county.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Decree amended and affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
