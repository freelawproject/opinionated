Swartz, and held by Cullen. The bill charged that the note was usurious, having been discounted at six- &gt; teen <em>per cent, </em>per year; and without asking for a discovery from the defendants, prayed the court to direct an issue to be tried at its bar, whether or no the transaction was usurious.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-10\">Cullen answered the bill, denying that lie had knowledge of any usury in the note: he purchased it of Lancaster &amp; Co., brokers, without knowing for what purpose it was made, or to whom it belonged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-11\">An issue having been directed, on the first trial the jury was hung, and no verdict was rendered. On the second trial, after the evidence had been introduced, <em>9 * </em>the defendant moved the court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-14\">If the jury shall be satisfied, from the evidence, that the note on which this suit is brought was drawn and endorsed by the maker and endorser to raise money on a sale of it, and was placed by them in the hands of Lancaster &amp; Co., brokers, to be sold by them for that purpose; and Lancaster &amp; Co. sold it to the defendant at a discount of more than legal interest, but neither endorsed the note nor made themselves in any way responsible for its payment, nor at any time owned it, or any part of it; and that the defendant purchased it without notice of the purpose for which it was made, or of its character, more than the note and endorsement import, the jury must find for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-15\">The plaintiff thereupon moved the court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-16\">1. If, from the evidence, the jury shall believe that the plaintiff applied to Lancaster &amp; Co. for a loan of money, and at the suggestion of Lancaster &amp; Co. made the note in the house of Lancaster &amp; Co., which was then and there, with the knowledge of Lancaster &amp; Co., endorsed by Swartz for the accommodation of Gimmi, and delivered to Lancaster &amp; Co., who there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>upon paid him for the said note the sum of $5,894 17 out of their own money, and the deed of trust to secure it was prepared in their office; and at the time Lancaster &amp; Co. had no authority to purchase the note for Cullen, and no money of Cullen in their hands, then the transaction is usurious; and the subsequent sale of the note hy Lancaster &amp; Co. to Cullen did not purge it of that taint; and the jury must find for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-4\">The court gave the instruction asked for by the defendant, and refused to give that asked for by the plaintiff'.

And if the jury are satisfied, from the evidence, that Lancaster &amp; Co., without any authority from Cullen to purchase the note for him, paid for the note with their own money and received it from the maker, they thereby became the purchasers of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-8\">The plaintiff excepted to the opinion of the court giving the instruction asked for by the defendant, and refusing to give the first instruction asked for by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-9\">The bill of exception sets out the substance of all the evidence given on the trial; for which see the next bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-10\">The jury found a verdict that the note was not usurious. And thereupon the plaintiff moved the court to set aside the verdict as contrary to the law and the evidence. But the court overruled the motion, and the plaintiff excepted. The bill of exception states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>that upon the motion of the plaintiff the court certifies-the following as the evidence, there being no testimony - offered by the defendant. E. A. Lancaster, a member of the firm of Lancaster &amp; Co., deposed as follows: and then proceeds to give his evidence in detail. In substance it is as follows: The note in question was-sold by me to Cullen on the 1st of May. Gimmi and Swartz were in the room at our hanking house when the note was executed. Gimmi told me he wanted to-raise money in several previous conversations. Swartz said Gimmi owed him money, and had property. T told him I could raise the money. Gimmi\u2019s note was larger than the note due to Swartz; that, Swartz said, was for $2,000 in gold, for which he had a deed of' trust. The note was drawn in our office in the presence of Gimmi and Swartz at my suggestion. It was difficult, at the time, to make negotiations for money. The rate of discount on the note was one and a quarter yer <em>cent, </em>per month, then very moderate. Our commissions were to come off the amount. To secure the note Gimmi executed a deed of trust on real estate. (The deed is set out. This deed is dated April 30th, 1866. On that day there was placed to the credit of Gimmi, on Gimmi\u2019s pass hook, $5,894 17; and on the 1st of May, there was entered on their ledger to his credit $5,926 67; and Gimmi checked for the money as he needed it.) Thinks Dr. Cullen was not in. the city when the note was executed. Lid not tell him anything about the origin of the paper, or the purpose-for which it was made; because if I had done so he-, would not have purchased it. We never inform a purchaser of the origin of the paper we offer for sale. He-did not know the origin of the transaction or the character of the note, or to whom it belonged. I explained to him the security on which it rested. Lr. Cullen kept an account at our house, hut never authorized me to buy paper for him. I never bought any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>paper for him without first submitting it to him. At this time Dr. Cullen had no money on deposit with us, but he had bills receivable deposited with us for collection, which were paid, and by which we were reimbursed the money which we advanced to Gimmi. When the transaction was closed he gave us his check for the amount of the sale of the note and sixteen days interest. When I first offered the note to Dr. Cullen, on the 1st of May, he objected to taldng it, saying that he had no money, and his account with us was in fact overdrawn. I told him that would make no difference, that it was a good note, and we would advance the money for him; and he agreed to do so, subject to the right, on his part, to look into the title to the property which had been conveyed to secure the note, and to decline the purchase if he was not satisfied with it. He did look into the title, was satisfied with it, took the note, and on the 16th of May we closed the transaction, charging him with the amount which had been advanced to Gimmi and sixteen days interest upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-3\">The money advanced to Gimmi, as I have before stated, was our own money, but it was advanced for Dr. Cullen, as I have before stated, to enable him to purchase the note, not to purchase it for myself or for my house, and I never considered myself as the owner of it, or any part of it, at any time, and never intended to make myself responsible for its payment. Yet, if Dr. Cullen had found that my representation of the security was not correct, and had refused to take the note, as he had a right to do, I should have been obliged to look to Gimmi for the repayment of the money I had advanced to him, as I have before stated. That is one of the risks of my business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-4\">The defendant Cullen was examined as a witness on a former trial, and not being introduced on this trial,, the plaintiff introduced several jurors who served upon the former trial, who testified that, upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>former trial, when Cullen was .examined on his own behalf, he deposed that he did not purchase the said note until after he had examined the title to the property, and the property itself, and then paid for it by his check on Lancaster &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-10\">On the 11th of March, 1869, the cause came on to be heard, upon the verdict of the jury and the motion by the plaintiff, for a new trial of the issue, when the court overruled the motion, dissolved the injunction, and dismissed the bill. And Gimmi thereupon applied to this court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-11\"><em>Lyons, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acq\">insisted\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-12\">1. That the. evidence shewed that Lancaster took the note from Gimmi, and paid him the money for it; and that the sale by Lancaster to Cullen was subsequent to this payment by Lancaster to Gimmi. And as the purchase was admitted to be at more than legal interest, it was clearly usurious. And the note being usurious in its inception, it is null and void in the hands of every subsequent holder. The first instruction asked for by the plaintiff should, therefore, have been given. <em>Wilkie </em>v. <em>Roosevelt, </em>3 John. Cas. 206; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hake, </em>2 Id. 60; <em>Bennet </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>15 John.

If the parties whose names are on a note made to raise money, and discounted at a higher rate than legal interest, could not sue upon it if it had not been discounted, it is usurious and void. <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>17 John. R. 176; 8 Cow. R. 669. And a bill or note drawn for the purpose of being discounted at usurious interest, and endorsed for the accommodation of the maker, is void. <em>Munn </em>v. <em>The Commission Co., </em>15 John. R. 44; <em>Pennet </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>15 Id. 355.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-14\">3d. A note has no legal inception until its delivery, as evidence of an existing debt; and if negotiated at a usurious discount by the maker, it is void in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>hands of the purchaser. <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>McCullum, </em>20 John. R. 288; <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>1 Hill N. Y. R. 563; <em>Asly </em>v. <em>Rapeleye, </em>Id. 9; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>5 Duer.

And one who acts as agent in procuring a usurious loan upon a note, cannot recover upon it as endorser. Re<em>ed </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Cow. R. 647.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-4\">4. A note made to raise money, and sold at a higher rate of interest than is lawful, if nohe of the parties to it could sue upon it, as between themselves, it is void in the hands of a party who had purchased it at less than the legal rate of interest. <em>Knights </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>3 Pick. R. 184; <em>Cockey </em>v. <em>Forest, </em>1 Gill &amp; John. R. 482; <em>Ruffin </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>2 Hawks. R. 411; 2 Parsons on Bills and Notes, 426, 427 and notes V. <em>W. </em>&amp; X.; Edwards on Bills and Notes, 352. So, if a note is purchased with knowledge, from an agent of the maker, at a usurious discount, it is void; and, <em>a fortiori, </em>if it is purchased by his own agent. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Bruce, </em>Gilm. 42; <em>Whitworth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>5 Rand. 333. And where a usurious loan is made, and promissory notes are pledged as security, no action can be maintained by the lender against the borrower. <em>Bell &amp; Harvey </em>v. <em>Lent, </em>24 Wend.

The court, in effect, gave the instructions asked by the plaintiff, Gimmi, who has therefore no right to complain on that score.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-11\">Cullen was the party entitled to complain, for there was no evidence that the note was purchased by Lancaster, but evidence exactly to the contrary; and the instruction was calculated to mislead. And so was the instruction that \u201cif Lancaster &amp; Co. paid for the note with their own money, and received it from the maker, they thereby became the purchasers of it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-12\">The proof is, that they did not pay for it with their own money; that they acted as Gimmi\u2019s agents in sell-ins: the note, and that he paid them for it a commission of $70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-13\">The proof is, that they advanced the money, and that Cullen bought the note, and paid interest on the advance. If they fix the date of the purchase on the 1st of May, and Cullen on the 16th, it is because he did not regard it consummated until he examined into the security, and he did not complete the examination till the 16th. It was inchoate on the 1st, and when he found the security good, on examination, the purchase related back to that day. Accordingly, he paid interest for the 16 days.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-14\">In accounting for the price to Gimmi, they took the risk of Cullen\u2019s accepting the security. They were convinced it was good, and there was no risk, and they found their account in the commission they got from Gimmi on the transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-15\">It is said Lancaster &amp; Co. had no authority to purchase for Cullen. It was not necessary for them to have authority from Cullen to purchase for him. He was acting for himself, and agreed conditionally, on the 1st of May, to buy. Though he had no money, their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u2022advancing on bis account, subject to bis refusal of tbe security, and therefore of tbe obligation to return tbe advance, was not paying their own money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-4\">To commit usury, parties must intend to do tbe acts constituting it. Lancaster &amp; Co. did not intend to pay their own money to get tbe title to tbe note in themselves, nor did Gimmi intend they should get it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-5\">They and be intended a brokerage on tbe part of Lancaster; and if Cullen bad rejected tbe security, tbe note would have resulted to Gimmi, and Lancaster been left to sell it to some one else, who thought better than Cullen did of tbe security, and thus reimburse himself for tbe money be bad accounted for to Gimmi.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-6\">Third. Tbe motion for tbe new trial was properly refused. Hot only was there not tbe conclusive evidence required to establish usury; <em>Brockenbrough </em>v. Spindle, 17 Gratt. 21, 33; there was not enough to beget a well-grounded suspicion of it! S. C. 45. But 'the court cannot review tbe ruling, for tbe facts are not certified.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b479-7\">Joynes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2g\">Tbe court did not err in giving tbe instruction moved by tbe defendant. It was in accordance with the doctrine of a majority of tbe whole court, in <em>Whitworth </em>v. Adams, 5 Rand. 333; following <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Bruce, </em>Gilmer 42; and recognized as the settled law of the State, in <em>Brummel &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Enders, Sutton &amp; Co., </em>18 Gratt. 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Tbe instruction moved by tbe plaintiff was predicated upon tbe supposition that Lancaster &amp; Co. did not sell tbe note to tbe defendant as tbe agents of the maker and endorser, or either of them, as supposed in tbe instruction moved by tbe defendant; but that they bad themselves become tbe purchasers of it, and after-wards, while they held it as them own property, sold it to tbe defendant. This instruction did not submit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>the jury the general question whether the note had heen purchased by Lancaster &amp; Co., and sold by them,</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">\u2022 as their own property, to the defendant. It set forth various supposed facts, and implied, without saying so, that if these supposed facts were true, Lancaster &amp; Co. had purchased the note, and sold it to the defendant as their own property; which would have made a case of usury. The court, upon refusing to give this instruction, gave another, of its own motion, which, without any recital of special circumstances, submitted to the jury, in general terms, the question, whether the note was purchased by Lancaster &amp; Co.; and instructed them that, if it was, it was a case of usury. The court evidently designed to embody, in this instruction, the same proposition as that embodied in the prayer of the plaintiff. It doubtless thought that the form in which the latter was expressed was calculated to confuse the jury. If the instruction thus given fell short, in its scope and effect,'of the instruction moved by the plaintiff, the difference was fully made up by the instruction subsequently given on the motion of the plaintiff. The plaintiff, therefore, has no right to complain; he obtained from the court substantially the same instruction he asked for, and in a simpler and more intelligible form. The instruction moved by the plaintiff was liable, however, to a more serious objection. It did not present to the mind of the jury the distinct question, whether Lancaster &amp; Co. had become the purchasers and owners of the note, upon their own account. A lawyer would readily understand, upon reading the instruction, that that was the question involved; but a plain man, without legal knowledge, would hardly discover it without explanation. Moreover, it assumes that Lancaster &amp; Co., at the time the note was delivered to them by Gimmi, \u201cpaid him for the said note the sum of $5,894 1Y, out of their own money,\u201d having then no money of Cullen in their hands, and no autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>rity from him to purchase a note for him, and says that, if that was so, the transaction was usurious. This could not be true unless the $5,894 17 was paid as the <em>price </em>of the note; unless the transaction was a sale of the note hy Gimmi, and a purchase of it hy Lancaster &amp; Co. If it was paid <em>for </em>the note, in the sense of an <em>advance </em>of money upon it, in the expectation of making a sale of it, the note being still the property of Gimmi, then the proposition of the instruction would not he true. And in this view, the fact that the money was paid out of Lancaster &amp; Co.\u2019s own funds was wholly unimportant. And that fact was unimportant in any view, unless it was paid, on their own account, on a purchase of the note for their own benefit. They might advance it for Dr. Cullen, as a loan to enable him to make the purchase, as Lancaster says was the fact. The fact is, that while only $5,894 17 was put to the credit of Gimmi on the hooks of Lancaster &amp; Co. on the 30th April, 1866, the day the note was delivered hy him to them, the sum was increased, on the 1st day of May, 1866, the day on which the sale was made to Cullen, conditionally, to $5,926 67, on the nett proceeds of the note. The instruction withholds any consideration of this fact from the jury, and makes the transaction turn upon the payment of the $5,894 17, upon the delivery of the note. \"Without pursuing this subject any further, I think that this instruction was calculated to confuse and mislead the jury, and ought, for that reason, to have been refused. It would have been no error to refuse it, without substituting any other in its place.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The hill of exceptions in relation to the instructions given and refused discloses, therefore, no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In considering the hill of exceptions to the refusal of the court to award a new trial of the issue, the question arises, whether it is to he regarded as containing a certificate of the evidence given on the trial, or a cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>tifieate of the facts proved on the trial, in the opinion of the Circuit court. The counsel for the plaintiff contended, that notwithstanding it does not, in terms, profess to certify the facts proved, yet as the evidence stated was all introduced hy the plaintiff, and there was no intimation that any part of it was not credible, it should all be taken to be true; so that the certificate should be regarded as substantially a certificate of the facts. The language of the bill of exceptions, however, indicates that the intention of the court was to certify the evidence, and not the facts. It says, \u201cthe court certifies the following as the <em>evidence in the cause.\u201d </em>\u201c Robert A. Lancaster [the only witness as to the transaction in controversy,] <em>deposed </em>as follows.,\u201d It says that the other witnesses also introduced by the plaintiff \u201c <em>testified,\u201d </em>&amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Since the distinction between a certificate of evidence and a certificate of facts proved, has been so fully established and so well understood, it can hardly be supposed that the judge or the counsel, both of long experience and eminent learning and ability, would employ such language, when the intention was to have a certificate of the facts proved. The use of such words in the bill mil not be decisive of the character of the certificate, if it appears from the use of other words, or from the general scope of the certificate, that the object of the court was to certify the facts and not the evidence merely. <em>Jackson\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>3 Leigh 212. But in this case there is no statement, as in <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>for instance, that \u201cthese were all the facts proved,\u201d nor any other expression to impair the force of the other words, and throw doubt upon the character of the certificate. And we shall see from the cases which will be cited, that the facts that the evidence was all introduced by one side, and that it was not contradicted, are not sufficient to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>mine that the certificate was designed as a certificate of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Regarding the certificate as intended to be a certificate of the evidence given on the trial of the issue, the next question is, was it well taken to authorize this court to review the judgment overruling the motion for a new trial in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In <em>Bennett </em>v. Hardaway, 6 Munf. 125, a motion had been made for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the evidence, and the motion being overruled, a bill of exceptions was taken, which certified all the evidence given to the jury, instead of the facts which appeared to the court of trial to he established by the evidence. This court held that the bill of exceptions was not well taken, and that it could not reverse a judgment refusing a new trial, except upon a certificate of the facts proved. The ground of the decision was, that some of the witnesses may have been discredited in the court below, and that this court might form its opinion upon testimony which was there discredited. Judge Roane, delivering the opin-. ion of the court, said: \u201cIt does not follow that a judge believes every witness who gives evidence before him, as he may well hesitate to do from the manner of testifying and other extraneous circumstances; nor <em>can </em>he do it where they conflict with one another. It is evident, therefore, that in this case the opinion of this court might be founded upon the testimony of witnesses who were discredited both by the jury and the court below. This court only sees\u2019the evidence on the. record, and on paper the credit of every witness is the same, who is not positively impeached.\u201d . This case has never been overruled or questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Subsequent cases, however, have established a modiRcation of the doctrine of <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>but entirely consistent with it in principle, which has long-been the settled rule of this court. This rule is, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>a bill of exceptions to the refusal to grant a new trial, may be dealt with by rejecting all the evidence on the - part of the exceptor, and considering the case upon the evidence of the other party alone. In the application of this rule, the evidence of the party who prevailed below, is to be taken as true. If, testing the case upon this rule, the judgment cannot be sustained,, it will be set aside. <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>2 Leigh 337; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ashby, </em>6 Leigh 135; <em>Rohr </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>9 Leigh 30; <em>Vaiden\u2019s Case, </em>12 Gratt. 717; <em>Butts\u2019 Case, </em>14 Gratt. 613; and many other cases. It is obvious that this-rule does not encounter the difficulty which led to the decision in <em>Bennett v. Hardaway. </em>Ho question of the-credit of the witnesses can arise. The exceptor gives-, up his own evidence, bringing it to the same thing as-if he had not introduced a witness: and he admits the-truth of the evidence adduced by the other side. So, in every case where a new trial is asked fi-onr an appellate court, upon a certificate of the evidence only, the party who asks it must give up his own evidence, if any, and admit the truth of his adversary\u2019s evidence, if any. Otherwise, he must encounter the difficulty upon which the decision in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway </em>proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">The same principles apply, though all the evidenceivas adduced by one side. <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>1 Leigh 340, and <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ashby, </em>6 Leigh 135, were-cases of that sort. In the former case, Bennett, as assignee, brought an action on a bond against Carrington, to which the defence was that the bond was given for money won at unlawful gaming. The plaintiff\" proved the bond and the assignment, and this was his only evidence. The defendant introduced a witness-to sustain his defence, and the jury found for the plaintiff. ' A motion was made for a new trial and overruled. There was a question in this court, whether the bill of exceptions should be construed as\u00a1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u2022a certificate of the evidence only, or as a certificate of \u25a0the facts proved. Judge Carr regarded it as a certificate of evidence only; Judges Green and Coalter considered it as a certificate of facts. Judge Carr field, that -this court could not review tire judgment upon this certificate, upon the ground that the court and jury might have discredited Carrington\u2019s witness. He said: \u201cBut how do we know that the court and jury believed this witness ? They may have discredited his whole tale. They saw and heard him, and there may have been that in his manner (though wholly hidden from us) which proved to them that he was wholly unworthy of credit.\u201d * * * \u201cAnd if, upon the strength of what this witness swore, we reverse the .judgment and set aside the verdict, may not our opinion (in the words of Judge Boane) be founded upon testimony discredited by the jury and court below ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">It will be observed that, in the view of the bill of \u00abexceptions taken by Judge Carr, <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett </em>was precisely like the case before us. All the evidence upon the issue had been introduced by the exceptor, and there was no intimation in the record as to whether the court did or did not give credit to- it. \u201cThere was no inconsistency in the evidence; the ex-\u2022ceptor was asking the court, as in the present case, to assume that the evidence of his witness was entitled to credit: being the only evidence in the cause and not impeached; and to hold that the court and jury had \u00abdrawn the wrong conclusion from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\"><em>Green </em>v. <em>Ashby </em>was a converse case. The bill of exceptions to the refusal of the court to grant a new trial, certified the evidence given to the jury, the whole of which was introduced by the plaintiff, in whose favor the verdict was rendered. The court held that the bill \u2022of exceptions was well taken, and being of opinion that, giving full credit and weight to the evidence of \u00a1the plaintiff, the judgment was erroneous, it was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>versed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded. President Tucker, after adverting to the general rules in reference to bills-of exceptions or motions for new trial, said: \u201c From this view, we may deduce the rule that no bill of exceptions is properly taken, wbicli submits to this court conflicting evidence, upon tbe credit of which we must decide, before we can pronounce upon the judgment of the inferior court. And, for a like reason, though the evidence be all on one side; yet, if that which is introduced, is adduced by the excepting party, the bill of' exceptions is not properly framed, if it recites the evidence which was given, instead of setting forth the-facts: for, peradventure, the court and jury may have-discredited the witnesses; and, if so, this court coulct not interfere. This was the case in <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett, m. </em>the opinion of one of the judges. There was-no conflicting evidence upon the real matter of litigation between the parties. All the evidence to that point was on the side of the exceptor; and as the-court and jury both decided against him, the court could not, upon its own principles, have overruled their opinion upon the weight of the evidence, unless-the facts as proved were duly stated. In this the whole-court very obviously concurred; though the majority were of opinion, that the question of the truth of the-evidence was not submitted; but that the facts were properly certified.\u201d Judge Cabell thought the bill of' exceptions well taken, because there was no conflict in the evidence, which was all on one side, and \u201c <em>against </em>the party tendering the exception.\u201d From this it is-plainly to be inferred that he concurred in the opinion with Carr, J., and Tucker, P., as to a case in which all the evidence was introduced by the excepting party.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">The rule, therefore, is, that where all the evidence is introduced by one party, and the verdict is in his favor, the other party may have a refusal to grant a new trial reviewed, upon a bill of. exceptions certifying the evi-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>dence only. In such a case, the evidence certified will be considered as true by the appellate court, unless impeached in some way. But, when the verdict is against - the party who introduced the evidence, he cannot have the refusal of the court to grant a new trial reviewed upon a certificate of the evidence merely: he must have a certificate of the facts proved, or a certificate that the evidence was considered true by the court of trial; which would amount to a certificate that the facts stated in the evidence were really facts proved. From the evidence certified in the former case, and from the facts certified in the latter, the appellate court will draw such inference as a jury might reasonably draw.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The bill of exceptions to the refusal of the court to grant a new trial was, therefore, not well taken, and we cannot review the action of the Circuit court on that point. It is hardly necessary to say, that in the objection made to the bill of exceptions, I do not intimate any personal distrust of the truth of Mr. Lancaster\u2019s testimony, nor any belief that it was discredited by the jury or the court below. But the law is no respecter of persons, and its rules apply to all men alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The result would not have been different, however, if the facts proved had been certified, or if the evidence had been certified to be true. The fair result of the evidence certified, assuming that the witness was entitled to credit, is, that Gimmi delivered the note to Lancaster &amp; Co., on the 30th day of April, to be sold by them as his agents and for his benefit; they knowing that the note was without consideration, and made to raise money; that Lancaster &amp; Co. received the note as Gimmi\u2019s agents, and thereupon, on the sam\u00e9 clay, paid him the sum of $5,894 17, as an advance on the note, iii\\taticipation of a sale of it to be made by them for him'; as his agents; that, on the 1st day of May, they, as agents for Gimmi, made a conditional sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the note to Dr. Cullen, at a discount of one and a quarter <em>per cent, </em>a month; the condition being that Cullen should have a right to look into the title to the property which had been conveyed to secure the payment of the note, and to decline the purchase if not satisfied with it; that on the same day (May 1st), Lancaster &amp; Co. increased the sum paid to Gimmi to $5,926 67, that being the net proceeds of the note; that Lancaster &amp; Co. paid for the note with their own money, because, when they offered it to Cullen, on the 1st day of May, he told them that he had no money, and objected to taking it on that ground; that they, knowing that Cullen had notes coming to maturity at an early day, told him they would advance the money for him, and did so accordingly; that Cullen looked into the title, was satisfied with it, took the note, and on the 16th day of May the transaction was closed by Cullen paying to Lancaster &amp; Co. the $5,926 67 paid by them to Gimmi on the 1st day of May, as the net proceeds of the note, and also sixteen days\u2019 interest on that sum; that Lancaster &amp; Co. had no authority to buy paper for Cullen; that Lancaster &amp; Co. were never the owners of the note; and that Cullen did not know, either on the 1st day of May, or on the 16th, for whom the note was sold, what was the origin or the consideration of it, or the purpose for which it was made: In all this .it is evident that there was no usury, according to the law, as settled in Virginia by the ease of <em>Whitworth </em>v. <em>Adams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">I am of opinion, therefore, to affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
