In an action on the case for damages to plaintiff\u2019s land, there is the plea of not guilty, on which issue is joined\u2019, and there is a special plea, to which there is a special replication concluding to the country. To this there is no rejoinder, and the record does not say that issue was joined upon it; but the parties go to trial, and the subjects of the special plea and replication are contested before the jury, which renders a verdict for the plaintiff. No objection having been taken to the want of joinder of issue in the court below, it seems that the objection cannot be taken in the Appellate court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b376-17\">2. In such a case if the subject of the replication is such that the defendant cannot rejoin special matter without a departure from the defence set up in his plea, but must take issue upon the replication, the nonjoinder of issue will be cured by the statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A3B\">3. Two actions on the case are brought in the same court at the same time, by the same plaintiff against the same defendant. The same act of defendant is charged as the cause of the damage in each case; but the damage in one case is charged to be to the plaintiff\u2019s land, and in the other to the crops grown and growing upon it. The case as to the crops is the first tried, and the evidence is as to the crops, and there is a verdict and judgment for the defendant. This verdict and judgment cannot be set up as an estoppel to the plaintiffs in the other action for damages to the land.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b376-19\">4. A railroad company has the land of R. condemned for its road, and the commissioners assess the damages, and their report is confirmed, and the company pay the amount of the damages assessed to R.

In such cases the assessment of damages is only a bar to an action for such injuries as could properly have been included in such assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ment. The commissioners are bound to presume the company 17111 construct its works in a proper manner, and they have no right to award damages upon the supposition that the company will negligently and improperly perform its work. A failure to do so by the company will, therefore, impose a liability to any one who may sustain any loss or injury by reason of such negligence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-4\">Ill February, 1857, George <em>~W. </em>Daniel instituted an action on the case in the Circuit court of Prince Edward county, against the Southside Railroad Co., for damages done to the plaintiff\u2019s land. In his declaration, he charged, that he was the owner of a tract of land of eight hundred and fifteen acres, bordering upon the Appomattox river; through a portion of which land two water courses flow, known as Big and Little Buffalo, and uniting in the plaintiff\u2019s flat lands; and Big Buffalo, known as Buffalo river after the junction of the two streams, falls into the Appomattox river, on the lands of the plaintiff; about five hundred acres of which lands are Appomattox and Buffalo low lands. Buffalo river, after it receives Little Buffalo, flows through a narrow pass or flat, about two hundred feet in width, formed by a rock or bluff on the west bank of Buffalo river and the hill lands on the east, leaving, naturally, that space for the escape of the flood waters of Buffalo river; and, in addition to which space, there was a sink or low place in the midst of the plaintiff\u2019s low lands west of Buffalo river, over which pass of about two hundred feet at Buffalo river, and the sink or low place the flood waters of Buffalo were accustomed to flow and escape without destruction. And he charges that the defendant made an embankment and other structures running on, to and across the Buffalo river, at the said pass of about two hundred feet, without leaving sufficient arches or water ways to allow the waters of the Buffalo river to escape over the said pass and the sink in the midst of the plaintiff\u2019s low lands, as they had been accustomed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>whereby the said sink or low place on the plaintiff\u2019s. lands was wholly obstructed, and whereby, in the month of August, in the year 1856, the flood water was. accumulated and penned back upon the low lands of the plaintiff, above and south of the said embankments and other structures, until they broke and washed down a portion of said embankment at Buffalo river at the said pass, permanently obstructing the said pass, to the sobbing and rendering permanently unfit for cultivation, a large portion of the plaintiff\u2019s low lands south of said embankment and other structures, of great value, viz: to the value of $9,500, and whereby the lands north of and below said embankments were greatly washed, abraided and injured; to the damage of the plaintiff $10,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-8\">At the March term of the court for 1858, the defendant appeared and pleaded \u201c not guiltyon which issue was joined. The defendant also pleaded specially \u2014That the defendant was a company incorporated by the General Assembly of Virginia, for a work of internal improvement: that before the embankment and other structures mentioned in the declaration were constructed, commissioners, appointed by the County court of Prince Edward, ascertained and reported to-the County court, that $1,362 was a just compensation to the tenant of the freehold of the lands in the declaration mentioned, for the portion of the lands proposed to be taken by the defendant for its purposes, and for the damage to the residue of the said lands beyond the peculiar benefits to be derived in respect of such residue, for works to be constructed by the defendant. That the defendant paid the amount of $1,362 to the tenant of the freehold; and that the County court of Prince Edward confirmed the report and ordered it to be <em>recorded; </em>and that afterwards the defendant constructed the said embankment and other structures in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the declaration mentioned; and this the defendant is ready to verify.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-4\">To this second plea the plaintiff replied, that the embankment and other structures were so improperly and negligently constructed by the defendant, that by reason thereof the lands of the plaintiff had been greatly damaged; and that the said damages were not estimated or ascertained by the commissioners in their assessment and report in the plea mentioned, and this he prays may be enquired of by the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\">There was no issue made up upon the special plea; the entry on the order book, after stating the issue on the plea of not guilty, is: and the defendants filed their special plea in writing, to which the plaintiff filed his replication in writing; and it is ordered that this suit be continued until the next term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-6\">The cause came on to be tried at the August term, 1859, of the court, when the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages at one thousand dollars. The record says the jury were sworn to try the issue joined; and the verdict is upon the issues. The defendant thereupon moved the court for a new trial; but the court overruled the motion, and rendered a judgment upon the verdict; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-7\">The judge certifies a great many facts; but upon other important points he certifies that the evidence was so conflicting that he could not certify the fact in relation to them. It appears that at the time damages were assessed by the commissioners, the land was in the possession of the executor of Judith Randolph, and it was shortly afterwards sold to the plaintiff. In the conclusion of the bill of exceptions, he says: \u201c On many points arising during the protracted trial of this case, a number of witnesses were examined, whose testimony was so conflicting that it is with great difficulty that the court can certify any facts as distinctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>and clearly proved, except sncli as were contained in <em>* * </em>papers exhibited.\u201d And \u201cthat the jury were sent to view the lands of the plaintiff, and the works of the defendant thereon, and the court cannot tell what effect such view had upon their minds, except so far as the , \u201e . _ . . . ' result of said view may appear m the verdict rendered by them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-11\">Among the papers introduced in evidence by the defendant, and set out in the bill of exception, is the copy of the record of another suit brought by the same plaintiff against the same defendant. This was an action on the case, brought at the same time in the same court, for injury to the plaintiff\u2019s crops. The declaration sets out the description of the plaintiff\u2019s land, and the obstructions of the defendant, and also the causes of the damage sustained, in the same terms as are employed to set them out in the principal case; and refers to the same flood of August, 1856, as the cause of the damage complained of; but charges that the flood waters became accumulated and penned back upon the lands of the plaintiff above and south of said embankment and other structures, to the utter destruction and loss of the crops of the plaintiff then and there grown and growing upon that part of the plaintiff\u2019s low lands, and on the low lands north of said embankment and other structures, of great value, viz : and then sets out the different kinds of crops, with tlieir value, to the damage of the plaintiff of ten thousand .dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-12\">The special pleas and the replication are the same in both eases; and there is no issue on the replication ; but the entry on the order books is the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-13\">In August, 1858, the cause was tried, when the jury found that the defendants are not guilty in the manner and form as the plaintiff against the said company hath complained. And thereupon the plaintiff moved the court for a new trial; which motion was overruled; and a judgment rendered for the defendant: And the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>plaintiff excepted.' The facts certified in the bill of exception, show that the enquiry in this cause was as to the injury to the crops growing on the land, whilst \u2022 in the principal case they indicate that the enquiry was as to the injury to the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\">Upon the application of the Southside Railroad Co., a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-5\"><em>J. Alfred Jones, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-6\">The first point made in the petition is sound, viz: that the verdict and judgment in the former action were a bar to the recovery in the present action. Although there was, on some points, conflict of evidence, and the facts in respect thereto are not certified, there was none on the point that the land referred to, and the works complained of, are the same in each action. This is not disputed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-7\">The issue was the same in each action, and the verdict and judgment in the former, which were for the defendant, Avere conclusive in the latter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-8\">The answer made to this, in the argument of the appellee, that the jury might have found the appellee was not damaged by the appellant\u2019s works, because there was eA\u00dadence tending to show that the freshet, which was so extraordinary, Avould have destroyed the crops, even had those works not been erected, is not sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-9\">It proceeds upon a misconception of the finding of the jury. That finding is not that there were no damages to the crops from those works. The finding is, that \u201c the defendants are <em>not guilty, </em>in manner and form, as the plaintiff against said company hath complained.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-10\">This verdict settled not merely the <em>question of damages. </em>It went deeper: It settled the question of <em>wrongful act. </em>It Avas a response to the plea of not guilty, which \u201c operates as a denial of the <em>breach of duty, </em>or <em>wrongful act, </em>alleged to have been committed by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>fend\u00e1nt.\u201d Stephens on Pleading, marg. 160, top 158, e\u2019di. 1837. If the <em>act </em>done had been wrongful, the verdict must have been <em>guilty. </em>And its being <em>\u201cnot guilty </em>\u201d decisive and conclusive upon the question that there was <em>no wrongful act. </em>And, indeed, if there was a wrongful act, there must have been some damages found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-6\">\u201c Some damages are always recoverable for violation of a right, although the action be in tort.\u201d 3 Rob. Prac., new edi. 618-621. It was long ago held, that \u201cevery injury imports damage in the nature of it,\u201d by Lord Holt, in <em>Ashby </em>v. <em>White, </em>quoted by Pobinson, <em>ubi supra. </em>And though, says that author, \u201cthere may have been a want of consistency in the language of the judges\u201d (page 619), <em>\u201cnow </em>the doctrine is established in the United States and in England, that <em>actual perceptible damage </em>is <em>not </em>indispensable as the foundation of an action. If there has been the violation of a right, and <em>no other </em>damage is established, the party injured is entitled to a verdict for <em>nominal </em>damages.\u201d Page 620. \u201cThe general principle,\u201d said Coleridge J., \u201capplies, that although no appreciable damage may be sustained in the particular instance by the wrongful act, yet, as the repetition of such an act might be made the foundation of claiming a right to do the act hereafter, a damage in law has been already sustained, in respect of which an action is maintainable.\u201d Page 621. And in Pennsylvania it was held (in 1828).that the <em>law </em>implies damage from flooding the ground of another, though it be in the least possible degree, and without <em>actual prejudice; </em>and in such case the plaintiff recovers nominal damages, although special damage was alleged and not proved.\u201d Page 620.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-7\">If, then, the jury were not satisfied that the special damage (to the crops) alleged was caused by the appellant\u2019s works; if they were not satisfied there was any \u201cactual prejudice\u201d therefrom, yet, if the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>showed that the appellee\u2019s ground was flooded in the <em>least possible degree </em>by the wrongful act of the appellants, they were bound to find a verdict of guilty, instead of \u25a0 not guilty, and to give some damages. Nevertheless, the jury found the defendants not guilty. Their verdict, then, in that case, is an explicit and unequivocal finding that it was not a wrongful act in the appellants to erect and continue the works complained of in this action, and (there having been judgment on it) is con-elusive in the present case. <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>2 Hen. <em>&amp; </em>Mun. 55; 1 Greenl. Evi. S. 531.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-4\">\u25a0 The declaration, in the former case, not only alleged special damage, but also general damages. Robinson (see 3d vol. Prac., new edi., page 624) says, that after \u2022stating the cause of action, \u201cthe declaration usually alleges the matter therein set forth to be to the damage of the plaintiff some specified sum. Under this common allegation there may be shown what are termed <em>general </em>damages; that is, damages which <em>necessarily </em>result from the act complained of, for,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-5\">Such was the form of the declaration in the first case. It stated, as cause of action, that the defendants made an embankment and other structures across Buffalo river, without leaving sufficient water way to allow the \u25a0flood waters to flow, as they had been accustomed, and then alleged damage therefrom. And there was in it not only an allegation of special damage to the crops, but general damage was alleged, to wit: to the specified sum of $10,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-6\">Under this, as we have just seen, there might have been shown \u201c what are termed <em>general </em>damages; that is, damages which necessarily result from the act complained of; \u201d and as damages necessarily result from unlawfully flooding another\u2019s ground (for \u201cthe law implies damage from flooding the ground of. another, though it be in the least possible degree, and without actual prejudice\u201d), they would have been shown if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>had been shown that the flooding was unlawful; and, such case\u2019 tiie plaintiff would have recovered nominal damages, although special damages was alleged and not proved.\u201d 3 Bob. p. 620. Chitty utters the same voice (1 Plead. 440 m.), that \u201cdamages are general or special. General damages are such as the <em>law implies, </em>or presumes to have accrued, from the wrong complained of. Special damages are such as really took place, and are not implied by law, and are either super-added to general damages, arising from an act injurious in itself, or,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATXK\">Speaking of this principle, Sedgwick, on the measure of damages, says \u201cin the common ease of trespass to lands, the main object usually being to determine the right, this principle becomes very important.\u201d In many of these cases, it might seem, at first sight, that the maxim <em>injuria sine dar\u00f1no </em>applied, and that the law would refuse redress. But, as has been clearly said by the Supreme court of Connecticut, in an action for flowing lands, \u201c an act which occasions no other damT age than putting at hazard those rights, which, if the act was acquiesced in, would be lost by lapse of time, is a sufficient ground of action.\u201d Pages 47-48, and notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEP\">It is submitted, the court should have instructed the jury that the verdict and judgment in the former ease were conclusive that, in erecting and continuing the works complained of by the appellees, the appellants did no wrong to them <em>(Preston </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Mun. 55); for \u201ca judgment of a proper court being the sentence or conclusion of the law, upon the facts contained within the record, puts an end to all further litigation on account of the same matter, and becomes the law of the case, which cannot be changed or altered, even by the consent of the parties, and is not only binding upon them, but upon the courts and juries ever afterwards, so long as it shall remain in force and \u2018un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>reversed.\u201d <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Pier, </em>4 Rawle R. 273, 288-9; and see 1 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7 531, and notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-4\">Whether pleaded or given in evidence, the verdict and judgment were conclusive. It is so in most of the States. 2 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cases 820, top, Libr. edi. 683 m. And notwithstanding the <em>obiter dictum </em>in <em>Cleaton </em>v. <em>Chambliss, </em>6 Rand. 86, of one of the judges, that is the rule in Virginia. See <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Barbour, </em>2 Wash. 64, and opinions of Tucker, judge, and Roane, judge, in <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Mun. 63-4, 67-8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-5\">Hot only are the verdict and judgment in the former case an absolute bar to the suit in this case, hut the facts show there is no ground of action. And if substantial grounds were wanting to set aside this verdict, there is a fatal defect in this; that there was no issue made upon the second plea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-6\">The replication to it set up new affirmative matter, to wit, that the works were negligently constructed, and the damages not estimated with reference to such negligent construction. But while averring <em>nrn </em>matter, it concluded to the <em>country. </em>This was error. See 5 Rob. Prac., new edi., 174-5, and cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-7\">The clerk did not enter the <em>similiter\u2014that </em>clerk (now an octogenarian, the last survivor of the old school of Virginia clerks), understood his business. He had no right to cut off the defendant from pleading, because the plaintiff concluded his replication erroneously, and he knew it. If the replication had concluded with a verification, as it should have done, there could have been no joinder of issue without a rejoinder; 1 Boh. Old Prac. 218; and the improper conclusion does not result in an issue, when a proper conclusion would not. Issue, therefore, was not joined on this replication. And this error is not cured by the provision of the Code, ch. 181, \u00a7 3. That applies only where the <em>similiter </em>is proper to he entered; where it is matter of form. It has not the effect to dispense with pleadings neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>sary to an issue. It cures <em>misjoining </em>of issue, but does not dispense with an issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-9\">Tbe objection, \u201cis not to tbe informality of tbe replication in concluding to tbe country while it affirmed new matter.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-10\">It is not an objection to tbe replication at all. Hor is it an objection that tbe <em>similiter </em>was not added; it goes beyond. It is that tbe replication, notwithstanding its conclusion to the country, was nevertheless a replication, on which the clerk could not enter the <em>similiter. </em>Tor it did not end the pleading; did not bring tbe parties to issue. It remained for tbe defendant to rejoin to the new matter averred in tbe replication, which tbe clerk could not shut him out from doing, because of tbe erroneous conclusion thereof; that it is to the <em>substance </em>of tbe plea, and not its conclusion the clerk must look in deciding whether or not to add tbe <em>similiter, </em>and when he decided here not to enter tbe <em>similiter </em>he decided not against his \u201c obvious duty,\u201d but plainly right. It is only when the plaintiff takes issue on the defendant\u2019s pleading, or traverses the same, that tbe plaintiff may proceed as if there were a <em>similiter. </em>\u00a7 27, cb. 171, Code 1860, page 712.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-11\">Here tbe plaintiff did not take issue, traverse or demur, and could not therefore proceed as if there were a <em>similiter.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-12\">In this state of tbe pleadings, bow can it be said \u201ctbe case was regularly tided on its merits by a jury.\u201d Juries are sworn to try <em>issues, </em>and on this important plea, going to the very foundation of the action, there was no issue made up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-13\">And, in fact, the jury were not sworn to try any supposed issue springing out of this plea. They were sworn to try \u201c <em>the issue </em>joined,\u201d not the issues\u2014but <em>the one, </em>the <em>only issue, </em>to wit, the general issue joined on the plea of not guilty. And it is submitted, it is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>answer that <em>\u201c </em>the omission was overlooked or disregarded, or immaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-4\">There is a mode of making tip issues on pleas received in court. See it in 1 Rob. Old Prae. 222. Parties are not allowed to disregard it. They must come \u201cto issue before they go to trial. They cannot waive this cardinal rule of Virginia jurisprudence. And if the court which tried the case fails, for whatever reason, to see that it is done, it will be fatal in the Court of aptpeals. The cases are numerous to that effect; cases in which the exception was taken, as it is objected is done here for the first time, in the Court of Appeals; for, if the defect had been noticed in the lower court, it would have been corrected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-5\">Verdict does not cure the error. See the cases collected by Mr. Robinson, in the Old Practice, page 220-1. See what he extracts from the case of <em>Totty\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Donald &amp; Co., 4 </em>Munf. 430, in which nonassumpsit and a special plea were pleaded. \u201cTJpon the first plea issue was joined, and to the second the plaintiffs filed a special replication, to which there was neither demurrer nor rejoinder. The record stated that the jury were sworn to try the issues joined (not, as in this case, the issue). TJpon both pleas there was a verdict for the plaintiffs, and judgment rendered accordingly. The Court of Appeals was of opinion that <em>\u201c </em>there being <em>no rejoinder, </em>the special replication to the second plea was <em>no issue </em>on that plea;\u201d and for this cause reversed the judgment, set aside the verdict, and remanded the cause for further proceedings.\u201d 1 Rob.

The technical exception to the state of the pleadings, taken in this court for the first time by the learned counsel for the appellee, involving, as it does, matter of form merely, does not appeal very forcibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>to the favorable consideration of the court, and is untenable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-9\">However irregular and informal it may be to conclude a plea to the country, when it should properly conclude with a verification, such irregularity is now regarded as a matter of form only, and is no longer, as formerly, the subject of a general demurrer. 5 Hob. Prac. p. 182, \u00a7 8, and cases there cited. Hot being the subject of general demurrer, and special demurrers being abolished, and no objection having been taken in the court below to the form of the pleading, nor any motion, made to correct its conclusion, all objection on that score must be considered as waived; and it was the obvious duty of the clerk, under the Virginia statute, to add the <em>similiter. </em>Piad that been done, it will not be pretended at this day, that the judgment would be reversed after verdict on account of the informal conclusion of the plea. But it was not done ; yet the omission was overlooked, or disregarded as immaterial, and the case was regularly tried on its merits by a jury, who rendered a verdict, which was approved by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-10\">After verdict and judgment thus rendered, no exception will be allowed for want of the <em>similiter. </em>Code 1860, eh. 181, \u00a7 3, p. 742-3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-11\">2.

The actions were not <em>trespass, </em>but were both in <em>case </em>for <em>consequential </em>damages; and the jury might well find, as\u2014with the approval of the court\u2014 they <em>did </em>find, that the consequences alleged in the declaration did result in the one case from the unskillful erection of the embankment; \u201cwhilst the destruction of the crops charged in the other case, was not a consequence, in any degree, -of the embankment; but that the latter were washed away and destroyed by the natural and unavoidable .effect of a very great and unusual flood, sufficient of itself to produce the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>(as was iii fact the case); and yet, by the unsMllfal erection and subsequent breaking and washing away of the-appellant\u2019s embankment, and a change in the channel of the stream, caused thereby, the jury might also find that the appellee\u2019s <em>land tuas </em>covered with sand, sobbed,, abraded, and greatly injured. So far from these cases-being the same, it is respectfully submitted, that when strictly analyzed, it will be difficult to find the slightest similitude.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-4\">It is not perceived how, under the well known rules; of law applicable to <em>estoppels, </em>such a record as that offered in evidence can be relied on as an <em>estoppel </em>in such a case as this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-5\">Hot being conclusive as an estoppel, it is merely a <em>fact </em>in the cause; and the other important facts not being fully certified, the judgment of the court below cannot be reviewed here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-6\">3. In reply to the suggestion, that the land owner has been already paid for the flooding of his land,, by the original condemnation and assessment of damages,, we think it enough to say, that it is apparent, not only from the special replication, but on the face of the declaration, that the appellee\u2019s claim was to recover for damage to his property, not only <em>not foreseen and estimated </em>by the commissioners, but which, from the very nature of the case, could not have been foreseen and estimated; being the unexpected result of a breach \u00a9f the embankment, caused by unskillful construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-7\">\"We need not cite authority to shew that <em>such unforeseen injury </em>is not covered by the original assessment of damages.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-21\">He had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b390-8\">Staples, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUz\">This is an action of trespass on the case for damage to the plaintiff\u2019s land. The declaration charges the defendant with erecting an embankment and other structures across the lands of the plaintiff,, without leaving sufficient arches or waterway to allow' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>the flood waters of Buffalo run to escape as they had heen accustomed; and in consequence thereof the flood waters of said run became accumulated in great quantity upon the low lands of the plaintiff, injuring the same, and rendering them permanently unfit for cultivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The defendant pleaded not guilty; upon which issue was joined. He also filed a special plea alleging, in substance, that the commissioners, duly appointed, had awarded the tenant of the freehold, under whom plaintiff claimed, the sum of $1,362, as a just compensation for the land taken by the company, and for the damage to the residue of the tract; that the sum so awarded had heen duly paid by the defendant to said tenant of the'freehold, and the report of the commissioners confirmed by the proper court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">To this plea the plaintiff put in a special replication, averring that the damages to the lands of the plaintiff, set forth in the declaration, resulted from a negligent and improper construction of the defendant\u2019s works, and were not assessed or ascertained by said commissioners ; concluding to the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">To this replication there was no rejoinder. The record states that the jury \u201creturned into court, and upon their oaths rendered a verdict <em>1 </em>upon the <em>issues </em>joined\u2019 for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">It is now insisted that, though a misjoining of issue is cured by the statute of jeofails, yet that act will not sustain a verdict where no issue has heen in fact joined; and in this case the special replication, containing new matter, there can he no issue thereon without a rejoinder; and this objection is not obviated by the statement in the record that the jury were sworn to try or rendered their verdict upon the issues joined. It must he admitted the cases cited by appellant\u2019s counsel strongly sustain this view. The case of <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Mauro, </em>4 Rand. 488, is, however, a later decision than either of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>those cited, and maintains a contrary doctrine. There defendant jileaded that the action was founded on an account of goods, wares and merchandise; and that cause action did not accrue within one year. The plaintiff replied that the plaintiff and defendant were merchants, and goods were sold and delivered by7 plaintiff as a merchant, and so purchased and received by the defendant; concluding with a verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">There was no rejoinder to this replication, but the record stated \u201cthat issue was thereupon joined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">It was objected that there was no issue; but the court held this was a misjoining of issue which was cured by the statute of jeofails. It does not appear from the report of the case, that the previous decisions were cited, or in any manner alluded to, either in the argument or the opinion of the court. This is the more remarkable, as the cases are in direct conflict, unless, as has been suggested, the statement in the record in <em>Moore </em>v. Mauro, \u201cthat issue was joined on the replication,\u201d distinguishes that case from <em>Wilkinson\u2019s Adm\u2019rs </em>v. Bennett, 3 Munf. 314; where the record states \u201cthe jury were sworn upon the issue joined.\u201d This is certainly a very narrow and unsatisfactory ground upon which to adjudicate the rights of parties. Besides, in <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Thornton\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>1 Wash. 194, an entry upon the record after the replication filed, \u201c that issue was thereupon joined,\u201d was held to be insufficient when it appeared there was no issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The decision in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Mauro, </em>would seem to be more in harmony with the spirit of the modern cases, and the disposition manifested by the courts to disregard mere technical objections, unless there be omitted something so essential to the action or defence that judgment according to law, and the very right of the cause, cannot be given; more especially where the parties, as in this case, have gone to trial upon the merits, submitting the cause to the jury as though the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>liad heen more formally joined. The certificate of the .judge presiding at the trial, shews that the subject matter of the plea and replication was fully investigated, was the point to which the evidence of both plaintiff and defendant was principally directed, and must have been passed upon by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Do objection for the nonjoinder of issue was made, either before or after the rendition of the verdict. 'The cause was tried in August, 1859; a motion made by the defendant for a new trial and overruled; and a writ of error and supersedeas from this court obtained in that year. During all this time this objection has never been made; and now, after the lapse of nearly twelve years, we are asked by the defendant to reverse the judgment for a defect in the pleadings directly attributable to its own negligence. The effect of sustaining such an objection now would be the sacrifice of the justice of a cause upon a mere technicality in no way affecting the merits, and to hold out to parties inducements to omit some purely formal proceeding \u25a0easily overlooked in the hurry and confusion of a trial, with a view to a reversal of an unfavorable verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Under these circumstances, I think this court, in this ease, should follow the rule announced in <em>Moore </em>v. Mauro, if there was no other ground upon which its decision might be based. But the question here may Be settled without reference to the precise point involved in the previous decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">It is a rule of pleading, that whenever the replication contains new matter it should conclude with a verification, to afford the opposite party an opportunity of answering it. Iu such case there will not be an issue until the defendant adds the rejoinder. But when the replication properly concludes to the country, the making up the issue by adding the <em>similiter, </em>is mere matt\u00e9r of form. This may be done by the clerk; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the failure to do so is not ground of error. The rule Just stated is subject to this qualification, that although the replication may contain new matter, yet if the defendant cannot take any new or other issue in his rejoinder without a departure from his plea, the replication may, notwithstanding the new matter, conclude-to the country. 1 Saunders R. 103 a.; <em>Carthrae </em>v. Clarke, 5 Leigh 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The defendant pleaded that compensation had been made the tenant of the freehold for the land taken, and for the damage to the residue of the tract. The plaintiff replied that in consequence of the negligent construction of the work, the damages sued for were not assessed nor foreseen by the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Suppose the defendant had rejoined, what new issue could he have taken, or what new matter averred* without a departure from his plea? He could only have rejoined that the work <em>was </em>properly constructed* and the damages <em>were </em>foreseen and assessed by the commissioners. And thus the parties would have been formally and technically at issue on the precise ground with respect to their pleadings, they in fact occupied on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The same defect occurred in the pleadings in the-first case tried, in which there was a verdict against the plaintiff, and upon which the defendant is now relying as an estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">It is not improbable that the counsel, in both cases* for plaintiff and defendant, considered the replication as substantially a denial of the plea, upon which the issue might at once be tendered, and to which the defendant could make no answer, other than that contained in the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">If these views be correct, an issue was properly tendered by the replication, and the failure of the defendant to join therein is cured by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">The second'question to be considered is, whether the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>verdict in the first case tried presents a bar to a recovery in this suit. There can, of course, be no doubt that a verdict in one suit 'will be conclusive in every other between the same parties, where the cause of action is the same; upon the ground that what has once been judicially determined shall not again be made the subject of controversy. But it has been settled by numerous cases, that to make such verdict available as an estoppel, or conclusive as evidence, it must appear not only that the same matter was in controversy, but that it was actually decided; and that where the verdict of the jury may have been founded upon one of two points, it will not operate as an estoppel as to either. 2 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases 374. Although the testimony may have been sufficient to establish a particular fact, and that fact may have been involved in one \u00aef the issues to be tried, yet if it be doubtful whether the verdict was based upon such fact, it will not operate as an estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Li <em>Long </em>v. <em>Baugas, </em>2 Ired. R. 290, it was decided that a verdict, in an action of detinue against the plaintiff, on the plea of <em>non deiinet, </em>is not sufficient evidence in another suit to show that the plaintiff had no title to the property demanded. Judge Ruffin said the verdict might have proceeded on various grounds, suggested by him; that the plaintiff had no title, or that the defendants did not jointly detain' the property. It was impossible to tell on what ground the jury went, possibly upon either or all the grounds together. And if evidence were allowable, to show the grounds upon which the verdict was rendered, it was clear the evidence did not show that the verdict was given, necessarily, on the very fact that the plaintiff had no title.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">According to the Lew York decisions, parol proof may be given to show the grounds upon which the verdict was rendered in the first action, where the record does not disclose them. But it is there held, also, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>will not be sufficient to show that the testimony established a particular fact; it must clearly appear that the verdict was based upon that fact. <em>Jackson ex dem. </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>8 Wend. R. 27; Lawrence <em>v. Hunt, </em>10 Wend. R. 80. In <em>McDowell </em>v. <em>Langdon &amp; </em>als., 3 Gray\u2019s R. 513, it was decided that a verdict for the defendant in an action at law for obstructing the flow of water to the plaintiff\u2019s mill, on a plea of not guilty, and a specification of defence denying both plaintiff\u2019s right and any injury thereof, are not a bar to another suit for the same' matter, unless it appear either by the verdict or extrinsic evidence, that the defendant prevailed because the jury found that the jflaintiffs had not the right which they claimed. Metcalf, J., said it was doubtful whether the defendants succeeded in the first action, on the ground that they had the right they claimed in their specification, or on the ground that they had done no acts in violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights. And the parol evidence admitted showed only that the plaintiffs at the trial claimed an ancient right to a prior use of the water; and that evidence was introduced on both sides in regard to the rights of both parties. The plaintiffs may have failed in their action because they failed to satisfy the jury that the defendants had violated their rights, even though the plaintiffs had all the rights which they claimed. See also <em>Lore </em>v. Truman, 10 Ohio State R. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">In the case of <em>The Wash., Alex. and Geo. Steam Packet Co. </em>v. <em>Sickles and Cook, </em>24 How. U. S. R. 333, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the record of a former suit between the parties, in which the declaration consisted of a special count and the common money counts, and where there was a general verdict on the entire declaration, cannot be given in evidence as an estoppel in a second suit founded on the special count, for the verdict may have been rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>on the common counts. Also, 2 Smith Leach Gas. 794, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Let us see if these principles are not decisive of the question under consideration. The two actions were instituted against the defendant on the same day. The declarations in hoth cases were filed at the same time, and the same issues made up in both cases at the same term. The writ in the one case is for damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 crops, in the other for damage to his land. The declarations follow the writs with great precision and care in each case. In that for the destruction of the crops, the declaration contains no allegation whatever of any injury to the land. That case was first tried, and the certificate of the judge, of the facts proved, shows that the attention of neither party was directed to the question of damage to the lands, nor was there a scintilla of evidence before the jury on that subject. The reason is obvious; at that time the other suit between the same parties, for the recovery of such damages, was pending in the same court, and must have been understood and tacitly agreed, as not a proper subject of investigation in the case then being tried. It may be that testimony ivas offered to show that defendant\u2019s works were improperly constructed, but the record does not show the fact. The main purpose of the defence was to show that the flood which stvept away plaintiff\u2019s crops Avas the heaifiest knoAvn in that section for twenty-five years, and that the crops of the plaintiff would have been utterly destroyed though the embankment had never been made. The judge certifies it was proved on the trial that at the time of the injury the plaintiff\u2019s lands were not covered Avith Avater to a greater extent than they had frequently been before defendant\u2019s works were constructed; and if these works had never been constructed at all, all the plaintiff\u2019s crops would have been utterly destroyed. Surely the defendant could not be required to pay the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>tiff for the loss of his crops, if it were clear they would have been destroyed with or without the embankment, although the jury might believe, from the evidence, work was defectively constructed. Ho one reading this record can fail to perceive that the verdict was given on this ground, and upon no other. If, however, upon the pleading and the evidence, it is merely doubtful upon what ground the jury rendered their verdict in the first action, such verdict will not operate as an estoppol, according to the authority of adjudicated cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">It has been argued, and with much ingenuity and ability, that the averment of specific damage to the crops was not the gist of the first action, but only a consequence of the right of action; that flooding the ground of another is actionable in itself; that in such case the law will imply damage which need not be specially stated; that the plaintiff, though he might fail as to the crops, had the right in the first action to recover for injury to the land, and that the plea of not guilty put in issue both the act complained of, and all its consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">And so in detinue, the plea of <em>non deiinet </em>puts in issue the title of the plaintiff, as well as the act of detention. But in such case the verdict does not operate as an estoppel, unless the ground upon which it was rendered appear from the record or by extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">In <em>Thorpe </em>v. Cooper, 15 Eng. C. L. R. 387, it was said that, although a declaration contains counts under which the plaintiff\u2019s whole demand might be recovered, yet, if no attempt'be made to give evidence of some of the claims, they may be recovered in another action. This proposition is sustained by numerous authorities. <em>Hadley </em>v. Green, 2 Tyrwhitt\u2019s R. 390; <em>Seddon </em>v. <em>Tutop, </em>6 T. R. 607; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Van Houten, </em>12 Johns. R. 311; and <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>10 Johns. R. 313. It is equally well settled that, whenever a question arises as to the identity of the matter litigated in the first suit, parol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>evidence may be received of what transpired on the first trial, with a view to ascertain what was the matter \u2022decided upon by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The rule is thus laid down in 1 StarMe Evi. p. 263. A recovery in one action cannot be pleaded in bar of a second, where in trial of the first action no evidence was given in support of the claim on which the second is founded. Where issue is taken on the fact whether the second action is brought for the same cause as the first, evidence is admissible of what passed at the first trial. See, also, <em>Whittemore </em>v. <em>Whittemore, </em>2 New Hamp. R. 26; 2 Phillipps on Evidence, new ed. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">It may be argued, however, that this rule only applies where the causes of action are distinct and sever-able, and the plaintiff is at liberty to enforce them in \u25a0one or several suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The rule undoubtedly is, that where a wrong or a \u25a0contract is entire, and might be the subject of a single suit, the law will not permit it to be divided and made the subject of several suits. In such case, if there is a judgment for or against the plaintiff for part, the residue will be as absolutely extinguished as if the whole demand had been embraced in the first suit. The difficulty is not in the rule, but in discriminating between causes of action that are entire, and such as are separate and distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Where the act is unlawful in itself, a right of action accrues immediately, and is held to include all subsequent damage flowing from it. In such cases there can be but one recovery between the parties, as the injury is not the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Where, however, the act is lawful in itself, but negligently and improperly performed, the gist of the action is the damage, without which there can he no recovery. And I can see no good reason in such case why the plaintiff may not institute separate suits for distinct injuries, occurring at different times, to differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ent parcels of property, though resulting from one and the same act of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"A_I\">The case of <em>Young </em>v. Munby, 4 Maule &amp; Selw. R. 184, substantially affirms this principle. The plaintiff declared against the defendant, the executor of the \u00b0 former rector of the rectory of Grilling, for the failure of such rector to repair the chancel and pew of the church, as it was his duty to do. The defendant\u2019s plea was, that the plaintiff had impleaded the defendant in a former action for want of reparation of the rectory house, out-houses and cottages belonging to the rectory, and recovered a verdict; and that the same state of ruin and decay of the chancel and pew existed before and at the time of the commencement of the former action, and might have been included in the former suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">It was argued by Tindal, that the plaintiff is not at liberty to subdivide one entire cause of action, and to bring so many separate suits as there may be consequences resulting from it; but that he is bound to include all the consequences under one action, and to recover damages for them once for all. Lord Ellen-borough said there was no doubt in the case. If the defendant could make out that an injury caused by dilapidations was one entire identical injury, forming precisely the same cause of action for any part of it, then he would be right that the plaintiff could have but one action for it. But there was no good reason why this should be considered as one entire cause of action, compounded of the several injuries sustained in the several parts. They are different and independent injuries in respect of the different parts, the injury from the dilapidation of the house is one thing, and for the dilapidation of the chancel is another; the causes are distinct; the latter might not be consummate when the first was.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Tn this case, conceding for a moment that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>tiff had the right to recover in the first suit for flooding his lands, still it is apparent he neither enforced nor attempted to enforce that claim. There was no allegation in the declaration of such damage, nor evidence offered on the trial hearing upon that question. Had he attempted it, it is not improbable the evidence would have been objected to on the ground of the pendency of another action for damage to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">In the first suit, the gravamen of complaint was, that by reason of defective arches and waterways, the plaintiff\u2019s crops were destroyed by the flood of August, 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In the present case, the evidence bearing upon the question of the damage to the land, and the causes to which it was attributable, was very conflicting; so much so, that the presiding judge refused to certify the facts. <em>We </em>must, therefore, look to the declaration to ascertain the grounds of the action, and as there was a verdict for the plaintiff, it is to be presumed he sustained these grounds at least to the satisfaction of the jury. The averment is, that, owing to insufficient arches or waterways constructed by the defendant, the waters of Buffalo run became accumulated upon the low lands of the plaintiff in the month of August, 1856, and at various other times since, a portion of the embankment washed down and was thrown into the stream, obstructing the channel, and causing a reflux of the waters upon the adjoining lands of the plaintiff, sobbing and permanently injuring the same. It is apparent from this statement that the causes of action are different for distinct injuries, occurring at different times. The plaintiff\u2019s right of action for the destruction of the crops was complete upon the happening of that event. \"Whether he could then have maintained a suit for the damage to the freehold, is very questionable. The extraordinary freshet which destroyed the crops, would also have flooded the lands, although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>defendant\u2019s works bad never been constructed. Tbe exemption from liability was as complete in tbe one case as tbe other. The permanent injury to tbe freehold, of wbicb complaint only is made in this action, was sustained afterwards, was gradual in its character, and was tbe result of successive overflowings or accumulations of water upon plaintiff\u2019s land, and wbicb could have been in a measure prevented by removing tbe obstructions and tbe construction of suitable arches and waterways. Tor the first injury, tbe loss of tbe crops, tbe plaintiff might have sued immediately. Tor tbe second, tbe damage to tbe freehold, be bad tbe right to bring a new action whenever tbe damage was sustained. Indeed, upon well settled principles, each overflowing of tbe plaintiff\u2019s land was a continuation of tbe injury, for wbicb there might have been successive actions. Tbe fact that tbe plaintiff delayed his suit for tbe first injury until tbe occurrence of tbe damage in tbe second, it seems to me, imposes upon him no obligation to include both causes in tbe same action.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Before concluding this opinion, it is proper to notice a question wbicb has been raised as to tbe right of tbe plaintiff to maintain this action. At tbe time of tbe assessment of damages by tbe commissioners tbe land was held by tbe personal representative of Mrs. Judith Randolph, and to him tbe money was paid. A short time thereafter tbe land was sold under a decree of court and was purchased by tbe plaintiff. Whether tbe works of tbe company were then completed does not distinctly appear. If they were not, tbe purchaser could not know that these works would be constructed In a negligent and imperfect manner. If they were so completed, it has been suggested tbe purchaser must be apprized of tbe defective execution of tbe work, and as bis vendor received compensation for tbe land, and for damages to tbe residue of tbe tract,' be must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>take the land <em>cum on\u00e9re; </em>and further if the works ol the defendant were so defectively constructed, a cause of action at once accrued to Mrs. Randolph\u2019s representative, but did not pass to the purchaser, and the plaintiff has, therefore, no right to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The principle of law is well settled, that wherever \u2022any act injures another\u2019s right, and would be evidence in future in favor of the wrong doer, an action may be maintained for the invasion of the right without proof \u2022of any specific damage. The reason is said to be that the repetition of the act may, in the progress of time, impair or defeat the right, and were the owner required to wait for some appreciable injury before bringing his \u25a0suit, he might lose the right without a remedy to preserve it. But this principle can have no application to :a case like the present. bTo right of the land owner was infringed by the construction of the company\u2019s works. Upon the payment of the damages assessed by the commissioners, the title to the land taken for the railway immediately vested in the company in fee simple, and thereafter the relation sustained by the land owner and company to each other was simply that of vendor and purchaser. Being the owner of the land thus acquired, the company had complete dominion of the soil, and might place thereon such structures as it deemed proper in the prosecution of its work. Bor the exercise of this undoubted right it could not be \u25a0accountable to any one unless for actual damage sustained thereby, however defective the work might be. 'The rule is tiras laid down in a leading case: \u201cThe right which a man has is to enjoy his own land in the state and condition in which nature has placed it, and also to use it in such manner as he thinks fit, subject always to this, that if this mode of using it does damage to his neighbor, he must make compensation.\u201d The ground of complaint in such case, is not the doing .an unlawful act, but the doing an act, lawful in itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ill such a careless and negligent manner that consequential damage is caused to the contiguous land owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">If this view be correct, the estate of Mrs. Randolph had no cause of action by reason of the defective construction of the company\u2019s works, as thereby no right of said estate was invaded, and no damage to the land occurred until after it had passed into the possession, and became the properly of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">The company\u2019s works may have been defectively constructed, but it did not necessarily follow that any injury to the land-owner would result from such construction. Whether it would or not would depend upon the violence or frequency of storms, the action of the weather, and other agencies, whose influences could neither be estimated nor foreseen. The damages in such cases would be purely speculative, and the result would be, that in many instances the company would be required to pay for injuries that would never occur, and in others escape the payment of damages which might be sustained long after the verdict was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">If a right of action accrues so soon as the work is defectively done, this injustice would follow. If the land-owner fails to sue within five years thereafter, his action is barred, though his property should be rendered utterly valueless within the five years by a reflux of the water thereon occasioned by such defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">In <em>Bonomi </em>v. <em>Backhouse, </em>96 Eng. C. L. R. 622, the plaintiff was the owner, of the reversion of an ancient house, and brought his action, alleging that the defendant negligently and without leaving proper support, worked the mines under the contiguous land. Ro actual damage, had occurred until within six years, and it was claimed the action was barred. The court of Exchequer, reversing the Queen\u2019s Bench, held that no cause of action accrued for the mere excavation by the defendant on his own land, so long as it caused no dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>age to the plaintiff\u2019s. The judge said, if the cause of action arose when the act was done, without regard to the injury, the jury would have to decide upon the speculative question whether any damage is likely to arise; and it might well he, that in many cases the jury would give large sums of money for apprehended damage, which, in point of fact, might never occur, and in other cases, upon the evidence of mineral surveyors and engineers, find that no damage was likely to occur when the most serious injury might afterwards happen; and in such case no new action could he brought for any subsequent damage occurring, because if the original act was unlawful, all the damage consequent upon that unlawful act is satisfied by the first recovery. The authority of this case has been repeatedly recognized, and is generally regarded as sound law.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The injustice of a contrary rule is made manifest by a single illustration. A railway company having constructed a defective culvert or other structure, ascertains that the land of the adjoining proprietor will he flooded and injured, and immediately remedies the defect by a proper culvert, so that no damage to the land can ever occur. It seems to me that fact would he a conclusive answer to an action brought for the defective construction of the work in the first instance. The defendant might well say that the plaintiff had not \u25a0only sustained no damage, but beyond all dispute never would sustain any damage. But if the cause of action arises by reason of the defect alone, the right having \u25a0once vested could not be extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">These considerations serve to show that, to maintain an action against a railway company for the erection of defective structures upon its own land, the plaintiff must aver and prove some special damage, and upon proof of that he is entitled to recover whenever his title may have been acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The case of <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>The Great Northern Railway </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>Co., </em>4 Eng. Law and Eq. R. 265, is an authority directly in point. There the declaration averred that the defendants erected an embankment across certain low lan&lt;^s&gt; without leaving sufficient arches for the flood waters of the river Dun to escape, by means of which said waters became accumulated on plaintiff\u2019s lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The defence was that before the plaintiff, who was-a mere tenant for years, became possessed of the land,, the defendant had paid to the owner, under whom plaintiff claimed, the amount awarded such owner, as a compensation for the land purchased and for all damage done or likely to he done to the remaining <em>lands; </em>and that before plaintiff became possessed of the close-the defendants constructed their arches and embankments in the mode and according to the specifications mentioned in the award. The plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain the action was not denied. The only question considered was whether the compensation received by the owner embraced all possible and contingent damage arising from the construction of the work, although neither foreseen nor even guessed at by the arbitrator\u00bb The court held that the company might, by executing-their arches with proper caution, have avoided the injury which the plaintiffs sustained, and the want of such caution was sufficient to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">In <em>Pittsburg, Fort Wayne, and Chicago Railway </em>v. <em>Gilliland, </em>56 Penn St. R. 445, the same questions were presented and discussed as in the previous case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">This was also an action ag\u00e1inst a railway company-for damages to the plaintiff\u2019s premises, a tenant for-years, arising from the construction of an insufficient culvert, by means of which plaintiff\u2019s lands were overflowed in time of heavy floods. It was insisted that the plaintiff\u2019s remedy, if any he had, must be held to he included in the special remedy given for the appropriation of the land, under which the damages had been duly assessed, and paid to the tenant of the free<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>hold, long- anterior to the lease under which plaintiff claimed. But the court held that no estimate of damages could be founded upon an expectation that the \u25a0 company will omit its duty, or on the supposition that it will so negligently and unskilfully construct its work as to produce injury; or whether it will fail at all is unknown and can furnish no guide to govern the estimate. If the culvert was so unskilftilly and negligently constructed as to be insufficient to resist the high water of the stream, the company building it would be liable to <em>any party injured </em>thereby. <em>Hentz </em>v. <em>Long Island R. R. Co., </em>13 Barb. R. 646, is to the same effect. 11 Cush. R. 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">All the authorities agree that the assessment of damages under the statutes applying to that subject, is only a bar to an action for such injuries as could properly have been included in such assessment. The commissioners have the right and are bound to presume the company will construct its works in a proper manner, and they have no right to award damages upon the supposition that the company will negligently and improperly perform its work. A failure to construct its works in a proper and skilfull manner will therefore impose a liability for damages to any one who may sustain any loss or injury by reason of such negligence; it being well settled that such damages are not to be considered as included in the estimate of the commissioners. In this case, whether the works of the company were or were not properly constructed was a question exclusively for the jury. Upon this point the evidence was so conflicting, the judge of the Circuit court refused to certify the facts. Upon well-settled principles, where the evidence is contradictory and a new trial is refused by the court which presided at the trial, its decision is not the subject of a writ of error or examination in an Appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"AEa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The judgment of the Circuit court must therefore be <em>af</em>firmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The other <em>pies, J. </em>judges concurred in the opinion of <em>Staples, J.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Judgment Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
