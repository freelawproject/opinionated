The indictment contains two counts. In the first count-the prisoner is charged with having made an assault on. Alice Brown, and feloniously to have ravished her, and. that then and there, in the commission of the rape-aforesaid, murdered her by choking her and thrusting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>\u2022dirt, &amp;c., into lier nose, mouth and throat. But the count omits the conclusion <em>\u201c </em>against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b757-4\">The second count charges the murder by the same \u25a0means, except that it does not charge that it was done in the commission of a rape. This count concludes against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth. The endorsement on the indictment is, An indictment \u2022against Willis Thompson, for murder in commission of rape. True bill. James W. Goodman, foreman of the grand jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b757-5\">When the prisoner was arraigned he elected to be tried in the Circuit court; and when the cause was \u25a0called in that court, he demurred to the indictment and each count thereof; but the demurrer was overruled: and he then pleaded not guilty. On the trial the jury found a general verdict of guilty of murder in the first \u25a0degree, and the court sentenced the prisoner to be hung.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b757-6\">In the progress of the trial, the prisoner, by his counsel, took two exceptions to the rulings of the court, on \u25a0the admissibility of his confessions; and after the verdict he moved in arrest of judgment, which motion the court overruled, and the prisoner excepted. . \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b757-7\">From the first exception, it appears that the .attorney for the Commonwealth introduced a witness, by whom he proposed to prove certain confessions of the prisoner. 'Whereupon, the prisoner, by his - counsel, objected to \u25a0.the introduction of the said confession as evidence in the cause, unless it was first shown affirmatively by the prosecution, to the satisfaction of the court, that said confession had been made freely and voluntarily, and \u25a0without any improper inducements, either of promises \u25a0or threats, or other improper means. But the court -overruled the objection, and decided to admit said confessions to go to the jury, unless the prisoner could . show, by proper testimony, that the said confessions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>had been obtained from him contrary to the rules off law in such case made and provided; being of opinion that when confessions are offered in evidence the law presumes they are voluntary and free from exception; and that if the prisoner desires to exclude them, the-<em>onus </em>is upon him to show that they have been obtained from him by improper inducements, and not upon the-Commonwealth to show affirmatively that they were free and voluntary. To which opinion of the court, the prisoner excepted. But before the confession was admitted, evidence was introduced which satisfied the court that the first confession made was made under a. fear of being hanged by the mob of excited negroes, who surrounded him; and that confession was excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b758-8\">After the first confession was excluded, the attorney for the Commonwealth proposed to give in evidence a confession made at a subsequent time; to which the-prisoner, by his counsel, objected, unless the Commonwealth first showed clearly that the influence exerted' on the mind of the prisoner, by the previous threats \u00a1 and the circumstances surrounding the prisoner, had been removed; that the presumption of law was, that-those influences continued to exist on the mind of the-prisoner, and induced all subsequent confessions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b758-9\">The facts as to this second confession having been, proved, the prisoner, by his counsel, moved the court \u25a0 to exclude this confession, on the ground that, to say the least, it was doubtful whether the influences brought \u25a0 to bear on the mind of the prisoner, by the threats. made against him when the first confession was made,, and the circumstances which surrounded him, had been removed; but the court overruled the objection, and permitted the confession to go to the jury. As-this court did not express any opinion upon the sufficiency of the evidence to authorize the admission off the confession, it is unnecessary to state it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>The motion to arrest the judgment was on the grounds\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b759-4\">1st. That it ivas uncertain whether the verdict was a general one, applying to both counts, or only on one; and if on one only, which?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b759-5\">2d. If the verdict was on the first count, it should be arrested because the demurrer to that count should have been sustained, for the want of the constitutional conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b759-6\">3d. If the verdict was on the second count it was a nullity, because the endorsement on the indictment shows that the grand jury only acted on the first count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b759-7\">4th. If there was no finding of the grand jury on the second count, it should have been stricken out on the demurrer to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b759-8\">5th. That the evidence required to convict the prisoner, on the first count, of murder in the first degree, is different from the evidence which was required to convict him of that crime on the second count. The proof of an attempt to commit a rape, the homicide being proved, would have been sufficient on the first count; on the second, willful and premeditated killing would have been necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b759-9\">Upon the application of the prisoner, a writ of error was allowed him to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b759-14\"><em>Tutwiler, </em>for the prisoner,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acml\">insisted\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-15\">1st. It was error to overrule the demurrer to the first count in the indictment. That count omitted the constitutional conclusion \u201cagainst the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth.\u201d Each count of an indictment must be perfect in itself; and the omission of the conclusion against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth is fatal. <em>Carney\u2019s </em>case, 4 Gratt. 546.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-16\">2d. The demurrer should have been sustained to the first count, because it charges both rape and murder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUPR\">3d. The court below erred in requiring the prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the confession proposed to be given in evidence against him, had been obtained from him by undue influence, before would exclude them. Confessions must be shewn by the Commonwealth, affirmatively, to have been free and voluntary, before they can be introduced. In the case of <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Waverton, </em>2 Lead. Crim. Cas. 157, it is said, <em>\u201c </em>in order to render a confession by a prisoner admissible, the prosecution must shew, affirmatively, to the satisfaction of the judge, that it has not been made under the influence of any improper inducement; if it appear doubtful on the' evidence, the confession ought to be rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-7\">4th. The prisoner having proved, to the satisfaction of the judge, that the first confession had been obtained by threats, so that it was excluded, the court erred in admitting the same confession made at a subsequent time, without requiring the clearest proof that the influences which had induced the first confession, which had been excluded, had been removed from the mind of the prisoner; the presumption of law being that those influences continued. 1 Archb. Cr. Pr. &amp; Pl. 417,418; 2 Russ. Crimes, Confessions; <em>Smith\u2019s case, </em>10 Gratt. 734.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-8\">5th. The verdict of the jury was general. If it was on the first count, it was a nullity, because that count <em>was </em>defective for the reasons before stated; if it was on the second count, it was equally a nullity, because the endorsement .on the indictment shews that on this count there was no finding by the grand jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b760-9\">Rhleger, for the Commonwealth,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2y\">insisted\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-10\">1st.\u2019 The two counts charge exactly the same facts, and the same offence; and there could be no proof or punishment under one count which could not be under the other. The description as to the rape is a statement of the surrounding circumstances not essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>to the charge of murder. 2 Russ. Crimes 793. This distinguishes this case from <em>Carney\u2019s case, </em>4 Gratt. 546. 'The constitution says every indictment shall conclude \u2022against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth; 1 but it does not say that each count shall so conclude; and, in a case like this, the one conclusion will apply to every count in the indictment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b761-5\">2d. The first count does not charge the offence\" of rape as a distinct offence, but as the attendant upon the crime of murder; which it is the intention of the count to charge. <em>Tiernan\u2019s </em>case, 4 Gratt. 545; <em>Ratcliffe\u2019s case, </em>5 Id. 657.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b761-6\">3d. The finding of the grand jury applied to both \u2022counts. The only proper endorsement upon an indictment is \u201c a true bill,\u201d, or \u201c not a true bill;\u201d and any addition is surplusage. <em>Cohen\u2019s case, </em>2 Va. Cas. 158.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b761-7\">4th. As to the confessions, he referred to 2 Russ. Crimes 858, <em>Griffith\u2019s case.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b761-8\">Moncure, P.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1B\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">The court is of opinion, that as the constitution, article VI, sec. 26, requires that indictments shall con-clude, \u201c against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth,\u201d and as the first count of the indictment in this case does not so conclude, though the second, count does, the first count is therefore fatally defective in that respect, and the demurrer thereto ought to have been sustained instead of overruled; according to the authority of <em>Carney\u2019s case, </em>4 Gratt. 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">The court is further of opinion, that although the grand jury might lawfully have found the first count \u2022of the indictment \u201c a true bill,\u201d and the second count \u201c not a true bill;\u201d yet, they did not in fact do so, but found the whole indictment, including both counts,</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">a true bill.\u201d The endorsement, \u201c an indictment against Willis Thompson, murder in commission of jape,\u201d which appears to have been on the indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>when found by <em>the </em>grand jury and when presented by them in court, was not a part of their finding, which consisted only of the words, \u201c true bill,\u201d endorsed on the indictment and signed by their foreman. And, although the same words of description, endorsed on the indictment as aforesaid, are used in the record of the finding thereof; yet, it is a sufficient record of the finding of the whole indictment; the words, \u201c in commission of rape,\u201d included in that description, being-mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The court is further of opinion, that it is not necessary, in consequence of the statute defining the different degrees of murder, and subjecting them to different punishments, to alter the form of indictments for-murder in any respect, nor to charge specially such \u2018facts as would shew the offence to be murder in the-first degree. 3 Robinson\u2019s Practice, old edition, p. 43; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>1 Va. Ca. 310; <em>Wicks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Id. 387. Therefore, the first count of .the indictment in this case, which charges specially a rape,, in the commission of which the murder, which is the-object of the prosecution, is charged to have been committed, is wholly unnecessary, although not on that ground demurrable; and the second count, which is in the common form, will answer every purpose which could have been answered by the first count as an indictment for murder, even if the latter had been otherwise unexceptionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">The court is further of opinion, that in a criminal case a confession of the accused is admissible evidence^ against him, only when it is voluntary; that is, when, made without being induced by motives of hop\u00e9 or fear of temporal advantage or injury, excited by a person in authority, or with the apparent sanction of such a person. <em>Smith\u2019s case, </em>10 Gratt. 734. Persons in authority, within the meaning of the rule, being such as are engaged or concerned in the apprehension, prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>cution or examination of tlie accused. Id. 742, \u20193. That the confession is voluntary, being therefore a condition precedent of its admissibility, and the duty of deciding on its admissibility being a duty which devolves on the court, it follows, necessarily, that the court must be satisfied that the confession was voluntary, before it can be permitted to go before the jury; in other words, that the burden of proof that it was voluntary, devolves on the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">The court is further of opinion, that though a confession may be inadmissible because not voluntary, it may become admissible by being subsequently repeated by the accused, when his mind is perfectly free from the undue influence which induced the original confession. <em>Prima facie, </em>the undue influence will be considered as continuing; though the presumption may be repelled by evidence, which, however, must be strong and clear. The rule on this subject has been well stated to be, \u201c that, although an original confession may have been obtained by improper means, yet subsequent confessions of the same or like facts may be admitted, if the court believes, from the length of time intervening, or from proper warning of the consequences of confession, or from other circumstances, that the delusive hopes or fears, under the influence of which the original confession was obtained, were entirely dispelled. In the absence of any such circumstances, the influence of the motives proved to have been offered, will be presumed to continue, and to have produced the confession, unless the contrary is shown by clear evidence, and the confession will therefore be rejected.\u201d 2 Russ, on Crimes 838; Greenl. Ev. 257; and cases cited. It follows that the burden of showing the contrary devolves on the Commonwealth, as the condition on which the confession will be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The court is further of opinion, that the original confession, which was offered in evidence in this case,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Was clearly inadmissible; having been made under tbe influence of fear, produced by tbe presence and tbe threats of a large number $f negroes, some of whom were armed, who attended tbe person who made tbe arrest, and threatened to bang tbe accused, and tbe Circuit court was therefore right in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">But tbe court declines at this time to express any opinion as to tbe admissibility of tbe subsequent confessions which were given in evidence; deeming it sufficient to state the principles of law which govern tbe subject, and leaving it to tbe Circuit court to apply them, according to a sound discretion, in view of all tbe facts, as they may be developed in tbe future trial of tbe case.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Therefore, it is considered that tbe said judgment, for the reason aforesaid, is erroneous, and that it he reversed and annulled; that tbe demurrer to tbe first count of the indictment be sustained; that tbe verdict of tbe jury be set aside; and that tbe cause be remanded to tbe said Circuit court, for a new trial to be bad therein on tbe second count of tbe indictment; on which new trial the said court is to be governed by tbe principles herein declared, as far as they may be applicable. Which is ordered to be certified to tbe said Circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
