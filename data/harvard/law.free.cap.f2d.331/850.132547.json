In General Banc-shares Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 8 Cir., 326 F.2d 712, the Court affirmed a decision of the Tax Court similar to that which is here appealed from. We fully concur in the carefully reasoned opinion in that case and affirm the judgment of the Tax Court on the basis of that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-24\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
