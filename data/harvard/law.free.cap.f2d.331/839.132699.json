The Board found that the Intervenor, The American Ship Building Company, by locking out employees upon the expiration of the existing contract and while negotiations for renewal were pending violated Sections 8(a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 61 Stat. 140 (1947), as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1) (3) (1958). We find no basis for disturbing the Board\u2019s conclusion that the issue presented to it was limited to the layoff of employees at the South Chicago plant; other charges were not involved. Cf. International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, AFL-CIO v. National Labor Relations Board, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 91, 289 F.2d 757 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">No. 18056 reaches us on the petition of the Labor Board for enforcement of the same order against The American Ship Building Company as respondent in No. 18056. American Ship Building contends that enforcement should be withheld because the Board\u2019s findings were inadequate<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and were not supported by substantial evidence, and because the lockout did not violate the Act in the circumstances found by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\"> The question presented initially is narrowly whether the record contains evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings. On the whole record, and allowing for the important place accorded to the Board\u2019s special experience, we conclude that the Board\u2019s finding that respondent had no reasonable basis for fearing a strike is not without the requisite record support. See Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). Respondent alternatively contends that in the circumstances shown here a lockout was permissible as a valid economic response in the collective bargaining process; the Board rejected this contention. \u201cThe ultimate problem is the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests. The function of striking that balance to effectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility which the Congress committed primarily to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to limited judicial review.\u201d National Labor Relations Board v. Truck Drivers Local No. 449, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, A.F.L., 353 U.S. 87, 96, 77 S.Ct. 643, 648, 1 L.Ed.2d 676 (1957). We find no basis for disturbing the Board\u2019s conclusions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-6\">. Although, the Board\u2019s findings did not spell out the coercive and discriminatory impact of the lockout on the rights of employees, we think this consequence is implicit and the omission of explicit findings does not warrant remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b892-13\">. The Board\u2019s Decision and Order are reported at 142 N.L.R.B. No. 173 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
