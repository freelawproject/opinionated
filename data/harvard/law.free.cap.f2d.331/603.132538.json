The District Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by an overwhelming preponderance of the evidence and his conclusions of law are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"A3W\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"aju-dedup-1\">The Court expresses its appreciation to Honorable John P. Sandidge and Honorable James A. Crumlin of the Louisville Bar, appointed counsel, who have ably and vigorously represented Appellant throughout the proceedings in the District Court and on the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
