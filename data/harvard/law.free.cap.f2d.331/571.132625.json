The libellants contend that the-District Court\u2019s fact-findings were \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d because they were the end result of the failure to apply proper legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-26\">Since the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are essential to our disposition they will be stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-27\">\u201cFINDINGS OF FACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_m\">\u201c1. Libelants, Joseph J. Fer-rante, Antonio Hroncich and Vito Salvemini, were on October 28, 1960, and now are residents of the State of New Jersey, and were injured while working as longshoremen employed by Nacirema Operating Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Inc. in the #2 hold of the M/S Mal-tesholm on October 28, 1960.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201c2. Claimant-respondent, Swedish American Lines, was and now is a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Kingdom of Sweden and was, on October 28, 1960, and still is, the owner of the M/S Maltesholm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">\u201c3. Respondent-Impleaded, Naci-rema Operating Co., Inc., was, on October 28, 1960, and now is, a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of one of the states of the United States and was on October 28, 1960, and still is, doing business in the State of New Jersey as a stevedore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201c4. -The M/S Maltesholm was on October 28, 1960, and now is, a merchant vessel of Swedish registry, her home port being Gothenburg, Sweden. The ship had six hatches, #2, the site of the accident, being in the forward part of the ship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201c5. Libelant Ferrante asked the stevedore hatch boss for slings to be used in unloading some plywood boards. In turn the hatch boss asked the third mate of the ship for \u2018slings.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">\u201c6. The third mate of the M/S Maltesholm procured and gave to the stevedore hatch boss two manila rope slings which the hatch boss then sent down to the employees of Nacirema, who proceeded to make up a sling load of plywood boards by assembling two piles of the boards side by side, these piles resting on 4 x 4 timbers so that each sling could be passed beneath the boards. Each sling was passed around the piles, one at each end, looped through itself and attached to a single hook. The hook was attached to wire rope runners which would lift the sling load from the hold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">\u201c7. The making up of this sling load was done entirely by and under the direction of employees of Respondent-Impleaded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-11\">8. The only suggestion made by the third mate to the hatch boss was not to make big sling loads \u2018because something might be could happen and broken,\u2019 to which the hatch boss replied \u201cI am the foreman and I know what I am doing.\u201d No attempt was made by the third mate to direct the method of unloading nor did he interfere in any way with the conduct of the stevedoring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">\u201c9. When the sling load of boards was lifted out of the hatch, the load came apart and some of the boards fell, striking Libelants and injuring them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-13\">\u201c10. Libelants\u2019 expert witness (with extensive experience as a longshoreman, as a supervisor of loading and unloading ships and as a ship foreman) testified that it was not standard procedure to make two piles of plywood boards, placed side by side to be lifted by slings, single piles only being used to make a sling load. He further testified that if this standard practice were not followed, it would be an element that would cause the load to fall. He also-testified that the use of either rope or wire is standard practice for lifting plywood, and that there was a preference for the use of rope on plywood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-14\">\u201c1. The accident was caused by the manner in which the sling load was made up by employees of Respondent-Impleaded with two piles, side by side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-15\">\u201c12. The duties of the third mate did not include supervision and control of the manner in which the longshoremen were doing their work. Rather, his duties consisted in pointing out the cargo to be discharged at Jersey City and also to observe the longshoremen so as to prevent damage to or theft of cargo, damage to the ship or smoking by the longshoremen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-16\">\u201c13. At the close of Libelant\u2019s case as to liability, Libelants having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>reserved their rights to introduce further medical testimony, Claimant-Respondent reserving its rights to proceed further if its motion be denied, moved to dismiss the libel and Respondent-Impleaded, with a similar reservation of rights if its motion be denied, moved to dismiss the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">\u201cCONCLUSIONS OF LAW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201c1. This Court has jurisdiction under Article III, Sec. 2 of the Constitution and under Title 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1333.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201c2. The M/S Maltesholm was seaworthy at the time of the accident causing Libelants\u2019 injuries because the ship\u2019s equipment, with which Libelants were working, was reasonably fit for its intended use. Mah-nich v. Southern S. S. Co. 321 U.S. 96, [64 S.Ct. 455, 88 L.Ed. 561] (1944); Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc. 362 U.S. 539 [, 80 S.Ct. 926, 4 L.Ed.2d 941] (1960).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201c3. In the absence of interference or assumption of authority by a ship\u2019s officers or crew, the responsibility for making up slingloads is on the stevedore, not the shipowner, 29 C.F.R. Secs. 9.2, 9.3, 9.81 and 9.82.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">\u201c4. The accident of October 28, 1960 was caused solely by the negligence of the stevedores, which negligence did not create an unsea-worthy condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">\u201c5. Absent the exercise of con-tool over the stevedoring operation, a shipowner is not responsible for the negligent manner in which stevedores conduct their work, nor for the negligent use by longshoremen of seaworthy appliances. <em>Billeci </em>v. United States, 298 F.2d 703 (9th Cir. 1962); Puddu v. Royal Netherlands S.S. Co., 303 F.2d 752, 2d Cir. February 20, 1962, affirmed in banc May 15, 1962.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">\u201c6. Absent liability upon the shipowner for an unseaworthy condition caused solely by the active negligence of the stevedoring company, there is no issue of indemnification of the shipowner by the stevedore company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">\u201c7. The libel should be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">It is evident from the foregoing that the District Court regarded as solely dispositive of the issue of the ship\u2019s negligence its fact-finding that the ship did not exercise control over the stevedore\u2019s negligent method in loading the slings.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">It is evident, too, that the District Court regarded as solely dispositive of the unseaworthiness issue the undisputed fact that the ship\u2019s equipment, viz., the manila ropes, \u201cwas reasonably fit for its intended use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">The facts as found by the District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"axi-dedup-1\">At the time of the accident the stevedore\u2019s longshoremen were engaged in discharging 9' x <em>5' </em>x %\" plywood boards from No. 2 hold of the M/S Maltesholm; the longshoremen used manila ropes supplied by the ship to form a sling in which two piles or stacks of board were placed; while a sling load was being lifted out of the hatch it came apart and some of the boards fell injuring the libellants; the placing of two piles of boards in a sling was not standard procedure; the loading of the slings \u201cwas done entirely by and under the direction\u201d of the stevedore ; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cthe accident was caused by the manner in which the sling load was made up\u201d;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the third mate of the ship, one Szewczyk, told the stevedore\u2019s foreman \u201cnot to make big sling loads \u2018because something might be could be happen and broken\u2019 \u201d, but \u201cno attempt was made by the third mate to direct the method of unloading nor did he interfere in any way with the conduct of the stevedoring.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALEQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>On the fact-findings stated the District Court held, in sum, in its Conclusions of Law, that the ship was seaworthy \u201cbecause the ship\u2019s equipment [manila ropes] * * was reasonably fit for its intended use\u201d; the loading method used by the stevedore was negligent but its negligence \u201cdid not create an unsea-worthy condition\u201d; the ship was not negligent because it did not exercise control over the stevedoring operation; that no issue of indemnification of the shipowner by the stevedore existed \u201cabsent liability upon the shipowner for an unsea-worthy condition caused solely by the active negligence of the stevedoring company\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"ajl-dedup-1\">First, as to the issue respecting negligence :</p>\n<p id=\"ayy-dedup-1\">Applicable to the issue of the ship\u2019s negligence are these well-settled principles:</p>\n<p id=\"anv-dedup-1\">\u201cThe work of loading and unloading is historically \u2018the work of the ship\u2019s service.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Afe\">Where a ship knows, or should have known, that the stevedore\u2019s method of discharging its cargo does not conform to the standard of reasonable care, and thereby creates a hazardous condition, the ship is negligent when it does not forbid the use of the method.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"azt-dedup-0\">Ordinarily, a ship owes a longshoreman the obligation to provide him with a safe place to work, and its failure to do so constitutes negligence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACS\">The District Court erred in failing to apply the foregoing principles and in making the \u201cexercise of control\u201d the exclusive criteria for testing the ship\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"auh-dedup-1\">The District Court\u2019s fact-findings that the ship\u2019s third mate (1) had told the stevedore\u2019s foreman not to make big sling loads \u201cbecause something might be could be happen\u201d and (2) had failed to \u201cinterfere in any way with the conduct of the stevedoring\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> required it to apply the principle that a ship is negligent when it knows of, and does not forbid the use of a stevedore\u2019s method of discharging cargo which fails to conform to the standard of reasonable care and creates a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>hazardous condition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The District Court\u2019s failure to apply the principle stated is reversible error. Knox v. United States Lines Company, 294 F.2d 354, 357 (3 Cir. 1961); Beard v. Eller-man Lines, Ltd., 289 F.2d 201, 206 (3 Cir. 1961), rev\u2019d on another issue, sub nom. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd., 369 U.S. 355, 82 S.Ct. 780, 7 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962) <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ase-dedup-0\">There remains for disposition the contention that the District Court failed to apply proper legal standards in premising its determination that the ship was not made unseaworthy by the stevedore\u2019s negligent conduct on the ground that the ship\u2019s equipment, viz., the manila ropes used in making up the slings, \u201cwas reasonably fit for its intended use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AiOC\">Libellants contend that the sub-standard constructed draft \u2014 assembling two piles or tiers of plywood boards 2% to 3 feet high <em>side by side </em>\u2014 when placed in the slings created defective equipment for use in discharging the cargo and that under the doctrine of Rogers v. United States Lines, 347 U.S. 984, 74 S.Ct. 849, 98 L.Ed. 1120 (1954) and Alaska Steamship Co., Inc. v. Petterson, 347 U.S. 396, 74 S.Ct. 601, 98 L.Ed. 798 (1954) the vessel became unseaworthy. In the cases cited it was held that when a stevedore brings aboard ship defective equipment which causes an accident the ship is made unseaworthy. Libellants urge that no valid distinction can be made between a stevedore\u2019s use of defective equipment which he brings aboard the ship and his fashioning of defective equipment to perform his work after he arrives aboard ship.</p>\n<p id=\"AjCR\">The ship and the stevedore dispute this contention and say in substance that the stevedore\u2019s negligent use of the ship\u2019s fit equipment does not make the ship unseaworthy. They cite in support of their view Puddu v. Royal Netherlands Steamship Company, 303 F.2d 752 (2 Cir. 1962), cert. den. 371 U.S. 840, 83 S.Ct. 67, 9 L.Ed.2d 75;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Billeci v. United States, 298 F.2d 703 (9 Cir. 1962);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Arena v. Luckenbach Steamship Company Inc., 279 F.2d 186 (1 Cir. 1960), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>den. 364 U.S. 895, 81 S.Ct. 222, 5 L.Ed.2d 189.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKq\">In Crumady v. The Joachim Hendrik Fisser, 249 F.2d 818, 820-821 (1957), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 358 U.S. 423, 79 S.Ct. 445, 3 L.Ed.2d 413 (1959) <footnotemark>15</footnotemark>, we held, on our fact-finding that the ship\u2019s equipment was not unseaworthy prior to its negligent use by the stevedore, that the stevedore\u2019s negligence did not make the ship unseaworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"AiP\">Four years later, in Knox v. United States Lines Company, we remanded for trial \u201cthe issue of possible unseaworthiness caused by the [stevedore\u2019s] manner of breaking down the stowage.\u201d In doing so we referred to Holley v. The Manfred Stansfield, 186 F.Supp. 212 (D.C.E.D. Va.1960) as \u201ca case not significantly different from the present case.\u201d 294 F.2d 358, 359. In Holley it was held that a ship became unseaworthy when a longshoreman negligently created an overhang of solidified potash which later fell and killed him.</p>\n<p id=\"A3J3\">In Knox there had been a jury finding that the stowage was seaworthy <em>prior </em>to the commencement of the stevedore\u2019s breaking-down operation; here it is undisputed that the ship\u2019s equipment \u2014 \u25a0 the manila ropes \u2014 was fit for its intended use. Unless a valid distinction can be drawn between a stevedore\u2019s unsafe<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> breaking-down of a seaworthy stowage and its negligent (unsafe) use of a ship\u2019s equipment, a logical projection of our holding in Knox would seem to indicate our subscription to the view that a stevedore\u2019s negligent or unsafe use of a ship\u2019s seaworthy equipment makes the ship un-seaworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"A41D\">It compels notation that the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Scott v. Isbrandtsen Company, Inc., 327 F.2d 113 (1964) has construed Knox as holding that a longshoreman\u2019s negligent method of discharging cargo makes the ship unseaworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"A9p\">In Scott it was said (327 F.2d pp. 125-126):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad8\">\u201cIn this circuit it is no longer open to question that evidence of the negligence of the longshoremen themselves in the performance of the ship\u2019s work and <em>in their method of operation </em>may present a factual issue as to whether an unseaworthy condition is created for which the shipowner may be held liable for injury to a longshoreman resulting from such condition. This is true even though the condition be transitory and without knowledge of the ship\u2019s officers. Furthermore, contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, in determining unseaworthiness no significance attaches to the fact that no one complained of the alleged unsafe condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>It is interesting to observe that in Scott the Court noted (327 F.2d p. 124):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aef-dedup-0\">\u201cThe obvious trend of the Supreme Court decisions is toward providing ever increasing protection for crewmen, longshoremen and even others employed by independent contractors who may be called upon to work aboard vessels.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_Bk\">The Supreme Court has not yet spoken on the precise question as to whether a stevedore's negligence in' the use of ship\u2019s seaworthy equipment makes the ship un-seaworthy but doctrinal trends evidenced in its decisions since Seas Shipping Co., Inc. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946) indicate that it would answer the question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"aa0-dedup-0\">In Reed v. The Yaka, 373 U.S. 410, p. 413, 83 S.Ct. 1349, p. 1352, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963), the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASyn\">\u201cIn Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, [66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099] (1946), we held that a shipowner\u2019s warranty of seaworthiness extended to a longshoreman injured while loading the ship, even though the longshoreman was employed by an independent contractor. In doing so, we noted particularly the hazards of marine service, the helplessness of the men to ward off the perils of unseaworthiness, the harshness of forcing them to shoulder their losses alone, and the broad range of the \u2018humanitarian policy\u2019 of the doctrine of seaworthiness * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAi-\">In Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, p. 549, 80 S.Ct. 926, p. 932, 4 L.Ed.2d 941 (1960), the Court after quoting extensively from Sieracki said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aj--dedup-0\">\u201cFrom that day to this, the decisions of this Court have undeviatingly reflected an understanding that the owner\u2019s duty to furnish a seaworthy ship is absolute and completely independent of his duty under the Jones Act to exercise reasonable care.

In <em>Puddu, a </em>stevedore was injured when a boom, part of the ship\u2019s equipment, buckled and broke. The District Court found that the ship was seaworthy on the gi'ound that the boom itself was non-defective and the accident was occasioned solely by the negligent conduct of the stevedores in placing \u201cunusual and dangerous stress on the boom.\u201d Implicit in the Second Circuit\u2019s affirmance of this finding on the ground that it was not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d is the holding that a stevedore\u2019s negligence does not make a ship unseaworthy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"Azs\">. In Billed a winch fell out of a gear and became free-wheeling, due to the negligence of stevedores, causing a hatch section which had been raised but a few feet to simultaneously drop and swing to the port side where it skidded along the structure of the ship until it struck the libellant. Faced with this factual pattern the Ninth Circuit held 298 F.2d at pages 705, 706: \u201c[T]he shipowner\u2019s warranty of seaworthiness does not extend to a negligent use by longshoremen of seaworthy appliances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"AgZk\">. In Arena a longshoreman was injured when a loading board tipped and spilled rolls of paper into the hold of the ship. It was contended on appeal from the District Court\u2019s direction of verdict in defendant\u2019s favor that the board was used by stevedores in an unsafe manner and that this alone rendered the ship un-seaworthy. The First Circuit rejected this argument, holding among other things that \u201cthe board was not defective simply because the longshoremen who loaded it neglected to do so in a proper fashion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"avz-dedup-0\">. The Supreme Court reversed on the ground that the District Court\u2019s fact-finding that the ship\u2019s equipment was unsea-worthy prior to its use by the stevedore was not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d, and that the stevedore\u2019s negligence \u201cdid no more than to bring into play the unseaworthy condition of the vessel.\u201d 358 U.S. 427, 79 S.Ct. 445, 448, 3 L.Ed.2d 413.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"ALYW\">.
