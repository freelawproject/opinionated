They may be prepared by the polymerization of anhydrous formaldehyde or by the polymerization of trioxane which is a cyclic trimer of formaldehyde. Polyoxymethylene varies in thermal stability and in molecular weight, depending on its method of preparation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atyn\">***** *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlGW\">\u201cAlthough polyoxymethylenes prepared by some methods are much more stable against thermal degradation than those prepared by other methods, it is nevertheless desirable for many uses that the thermal stability be increased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\u201cIt has been found in accordance with this invention that polyoxy-methylenes may be <em>stabilized against thermal degradation by reaction with isocyanates </em>and preferably with compounds containing two or more isocyanate groups.

The polyoxymethylene may be in the form of finely divided solid particles, as in a slurry, but for best results the polyoxymethylene and the isocyanates are dissolved in a common solvent. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ag4-dedup-0\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a-l-dedup-0\">\u201cThe temperature of the reaction is suitably at least about 20 \u00b0C. and preferably from about 140\u00b0 to about 180\u00b0C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a2q-dedup-0\">Appellant\u2019s examples disclose comparative tests in which samples of both untreated polyoxymethylene and polyoxy-methylene treated with isocyanate are subjected to temperatures conventional for molding operations. Decomposition rate data show greater thermal stability for the treated material.</p>\n<p id=\"amu-dedup-0\">Claims 1-4 are drawn to composition, 5-14 to method.

In reciting the objects of the invention the patent states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"are-dedup-1\">\u201cAnother object is the preparation of high molecular weight polymers of formaldehyde of reduced brittleness, <em>little or no tendency to decom-poke at their melting points, </em>and of good flow characteristics at mould-ing temperatures. A still further object is the preparation of tough, <em>unusually stable, </em>polymers of formaldehyde.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWlH\">The patent further says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A04\">\u201cThe resultant polymer melts in the 165-175 \u00b0C. range. It shows a <em>greater thermal stability than formaldehyde polymers prepared in the absence of isocyanates and aliphatic acylethenone, </em>decomposing only slowly up to 200 \u00b0C., whereas formaldehyde polymers prepared similarly but without the aliphatic acyl ketene, as hereinbefore defined, and isocya-nate decompose rapidly even at temperatures as low as 175\u00b0C.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ag--dedup-0\">The quantity of isocyanate and ketene used depends upon their molecular weights, the patent stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1td\">\u201cThe isocyanate or isothiocyanate is used in relatively small amounts between 0.01-2.0 mole per cent, of the formaldehyde employed. The exact amount of isocyanate is dependent upon its molecular weight, 2 \u2014 4 iso-cyanate groups to each thousand formaldehyde molecules generally being most effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcV8\">The function of isocyanate in the polymerization process is said to be as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyIU\">\u201cAlthough the exact manner in which these modifying agents [iso-cyanates and ketenes] function is not known, it is believed that <em>one or both </em>of these modifying agents facilitate the formation of stable, high molecular weight formaldehyde polymers both by removing impurities and <em>by reacting with the terminal methylol groups of the polymer.\u201d </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG2l\">British 748,856 (hereinafter \u2019856 &gt; deals with stabilizing formaldehyde polymers</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5F1\">\u201c * * * by incorporating certain stabilizing agents therein, namely:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"anq-dedup-2\">\u201c(a) hydrazines, substituted hy-drazines or hydrazides,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9DP\">\u201c(b) secondary or tertiary monomeric aromatic amines,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE8S\">\u201c(c) phenols or substituted phenols, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHJx\">\u201c(d) ureas, thioureas and their-substitution products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjPU\">vf -a* -Jr w</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"af4-dedup-0\">\u201cThe stabilizing agent is added in an amount of not more than 10% of the weight of the polymer, a preferred range being from 0.1% to. 5%.

The types of compound used for this .stabilizing purpose are quite diverse. They have, with the exception of one \u2022class of compounds (the phenols) one thing in common; each class contain [sic] nitrogen atoms bonded to \u2022carbon atoms. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayb-dedup-2\">\u201cIt is not deemed inventive to add to this list of -N-C compounds, still .another type \u2014 namely the isocya-nates, especially since the earlier British patent, (557,873), already teaches the use of isocyanates in polyformaldehyde resin compositions, wherein a thermally-stable polyformaldehyde resin composition is produced from formaldehyde, or from \u2018depolymerized\u2019 polymers of formaldehyde.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amu-dedup-1\">'The board affirmed the examiner saying .\u25a0simply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APFa\">\u201cBritish Patent No. 557,873 indicates that one or more of the modifying agents [isocyanates and ketenes] facilitate the formation of thermally stable, high molecular weight formaldehyde polymers. <em>The patent clearly indicates that the isocyanate reacts with the terminal methylol groups of the polymer. </em>For the reasons indicated above, as well as those set forth in the Examiner\u2019s Answer, we conclude that the appealed claims are not patentable over the references.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhnD\">The gist of appellant\u2019s arguments before this court regarding the rejection of claims 1-14, which we take to be an obviousness rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, is that the examiner\u2019s above-quoted statement concerning -N-C compounds is erroneous and displays a \u201cwoeful ignorance of elementary organic chemistry\u201d; that compounds (a) to (d), supra, <em>in </em>\u2019856 are \u201cdiverse classes of compounds,\u201d functioning in various ways as stabilizers and certainly do not suggest isocyanates as stabilizers; that the statement in \u2019873 that isocyanates stabilize polyoxymethylene \u201cby reacting with the terminal methylol groups of the polymer\u201d is \u201cspeculative\u201d and \u201cvague and uncertain\u201d; that \u2019873 employs as stabilizers isocyanates and ketenes <em>together </em>and there is \u201cno teaching * * * that either of these compounds is effective by itself\u201d; and that the reaction conditions in \u2019873 are such that one does not obtain a product of isocyanate with \u201cnormally solid resinous polyoxymethylene\u201d as required by appellant\u2019s claims 1 and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"aaye-dedup-0\">Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s arguments, we find no reversible error in the board\u2019s decision. In our view, the British patents considered together clearly teach one skilled in the art (1) that iso-cyanates stabilize polyoxymethylene, at least in part, by reacting with terminal methylol groups and (2) that such stabilization occurs when isocyanate is mixed with formaldehyde <em>before </em>polymerization or <em>after </em>formation of polyoxymethylene. Appellant appears to have confirmed the teachings of the art but in so doing, in our opinion, has done nothing unobvious.</p>\n<p id=\"A68-\">While we do not agree with the examiner that the four classes of stabilizers listed in \u2019856 render obvious <em>per se </em>an analogous use of isocyanates, we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>with the board that such use is obvious in view of patent \u2019873 which \u201cclearly indicates that the isocyanate reacts with the terminal methylol groups of the [polyoxymethylene] polymer.\u201d In our opinion, such teaching, in view of the later teaching in \u2019856 that <em>preformed </em>polyoxymethylene may be stabilized against \u201cend-attack\u201d thermal degradation, renders appellant\u2019s process and product obvious \u25a0 within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"aze-dedup-1\">For reasons above stated, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"azo-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AXQ-\">.
