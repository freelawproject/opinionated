His contention is based upon the fact that counsel failed to object to the admission of an allegedly coerced confession and to subpoena witnesses and offer their evidence to support his client\u2019s contention. This would raise serious issues but for the fact that the district court sitting without a jury specifically rejected the confession, stating that the substance of the confession was not considered in arriving at the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"Af_\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
