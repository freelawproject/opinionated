The plaintiff claims under a deed which, unquestionably, conveyed to his predecessor in title a tract adjoining the land in dispute. He points to some words in the deed which might include the tract in dispute as well as the tract clearly intended to be conveyed. The District Judge, however, did not so construe the deed. He held that if the language upon which the plaintiff relies is inconsistent with the deed\u2019s reference to the remote grantor\u2019s source of title, the later reference discloses the specific intention of the parties and is controlling notwithstanding the earlier language susceptible of a broader construction. The District Judge concluded that the deed to the plaintiff\u2019s immediate predecessor in title did not give his predecessor color of title to the land in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">After full consideration of the briefs and the argument of counsel, we conclude that the District Judge properly decided the threshold question. We, therefore, affirm for the reasons stated by him in support of his conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor had no color of title to the disputed land.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-14\">.
