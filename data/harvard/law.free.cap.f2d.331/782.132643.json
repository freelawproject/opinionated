The CATVs can relay to their subscribers, through microwave radio facilities, programs from distant television stations which duplicate the programs broadcast by local stations. While a CATV operation is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, its use of microwave facilities must be licensed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-22\">On December 14, 1962, the Federal Communications Commission gave notice of proposed making of rules to govern the grant of licenses for microwave radio stations serving CATV systems, and to permit authorizations in this service only (a) if the CATV system carries the signal of any existing or subsequently constructed local television station, and (b) if the CATV system does not duplicate any program carried by the local station, either simultaneously or 30 days before or after. It was announced that applications for such microwave authorizations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>would not be acted upon during the pend-ency of the-rule making proceeding unless the applicants agreed to accept authorizations containing conditions (a) and (b) above described.</p>\n<p id=\"A-ZC\">T 00 lnc9 +t,. On January 22, 1963, Wentronics, the , \u201e \u201e , j. \u2022 operator of a CATV. system m Casper, Wyoming, filed with the Commission ap-plieations for modification of its three microwave radio authorizations to permit a second channel of service on which it proposed to carry the signals of a Denver television station. In an accompanying letter, Wentronics stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXO-\">\u201c* * * Wentronics, Inc., hereby gives notice in response to paragraph 7 of the Commission\u2019s \u2018Notice of Proposed Rule Making\u2019 in Docket No. 14895 that, in order to obtain a grant of these applications, it accepts the conditions described in paragraph 5 of that notice and that in operating this requested channel, when approved, such operation shall be pursuant to those conditions or with any other rules eventually adopted in this microwave service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aesc\">\u201e ...... The foregoing is without preju- ,. , ,,, , . , r \u2022 t . dice to Wentromc s [stc] rights to participate in the rulemaking procedure and to raise every legal objection to the adoption of the proposed rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK5e\">On May 27, 1963, the Commission granted the applications subject to the following conditions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajb-dedup-1\">^ \u201cIf the CATV system operates in an area within the predicted Grade A contour of any television broadcast station in operation, or which subsequently comes into operation, the CATV system must not duplicate simultaneously or 30 days <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>prior or subsequent thereto a program broadcast by such television broadcast station, provided the CATV operator has received at least 30 days advance notification from the broadcast station licensee of the date of such broadcast. Further, if requested by such television station, the CATV system must carry the signal of such station without any material deg- . ,, radation m quality,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"agz-dedup-2\">Wentronics petitioned for r\u2019econsideration of its grants, saying it had not understood that the non-duplication condition would apply to all its operations as well as that covered by the applications for modification. It asked, however, for' the complete elimination of the non-duplication condition. In denying this, the Commission said <em>inter aha:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"axy-dedup-1\"><em>\u201c * </em>* * As we have stated, the circumstances are that the condition is an interim measure pending conelusion of the rule making proceeding, designed to accommodate those applicants who voluntarily accept them in order that they may obtain grants before the conclusion of the proceeding. Acceptance of the interim condition will not preclude or prejudice any changes which may flow from further action by the Com- . . . , . mission m the rule making proceeds <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhTD\">y\u00b0u no* wish to retain the Srants in question, as now conditioned, you may return them to the Commission for cancellation and your applications therefor will be returned to pending status.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"akt-dedup-1\">This appeal is from the Commission\u2019s refusal to delete the above quoted condition from the authorizations.</p>\n<p id=\"A4XK\"> It should be noted that, as the proposed rules have not been adopted, their validity is not in issue here, and that the freeze pending rule making, which the Commission had the undoubted right to order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is still in effect. In order to obtain exemption from the freeze order, Wentronics voluntarily agreed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>conditions imposed by; the Commission. If it misunderstood those conditions, Wentronics may return the grants for cancellation and continue its CATV operations as before, free of the non-duplication condition; but it cannot retain the grants and be relieved of the conditions to which it\" agreed in order to obtain them.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-15\">. The Commission has described a community antenna as \u201ca receiving antenna located on a high elevation so as to receive signals to best advantage, and wire lines whereby the signals received are transmitted to the receiving sets of the subscribers in the community, together with necessary amplifying equipment and sometimes equipment to \u2018converf the signal from the channel on which it is received to another channel at which it appears on the' subscriber\u2019s set.\u201d CATV and <em>TV Repeater Services, </em>26 F.C.C. 403, 407 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"arz-dedup-0\">.
