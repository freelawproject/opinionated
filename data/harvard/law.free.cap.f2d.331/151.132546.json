Concurrent sentences of ten years imprisonment were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-27\">Each count of each indictment charged a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2314. Count I of case No. 4-63 Cr. 21, which is typical of all counts, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-28\">\u201cThat on or about the 27th day of September, 1962, at the City of Minneapolis, County of Hennepin, State and District of Minnesota,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-29\">FRANKLIN BRUCE STREETT, aka FOREST WADE, aka WES STEVENS,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-30\">did, with unlawful and fraudulent intent, cause to be transported in interstate commerce from Minneap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>olis, Minnesota, to New York, New York, a falsely made and forged security, to wit: \u2018N.C.B. Traveler\u2019s Check\u2019 No. 025-776-005, dated September 27, 1962, in the amount of $100.00, payable to Dr. M. A. Van Etta, signed Forest Wade and countersigned Forest Wade, and drawn on The First National City Bank of New York, knowing the same to have been falsely made and forged; in violation of Section 2314, Title 18 United States Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The other counts each involve a separate traveler\u2019s check varying in amount from $20 to $100. It is undisputed that each traveler\u2019s cheek was a genuine traveler\u2019s cheek drawn on The First National City Bank of New York; that such checks were purchased at a North Carolina bank by Forest Wade; that the traveler\u2019s checks were issued and delivered to Wade and that his genuine signature was placed upon each check at the appropriate place at the top of such check prior to delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Based upon well-established principles that the .evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the Government since the Government prevailed in the trial court, the evidence clearly establishes that Streett stole the traveler\u2019s cheeks from Wade at Rome, Georgia; that Streett took the cheeks with him to Minneapolis; that he forged the countersignature \u201cForest Wade\u201d upon each of such traveler\u2019s checks; that he received the full value of each check from the various persons who cashed said checks; that Streett knew such cheeks were stolen; that he knew the countersignature on each check was forged; that he knew the instrumentalities of interstate commerce would be used in transporting the checks from Minneapolis to New York for payment; and that all such acts were done with an unlawful and fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Title 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2314 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">\u201cWhoever transports in interstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">\u201cWhoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transports or causes to be transported, or induces any person to travel in, or to be transported in interstate commerce in the execution or concealment of a scheme or artifice to defraud that person of money or property having a value of $5,000 or more; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-11\">\u201cWhoever, with unlawful or fraudulent intent, transports in interstate or foreign commerce any falsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited securities or tax stamps, knowing the same to have been falsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-12\">\u201cWhoever, with unlawful or fraudulent intent, transports in interstate or foreign commerce, any tool, implement, or thing used or fitted to be used in falsely making, forging, altering, or counterfeiting any security, or tax stamps, or any part thereof \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-13\">\u201cShall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-14\"><em>\u201c </em>* * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">This appeal is based upon defendant\u2019s contention that the facts of this case show a forged endorsement of a genuine traveler\u2019s check rather than a forged security and that such forged endorsement was not included in the prohibition of paragraph 3 of \u00a7 2314. Such contention was raised in the trial court by motion to dismiss indictment and by motion for acquittal, which motions were overruled. Except for the monetary requirement of $5,000 there appears to be no question concerning the applicability of the first paragraph of \u00a7 2314. However, such paragraph does not apply as the se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>curities did not reach $5,000 in value. Hence, the Government must bring this case under paragraph 3 within the statutory language, \u201cfalsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited securities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The indictment narrows the field down to falsely made and forged securities. These terms have been defined and distinguished by the court in Pines v. United States, 8 Cir., 123 F.2d 825, 828, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\u201cManifestly, the words \u2018altering\u2019 and \u2018counterfeiting\u2019 could refer only to a crime based upon a preexisting genuine instrument. Forgery, however, does not necessarily carry such presumption but indicates that there is a genuine or real obligor in existence whdse obligation has been simulated. To \u2018falsely make\u2019 is a crime not of changing or forming an instrument to resemble an existing genuine instrument or to represent that it is the act of a genuine and existing obligor, but rather to make an instrument which has no original as such and no genuine maker whose work is copied, although in form it may resemble a type of recognized security.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Thus it is apparent that the real issue is whether the traveler\u2019s checks here involved are forged securities within the meaning of such term as it is used in \u00a7 2314.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The Government contends that the acts of forgery committed by the defendant in placing the countersignature upon the traveler\u2019s checks were the very acts necessary to make them negotiable, and since the countersignature was not that of the purchaser, the checks were therefore forged securities. On the other hand, defendant argues that only the endorsement was forged, not the security itself which was complete prior to the countersignature, and that forged endorsements are not included within the coverage of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The distinction between a forged security and a forged endorsement was recognized by this court in Gesell v. United States, 8 Cir., 1 F.2d 283, and Lewis v. United States, 8 Cir., 8 F.2d 849, and later by the Supreme Court in Prussian v. United States, 282 U.S. 675, 51 S.Ct. 223, 75 L.Ed. 610. In the Prussian case the defendant had been indicted under \u00a7\u00a729 and 148 of the Criminal Code for forging the endorsement on a United States Treasury Draft. As evidenced by the following quotation, \u00a7 148, which is now 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 471, contained language very similar to the relevant phrase in \u00a7 2314, to wit, \u201cfalsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited securities.\u201d In interpreting such language, the court in Prussian states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">\u201cUnder section 14\u00a7, \u2018whoever, with intent to defraud, shall falsely make, forge, counterfeit, or alter any obligation or other security of the United States,\u2019 is guilty of a criminal offense. Section 147 provides: \u2018The words \u201cobligation or other security of the United States\u201d shall be held to mean all * * * checks, or drafts for money, drawn by or upon authorized officers of the United States.\u2019 It is apparent that the draft drawn on the Treasurer by an authorized officer is an \u2018obligation * * * of the United States\u2019 both in common parlance and by the express definition of section 147. But to extend the meaning of that phrase so as to embrace the indorsement on the government draft is to enlarge the statutory definition, and would be possible only by a strained construction of the language of sections 147 and 148, inadmissible in the interpretation of criminal statutes, which must be strictly construed. See Fasulo v. United States, 272 U.S. 620, 47 S.Ct. 200, 71 L.Ed. 443; United States v. Salen, 235 U.S. 237, 35 S.Ct. 51, 59 L.Ed. 210.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-15\">\u201cThe writing described in the indictment, when issued by the drawer, was a check or a draft. The added indorsement was in itself neither a check nor a draft. We need not stop to consider the argument advanced that the obligation upon the draft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>does not become complete until it is indorsed, see Hamil v. United States, supra, p. 371 for it overlooks the circumstance that the meaning of \u2018obligation\u2019 in section 148 is narrowed by the definition in section 147 to specifically enumerated written instruments, including checks or drafts for money, which are complete, as such, within the statutory definition and in common understanding, at least when issued to the payee by an authorized officer of the government. The indorsement was at most the purported obligation of the indorser, not of the United States, and a purported transfer of the title of the draft to the indorsee. In neither aspect was \u25a0the indorsement itself an obligation of the United States as defined by section 147, or such a part of the draft as to constitute the forging of the indorsement a forgery of the draft.\u201d 282 U.S. 675, 677-678, 51 S.Ct. 223, 224, 225, 75 L.Ed. 610.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">After holding that the endorsement was not part of the security and therefore not within \u00a7 148, the Court upheld the conviction by construing the forged endorsement as falling within \u00a7 29\u2019s (now \u00a7 495\u2019s) catch-all phrase \u201cother writing, for the purpose of obtaining or receiving * * * from the United States * * * any sum of money.\u201d A comparable catch-all phrase does not exist for non-governmental transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The Government attempts to explain away the applicability of the Prussian case by asserting that the sole reason why the forgery was not covered under \u00a7 148 was because the endorsement was not an obligation of the United States which was intended to be protected, but rather was merely the obligation of the person whose signature was forged \u2014 an individual \u2014 who was not intended to be protected. However, this appears to be too restrictive an interpretation of the Court\u2019s reasoning. The Court clearly held that the endorsement was not \u201csuch a part of the draft as to constitute the forging of the indorsement a forgery of' the draft.\u201d 282 U.S. 675, 678, 51 S.Ct. 223, 224, 75 L.Ed. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">The reasoning of the Prussian case has. been recognized in many subsequent cases. See Danielson v. United States, 9 Cir., 321 F.2d 441; Rogers v. United States, 5 Cir., 304 F.2d 520 (dissenting opinion) ; United States v. Henderson, 7 Cir., 298 F.2d 522; Carr v. United States, 6 Cir., 278 F.2d 702; Webster v. United States, 8 Cir., 59 F.2d 583. The government objects to the relevance of these cases in that they all are concerned with the protection of the United States\u2019' securities. Nevertheless, the objective being sought here is to discover the scope-of \u00a7 2314, and authoritative court interpretations of a statute bearing strikingly similar language would appear to be pertinent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">The legislative history supports the interpretation of the statute urged by defendant. Section 2314 has its origin in the National Stolen Property Act of May 22, 1934, ch. 333, 48 Stat. 794. As originally enacted, the statute did not extend to interstate transportation of forged securities, but only to interstate transportation of, <em>inter alia, </em>stolen securities of the value of $5,000 or more, if 1 of \u00a7 2314. Paragraph 3 extending coverage to \u201cfalsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited\u201d securities, regardless of value, was added in the amendment of August 3, 1939, ch. 413, \u00a7 1, 53 Stat. 1178, eight years after the Supreme Court had held in Prussian that such language does not cover forged endorsements.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">The report on the amendment by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, S. Rept.No.674, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. (1939), was a two page document incorporating and consisting mostly of two letters from the Attorney General. The second letter, dated May 5, 1939, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">\u201cThe principal purposes of the pending bill are to extend the existing law to property that has been embezzled, and also to forged or counterfeited securities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u201cStudies of the desirability of extending this legislation to the transportation of forged or counterfeited securities in interstate or foreign commerce have led the Department to the conclusion that in respect to such eases the minimum amount of $5,000 serves no purpose, and that accordingly, it would be best to provide that such transportation be a criminal offense irrespective of the value of the forged, or counterfeited certificates. The reasons leading to this conclusion are that criminals who engage in forging or counterfeiting certificates do not ordinarily subject themselves to the hazards involved in such a nefarious undertaking, except for the purpose of multiplying the forged certificates on a large scale. <em>For example, while a single act of transportation may perhaps involve a forged traveler\u2019s check of a small denomination or a forged stock certificate for a few shares, the probability is that the person who manufactured the plate from which the traveler\u2019s check or certificate was printed produced a large number of duplicates of the same fraudulent document. </em>Otherwise, it would not have been worth while for him to go to the trouble and expense of purchasing the necessary tools and engraving the plate employed in accomplishing his criminal purpose. It would appear therefore, that the transportation of this type of contraband articles is entirely different from the transportation of stolen property.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Such legislative history indicates an intention to extend the coverage of \u00a7 2314 in order to prohibit the actual false making or reproducing of the securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The Government\u2019s reliance upon United States v. Sheridan, 329 U.S. 379, 67 S.Ct. 332, 91 L.Ed. 359, is misplaced. While it is true Sheridan holds that paragraph 3 of \u00a7 2314 reaches small as well as large makers of forged instruments as is evidenced by the absence of the $5000 limitation, the securities there involved were checks and the Court found that the checks themselves (not just the endorsements) were forged and hence the forged checks clearly fell within the statutory description.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Congress could unquestionably have broadened the statute to cover forged endorsements. Congress has not expressly covered forged endorsements of genuine securities in the statute. The language of paragraph 3 is practically identical with that interpreted in Prussian. The interpretation problem confronting us here so clearly resembles that present in Prussian and the numerous Courts of Appeal cases including our own reaching the same result, that we feel the reasoning of such eases controls the result here. If Congress had desired to cover forged endorsements, it could easily have said so. As stated in Prussian, \u201cBut to extend the meaning of that phrase so as to embrace the indorsement on the government draft is to enlarge the statutory definition, and would be possible only by a strained construction of the language * * *, inadmissible in the interpretation of criminal statutes, which must be strictly construed.\u201d 282 U.S. 675, 677, 51 S.Ct. 223, 224, 75 L.Ed. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">It cannot be seriously questioned that the traveler\u2019s checks were complete as securities prior to the forged countersigning, as was the government draft in Prussian. It was established by this court in Pines v. United States, 8 Cir., 123 F.2d 825, that traveler\u2019s checks are complete as securities prior to the countersigning. The defendant in that case was convicted under Title 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 415, the forerunner of \u00a7 2314, for transporting in interstate commerce traveler\u2019s checks issued from a fictitious bank. This court stated at p. 828 of 123 F.2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">\u201cAs to the Travelers Cheques it is contended that they were not complete ; hence, could not be unlawfully transported. A Travelers Cheque has the characteristics of a cashier\u2019s check of the issuing bank. As said by us in Mellon Nat. Bank v. Citizens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Bank &amp; Trust Co., 8 Cir., 88 F.2d 128, 132.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">\u201c \u2018It is a bill of exchange drawn by the issuing bank upon itself and is accepted by the act of issuance, and the right of countei'mand as applied to ordinary cheques does not exist as to it.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">\u201cThe purported Travelers Cheques alleged to be fictitious were payable to order when countersigned by Joseph L. Lewis, whose signature purported to appear on them. As the obligation created by the issuance of a Travelers Cheque is complete as against the bank when issued, even though requiring the signature of the one to whom issued, it constituted a security within the purview of the statute because falsely made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The Government argues that since Pines held that the traveler\u2019s checks in that case were covered by \u00a7 415, that case cannot be used as authority for holding that the checks in the instant case are not securities within the statutory meaning. However, the clear holding of the Pines case is that the checks came within the purview of the statute not because of the lack of genuineness of the obligation or because of forgery, but because the obligation itself, although a completed security, was falsely made. This distinction between a \u201cfalsely made\u201d security and a \u201cforged\u201d security was recently recognized in Stinson v. United States, 5 Cir., 316 F.2d 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">United States v. Petti, 2 Cir., 168 F.2d 221, supports defendant\u2019s position that the traveler\u2019s check is a complete security. The traveler\u2019s checks there involved had been stolen from an American Express Company office and had not been signed by the purchaser. The court held such checks to be securities. The case for traveler\u2019s checks in our present case to constitute securities is much stronger as we here have the additional factors that the checks were purchased and paid for and the first signature of the purchaser was properly affixed to the checks at time of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Both defendant and the Government rely upon dictum in Rowley v. United States, 8 Cir., 191 F.2d 949, where the traveler\u2019s cheeks which had been stolen from a bank to which they had been issued came into defendant\u2019s possession without a signature or countersignature of a payee. The Government cites the case for stating that a federal offense under the pertinent paragraph of \u00a7 2314 was charged and for defining forgery as \u201cThe fraudulent making or alteration of a writing to the prejudice of another man\u2019s rights.\u201d 191 F.2d 949, 950. Defendant relies upon the following language to show there was here involved a completed instrument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">\u201cThe obligation created by the issuance of the cheques as against the bank issuing them was complete when the checks were issued even though they required the signature of the one to whom issued and they constituted a security within the purview of the statute.\u201d 191 F.2d 949, 950.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">The argument that it could not be a forged security if completed prior to the forgery was not presented before the court. But whatever import this case might have is negated by the fact that the defendant pleaded guilty and failed to appeal. This court affirmed the lower court\u2019s denial of a motion to vacate sentence on the procedural ground that after conviction a sentence is not open to collateral attack based upon a defective information or indictment except for exceptional circumstances not here present.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">The Government also relies upon Berry v. United States, 5 Cir., 271 F.2d 775. The facts of this case are somewhat incomplete since neither the statute nor the amount of the traveler\u2019s check is mentioned, although the indictment referred to \u201cfalsely made and forged security,\u201d and evidently, the defendant had forged the countersignature. The court states on p. 777 of 271 F.2d;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">\u201c[W]hat is in question here is not an ordinary check but a travelers check which, though it requires for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>negotiation the signature of the person- to whom it is issued, is, when issued and signed by the payee, complete against, and cannot be countermanded by, the issuer. Pines v. United States, 8 Cir., 123 F.2d 825. Such cheeks are cash, not upon the credit of the persons negotiating them but upon the credit of the issuer and the correspondence of the endorsement of the negotiator with the signature on the face of the instrument. In the case, therefore, of such instruments, the first negotiator, if not the person to whom the check was issued, is necessarily a forger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Again the argument relied upon by the defendant in the instant case was not presented before the court. There is no dispute over the conclusion that the defendant is a forger within the meaning of common law \u2014 only that this was not a forged security under the paragraph in question of \u00a7 2314.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">To summarize, it is our view that the traveler\u2019s checks involved were complete genuine securities at the time that they came into the hands of the defendant. While it is absolutely clear that defendant wrongfully forged the signature of Forest Wade upon each traveler\u2019s check, \u00a7 2314 does not reach forged endorsements but only reaches forged securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">There is abundant evidence to support defendant\u2019s guilt of many unlawful acts including larceny and forgery of endorsements. However, we conclude with considerable reluctance that the defendant\u2019s guilt of transporting a forged security in violation of \u00a7 2314 is not established by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">We express our appreciation to Mr. Forslund who served as court-appointed counsel for his competent representation of the defendant on this appeal and for his excellent written brief and oral argument made upon behalf of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b209-10\">RIDGE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A0_\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"ABZ\">Because I believe that one who forges the \u201ccountersignature\u201d of the payee named in a \u201ctraveler\u2019s check\u201d without authority to do so, with \u201cfraudulent intent,\u201d and such \u201ctraveler\u2019s check\u201d is thereby caused to be transported in interstate commerce is guilty under Section 2314, Title 18, U.S.C.A., I would affirm Streett\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
