We find no error in the supplemental instruction nor anything in the record that would cast doubt on the legality of Johnson\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-20\">No objection was taken to the Government\u2019s summation nor were any protective instructions sought. Although the prosecutor\u2019s statement that he \u201cvouched for\u201d the credibility of certain government witnesses was improper, cf. ABA Canon of Professional Ethics #15 (1963), it was not, at least absent objection, reversible error. Lawn v. United States, 355 U.S. 339, 359-360 n. 15, 78 S.Ct. 311, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-22\">As we find that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions and that the specific points raised are without merit, we affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
