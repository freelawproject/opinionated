The tools include clinching pliers, crimping tools, wrenches and the like all of which are suitable for use to bend and shape metal.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-22\">Appellee\u2019s \u201cBENDIT\u201d tool, characterized by the board as \u201cdesigned * * * for the ever-popular \u2018do-it-yourselfer\u2019,\u201d is simply a short metal rod the ends of which are grooved and pronged to permit hand-shaping of aluminum wire pieces into hooks for pegboards.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-23\">The opposition is based on opposer\u2019s registration of \u201cBendix,\u201d Reg.No. 662,-208, for various testing and indicating equipment including \u201ctools and devices * * * for testing and analyzing electrical systems and components thereof * * # <em>tt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-26\">\u25a0 Appellee relies on its application as filed, taking no testimony below and filing no brief in this court. Opposer took testimony, introduced as evidence various exhibits illustrating its tools as advertised and sold, and submitted a dealer\u2019s promotional circular describing ap-pellee\u2019s tool.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-27\">The board considered the sole issue to be \u201cdetermination * * * of likelihood of confusion\u201d and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-29\">\u201cThere is no question but that as opposer alleges the goods of both parties may be considered as hand tools and may broadly be construed to perform a similar function. As the record shows, however, op-poser\u2019s hand tools are designed for use in servicing, maintaining, and installing specialized equipment manufactured by opposer such as diesel fuel injection pumps and nozzle holders, jet ignition systems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>testers, ignition systems used on reciprocating type engines, and other highly technical equipment which would ordinarily be sold through distributors of this type of equipment for use by technically trained individuals. Applicant\u2019s hand tool, however, is a simple gadget which is apparently designed like many other similar products for the ever-popular \u2018do-it-yourselfer\u2019 and for distribution through the normal retail outlets for such type products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-4\">\u201cConsidering therefore the <em>mature of and the differences between </em>the hand tools of the parties and the <em>highly suggestive nature </em>of the mark \u2018BENDIT\u2019, it is unlikely that purchasers familiar with \u2018BENDIX\u2019 technical equipment and tools will assume that applicant\u2019s product originates with or is in some way associated with opposer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">On reconsideration the board added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AggY\">\u201cUpon a review of the record in this proceeding, the Board remains of the opinion that the sale of the products of the parties under the <em>surname </em>\u2018BENDIX\u2019 and the <em>suggestive term </em>\u2018BENDIT\u2019, respectively, is not likely to cause purchasers to attribute a common origin thereto.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">We find no clear error in the board\u2019s unanimous decision and for reasons set out below appellant has not convinced us there is any.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Appellant\u2019s principal argument appears to be that in determining likelihood of confusion the boai*d erred in characterizing opposer\u2019s tools as \u201cspecialized\u201d vis-\u00e1-vis the simple wire-bending tool of appellee; that in fact one of op-poser\u2019s tools, a physical exhibit in evidence, \u201cdiscloses more points of similarity than any points of dissimilarity.\u201d We note from the testimony and exhibits that opposer\u2019s tool in question is a \u201cspring tension adjusting tool\u201d and, although it is in some respects similar in appearance to appellee\u2019s tool, it does not appear to be intended for use as a wire or metal bending tool. With respect to appellant\u2019s other tools, we agree with the board that their use results from acquisition \u201cthrough distributors of this type of equipment for use by technically trained individuals\u201d as compared with appellee\u2019s tool which is a \u201csimple gadget\u201d for distribution through \u201cnormal retail outlets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Appellant further argues that the marks consist \u201cof a six-lettered word, differing only in the last letters, in the one ease ending in the letter (t) while in the other case, the letter is an (x),\u201d and that not only are the marks similar in appearance but they are also \u201csimilar' in sound in the spoken word.\u201d Appellant also points out that some of their tools are used to service \u201creciprocating type engines\u201d in \u201clawn mowers, outboard motors and stationary engines\u201d which service may be performed not only by technically trained personnel but by persons characterized by the board as \u201cdo-it-yourselfers,\u201d who use the \u201cBEN-DIT\u201d tool.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s arguments, we agree with the board that \u201cConsidering * * * the nature of and the differences between the hand tools of the parties and the highly suggestive nature of the mark \u2018BENDIT\u2019, it is unlikely that purchasers familiar with \u2018BENDIX\u2019 * * * tools will assume that applicant\u2019s product originates with or is in some way associated with opposer.\u201d \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">\u201cBENDIX\u201d is a very well known trademark, originally a proper name, and does not, we think, suggest bending. \u201cBENDIT,\u201d on the other hand, as used is highly suggestive of a bending tool and has an entirely different connotation, not suggestive of connection with Bendix products. See In re General Electric Co., 304 F.2d 688, 49 CCPA 1186 (\u201cVulcan\u201d v. \u201cVulkene\u201d), and Lever Bros. Co. v. Producers Chemical Service, 283 F.2d 879, 48 CCPA 744 (\u201cLux\u201d v. \u201cShux\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-15\">WORLEY, C. J., sat but did not participate in decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-30\">.
