Appellant urges that it was error for the District Court to give the so-called last clear chance instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-29\">Appellee Betsy Ann Siegeltuch, a young woman of 24, was driving her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>regular route home from her daily work when her car was struck by appellant Frost\u2019s car as she drove a car owned by appellee Benedict across an arterial highway. Her injuries left her with an amnesia so that at trial she had no recollection of any events concerning the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Appellant Frost, also age 24, was driving on the arterial street; he testified that when he was approximately 100 feet from the intersection he first observed Miss Siegeltuch approaching the intersection ; she was also approximately 100 feet from the intersection. Appellant and two of the passengers in his car testified that Miss Siegeltuch drove through the arterial street without stopping at or near the usual \u201cSTOP\u201d sign which controls entry to the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Frost\u2019s testimony, which is uncontradicted, was that when he was about 50 feet from the intersection<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he became aware that appellee\u2019s car was not slowing down to stop at the arterial \u201cSTOP\u201d sign, that he then applied his brakes but struck appellee\u2019s car as it crossed the intersection without having stopped. The evidence showed that he applied his brakes but slid approximately 35 feet on the damp or wet pavement into appellee\u2019s car, which traveled 39 feet after the collision. Frost\u2019s car traveled 24 to 27 feet after impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Another motorist who was approaching the arterial street from a point opposite Miss Siegeltuch acknowledged that \u201cit would be fair to say\u201d that she \u201cshot out into the intersection.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This witness qualified his testimony by saying he did not actually observe appellee \u201crun\u201d the \u201cSTOP\u201d sign but taken as a whole a jury could reasonably find that the testimony of this independent eyewitness supported appellant\u2019s version of the collision that Miss Siegeltuch had failed to stop as required.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\"> In the circumstances revealed by this record, an instruction on last clear chance was not appropriate, for at best the jury would be obliged to speculate on what alternative courses were available to Frost in the time available to avoid the collision. There is no evidence in the case that appellant was aware or \u201cshould reasonably have been aware of [appellee\u2019s] danger and could have taken the proper precautions to avoid injury * * \u2022\u25a0.\u201d Richardson v. Gregory, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 263, 265, 281 F.2d 626, 628 (1960). Frost had a right to assume appellee would stop at the arterial \u201cSTOP\u201d sign. We can assume for. these purposes that a jury could reasonably find negligence on the part of Frost, but we find no evidence that Frost in the exercise of due care could have done other than what he did when he became aware that Miss Siegeltuch had placed herself in a position of peril. Appellee did not meet her burden on this score simply by suggesting speculative alternatives. The last clear chance doctrine, as its name implies, has to do with not merely the <em>last </em>chance to avoid injury but a <em>clear </em>chance as well. Compare Capital Transit Co. v. Garcia, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 168, 194 F.2d 162 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">The jury returned a special verdict here finding that Miss Siegeltuch \u201cwas negligent and that her negligence proximately concurred in [some] degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>in causing the impact and her resulting injuries * * Her negligence having been found contributory, she cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-8\">. Frost testified that he was driving 25 m. p. h. when he first appreciated plaintiff\u2019s danger; the police officer from the Accident Investigation Unit testified that at the scene shortly after the collision Frost had given him the same information; two of the three passengers in Frost\u2019s ear estimated their speed at 25 m. p. h. also; the thii-d passenger was never questioned as to the speed of the Frost vehicle. Ap-pellee\u2019s expert witness on the basis of the skid marks estimated that Frost\u2019s speed when he applied his brakes was at least 34 m. p. h. An eyewitness judged Frost\u2019s speed to he about 30 m. p. h. The posted speed limit was 25 m. p. h.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-16\">. This witness characterized appellee\u2019s action saying it appeared to him that she did not see appellant\u2019s approaching car, which the witness \u201chad no difficulty seeing\u201d and because \u201cshe [appellee] was looking straight ahead as she went across the intersection. * * * \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
