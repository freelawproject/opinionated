Appellant and one Lollar were acquitted on the housebreaking count, but both were convicted of grand larceny. Appellant contends principally that he was entitled to an acquittal on the larceny count because of insufficiency of the evidence. Actually, the case presents no new question.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-23\">A few days before April 29, 1963, this appellant entered \u201cThe Wig Shoppe\u201d on Columbia Road. The proprietor waited upon him, answering his questions about the texture and the cost of wigs. Appellant expressed an interest in owning a wig for use in an act he performed as a dancer. The proprietor testified that he \u201cdiscouraged\u201d the appellant from trying on a wig and that appellant left the shop without buying.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-24\">About midnight on April 29, 1963, three men were seen standing in front of \u201cThe Wig Shoppe\u201d in the display window of which were three wigs, one black, one red and one platinum blonde. Dykes broke the window and was observed as he removed some objects from within. The police were notified. Taking a witness with them in a cruiser, the officers within a few minutes came upon the three co-defendants <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and called to them to stop. The appellant stood behind a parked car and shook the front of his jacket. Investigating immediately, an officer found at the spot where the appellant had been standing a black wig which was later identified as having come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>from the wig shop. The three co-defendants were placed in the back seat of the police car. Arriving at the precinct, the red wig was found in the ear. At the precinct, Dykes was searched and the platinum blonde wig was found concealed in his underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">At the precinct following the arrest of the appellant, the proprietor identified Jackson as the man who had been in the store inquiring about the possible purchase of a lady\u2019s wig. Appellant seems to think that the evidence of Jackson\u2019s earlier visit to the shop \u201cshowed at most only a general interest in wigs,\u201d testimony which was prejudicial because \u201cwell calculated to arouse any latent jury prejudice against a man who would seek to try on women\u2019s wigs.\u201d We deem the contention more ingenious than substantial. Such contacts with the appellant and observation of him by the proprietor on two occasions so closely related in point of time was competent not only on the score of identification, but relevant to the jury\u2019s consideration of the appellant\u2019s motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The jury might well have concluded that not every day does a man evince an interest in acquiring a lady\u2019s wig, only thereafter to be so intimately connected with the breaking of the window and the snatching of the three wigs. That such wigs might have been discovered by the appellant on the occasion of his visit to the store to have substantial value could have had some bearing on the division of the loot into three equal parts. Or so the jury might have concluded with the black wig shaken from under the appellant\u2019s coat at the point where it was picked up by the officer, the platinum blonde wig concealed by Dykes in his underclothing whence he could not shake it loose, and the red wig in the police car where Lollar had been seated with the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We do not have the benefit of whatever explanation the appellant might have offered if he had testified. In the circumstances we find no absence of support for the conclusion of the trial judge that the motion for acquittal should have been denied. The evidence amply sustains the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">We see no need to go into greater detail, for we find no error in respect of the foregoing or other contentions which we have fully considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-16\">. No appeals by the co-defendants, Dykes and Lollar, are now before us. Dykes was found guilty on both counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b868-25\">.
