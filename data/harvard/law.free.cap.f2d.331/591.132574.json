In the light thereof, these parties conceded that the only issue bearing on the Government\u2019s liability for the damage sustained by the ap-pellees, is whether the soldier was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the above accident. The District Court, applying the law of the State of Colorado, resolved that singular issue against the Government\u2019s contention, in Myers v. United States, 219 F.Supp. 71 (D.C.W.D.Mo.1963). That single issue is all that is presented to us in these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-21\">We have carefully examined the record and duly considered the briefs and contentions of these parties as to the applicable law, federal, as well as that of the State of Colorado, which they concede to be controlling; and which we deem is all that is worthy of our consideration in these appeals. Such law was also considered by District Judge Becker, and applied to the stipulated facts here to be considered, in the course of his memorandum opinion, supra. \u201cThat opinion and the briefs of the parties have convinced us that the judgments) appealed from (represent), at the very least, a permissible conclusion with respect to a doubtful question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>[Colorado] law, which this Court will not reverse.\u201d State Securities Company, etc. v.
