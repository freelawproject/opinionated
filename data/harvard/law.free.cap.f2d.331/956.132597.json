We find no error in the denial of the motion and affirm ^ district C(mrt,s order.</p>\n<p id=\"av4-dedup-0\">_ __ On November 10, 1959 the Securities a?d Exchange Commission brought a cml actlon m tlle dlstrlct court to enJ\u00b0ln the appellant from engaging m deceptive Phases of securities m violation of secti\u00b0ns 9(a) (1) and (2) and 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, lbF;S'C- \u00a7 78l(a;&gt; (1) and (2) and 78j(b)- Three days later, a consent decree was entere&lt;3&gt; permanently enjoining the appellant from engaging in the fraudulent activities described in the S. E. C.\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"APPe\">\u201e T A j. On June 13, 1962 an indictment was ..... at. \u2022 ax. filed m the district court charging the \u201e <em>, , \u25a0 </em>. .A1 . appellant and one Melvyn Kevin with de- \u201e ,. a t ^ i \u2022 i\u00ab\u00ab , fraudmg stock brokers m 1961 and 1962 by falsely representing that they were able to pay for stock which they had purchased with the intent to default on payment if the stock declined. Since the practices charged in the indictment had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number><em>been enjoined in the </em>consent decree entered in the S. E. C.\u2019s civil suit, the Government asked the district court to enter an order to show cause why the appellant should not be punished for criminal contempt for wilfully violating the consent decree. The appellant subsequently pleaded guilty to the contempt charge, and the indictment was marked off the calendar. On March 29, 1963 the appellant was sentenced to two years imprisonment with execution suspended and was put on probation for four years. The indictment was <em>nolled </em>because of the appellant\u2019s guilty plea to the contempt charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">On August 14, 1963 the appellant was charged with violating the terms and conditions of his probation. When the appellant admitted his violation, Judge Tyler revoked appellant\u2019s probation, vacated the suspension of execution of sentence, and sentenced appellant to imprisonment for a year and a day. At all relevant stages in the proceedings, appellant was assisted by competent counsel of his choosing. Appellant began serving that sentence on August 23, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention is that his sentence should be set aside under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on the ground that he may not constitutionally be imprisoned for more than the penalty provided for petty offenses (six months as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1) without being offered the right to a jury trial. The argument is entirely based on the following somewhat cryptic comment in footnote 12 of the majority opinion in United States v. Barnett, 84 S.Ct. 984, 12 L.Ed.2d 23 (1964):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-6\">\u201cHowever, our cases have indicated that, irrespective of the severity of the offense, the severity of the penalty imposed, a matter not raised in this certification, might entitle a defendant to the benefit of a jury trial. * * * In view of the impending contempt hearing, the effective administration of justice requires that this <em>dictum </em>be added: Some members of the Court are of the view that, without regard to the seriousness of the offense, punishment by summary trial without a jury would be constitutionally limited to that penalty provided for petty offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">Appellant contends that we are bound to apply this dictum, that we are bound to apply it retroactively, and that it requires setting aside the balance of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">We find it unnecessary to point out all the logical and legal fallacies in appellant\u2019s rather ingenious argument. Even if we assume that if the issue were properly presented, the Supreme Court would hold that where a defendant is summarily tried for contempt without a jury, punishment is constitutionally limited to six months, and that this constitutional principle must be retroactively applied, the appellant\u2019s motion must be denied. Unlike Barnett, Bialkin did not request a jury trial; indeed, he did not request a trial at all. Instead, while represented by competent counsel of his own choosing, appellant elected to plead guilty. The outstanding indictment against him for the same activities which led to the contempt charge was <em>nolled </em>as a result of his guilty plea. By pleading guilty to the indictment under such circumstances, appellant plainly would have waived any constitutional right to a jury trial if he had one.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Matey v. Sacks, 284 F.2d 335 (6 Cir. 1960), cert. denied Matey v. Alvis, 364 U.S. 853, 81 S.Ct. 76, 5 L.Ed.2d 77; Bugg v. United States, 140 F.2d 848, 851 (8 Cir. 1944), cert. denied 323 U.S. 673, 65 S.Ct. 89, 89 L.Ed. 547; Hood v. United States, 152 F.2d 431, 433 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>(8 Cir. 1946); West v. Gammon, 98 F. 426 (6 Cir. 1899). The jury\u2019s role is that of a trier of guilt, and where the accused admits his guilt, there is no function for the jury to perform. If Bialkin had been found guilty by a jury, it is clear there would be no six-month limitation on the district judge\u2019s power to impose sentence. Hill v. United States ex rel. Weiner, 300 U.S. 105, 57 S.Ct. 347, 81 L.Ed. 537 (1937). It makes little sense to impose such limitation where, as here, there is no issue of guilt to be resolved. Even today, appellant does not urge that he was innocent of the contempt. His claim is simply that the district court lacked the power to sentence him to more than six months\u2019 imprisonment without offering him the right to trial by jury. We think the Supreme Court did not mean to suggest that defendants who plead guilty to a contempt charge without demanding a jury trial in eases in which the United States is a party may not be'imprisoned for more than six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">. Appellant has never had either a constitutional or statutory right to a jury trial on his contempt charge. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3691 does not confer the right to a jury trial if the alleged contempt is committed in disobedience of any lawful decree entered in any suit brought or prose-euted in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States. The S. E. O. action was plainly a suit brought on behalf of the United States. And the Barnett ease held that there was no constitutional right to a jury trial on a charge of criminal contempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
