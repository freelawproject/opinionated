The district court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which, except for some minor changes, had been prepared by counsel for Johns-Manville.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The patent is for a push-in pipe coupling for use principally with asbestos-cement pipe similar to the coupling for use with cast iron pipe held valid in United States Pipe &amp; Foundry Co. v. James B. Clow &amp; Sons, Inc., N.D.Ala. 1962, 205 F.Supp. 140. That decision was reversed, 5 Cir., 313 F.2d 46, for determination of the issue as to who was the first inventor, with the following ruling as to patentability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\u201cThe contention that the patent is \u2022devoid of any inventive contribution in view of the prior art, and that it was not infringed are both without merit, as is the argument that the claims failed to meet the statutory requirement of definiteness. Also, the claim of file wrapper estoppel was not made out. These matters were carefully considered by the District Court and the findings and conclusions in regard to them find adequate support in the record. To this extent, and except as stated, the judgment is affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The district court in the present case \u2022described what it referred to as \u201cthe Heart of the invention\u201d in its finding numbered 11 (209 F.Supp. 800, 801):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahz-dedup-2\">\u201cThe coupling made and sold by plaintiff in accordance with the patent in suit was a lubricated \u2018push-in\u2019 coupling and was the first one of this type ever used in the asbestos-cement field. The patented coupling consists of an asbestos-cement sleeve having grooves in its inner surface in which rubber sealing rings are seated and arranged to be relatively lightly compressed as the lubricated pipe ends are pushed into the sleeve. The machined ends of the pipes are each provided with a circumferential <em>shoulder </em>at a predetermined distance from the end, to engage the rubber rings and to limit the movement of the pipe into the sleeve (Tr. 147, 148). The shoulder on the pipe <em>in combination </em>with the sealing ring in the groove in the sleeve is the heart of the invention, accomplishes new and useful results, makes possible an entirely new mode of operation, and the use of the shoulder in combination produces advantages which were not up to then foreseen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">The issuance of the patent carries with it a presumption of validity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Italit\u2019s attack on the validity of Claims 1 and 2 (n. 1, supra) is based upon obviousness or lack of invention.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the issue of validity the district court made extensive findings of fact culminating in finding No. 20:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">\u201c20. Although there is no single new element in the plaintiff\u2019s patent that constitutes a patentable invention in and of itself, the combination of old elements, or previously known elements, or elements of prior art, particularly as respects the shoulder on the pipe, has produced a new and useful and patentable improvement over all previously known couplings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>The elements of claims 1 and 2 of the patent in suit constitute a true patentable combination, and not a mere aggregation of old elements. All of the elements cooperate with each other to perform new and useful results in an improved manner and were combined through the exercise of invention. The new combination of old elements brought together for the first time by the inventor, Hei-sler, would not have been and was not obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made.\u201d (209 F.Supp. 802.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">This finding of fact cannot be set aside as clearly erroneous, and it warrants the conclusion that the statutory requirements for patentability have been met.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Claims 1 and 2 are charged to be infringed. One of these claims applies more particularly to a sleeve type while the other applies to a bell and spigot type coupling.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Claim 2 is dependent upon Claim 1 and cannot be infringed if Claim 1 is not infringed. The district court was unquestionably correct in that part of its finding No. 20, heretofore quoted, to the effect that each of the elements recited in Claims 1 and 2 were old in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The application for the patent as originally filed contained fourteen claims, all of which were rejected by the examiner upon various grounds, his communication concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">\u201cClaims 1 through 14 are further rejected on the ground of undue multiplicity. In view of the relative simplicity of applicant\u2019s device and the advanced state of the art as illustrated by the cited references supra, it is believed that applicant\u2019s invention if any, may be adequately claimed in not more than two claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">\u2022 In an amendment the applicant can-celled ten of the fourteen pending claims and added six new claims, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUaM\">\u201cThe reference cited and the grounds of rejection applied against the claims originally in this application have been very carefully studied, and the claim structure has been altered by the instant amendment in a manner considered to distinguish patentably from the art and to overcome the several grounds of rejection, including the rejection on the ground of undue multiplicity, for the reasons pointed out below.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">Again all of the claims were rejected with the statement that, \u201cThis rejection is final.\u201d In response, the applicant can-celled all of the claims and added five new claims, three of which, after amendment, became the claims finally allowed. The applicant stated that the new claims \u201care considerably more specific,\u201d and further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-12\">\u201cThe claims also provide for clearance for deflection of the pipe sections within the coupling sleeve, and the gaskets involved are specified to be of the readily deformable type, such as used in \u2018O-ring\u2019 constructions, the gaskets being stated to be held under relatively light radially compressive forces so as to provide for easy assembly of the coupling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">The examiner responded that the most detailed claim, which was eventually allowed as Claim No. 3, not here in suit, \u201cappears to be allowable,\u201d but rejected the other four claims. After appeal to the Board of Appeals, the applicant can-celled two of the claims and further amended the other two which were eventually allowed as Claims 1 and 2, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATP6\">\u201cWhile claims 23 and 24 are still considered allowable over the references in their unamended form, the instant amendment to these claims is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>proposed as more clearly delineating the novelty in the combination from the teaching of the references, as discussed hereinafter in detail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The language added to Claim 23, which became Claim 1 as finally allowed, is that which we have emphasized in n. 1, supra. The detailed discussion by applicant\u2019s attorney reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\u201cThe proposed amendment to line 4 of claim 23 specifies the substantially constant nature of the two different outside diameters of the annular portions joined by the shoul\u25a0der on the inner pipe section. The proposed amendment to line 26 of \u25a0claim 23 <em>leaves no room for any possible doubt as to the direction in which the axial end walls of the .groove extend. </em>The amendments to lines 41 and 43 of claim 23 are considered especially significant in lo\u25a0cating the shoulder at least in part radially opposite the same end wall \u25a0of the groove in the assembled relationship as brought out in allowed \u25a0claim 25, the difference being that the exact shape of that end wall is not specified in claim 23. This relative location of the said end wall and the shoulder is believed to be a critical feature of the combination, since the particular end wall involved must be so located in order to cooperate with the shoulder in preventing gasket blow-out under positive line-pressure off-conditions. Claim 24, as dependent from claim 23, contains all the novel features thereof, together with the additional novel features recited therein, and should clearly be allowable with claim 23.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMQb\">While Claim 3 of the patent specifically calls for the gasket to be \u201ccircular,\u201d Claims 1 and 2 do not contain this express limitation. However, the gaskets defined in Claims 1 and 2, because of the prosecution of the application and because of the relationship set out in the claims of the axial width of the groove with respect to that of the gasket, can only be limited to \u201cO-ring\u201d type gaskets. This does not mean that the gaskets must be circular or must have an \u201c0\u201d shape, but only that they be gaskets which seal under the \u201cO-ring\u201d principle of sealing. \u201cO-ring\u201d type gaskets may take many different shapes provided that the gasket is readily deformable. For example, an \u201cO-ring\u201d type gasket may be square shaped, delta shaped or X shaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">\u201cV-ring\u201d seals, which were distinguished over during the prosecution of the application, seal on an entirely different principle than an \u201cO-ring\u201d gasket. They do not depend upon being deformed or squeezed into a space between pipe sections in order to make a seal, but rather depend upon fluid pressure to force the lips of the \u201cV\u201d apart against' the parts to be sealed so that the greater the hydraulic pressure, the greater will be the force against the lips pushing them against the parts to be sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">In Keystone Driller Co. v. Northwest Engineering Corporation, 1935, 294 U.S. 42, 48, 55 S.Ct., 262, 265, 79 L.Ed. 747, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-12\">\u201cWe do not attribute the force of an estoppel to what was said by the claimant in seeking to avoid the prior art cited against his broad claims, but we do apply the principle that, where such broad claims are denied and a narrower substituted, the patentee is estopped to read the granted claim as the equivalent of those which were rejected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">See also, Southern States Equipment Corporation v. USCO Power Equipment Corporation, 5 Cir. 1953, 209 F.2d 111, 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">Claims 1 and 2 cannot be given a construction broad enough to encompass Italit\u2019s S-S automatic coupling, which utilizes a \u201cV-ring\u201d gasket, that does not move axially in its V-shaped groove to effect any seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-15\">Italit\u2019s coupling does not have the elements specifically defined in Claims 1 and 2. It does not have a groove in the outer pipe section which has \u201caxial end walls\u201d and \u201ca radially outer wall radially opposite at least a part of said annular por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>tion of smaller outside diameter\u201d of the inner pipe section as required in Claim. Instead of the three walls called for, it has two walls, one being a slanted wall (at an acute angle \u2014 not radially extending) and the other being a radially extending end wall which join to form a triangular shaped groove. Italit\u2019s groove is the type of groove adopted to fit the \u201cV-ring\u201d lip-seal type of gasket Italit uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Italit\u2019s coupling does not have the <em>two </em>\u201cgenerally radially extending axial end walls\u201d called for in the claims. It does have one such wall. It would be straining things to say that its slanted wall was a \u201cgenerally radially extending wall portion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Italit\u2019s coupling groove does not have \u201ca somewhat greater width axially of the outer pipe section and between said end walls than the thickness of the gasket in that direction in its initially flattened state to provide space for limited axial deformation of the gasket material towards and against <em>either one </em>of the axial end <em>walls </em>of the groove and away from the respective <em>other </em>end wall * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) as called for in the claims. The axial width of the groove in Italit\u2019s coupling is the same axial width as is the \u201cV-ring\u201d lip-seal gasket which fits into the groove.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Italit\u2019s coupling does not have \u201csaid shoulder lying at least in part radially opposite the other one of said end walls of the groove in said assembled relationship.\u201d The shoulder lies radially opposite a slanted wall of the groove and not any end wall which is \u201cgenerally radially extending\u201d as the end walls are defined in the claims. The only \u201cradially extending\u201d end wall is not \u201cradially opposite\u201d the shoulder on the pipe end.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Italit\u2019s coupling does not have a gasket which is engaged between the radially outer wall of the groove and the outer circumference of the inner pipe section, so that it is \u201cslightly flattened in a radial direction\u201d and so arranged in the groove that there may be \u201climited axial deformation of the gasket material toward and against either one of the [generally radially extending] axial end walls * * The gasket utilized in Italit\u2019s seal is a \u201cV-ring\u201d lip-seal gasket operating on a principle different from the \u201cO-ring\u201d squeeze principle of sealing and does not require any axial deformation to make a seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">The district court erred in finding that Claims 1 and 2 of the patent in suit have been infringed by the defendant, Italit. The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\">. \u201c1. A pipe coupling for confining a fluid therein comprising, an inner pipe section having an end portion of generally cylindrical outer circumference but comprising two annular portions of different <em>substantially constant </em>outside diameters joined by a shoulder extending generally radially outwardly at a relatively steep angle to the axis of said inner pipe section, an outer pipe section having a generally cylindrical inner circumference defining an opening receiving said end portion of said inner pipe section, the annular portion of said inner pipe section end having the smaller outside diameter being located the closer axially to the axially inner extremity of the inner pipe section, the maximum outside diameter of said end portion being somewhat smaller than the diameter of said opening to provide clearance for axial movement and limited canting of the pipe sections relative to each other, said outer pipe section having an annular groove formed generally radially outwardly from its inner circumstance and having a radially outer wall radially opposite at least a part of said annular portion of smaller outside diameter, and a resilient readily deformable gasket in said groove having a greater initial radial thickness than the distance between said radially outer wall of the groove and said radially opposite portion of the outer circumference of said inner pipe section end portion and being engaged therebetween under relatively light radial compressive force in assembled relation and at least slightly flattened in a radial direction, said groove having <em>generally radially extending </em>axial end walls and a somewhat greater width axially of the outer pipe section and between said end walls than the thickness of the gasket in that direction in its initially flattened state to provide space for limited axial deformation of the gasket material toward and against either one of the axial end walls of the groove' and away from the respective other end' wall in response to a fluid pressure differential resulting in a greater effective fluid' pressure on that side of the gasket lying toward said respective other end wall of' the groove, said shoulder being spaced a desired, predetermined distance from said inner extremity of the inner pipe section,, said predetermined distance being such that said shoulder positively orients said inner pipe section in a desired predetermined position axially with respect to said' outer pipe section when said pipe sections' and gasket are brought together in the aforesaid relationship in assembly of the coupling with said shoulder and the one end wall of said groove axially opposite' said shoulder both in contact with said gasket, <em>said shoulder lying at least in part radially opposite the other one of said end walls of the groove in said assembled relationship.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added for reason expressed in text to footnote 8, infra.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">\u201c2.
