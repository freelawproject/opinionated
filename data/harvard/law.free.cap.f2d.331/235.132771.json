Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), should be applied retroactively to a 1950 search of Sisk\u2019s automobile, resulting in seizure of evidence used to convict him in Indiana courts. The question is important because if Mapp is applied retroactively here a federal question is raised which must be answered in light of the recent Preston v. United States, 84 S.Ct. 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-19\">We hold that Mapp is inapplicable to the Sisk search in 1950, that there is no federal question presented which would invoke the Preston rule, and that for those reasons the district court properly denied the writ.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-20\">Sisk was convicted of murder in Indiana in 1951 and sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction was affirmed by the Indiana Supreme Court, Sisk v. State, 232 Ind. 214, 110 N.E.2d 627 (1953), and certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court. 346 U.S. 838, 74 S.Ct. 61, 98 L.Ed. 360 (1953). He filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court in February, 1954, claiming the search of his automobile violated his constitutional right. The petition was denied without hearing, and this court affirmed, Sisk v. Overlade, 220 F.2d 68 (7th Cir. 1955), holding that Sisk was entitled to no relief under Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 69 S.Ct. 1359, 93 L.Ed. 1782 (1949). Certiorari was again denied by the United States Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>preme Court. 350 U.S. 876, 76 S.Ct. 121, 100 L.Ed. 774 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s 1961 decision in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684 (1961), Sisk filed this petition, claiming again the violation of his constitutional rights by the 1950 search of his automobile. The district court applied the Mapp rule, tested the facts of the search by a federal standard,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and dismissed the petition. We think the court erred in applying Mapp retroactively. We affirm the decision of the court, however, for the reasons given hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The district court, after a full hearing, and the Indiana trial and supreme courts, found from the following facts that the search of Sisk\u2019s automobile was lawful as incident to a lawful arrest: He had been arrested by an Indiana officer at 7 a. m. on September 4, 1950, Labor Day morning, while in \u201cimmediate control\u201d of his automobile. He was driven to sheriff\u2019s headquarters where his automobile was towed. A search of the automobile was begun immediately, without a warrant, and clothing and a large, incriminating sum of money were found. After this search the car was barricaded in a garage with a rope tied around it. Six days later the search was resumed, and mats with blood spots were taken from the car. This evidence was admitted, over his objection, at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">After argument in the case at bar, the United States Supreme Court handed down its decision in Preston v. United States, 84 S.Ct. 881, in which it reversed a federal court conviction for conspiracy to rob a federally insured bank on the ground that the conviction was based on illegally seized evidence. We think the search of Sisk\u2019s automobile would be illegal under the rule in Preston because it was \u201ctoo remote in time or place to have been made as incidental\u201d to the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">The Supreme Court in Mapp applied the new exclusionary rule retroactively to the 1957 search of Miss Mapp\u2019s apartment. By its \u201cexplication\u201d of the Mapp rule in Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Court has extended the rule to cases pending in the appellate process at the time of the Mapp decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the Court has left to speculation the point at which the Mapp rule\u2019s backward reach should end. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that the question now is not <em>whether </em>Mapp should be given retroactive application, but <em>where </em>the line against retroactivity, if any, should be drawn. People v. Hurst, 325 F.2d 891, 895 (9th Cir. 1963), pet. for cert. filed, 32 U.S.L.Week 3360 (U.S., April 14, 1964) (No. 913).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">Examination of the language of the Mapp opinion for an answer to the question has been unproductive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Four circuits have given answers which are in disagreement. And we find no answer in decisions giving retroactive application to refined constitutional standards protecting the right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">The Ninth Circuit in People v. Hurst, 325 F.2d 891 (9th Cir. 1963), pet. for cert. filed, 32 U.S.L.Week, 3360 (U.S., April 14, 1964) (No. 913), and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Fourth Circuit in Hall v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, 313 F.2d 483 (4th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 809, 83 S.Ct. 1693, 10 L.Ed.2d 1032, applied the Mapp rule \u201cretroactively\u201d to cases already disposed of in the appellate process when Mapp was decided. The Fifth Circuit in United States ex rel. Linkletter v. Walker, 323 F.2d 11 (5th Cir. 1963), cert. granted 84 S.Ct. 1340 (U.S., May 18, 1964) (No. 999 Misc.), and the Tenth Circuit in Gaitan v. United States, 317 F.2d 494 (10th Cir. 1963), refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae0\">The Fourth Circuit in Hall thought the Mapp rule was always in the Fourteenth Amendment and that the Supreme Court found it in 1961 and applied it to a 1957 search. The Fourth Circuit was , . ., , . . , plamly influenced m its decision by the death sentence imposed on the evidence seized at a time when Maryland had no exclusionary rule in felony cases.</p>\n<p id=\"AnuK\">m, m n- ... ~ <em>. , , </em>The Tenth Circuit m Gaitan involved i \u2022 \u00bb r,..,, . , , . , claim of a Fifth Amendment violation . . .... . on admissibility of evidence m a nar- ,. cot\u00edes case. The court had not the philo- , . , , . sophical assurance of the court m tt n <em>tj. </em>it. Hall. It thought that Mapp s overruling of Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 69 S.Ct. 1359, 93 L.Ed. 1782 (1949), was a \u201cchange in a constitutional interpretation\u201d having the same result, in habeas corpus, as a \u201cchange in the constitution itself.\u201d It declined to set aside Gaitan\u2019s conviction. Its reason was that prohib\u00ed-t,ion convictions under the Eighteenth Amendment were not set aside after the passage of the Twenty-First Amendment. Welch v. Hudspeth, 132 F.2d 434 (10th Cir. 1942), United States ex rel. Randall v. United States Marshal, 143 F.2d 830 (2d Cir. 1944).</p>\n<p id=\"AlY_\">The Fifth circuit in Walker rejected the \u201ctraditional Blaekstonian view\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> taken by the court in HalL It took the \u201cmore modern view, as espoused by * * * the legal realists\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the Mapp rule was \u201cmade\u201d in 1961 and was therefore prospective. The court refused to app]y Mapp retroactively to a 1958 search ieatjing- to a \u201csimple burglary\u201d conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"A8P\">In the Hurst narcotics case the Ninth Circuit agreed with the court in Walker that the purpose of the Mapp rule was deterrence of future illegal searches and seizures. However, it disagreed that in California a \u201cwholesale reversal of past . ,. \u201e ,. convictions would result from retroac- \u201e , , , <em>hJe </em>application, as feared by the Fifth Circuit, because California had its own judicially imposed exclusionary rule since 1955. The court applied the Mapp rule to ,, TT. , , , the 1959 Hurst search because it was two , , years later than the search m Mapp and , , ,, , . . because the court thought the protection \u201e . . , , . afforded by the exclusionary rule was a ... ,. , ... constitutional privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"AHgH\">We think the exclusionary rule announced in Mapp has been implicit in the Fourth Amendment since the Bill of Rights was adopted, and implicit as against the states since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. But we think that it was not made explicit as a controlling constitutional rule until the Mapp decision in 1961. Consequently we think retroactive application of the rule is not a necessity, as though the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>existed before Mapp and bound state courts. Drawing the line in application of the rule, in our opinion, involves a prudential judgment for each court, until the Supreme Court, of course, makes the ultimate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Comparing the circumstances of this case and our view of the Mapp rule with the circumstances facing the other circuits and their reasons for decision, we find similarities and dissimilarities. The Sisk case before us is a murder case like Hall with a life sentence instead of a death sentence, and Indiana, unlike Maryland in Hall, had its own judicially imposed exclusionary rule when Sisk was convicted. We share, too, the Tenth Circuit\u2019s lack of \u201cassurance\u201d of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s philosophical notion as our own view set out above indicates. We disagree with the Tenth Circuit\u2019s reliance upon its analogy between review of ha-beas corpus under Mapp and under the prohibition eases after repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment. No right implicit in the Bill of Rights was made explicit by the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In view of Preston v. United States, 84 S.Ct. 881, we are not as sure as the Ninth Circuit that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dire prediction about \u201cwholesale reversal of past convictions\u201d would not result from unlimited retroactivity, even in Indiana. But we cannot accept the Fifth Circuit\u2019s idea that prospective application only is the just answer. Finally, we agree with the court in Hurst that Fourth Amendment protection is a \u201cConstitutional privilege,\u201d but Indiana\u2019s exclusionary rule was available for Sisk\u2019s protection at the time of his trial. Finally, we are im-~ pressed with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reason for applying the Mapp rule to the 1959 Hurst search \u2014 that the Supreme Court applied the rule to the 1957 Mapp search. However, the Sisk search was in 1950. <em>J</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">The retroactive application of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s 1961 prohibition against coerced confessions to reverse a 1936 conviction in Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433, 81 S.Ct. 1541, 6 L.Ed.2d 948 (1961), and the seemingly unlimited retroactivity given the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guaranty of right to counsel in the cases <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> following Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), do not control our decision. Those constitutional guaranties go to the very essence of fair trial. They have not been limited to a deterrent purpose as Mapp is.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The question before us, therefore, is different.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">Nor does Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956), compel us to apply the Mapp rule to the Sisk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>search, even though the Griffin rule<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was applied retroactively to 1935 in Eskridge v. Washington State Board, 357 U.S. 214, 78 S.Ct. 1061, 2 L.Ed.2d 1269 (1958). In Norvell v. Illinois, 373 U.S. 420, 83 S.Ct. 1366, 10 L.Ed.2d 456 (1963), the Court drew the line against retroactive application of the Griffin rule under the circumstances of that case and showed that retroactivity of that rule was not unlimited.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Indiana in 1923 anticipated the Mapp decision and drew its own constitutional exclusionary rule.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Flum v. State, 193 Ind. 585, 590, 141 N.E. 353 (1923). The Indiana Supreme Court when testing the validity of the search of Sisk\u2019s automobile found that it was justified because the search \u201cimmediately followed\u201d the arrest. We presume the court would have applied the Flum exclusionary rule if it had found the search unreasonable. Had they so found, the Indiana courts were not required under Wolf to measure the search against a federal standard. They measured it against their own standard. Sisk\u2019s petition for certiorari was denied. He brought a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which was denied, and the denial affirmed by this court, because at that time illegal searches by state officers did not afford a basis for federal intervention. Certiorari was again denied. We cannot say that more should have been done, or that more was due Sisk, at that time, or is due him now, in human justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We see no promotion of the underlying purpose of deterrence of Indiana officers from future illegal searches and seizures I by setting aside Sisk\u2019s conviction. Wha^ shock might result if Sisk\u2019s conviction were set aside would likely pass soon, as most shocks do. We think a serious con-] sequence of such judgment would be an unseemly jar to the delicate balance between our federal and state relationships and result in a serious discrediting of the judicial system and the administrad tion of justice. Weighing the probable gain of a temporary shock to law enforcement officials against these serious consequences, we think, points to the right result.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">We conclude that Mapp should not be given retroactive application to this case, where the search took place seven years before the search of Miss Mapp\u2019s apartment,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> where Indiana had its own exclusionary rule and the trial took place at least six years before Miss Mapp\u2019s trial, and where the conviction, was final before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Mapp v. Ohio. On this conclusion we hold that the district court properly denied Sisk\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Attorney William E. Borror, a member of the Indiana Bar, was appointed by the district court to represent petitioner before it. He has continued his representation of petitioner in this court. We express our appreciation to Mr. Borror for his persistent, outstanding service in this assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">The denial of petitioner\u2019s application is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-13\">. The rule of res judicata is no bar to Sisk\u2019s relief in this habeas corpus proceeding even though the legality of the search has been raised and decided by the Indiana courts, and raised in an earlier habeas corpus petition.
