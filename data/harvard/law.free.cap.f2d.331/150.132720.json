The petition otherwise sets forth adequately the claim that on his state court trial for murder, petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel. This seems to have been recognized by the District Court in its allowance of the appeal in <em>forma pauperis </em>and the stay of execution pending appeal. We treat this as also the equivalent of a certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>probable cause. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253. The District Court by appropriate proceedings was therefore required to determine the merits of this constitutional claim. Accordingly, the case is reversed and remanded to the District Court for an appropriate hearing in light of controlling principles. Townsend v. Sain, 1963, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770; Fay v. Noia, 1963, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
