Issued on August 13, 1962, the order was based upon the Board\u2019s determination that petitioner had violated Sections 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq. The decision and order of the Board, adopting the findings,- conclusions, and recommendations of the Trial Examiner, are reported at 138 N.L.R.B. 95. As the Board\u2019s findings were amply supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>'by the record as a whole, we deny the petition to set aside the order and grant the cross-petition to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The determination that Section 8(a) (3) had been violated was based upon findings that petitioner, during a union effort to organize its plant, had discharged two employees for union activity. Petitioner claimed that it had \u2022discharged the two employees because \u2022of adverse economic conditions, but petitioner\u2019s foreman stated during the hearing that he had selected one of these two employees for discharge because he had the least seniority among the workers and because the foreman knew that he \u201cwas one of the boys that came in with the Union organizers\u201d; and then admitted that petitioner did not ordinarily lay off its employees on a seniority basis. The Board\u2019s finding that the other \u2022employee had been discharged because of union activity was based upon his testimony that the official who had discharged him had told him that the action had been taken because he had been reported as one who had passed out union cards. Though this testimony was disputed by the official and also by another of petitioner\u2019s witnesses, these differing stories \u2022only raised an issue of credibility, an issue for the Trial Examiner and the Board to resolve. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). These findings of Section 8(a) (3) violations amply supported the determination that Section 8(a) (1) had been violated, but, in addition, the evidence showed that petitioner in order to keep its employees away from the union\u2019s representatives had reversed its policy of permitting employees to take their coffee breaks outside its plant; and that petitioner\u2019s management-employees had interrogated workers as to their union interest and membership and had threatened, in the event of slack work, that union members would not be transferred to other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Petitioner claims that the Trial Examiner erred by refusing to permit it to call as a witness the Board agent who had investigated the case. There is no indication that the investigation was itself in any way relevant, and petitioner gave no indication of what it hoped to prove by the witness. It appears that the only testimony which would have been elicited from the agent would have been cumulative evidence dealing with what he had been told by witnesses who did testify. Under the circumstances the Trial Examiner\u2019s ruling was entirely correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The petition to review and set aside is denied; the Board\u2019s petition to enforce its order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
