On the first trial, the action was dismissed, but on appeal the judgment was reversed and the case remanded. Armour and Company v. Celic, 2 Cir., 294 F.2d 432. The court stated at page 438: \u201cIf, as we have found, the Cooperative tortiously misappropriated plaintiff\u2019s property by disbursing its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>monies to persons other than plaintiff and by exchanging its fertilizer for produce, then the defendants who are culpably implicated must be held accountable wholly apart from whether their action constitutes a technical conversion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On remand the case was tried by Judge Eosling on the original record. Judgment for $20,388.57 was awarded plaintiff against certain of the Cooperative\u2019s directors. Their liability resulted from their having authorized a commingling of the cash received for fertilizer sold with money of the Cooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">On defendants\u2019 appeal it is argued that there is no proof that a \u201cfund\u201d belonging to Armour ever actually came into existence. However, this point was settled by the prior appeal in which this court \u201cfound\u201d that the Cooperative had disbursed plaintiff\u2019s monies. Moreover, the parties stipulated that Armour was owed $59,643, of which $26,299 worth of fertilizer was applied against debts owed by the Cooperative, and $12,955 was sold on credit but never paid for. The necessary inference is that $20,388 was sold and paid for. The judgment against the defendants is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Armour appeals from that part of the judgment denying it recovery for $26,299 worth of fertilizer that the Cooperative sold to creditor members, and instead of billing the member set off the purchase price against its own debt to the member. This procedure was contrary to the terms of the consignment contract. However, Judge Eosling found that the directors had never approved this practice and had directed that sales be only for cash. See Aeroglide Corp. v. Zeh, 2 Cir., 301 F.2d 420 involving the same insolvent Cooperative and holding that only the actively participating directors could be held liable for conversion, even though directors not present at the crucial meeting may have known of the wrongful action. Since the defendants here did not perform or authorize the wrongful transfer, they are not liable to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"Aev\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
