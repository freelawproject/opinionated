The plaintiff, Radio, is a citizen of Massachusetts and the defendant Chernack, his brother-in-law, a citizen of Rhode Island. The defendant Overseas Commodities Corporation, by whom they were both employed, is a Rhode Island corporation of which each owns one half of the stock. Defendants assert various errors occurring during the trial. Each, in addition, seeks a new trial because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, and Overseas alleges that there was no evidence warranting a verdict against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">We must start with a procedural matter. The record appendix filed by appellants is incomplete on its face, and hence inadequate to present questions of the sufficiency of the evidence. When appellee, in his brief, pointed this out, instead of attempting to correct the defects <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellants filed a reply brief discussing our decisions and arguing that appellee\u2019s \u201ccontention is frivolous at best\u201d. We do not agree. Our rule, presently numbered 23, requires an appellant, unless excused, to print all parts of the record which he \u201cdeems it essential for the judges of the court to read.\u201d This includes the exhibits. Pioneer Credit Corp. v. Bloomberg, 1 Cir., 1963, 323 F.2d 992. The word \u201cdeems\u201d does not leave it to the appellant to pick and choose what he would like to see, but imposes a burden upon him to print all of the evidence, good and bad, material to the point he wishes to raise. In Haddad v. Border Express, Inc., 1 Cir., 1962, 303 F.2d 134, at 136, we pointed out, in language peculiarly applicable to the case at bar, \u201c[I]f a defendant-appellant claims, for example, that the evidence did not warrant a finding for the plaintiff, he must (a) print all of the evidence in the case on liability, or (b) obtain, and print, a stipulation from appellee that appellant\u2019s appendix is adequate, or (c) file an agreed joint appendix with appel-lee.\u201d In further explanation we stated that the burden falls upon the appellant to prepare \u201ca prima facie complete record.\u201d Ibid. In the present appendix there appear constantly throughout the testimony of the various witnesses asterisks indicating omissions. In other words, the record is prima facie iwcom-plete.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The bracketed page numbering of the original transcript (very properly included in the appendix) reveals that omitted material sometimes covers several pages. None of the exhibits is separately printed, and they are very apparently only partially reproduced. There is no stipulation (which must, in any event, be approved by the court) that the exhibits need not be printed. There is no stipulation by appellee that the appendix is \u201cadequate.\u201d The record appendix is not a joint one.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">In the face of this failure to meet any of the alternatives set forth in Haddad v. Border Express, Inc., supra, appellants assert in their reply brief that \u201call relevant portions\u201d of the exhibits were read into the record. They further point out that the appendix is \u201csubstantial,\u201d and say that for this reason it \u201cshould be assumed to be a prima facie complete record.\u201d Further, after acknowledging that testimony was deliberately omitted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>they invite \u201ccomparison with the actual record on file in the office of the Clerk\u201d to show that no omissions were material, We cannot reread our opinion in Haddad without believing that we made it wholly clear that the purpose of the rule was to avoid just such assumptions, and the necessity of just such an undertaking.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\">Although we will not, accordingly, review the evidence in detail, we do observe that there is no readily apparent miscarriage of justice. It is true that not only was there a wide variance between Rad-lo\u2019s account and Chernack\u2019s, but Radio was self-contradictory and inconsistent to an extraordinary degree. Had Chernack been reasonably consistent we might find ourselves sympathetic. He was not, however. Even though we might think the other blacker we are little tempted to disturb a jury\u2019s choice between the pot and the kettle.</p>\n<p id=\"a2j-dedup-0\">Appellants assert that the trial was unfair in that the plaintiff was allowed to appeal to the jury\u2019s sympathy and prejudice. Not only was much of what is now complained of not objected to at the time, but none of it was so serious as to call for appellate action. Appellants\u2019 further complaint that the court failed to charge that certain possibly prejudicial, but admissible, evidence should have been restricted to the count for fraud was not properly preserved. It is poor practice to request (erroneously) an instruction that evidence be not considered at all, and then simply save one\u2019s exception to the denial of the request by number without pointing out to the court that it would be appropriate, and desirable, to give the request in a more limited form. If a matter is of fundamental importance it may be sufficient merely to alert the court. Cf. Gorin v. United States, 1 Cir., 1963, 313 F.2d 641, 654, cert. den. 374 U.S. 829, 83 S.Ct. 1870, 10 L.Ed.2d 1052. But where it is less so a request must be in reasonably appropriate form, or in some way the court\u2019s attention must be specifically called to counsel\u2019s wishes. Simply referring to a request by number, when only a part of it is correct, does not aecom-plish this. We have reviewed the charge as a whole in the light of the several requests and find it without prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"AgN\">We will deal briefly with the propriety of permitting the jury to award interest. The law of Rhode Island may be somewhat strict in this respect, and we will assume that in an ordinary contractual suit for unliquidated damages interest is not allowed ab initio. Providence Transit Concrete Corp. v. New England Concrete Corp., 1940, 65 R.I. 430, 437, 14 A.2d 807. This does not help appellants. The gravamen of the action against Chernack is that the salaries of Radio and Chernack, although not agreed to as to amount, were to be equal. Chernack, in Rhode Island, han-y^e books while Radio carried on the company business in Japan. Chernack caused the corporation to pay larger salaries to himself than to Radio, asserting all the while that the company was doing badly and that each was getting the same. It would seem clear that the dates that payments were due Radio, and the amounts, were fixed and liquidated by Chernack\u2019s own actions, so that he can have no complaint as to the imposition 0f interest. See O\u2019Brien v. Slefkin, 1958, 88 R.I. 264, 271, 147 A.2d 183.</p>\n<p id=\"aap-dedup-0\">su^ against Overseas was the cost of maintenance of Radio in Japan, allegedly to become due only in such amounts as the company could afford. It could be found that because of Chernack\u2019s representations regarding the company\u2019s finances Radio made no demands for full maintenance. Under these circumstances it might be said that the present claim was unliquidated both as to time and amount within the Rhode Island decisions. On the other hand, this very fact was due to what could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>found to be actionable misconduct by Chernack acting for the corporation, which, in turn, proximately caused Radio not to make a liquidated and timely demand which would have warranted the recovery of interest. The Rhode Island court takes an equitable view of the obligation to pay interest. See Pearson v. Ryan, 1919, 42 R.I. 83, 90, 105 A. 513, 3 A.L.R. 805. We believe the court was correct in permitting interest to be recovered in this action as special, or additional, damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-10\">. Cf. Esso Standard Oil Co. v. Secatore\u2019s, Inc., 1 Cir., 1957, 246 F.2d 17, 22-23, cert. den. 355 U.S. 834, 78 S.Ct. 54, 2 L.Ed.2d 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b223-16\">. Plaintiff\u2019s first witness was Chernack, called for cross-examination under the rule. A spot check indicates 24 omissions in the first 50 printed pages of testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A5HV\">. We do not mean by tbis that we are in favor of not abbreviating a record appendix. Far from it. Cf. Haddad v. Border Express, Inc., supra.
