It is alleged that this information did not come to the attention of counsel for the appellant herein until after this appeal was perfected. No action was taken to bring the matter before the district judge. These claims cannot be considered by this Court on this appeal. The proper procedure for the presentation of the questions raised by these claims is by motion in the District Court for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-17\">By reason of the claims of the appellant, as above stated, said appellant is given leave to file a motion for new trial in the District Court within two weeks from the date of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-18\">It is hereby ordered that consideration and decision of this appeal be held in abeyance pending the filing of a motion for a new trial in the District Court, and, if such motion is filed, it is further ordered that consideration and decision of the appeal be continued until the trial judge certifies to this Court whether he will grant the motion for a new trial or deny the same if the case is remanded to the District Court for a ruling on the motion.
