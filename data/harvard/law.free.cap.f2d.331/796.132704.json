McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 150, 71 S.Ct. 624, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1950) (separate opinion).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A199\">In our 1960 holding we tried, perhaps too tersely because the point seemed so plain, to make clear that decisions in the large matters of basic national policy, as of foreign policy, present no judicially cognizable issues and hence the courts are not empowered to decide them. We paraphrase our earlier opinion in em- , . . ,, , , , : ... ,, phasizmg that to temporize with these fundamental propositions by holding this case moot because the United States is presently committed to a suspension of atmospheric testing is to take some risk, however slight or remote, of seeming to invite further resort to the courts should testing be resumed. We are unwilling to suggest, even so indirectly, any erosion 0f the fundamental principle that the executive action challenged by the plead--\u00a1ngS piain\u00a1y falls jn that area where the Executive and Legislative Branches are gupreme and finalj reviewable only by the electorate, not by the courts. The language of the Court in Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 111, 68 S.Ct. 431, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948), is very much in point here;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayw-dedup-0\">\u00abSuch deeisions are wholly confided by our Constitution to the political departments of the government, Executive and Legislative. They are delicate; complex, and involve large elements of propheey. They are and should be undertaken onjy by thoge directly responsible to the people whose we]fare they adyance or imperiL They are deeisions of a kind for whieh the Judiciary has neither aptitudS) faciiities nor responsibility and which has long been held to belong in the domain of political p0Wer not gubject to judiciaI intru_ gion or inquiry.

In framing policies relating to the great issues of national defense and security, the people are and must be, in a sense, at the mercy of their elected representatives. But the basic and important corollary is that the people may remove their elected representatives as they cannot dismiss United States Judges. This elementary fact about the nature of our system, which seems to have escaped notice occasionally must make manifest to judges that we are neither gods nor godlike, but judicial officers with narrow and limited authority. Our entire System of Government would suffer incalculable mischief should judges attempi/ to interpose the judicial will above that of the Congress and President, even were we so bold as to assume that we can make better decisions on such issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-24\">.

The plaintiffs charge that the defendants, together with their counterparts in the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, have \u201ccaused the detonation of nuclear weapons in the air, on the ground, and under water,\u201d causing the plaintiffs \u201cto be damaged genetically, somatically and psychologically.\u201d They seek to enjoin such activity in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"AdTb\">Since the institution of this suit, the United States and 107 other nations have; signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-14\">\u201cSeeking to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time, determined to continue negotiations to this end, and desiring to put an end', to the contamination of man\u2019s environment by radioactive substances,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-15\">* \u00bb * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-16\">\u201cEach of the Parties to this Treaty undertakes to prohibit, to prevent, and not to carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion, or any other nuclear explosion, at any place-under its jurisdiction or control, -\u00bb \u2022\u00bb *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-18\">\u201cin the atmosphere; beyond its-limits, including outer space; or underwater, including territorial waters or high seas * * *.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-19\">Accordingly, there is not such a likelihood that further injury will occur as to require decision of the delicate questions presented. I would therefore \u201creverse-the judgment and remand the case to-the District Court with directions to-dismiss the complaint without prejudice.\u201d See my opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in Pauling v.

Moreover the opinion attributes greater limitations to judicial power than the Constitution requires or the decision in this case makes-necessary. See Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 164-165, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963), and cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>there cited; Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v.

Although certain underground testing is not banned by the Treaty, the parties thereto specifically undertake to seek \u201ca treaty resulting in the permanent banning of all nuclear test explosions, including all such explosions underground.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
