She seeks, <em>inter alia, </em>to have the election of a Board of Directors held invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Defendant moved in the District Court for judgment on the pleadings. The judge treated the motion as one for summary judgment, and granted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">The appellant\u2019s case with respect to the deficiency in the proxy statement was correctly held to be insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">There is no merit in appellant\u2019s claim that she was prejudiced by Judge Ryan\u2019s treating the motion for judgment on the pleadings as a motion for summary judgment. The procedure adopted by Judge Ryan is expressly authorized by Rule 12 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The occasion was a proper one for the application of that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-16\">Appellant\u2019s claims with respect to deprivation of constitutional rights by reason of Judge Ryan\u2019s sealing a statement which she submitted, have previously been considered by this court and found to be without substance. Parker v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 320 F.2d 937 (2d Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-17\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
