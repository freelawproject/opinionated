Neither has this Court ever stated that proof of the hypothetical existence at a point far distant from the-permanent residence of the claimant of a limited number of jobs within his physical capability requires, the denial by-the Secretary of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-11\">The duty of the administrator is to hear the evidence as to the physical capabilities of the claimant, to consider the nature and type of work for which he is still qualified, if any, and to determine whether the claimant\u2019s failure to-obtain a job in one of these categories results from his physical condition rather than from any other cause. Celebrezzev. O\u2019Brient, 5 Cir., 323 F.2d 989. He-must determine whether there is a reasonable opportunity for the claimant to-compete, in the manner normally pursued by persons genuinely seeking work, for a job within his determined capabilities. In making this decision he must, of course, consider the matter of reasonable-availability of jobs within the geographical areas which the claimant would normally be expected to consider if regularly in the labor market. The administrator is required to make findings and conclusions, in which he takes all of these-factors into consideration. When he does so, if there is evidentiary support in the-record* for his findings, they are to be-given finality and are not to be reversed or modified by the Courts. We find nothing in the cases of Butler v. Flemming,. 5 Cir., 288 F.2d 591, Hayes v. Celebrezze, 5 Cir., 311 F.2d 648, or Page v. Celebrezze, 5 Cir., 311 F.2d 757, strongly relied on by the trial court, that in any way conflicts with what we decide here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-12\">We think the administrative record here fully supports the Secretary\u2019s determination. The trial court erred in overturning it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-13\">The judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for the entry of a final judgment for the Secretary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
