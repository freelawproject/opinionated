There was no allegation or proof of fraud or misappropriation on Parker\u2019s part, but only that he had used bad judgment in spending large sums for the rehabilitation of houses and buildings, some of which he borrowed without court authorization, and so had been unable to pay the major portion of the income to the sole beneficiary, Howard University. Parker appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-19\">Although appellant\u2019s renovation program made it impossible to follow a schedule of fixed payments to the University, he has paid during his tenure sums which aggregate a substantial amount, and we note that the corpus is considerably larger than when he took charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-20\">The removal of Parker as trustee might be construed by some as a reflection on his integrity, which apparently was not intended by anybody. \u2019 Moreover, the parties before us expressed willingness that the trust be terminated, as there is no necessity for its continuation since Howard University is capable of handling the corpus for its own benefit without the expense of commissions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>trustees. We remand the case to the District Court for reconsideration in the light of the circumstances just detailed. It may decide to set aside the order of removal, vacate the appointment of successor trustees, order the immediate termination of the trust, and the payment and delivery of the corpus to Howard University.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
