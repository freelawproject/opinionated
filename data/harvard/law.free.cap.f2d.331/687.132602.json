The motion filed was in the alternative; <em>i. e., </em>likewise to correct an illegal sentence under Rule 35, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">To understand this appeal, we must note its background. We quote from ap-pellee\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-11\">\u201cAppellant, Laurence Frederick Anthony, was indicted by the Federal Grand Jury on March 27, 1957, for violations :of Title 21, United States Code, Section 176(a) (sic, 176a) for selling 5 ounces of marihuana on Feb. 23,1957 and 2 pounds, 5 ounces of marihuana on March 11, 1957, and was convicted on May 23, 1957. On June 10, 1957, the Honorable William C. Mathes, United States District Judge sentenced the appellant, Laurence Frederick Anthony, to the custody of the Attorney General for a period of 20 years and a fine of $5,000 to be paid to the United States for the offense charged in Count One of the indictment and 20 years for the offense charged in Count Four of the indictment, said two 20 year sentences to run consecutively for a total period of 40 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-14\">\u201cA timely notice of appeal was filed and the judgment of conviction was affirmed by this Honorable Court in Anthony v. United States, 256 F.2d 50 (Ninth Cir. 1958). On June 9, 1959, appellant filed in the United States District Court a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to Title 28, United States Code, Section 2255, alleging insufficiency of the evidence as grounds therefore and said motion was denied on August 25,1959. On November 9,1959, appellant again filed a motion pursuant to Title 28, United States Code, Section 2255, to vacate the sentence of the District Court imposed on June 10, 1957, alleging basically the same reasons as in his first 2255 motion and his second motion to vacate sentence was denied on December 31, 1959.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae0f\">\u201cCounsel was appointed by this Honorable Court for the appellant on May 7, 1960. Thereafter, a motion for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>and to proceed on typewritten briefs was denied by this court on December 6, 1960. In February of 1961, the appellee, United States of America, moved this court to dismiss the appeal from the denial of the 2255 motion for failure to prosecute the appeal as provided in Rule 73 (sic, 39(a)) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Said motion was granted on March 6, 1961. Cer-tiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court on October 9, 1961, which is reported in Anthony v. United States, 368 U.S. 852 182 S.Ct. 85, 7 L.Ed.2d 49] (1961).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-16\">Jurisdiction below rested on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>2255; Rule 35, Fed.R.Crim.P. Jurisdiction here exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Counsel for appellant accepts and adopts the court\u2019s statement of facts appearing in 256 F.2d 50, when his conviction was affirmed. (Op. Brf. p. 3.) We note here, as we noted there, that the insufficiency of the evidence to convict on either count was not previously raised, but rather four alleged errors in the introduetion of evidence. For that reason, it was not necessary for the entire evidence in detail to be summarized in our Prevl0Us opinion, nor even to attempt summarize its important features, For that reason it becomes necessary to state the facts, and we adopt the statement made by the government as appears in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Three alleged errors are raised, which we will consider in turn:</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><em>I </em>\u2014 The <em>trial court lacked jurisdiction because of the absence of any substantial evidence of possession of marijuana.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">From the recital in note 1, there exists ample evidence from which a proper and lawful inference of control and dominion over, and hence possession of, the marijuana involved, by the appellant may be drawn by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">\u201cIt is true,\u201d admits appellant, \u201cthat there is a possible inference that he [appellant] indeed delivered the mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>juana, prior to the two sales, in brown-paper bags; that he carried his supply in his car [etc].\u201d This being so, the possible inference becomes a proper inference of the fact of possession \u2014 of dominion and control of the marijuana\u2014 and once made by the trier of fact, and determined by him to be substantial, clear and convincing proof, such a determination of fact is binding on us. Williams v. United States, 9 Cir. 1961, 290 F.2d 451. The fact that <em>all </em>evidence might be circumstantial (though such state of facts does not here exist) would not prevent the finding of the jurisdictional fact of possession. Rodella v. United States, 9 Cir. 1960, 286 F.2d 306, and cases cited, p. 312, cert. den. 365 U.S. 889, 81 S.Ct. 1042, 6 L.Ed.2d 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Appellant urges that the only two decisions of the Supreme Court ever to uphold the validity of the statutory presumption established defendant\u2019s possession by \u201cdirect proof\u201d as \u201cactual and physical,\u201d not \u201cconstructive\u201d possession. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">In Roviaro v. United States, 1957, 353 U.S. 53, 57, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639, the government agent saw just what the government agent here saw \u2014 there the defendant carrying a small package (here a brown paper bag). In Yee Hem v. United States, 1925, 268 U.S. 178, 182, 45 S.Ct. 470, 471, 69 L.Ed. 904, the facts merely show: \u201cThe plaintiff * * * <em>at the time of his arrest </em>* * * was. found in possession of and concealing a quantity of smoking opium.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Here, at the time of appellant\u2019s, arrest in an auto, marked money used previously to buy marijuana was found on him,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and two bags of marijuana were found in his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">But even were the distinction urged by appellant to' be accepted, it would <em>not </em>prove that because actual physical possession existed in two cases before the Supreme Court, a different rule would be expected were the possession only a constructive possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">Appellant also requests us to consider Harris v. United States, 1959, 359 U.S. 19, 79 S.Ct. 560, 3 L.Ed.2d 597, reh. den. 359 U.S. 976, 79 S.Ct. 873, 3 L.Ed. 2d 843. In Harris the Supreme Court merely states: \u201cThe Government introduced into evidence the heroin itself, and testimony that petitioner had been in possession of it.\u201d (359 U.S. p. 20, 79 S. Ct. p. 562, 3 L.Ed.2d 597) But a review of the facts disclosed in the opinion of the court of appeals (8 Cir. 1957, 248 F. 2d 196) reveals no \u201cactual, physical\u201d possession of the heroin in defendant. Harris, but merely that he was identified by one of two police officers as being physically present in a <em>room; in </em>which room were two other persons (Robinson and Stamps) ; one of whom (Robinson) \u201chad his hand in the white powder [on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>a mirror] on the bed.\u201d (248 F.2d p. 198) Harris claimed an alibi, supported by the testimony of one Mason (allegedly the true third man in the room); one of the two codefendants, and his common-law wife. Yet the court of appeals stated there was competent evidence Harris \u201cwas present with the other defendants in the room at 4567 McMillan where unstamped heroin was being handled, that Harris was \u2018shown to have had possession of it,\u2019 and to be a \u2018person in whose possession it was found\u2019 within the meaning of the sections of the statute on which the indictment was rested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">These, facts disclosed by the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, plus the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance relying on the presumption based on defendant\u2019s failure to explain his constructive possession, strongly indicate that the Supreme Court will require \u201cdirect evidence,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but not necessarily require actual proof of physical possession before it will sanction the application of the presumption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">We hold there was clear and convincing proof by substantial evidence of appellant\u2019s possession of the prohibited drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\"><em>II </em>\u2014 The <em>trial court lacked jurisdiction because there was no evidence of unlawful importation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Here appellant raises the question as to whether the presumption created by the fact of possession, under the terms of the second paragraph of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> can logically be applied to marijuana, known to occasionally grow in the United States, as it has been applied to the products of the opium poppy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> known not to be grown in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-16\">In Caudillo v. United States, 9 Cir. 1958, 253 F.2d 513, cert. den. sub nom. Romero v. United States, 357 U.S. 931, 79 S.Ct. 1375, 2 L.Ed.2d 1373, we avoided ruling on the question here again raised by finding sufficient evidence in the record from which an inference could logically be drawn that the marijuana had come from outside the United States, <em>i. e., </em>that there existed a rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed. That was because the marijuana was \u201cunmanicured,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>\u201cit had seeds and stems and sticks mixed with the marihuana leaves.\u201d (Cf. discussion in Caudillo, 253 F.2d pp. 515\u2014 516.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-17\">There are four reasons why we conclude that here competent evidence existed of unlawful importation, and hence there was jurisdiction;</p>\n<p id=\"b744-18\"><em>First: </em>There was evidence in the record that on February 23, 1957, when the first sale was consummated (Count I) the marijuana allegedly brought by defendant in the paper bag was examined in codefendant Landry\u2019s bedroom. When the second purchase was made on February 27, 1957 (in which defendant Anthony was not seen to have had any connection and with which sale he was not charged), Landry referred to the previous February 23rd sale, and that \u201cthe last time in the bedroom marijuana <em>seed </em>and <em>debris </em>had been scattered everywhere and [Landry] * * * didn\u2019t want that to happen again.\u201d (Emphasis add<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>\u25a0ed.) It could have been reasonably inferred that the seed and debris would \u25a0come only from \u201cunmanicured\u201d marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Thus, if we assume the trial court \u2022could take judicial knowledge of the <em>kind </em>\u25a0of marijuana grown in the United States (and how it differs from the imported marijuana, and defendant requests the court to take judicial knowledge that marijuana sometimes grows in the United States), there exists sufficient competent evidence to call the presumption into play on behalf of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In Butler v. United States, 9 Cir. 1959, 273 F.2d 436, we relied (p. 439) upon the same type of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\"><em>Secondly: </em>In Costello v. United States, 9 Cir. 1963, 324 F.2d 260, cert. den. 376 U.S. 930, 84 S.Ct. 699, 11 L.Ed.2d 650, we went further than we had in Caudillo and Butler, but concluded, on the record of that case, particularly where \u201cno attempt was made to make a record as to \"the conditions or restrictions under \u201cwhich the drug there involved * * * may lawfully be possessed or used,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> presence of \u201cmanicured\u201d marijuana was not sufficient to render the statute invalid. As in Costello, we here go no further than to repeat \u201con this record we \u25a0 cannot say that the statute is unconstitutional either on its face or as applied to this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ada-dedup-1\"> <em>Third: </em>This is before us as an .appeal from a denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was not created to substitute for or take the place \u25a0of an appeal. Fiano v. United States, 9 Cir. 1961, 291 F.2d 113, cert. den. 368 U.S. 943, 82 S.Ct. 380, 7 L.Ed.2d 340; Perno v. United States, 9 Cir. 1957, 245 F.2d 60, cert. den. 362 U.S. 964, 80 S. Ct. 880, 4 L.Ed.2d 878. The question now raised was not raised on the appellant\u2019s \u2022original appeal. (Cf. 256 F.2d 50.) Labeling the. constitutionality of the presumption clause a matter of \u201cjurisdic-does not make it one. There is sufficient evidence in this record to make the applicability of the second paragraph of \u00a7 176a one of law, and not a question of jurisdiction. There are no facts to demonstrate a lack of jurisdiction, and counsel cites us no cases to demonstrate the lack. \u201cThe presumption created is \u2018a rule, not of substantive law at all, but merely of evidence.\u2019 Ng Choy Fong v. United States, 9 Cir., 1917, 245 F. 305, 307; Stein v. United States, 9 Cir., 1948, 166 F.2d 851, certiorari denied 334 U.S. 844, 68 S.Ct. 1512, 92 L.Ed. 1768.\u201d Butler v. United States, 9 Cir. 1959, 273 F. 2d 436, 438. Hernandez v. United States, 9 Cir. 1962, 300 F.2d 114, 118. tion\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\"><em>Fourth: </em>Other courts of appeal have had no difficulty in upholding the application of the presumption to marijuana, despite its growth in the United States. United States v. Kapsalis, 7 Cir. 1963, 313 F.2d 875; United States v. Gibson, 2 Cir. 1962, 310 F.2d 79. And, for whatever it may be worth, we note the United States Supreme Court denied <em>certiorari </em>in the Kapsalis case, supra, 374 U.S. 856, 83 S.Ct. 1911, 10 L.Ed.2d 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\"><em>Ill </em>\u2014 The <em>forty year sentence is a denial of due process, and the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">There is no merit to this point. The sentence was within the term prescribed by the Congress. The punishments prescribed, fine and imprisonment, are and always haye been customary punishments for crime in this country, and cannot be said to be either cruel or unusual. The defendant was convicted of two sales on two different days and under different circumstances. Appellant\u2019s argument with respect to hypothetical consecutive maximum sentences for (a) receiving, (b) concealing, (c) buying, (d) selling, (e) transporting, (f) facilitating the concealment, (g) facilitating the transportation, etc., etc., <em>ad infinitum, </em>\u201con one or perhaps two oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>casions immediately connected with one another\u201d makes no sense. \u201cPunish the incorrigible recidivist as Congress intended,\u201d urges appellant, \u201cand not the first offender.\u201d Appellant was convicted of two separate offenses which occurred on two separate occasions. The punishment fixed for each offense was within the limit prescribed by Congress for that offense, and the court had the discretion to order the sentences to run consecutively rather than concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"AUbn\">Nor does it aid appellant to urge upon us the problem of disparate sentences. That is a problem which will someday doubtless be solved by statutory enactment of some system for the federal courts similar to the indeterminate sen-fence law of California and other states, It is the duty of the judiciary to study the problem, and to aid in solving it, but not by judicial legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahbc\">It is urged that the punishment imposed is excessive. On the record that is before us (which, for example, does not include the presentenee report), the punishment imposed, while within limits of permitted discretion, does appear to be severe. We note that the judge who denied the motion here on appeal was also the sentencing judge, and he suggested to counsel that Anthony should seek executive clemency.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This seems to be appellant\u2019s only present remedy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI2j\">thoro \u00edq mu rule in Hip fpJpral criminal^praetice which is firmly established, it is that the appellate court has no control over a sentence which is within the limits allowed by a statute.\u201d Gurera v. United States, 8 Cir. 1930, 40 F.2d 338, 340-341; Brown v. United States, 9 Cir. 1955, 222 F.2d 293, 298; Pependrea v. United States, 9 Cir. 1960, 275 F.2d 325, 330.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a1e-dedup-0\">The denial of the motion to vacate sentence is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\">. \u201cFederal Narcotic Agent William C. Gilkey first saw Appellant\u2019s eodefendant Lucas Landry on February 23, 1957, in Los Angeles, at about 2:00 in the afternoon. The two men had a conversation in which Gilkey asked Landry if the latter knew where the agent could secure a connection for marihuana since he was interested in establishing himself in the marihuana trafiic in Pasadena. Defendant Landry stated that he might be able to supply Gilkey with a half pound of marihuana later on in the afternoon. Landry told Gilkey to call him hack at 7:00 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"Azvv\">\u201cThat evening Gilkey called defendant Landry on the telephone and asked the defendant if he had the half pound of marihuana. Landry said he didn\u2019t have it then and Gilkey was to call him back within an hour. Gilkey did call back within an hour and Landry asked him to go over to his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">\u201cGilkey did so at approximately 8:15 P.M., and went in. Gilkey asked Landry if he had the half pound of marihuana and Landry said he didn\u2019t have it then hut that he had made contact with a man who was to bring marihuana to his house. Gilkey agreed to wait. Later in this conversation, when Landry approached Gilkey with the possibility of the two of them going into the marihuana business together, Landry stated that he could possibly set himself up on the West side, a friend could set himself up out in Compton and Gilkey would cover Pasadena. The idea was for the three of them to pool their money and buy marihuana in large quantities, thus doubling the investment being put into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">\u201cImmediately thereafter the telephone rang and Landry spoke to someone. He stated, \u2018Bring it on. Stud is here.\u2019 Then Landry told Gilkey that the \u2018stuff\u2019 would be there in a few minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">\u201cAbout fifteen minutes later, appellant Laurence Frederick Anthony arrived at the apartment house in his 1947 Chevrolet and went inside carrying a brown paper bag of the type normally obtained in a grocery store. Landry asked appellant to step into the bedroom located by the living room where Gilkey was waiting. Appellant took the bag into the bedroom. It appeared to Gilkey that the bag contained something. Landry and Anthony remained in the bedroom for about five or ten minutes and then Landry came into the living room and asked Gilkey for $35.00, which was the agreed price for one-half pound of marihuana. Gilkey gave Landry $35.00 of official advance funds. Landry took the $35.00 back into the bedroom where appellant was waiting while Gilkey remained in the living room. Two or three minutes later, appellant left through the front room. Landry then returned to the living room and asked Gilkey to go into the bedroom and see what he had purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">\u201cGilkey went into the bedroom with Landry who opened a drawer in the dresser in which was a brown paper bag similar to the one that appellant had brought with him. Gilkey looked in the bag at Landry\u2019s invitation and they poured the contents of the bag into a newspaper. Upon examining it the substance appeared to Gilkey to be similar to bulk marihuana. Thereafter, the two men measured the quantity of marihuana contained in the bag and Gilkey carried it outside to the Government automobile where the container was initialed.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">\u201cIn the meantime, appellant had gotten into his Chevrolet and left the vicinity. He was there about ten minutes altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">\u201cAgent Gilkey saw the defendant Landry again on February 27, 1957, at approximately 8 :45 P.M., in Los Angeles. He had telephoned Landry earlier and had asked him if he could supply another pound of marihuana. Landry had told Gilkey that the agent would have to call him again because his \u2018connection\u2019 would not be home until later. A \u2018connection\u2019 was a source of narcotics. Gilkey agreed and telephoned Landry shortly after 7 :00 P.M. At that time Landry still had not heard from his connection but told Gilkey to come on by his house within an hour. \u201cAt about 8 :45 P.M. Gilkey arrived at Landry\u2019s home and went in. Gilkey ask<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>ed Landry if the latter had the marihuana and the answer was yes. Gilkey was asked to come into the bathroom and see the marihuana, Landry explaining that the last time in the bedroom marihuana seed and debris had been scattered everywhere and he didn\u2019t want that to happen again. Landry told Gilkey the marihuana would cost him $70.00 since the price was still $35.00 for each half pound. The agent examined one of the bags and told Landry it looked all right. Landry again approached Gilkey with the idea of the two of them going into the marihuana business together and Gilkey said he would think about it. He then gave Landry $70.-00 of official advance funds and Landry told him to call him when the agent got baek into town. Gilkey then left after stating he might possibly do business with Landry the following weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">\u201cIn the meantime, appellant Anthony had been observed parked near the apartment as agent Gilkey went in. After Gilkey left, codefendant Landry came out and went over to appellant\u2019s car, got in and stayed a few minutes. He then got out and appellant left. (Appellant was not charged as a defendant in Count 2 relating to the above transaction.)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">\u201cAgent Gilkey saw defendant Landry again on March 7, 1957, having previously called him at approximately 5 :00 in the afternoon. Gilkey asked Landry if the latter could get two pounds of marihuana. Defendant Landry said to call him baek around seven o\u2019clock. After a couple of other calls Landry instructed the agent to go to his house, which Gilkey did around 8:15 P.M. Landry invited him in and said he had two pounds of marihuana. He went to the rear of his house and returned with the marihuana. It was contained in a brown bag which codefendant Landry was carrying with him as he came baek into the front portion of the place. Meanwhile, appellant Anthony\u2019s car was parked at the rear of the building. Inside, Gilkey was told by Landry that the price of the two pounds was $140.00, as it was still selling at $35.00 a half pound. Gilkey took the brown bag and walked to a Government automobile. While this happened, appellant had gotten in his car and circled the block, returned and parked near the apartment. After Gilkey left, codefendant Landry came out to appellant\u2019s car and got in for a few minutes. Then he went baek to the apartment and appellant departed. Later, at his office Agent Gilkey found that he had been shorted on the quantity of marihuana and immediately telephoned Landry in that respect. Landry said the marihuana had been brought to him that way and the \u2018man\u2019 was the person responsible for the shortage in weight. Gilkey asked Landry to do something to make the weight up and the latter said he would look into it on a later date. (Appellant was not charged in Count Three relating to this transaction.)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">\u201cThe next time Gilkey saw Landry was on the 11th day of March, 1957, at the defendant\u2019s home at around 8:15 P.M. Earlier that afternoon he had spoken with Landry over the telephone. Gilkey asked the defendant if he had spoken with his source of supply about making up the half pound difference in the marihuana which had been shorted. Gilkey was told that the \u2018man\u2019 said he would make up one-quarter pound but not one-half a pound. Gilkey then asked Landry if the agent could pick up two pounds of marihuana from him that evening. Landry told him that he could do so with a telephone call being made in advance of his visit. About seven o\u2019clock, Gilkey phoned Landry, who stated that he hadn\u2019t heard anything as yet. Gilkey phoned back at 7:45 and arrangements were made for him to drop by Landry\u2019s house to pick up the marihuana. Gilkey arrived at Landry\u2019s house, parking his car in the rear driveway according to Landry\u2019s instructions. He then went into the house. About five or ten minutes later the bell rang. Appellant had gotten out of his car and walked to the rear portion of the address. Landry answered the door at the rear. He went out to appellant\u2019s car and returned to the rear with a brown paper bag. When he reappeared in the living room, Landry had the brown paper sack in his hand and said to Gilkey \u2018Here\u2019s your stuff.\u2019 Gilkey glanced in the top of the bag and looked in observing a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>stance that appeared to be marihuana. Landry again approached him with the idea of going into the marihuana business together. Gilkey told him he would talk to him about it later and gave Landry $140.00 which had been requested as the price of two pounds of marihuana. Landry asked Gilkey to step through the kitchen and leave by the rear door which he did. As he got into his automobile he observed an automobile parked directly behind him blocking the drivev'ay leading to the street. Gilkey asked Landry to do something about moving the car and the latter walked over to the automobile and spoke through the window. Gilkey recognized appellant as being in the front seat of the vehicle. Shortly thereafter, Anthony backed the automobile out and Gilkey followed with his own automobile, leaving the premises. Codefendant Landry then went over to appellant\u2019s ear and got in for a few minutes. Shortly thereafter appellant left. The bills comprising the $140.00 given to Landry on this occasion had been noted previously according to serial numbers. Appellant was arrested at approximately 9 :00 P.M., on the same evening pursuant to a warrant issued previously. The $140.00 was found on his person as well as the two bags of marihuana in his car.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b743-13\">.
