The district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Rule 12(b) (6), Fed.R.Civ.P. We think the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The South Bend Truck Company, defendant\u2019s assignor, sold the chattel to Theodore Schulz under an Indiana conditional sales contract, executed in Indiana. The contract showed Schulz\u2019 post office address was New Buffalo, Michigan. Schulz defaulted in payments, and the chattel was repossessed by defendant. Schulz later filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, Southern Division,' and plaintiff was appointed trustee. Plaintiff brought this suit to recover the chattel or its value on behalf of Schulz\u2019 creditors who had extended credit to him while the chattel was in his possession.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-18\">The ultimate issue on this appeal is whether Indiana or Michigan law should be applied to determine the validity of defendant\u2019s lien as against Schulz\u2019 creditors. The district court decided that Indiana law applied, under which the contract would be construed as a conditional sales contract, not required to be recorded either in Indiana or Michigan to preserve defendant\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-19\"><em> </em>It is our opinion that the trial court erroneously applied the general rule that \u201cthe law of the place where a contract is made or entered into governs with respect to its nature, validity, obligation, and interpretation.\u201d 15 C.J.S. Conflict of Laws \u00a7 lib. The error was due to the trial court\u2019s failure to accept as true the allegations of fact made,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which, if proven, would justify the inference that the defendant\u2019s assignor knew that Schulz was taking the chattel immediately to Michigan, and consented thereto. On that inference it is our opinion that the law of Michigan applies to render the contract a chattel mortgage, and that by failing to record the contract in Michigan vendor lost his lien.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-20\">Our opinion is based on the decision in Enterprise Optical Mfg. Co. v. Tim-mer, 71 F.2d 295 (6th Cir. 1934), founded on the broad rule in Michigan against \u201csecret liens\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the rule \u201cspecifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>established\u201d by the decisions of the Sixth Circuit<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agx\">\u201cwhere the parties to a contract * * * contemplate that the property is to go at once, and before any use by the vendee, into another state, and there remain quasi permanently, the law of the situs thus given to the property will control the application of a recording statute.\u201d 71 F.2d at 296.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acn\">In Enterprise the contract for the sale of goods was completed in Illinois and the goods were delivered f. o. b. vendor\u2019s factory in Chicago, to be shipped to Michigan for use there.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was conceded, as here, that under the law of Michigan the contract would be construed as a chattel mortgage. There, as here, vendor argued that the law of the place where the contract was completed controls the interpretation of the contract. Thus, it argued, under Illinois law the contract would be a conditional sales contract, not required to be recorded either in Illinois or Michigan to preserve the lien. The court dismissed the vendor\u2019s argument as \u201cconfus[ing] * * * nomenclature with substance.\u201d The court noted with approval a statement from Potter Mfg. Co. v. Arthur, 220 F. 843, 845 (6th Cir. 1915), that even \u201cif the question were open * * * it would be ruled, and with the same result, by Hervey v. Locomotive Works, 93 U.S. 664, 671 [23 L.Ed. 1003] (1876).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"aoq-dedup-0\">Defendant argues that In re Steen, 257 F.2d 297 (7th Cir. 1958), In re Princeton Rubber Co., 272 F.2d 197 (7th Cir. 1959), and Cook &amp; Sons Equipment, Inc. v. Killen, 277 F.2d 607 (9th Cir. 1960), supP\u00b0rt contention that the law of Indiana) the place of delivery, governs whether or n\u00b0t the contract must be recorded to preserve the vendor\u2019s lien. The cases, are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"A-O\">Cook did not involve third parties to. the contract, but involved the vendor and a purchaser from vendee, who took with notice of vendor\u2019s lien. The reason for the decision in Princeton was that the fundamental purpose of notice to vendee\u2019s, creditors was met by vendor\u2019s possession Ohio and New Jersey until delivery in Illinois where the contract was recorded,</p>\n<p id=\"AuP\">In Steen this court held that the vendor\u2019s assignee\u2019s lien was not good as against creditors of the vendee in Illinois, because the contract was not recorded in Texas where the chattels were located when the contract was made and where they were delivered to vendee, In the case before us the vendor\u2019s lien, was good in Indiana, the state of delivery, although it was not recorded. The question here, not reached in Steen, is whether the lien was lost as against third parties to the contract when the vendee, with vendor\u2019s knowledge, took the goods, from Indiana to Michigan, and the vendor did not record the contract in Michigan as required.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The reason for recording statutes is to give notice to creditors of the vendor\u2019s lien. In re Princeton Rubber Co., 272 F.2d 197,199 (7th Cir. 1959). When defendant made the contract knowing the chattel was to go to Michigan, he submitted the contract to Michigan law, was charged with knowledge of that law,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and was required to record the contract there to preserve his lien against claims of creditors who depend on the vendee\u2019s indicia of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-11\">. Plaintiff, as trustee, stands in the same position as bankrupt\u2019s creditors in determining the validity of defendant\u2019s repossession of the chattel. 52 Stat. 879 (1938), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110, sub. e (1) (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b299-12\">. \u201c[A] complaint should not be dismissed for insufficiency <em>unless it appears to a certainty that plaintiff is entitled to no relief under any state of facts which cotild he proved in support of the claim.\u201d </em>2 Moore, Federal Practice 1 12,08 at 2245.

Goodrich, 49 Mich. 65, 12 N.W. 913 (1882), and Corbett v. Littlefield, 84 Mich. 30, 47 N.W. 581, 11 L.R..A. 95 (1890), where mortgagees\u2019 liens were lost even though the chattels were brought in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>to Michigan <em>without the knoioledge or consent of the mortgagees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMl\">Later an equally divided court in Metro-Plan, Inc. v. Kotcher-Turner, Inc., 296 Mich. 400, 296 N.W. 304 (1941), sustained a mortgagee\u2019s lien where the chattel was brought into Michigan without his knowledge or consent. In response to the dissent in Metro-Plan, the Michigan recording statute was amended to exclude from its provisions goods brought into Michigan \u201cwithout the written consent of the mortgagee or the then holder of such mortgage or conveyance.\u201d Mich.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 26.929 [1] (1953), Pub.Acts 1941, No. 181. See Commerce Acceptance Co. v. Denton, 357 Mich. 394, 9S N.W.2d 633, 635.</p>\n<p id=\"AMDu\">Neither Metro-Plan nor the statute alters the Michigan rule against \u201csecret liens\u201d in a case like that before us\u2014 where the goods are taken into Michigan <em>with the knowledge and consent of the mortgagee.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"aya-dedup-0\">.

Whether this is a box in a post office or a rural mail box does not appear. Whether it marked a residence, a place of business or a garage, the record does not reveal. We are not entitled to infer from this vague reference to a Michigan address that this was the place to which the chattel \u201cwould be taken immediately\u201d. Further there is no showing here as there was in Enterprise Optical Mfg. Co. v. Timmer, 6 Cir., 71 F.2d 295 (1934), relied on by the majority, that the parties to the contract contemplated that the property was to go and remain in a state other than Indiana \u2014 the place where the contract was made and was to be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s brief in this court states that the truck was built for long interstate hauling. It contends that the \u201cvendor * * * <em>must have understood </em>that the truck would be returned to New Buffalo, Michigan, <em>when not in use, </em>* \"x\"\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.) Whether defendant must have understood what seems so clear to plaintiff\u2019s counsel was an inference which the district court is not required to draw.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">This case now goes to the district court, which is the trier of the facts, and which should first determine this issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
