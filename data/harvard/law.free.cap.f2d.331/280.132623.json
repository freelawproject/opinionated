The Company asserts that the award was beyond the authority of the arbitrator because (1) the grievance did not specify .the particular subsection of the agreement relied upon by the arbitrator (although it did specify another closely related section) and (2) the collective bargaining agreement does not expressly provide for a back pay remedy (although it does not expressly preclude such remedy^</p>\n<p id=\"AYu\">In line with the so-called trilogy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Supreme Court decisions and the consequent decisions of this Court in-eluding Lodge No. 12, Dist. No. 37, Intern. Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc., 5 Cir., 1961, 292 F.2d 112, the merits of the award are not open to court review. The arbitrator interpreted and applied the collective bargaining agreement to this layoff situation, found that the lay-off violated the agreement, and that reinstatement with back pay was an appropriate remedy. The essence of the award was drawn from the collective bargaining agreement, United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., 1960 363 U.S. <em>593 </em>597; 80 S.Ct 1358 4 L.Ed.2d 1424. The contract did not exclude from arbitration either the subject matter or the remedy adopted by the arbiter. Nor on this reeord do any asserted procedural irregularities vitiate the award.
