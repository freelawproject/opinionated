It appeared that he had subscribed to a statement that his income was less than $1,000, but, after receiving a \u201cwarning.\u201d sent at the instigation of his brother, he made a return showing an income of $3,500. <em>Eeld, </em>that the oath, or even subscription to the return, is not needed to constitute it a fraudulent return; but that, if the party makes a false return, intending it to be acted on by the officers of the government, knowing its contents to be untiue. an indictment will lie.</p><p id=\"b1113-27\">[Decided by Drummond, District Judge.
