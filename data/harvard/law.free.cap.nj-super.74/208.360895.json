A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Adi\">Defendant Henry A. Burger appeals from a judgment of the Mercer County Court sustaining a conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and the imposition upon him, as a second offender, of a mandatory sentence of imprisonment for a term of three months and the forfeiture of his right to operate a motor vehicle over the higlmuys of this State for a period of ten years. He maintains that (1) the proofs were not free of a reasonable doubt of guilt, (3) the court erred in admitting into evidence the results of a Breathalyzer examination, (3) he did not consent in writing to a chemical test, and (4) his prior conviction for a similar offense was not established by \u201cthe best evidence beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>doubt.\u201d Tlie State\u2019s proofs included the testimony of Police Sergeant Michael G-. Lisi, Patrolman Howard Sweeney and Police Surgeon Dr. Mark II. Lund.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Lisi testified that on May 14, 1960, at about 10 p. m., he was riding in a patrol ear driven by Sweeney, which was proceeding in a westerly direction on Nassau Road nearing the intersection of Scott Lane, in the Township of Princeton, when he observed the defendant operating an automobile \"coming in an easterly direction and veer sharply into the path of the police car on our side of the road.\u201d The patrol vehicle pulled over to the extreme right, backed up, turned around and then followed the Burger car until it \"came to a halt in a driveway of a residence on the Prineeton-Kingston Road,\u201d approximately a mile from where it had been first observed. While in pursuit, Lisi observed that defendant\u2019s automobile \u201ckept veering sharply to the right and to the left. At times it was completely over the white line on the left side of the road.\u201d He stated that they were unable to stop Burger because of his \"erratic driving\u201d and the traffic in both directions at that hour of the night. The police pulled in behind the parked Burger car, walked to the driver\u2019s side of that vehicle, and found Burger lying on the front seat; the headlights of his car had been turned off, but the motor was still operating. Lisi \u201cshut off the motor.\u201d Defendant was asked to step out of the car, and as he did so \"staggered backwards and fell against the car\u201d; he readily admitted that he had been drinking. The sergeant detected \u201ca strong smell of alcohol.\u201d Lisi suggested that Burger voluntarily submit to a \u201cBreathalyzer test,\u201d which at first he declined to do, but he subsequently gave consent. He was then taken to the Princeton Hospital and Dr. Lund was summoned. The doctor arrived approximately a half-hour after the call. Defendant, during this interim period, was in the custody of Lisi who testified that Burger\u2019s face was flushed\u2014\u201cHis eyes looked liked they were pretty badiy bloodshot and half closed\u201d\u2014and described his speech as \"mumbling language * * * you couldn\u2019t un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>derstand what he was saying, he talked continuously.\u201d Lisi was unequivocal in his opinion that Burger was intoxicated and was not fit to operate a motor vehicle. The testimony of Patrolman Sweeney substantiated that given by the sergeant.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The police surgeon gave evidence respecting his clinical observations, the phjrsical experiments and the test with the Breathalyzer equipment. The doctor testified that defendant told him \u00a3\u00a3he had been drinking beer that afternoon * <em>* *. </em>Three or four, he said.\u201d The defendant\u2019s physical condition was explained\u2014luis face was \u201cslightly flushed\u201d; eyes were \u201cslightly bloodshot\u201d; \u201che had an alcoholic breath, faint, * <em>* </em>* but certainly it was apparent\u201d; speech was \u201crational but he did ramble, he kept talking along\u201d; \u201cswayed noticably [sic]\u201d; there was a \u201cfair execution\u201d of the \u201cfinger and nose\u201d dexterity test; his clothing was \u201cfairly neat\u201d and he was polite. When interrogated as to whether he had formed a conclusion as to Burger\u2019s sobriety based upon his observations and physical tests, he opined: \u201cWell, I thought in view of the fact that he had swayed quite a bit while he walked and was rambling on, that he was under the influence of alcohol to the extent that it would be unwise for him to operate a motor vehicle car.\u201d Subsequent testimony concerning the Breathalyzer test was offered and received by the court; it included the result-readings, which indicated \u201c.22 blood alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Defendant took the witness stand on his own behalf and admitted that he had been drinking beer on the afternoon of the day of his apprehension, testifying: \u201cI\u2019d say average of maybe one every half hour, three-quarters of an hour. * * * most part of the afternoon.\u201d His admission under cross-examination is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">\u201cQ. The doctor asked you how many you had been drinking too, didn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">A. He did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">Q. That\u2019s when you told him you had three or four?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">A. Offhand I said three or four.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Q. Gould it have been more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">A. It could have been maybe five or six. I\u2019m not saying it was exactly three or four.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Burger said that after spending the afternoon in a saloon he drove home from the center of town about 6 o\u2019clock, returned into town (driving) approximately 7:15 P. M., had dinner at the \u201cGrotto\u201d where they do not sell alcoholic beverages, and left the restaurant for home shortly after 9 o\u2019clock. He claimed that his driveway was under repair so he had to use his neighbor\u2019s; when he parked he turned off both the motor and the headlights; the officers called to him from across the road; that he walked over to them and upon leaving the car he stumbled into a drainage ditch. It is significant that defendant at no time denied under oath that he was intoxicated or that he had been driving on the public highway in the manner alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The trial judge, in rendering an oral opinion, analytically reviewed the testimony adduced at the <em>de novo </em>hearing and found as a matter of fact that there was more than sufficient proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. He specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">\u201cNow, absent any proof as to the result of the Breathalyzer I feel there is sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction of this defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">In the discharge of our function as a reviewing tribunal, we have examined the record and determine without hesitancy that there is adequate evidence to support the trial court\u2019s judgment. See <em>State v. </em>Emery, 27 N. <em>J. </em>348, 353 (1.958). In reaching this conclusion we are mindful of the admonition that a prosecution for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor \u201cfalls into the somewhat amorphous category of a quasi-criminal proceeding,\u201d and that an alleged statutory infraction must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Ibid. </em>The credibility of the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>is lor the trial court to assess. <em>State v. Zelinski, </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>561, 567 (1960). Intoxication may be established by lay evidence. <em>State v. Ingram, </em>67 <em>N. J. Super. </em>21, 37 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1961)3 <em>State v. Pichadou, </em>34 <em>N. J. Super. </em>177, 180-181 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955). As said in <em>Emery </em>above (at <em>p. </em>355), the State need only prove that the accused \u201chas imbibed to the extent that his physical coordination or mental faculties are deleteriously affected.\u201d Burger\u2019s admissions, the testimony of the police officers and the clinical observations of the examining phjrsician abundantly pronounced the insobriety of the defendant and established his guilt as charged, without any consideration or weight being attributed to the disputed corroborating chemical test.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Accordingly, it is unnecessary to deliberate upon the technical qualifications of the police surgeon who administered the Breathalyzer examination or upon the factual details of the alleged inadequacies of a proper foundation upon which to predicate the admissibility of its results. Note, <em>State v. Miller, </em>64 <em>N. J. Super. </em>262 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960); <em>State v. Greul, </em>59 <em>N. J. Super. </em>34 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1959); <em>State v. Damoorgian, </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>108 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1958)3 <em>State v. Brezina, </em>45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>596 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1957) 3 <em>State v. Hunter, </em>4 <em>N. J. Super. </em>531 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949). See also Brooks, \u201cEvidence\u201d (\u201cScientific Evidence: Use of the Harger Drunkometer\u201d), 14 <em>Rutgers L. Rev. </em>390, 404-407 (1960) 3 <em>Richardson, Modern Scientific Evidence, </em>\u201cIntoxication Tests,\u201d <em>sec. </em>13.8, <em>p. </em>357 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Although the question of \u201cconsent\u201d in this case is now moot, the issue was vigorously argued on appeal and we digress to point out that the legislative <em>caveat, </em>incorporated in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50.1, that: \u201cNo chemical analysis, as provided in this section, or specimen necessary thereto, may be made or taken unless expressly consented to, or requested by, the defendant,\u201d does not require that such consent be in writing. The proofs indicate that defendant freely consented and willingly submitted to the Breathalyzer test administered by Dr. Lund. The voluntariness of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>consent was not denied by Burger during the trial of his cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Defendant challenges the propriety of the trial court\u2019s imposing a sentence on him as a second offender; he contends that his prior conviction was not established \u201cby the best evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Upon the completion of the trial under review, the prosecutor moved for an opportunity to cause a presentencc investigation to be made. The matter was adjourned from a Friday to the following Monday at 9 :30 A. <em>m. </em>\u201cto give the State opportunity to produce any evidence of a previous conviction.\u201d At the appointed time there was submitted to the court a certified copy of a report from the Motor Vehicle Division, Form No. SR 9763, dated June 5, 1961, under the hand and seal of Ned J. Parsekian, Acting Director, which disclosed that one Henry A. Burger (listing Ms current and former addresses) had previously (February 25, 1937) been convicted for the violation of driving while under the influence of liquor and had been fined $200 with the revocation of Ms license on February 27, 1937\u2014restored March 30, 1940. This report was shown to defendant\u2019s attorney. Neither the defendant, who was personally present before the court, nor Ms counsel denied the identity of the person or questioned the prior conviction record as set forth in the report. In response to the statment by the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">\u201cNow, if counsel at this time wants to indicate that this evidence is not correct and wants the opportunity to refute it, of course the court is always open. We will withhold sentence until such opportunity is presented counsel. T suppose that is always available to counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">counsel argued that it was not incumbent upon the defense to disprove an inadequate case, that the document itself was not the best evidence of a conviction. The trial court disagreed, and imposed the mandatory penalty applicable to second offenders as provided by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39 :4-50. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>urged that the second-offense provisions of this statute should be as strictly construed as in the ordinary criminal case. Reliance is placed upon <em>State v. </em>Laird, 25 <em>N. J. </em>298 (1957), but the facts in that case are clearly distinguishable, and the sound protective principles of law therein enunciated do not support the arguments that the records of the Division of Motor Vehicles are insufficient to establish a prior violation of the Motor Vehicle Act. In that case Justice Heher, speaking for the Supreme Court, said at <em>page </em>304:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">\u201cHere, the statute itself, <em>section </em>39:4-50, provides that one who has been convicted of a previous violation of the section need not be charged as a second offender in the complaint in order to render him liable to the punishment laid down for a second offense. Nevertheless, it is a basic principle of procedural jurisprudence that the accused be given, before sentence as for a second offense, notice and an opportunity to be heard as to the commission of the prior offense made a precondition to the greater punishment provided for its repetition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\"><em>Laird </em>stands for the proposition that there must be adequate inquiry and opportunity to be heard before the imposition of sentence. Such was accorded Burger. It was not necessary to try defendant for the former offense. A prior conviction record is only a factor to be considered in determining the degree of punishment. See <em>State v. </em>Rowe, 116 <em>N. J. L. </em>48, 51, 52 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935), affirmed <em>per curiam </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>466 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">This court in <em>State v. Hanson, </em>59 <em>N. J. Super. </em>434, 444 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960), certif. denied 32 <em>N. J. </em>351 (1960), observed that judges ordinarily do not proceed with the sentencing of a defendant found guilty of a violation where a mandatory higher penalty for subsequent offenses is prescribed until they have received a written record showing the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, if any, and that \u201csuch written record is obtained from the Division of Motor Vehicles.\u201d By statute, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:5-42, every judge and magistrate is required within three days to make a written report to the Commissioner (now Director) of Motor Vehicles of all convictions of motor vehicle violations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>crimes in which a motor vehicle was used. The Division is the central and official agency for keeping such records; it is the statutory reservoir for a state-wide compilation of such violations. Moreover, the records, reports, documents and papers of the municipal courts are subject to destruction according to schedules approved by the Administrative Director of the Courts. <em>R. R. </em>8:13-10(c). See also Municipal Court Manual <em>(rev. </em>1960), c. 8, <em>sec. </em>12, <em>p. </em>55, and schedule <em>p. </em>89. We hold that the exhibit of the Acting Director of Motor Vehicles, certifying the violation record of the defendant, was competent, admissible evidence within the contemplation of our statutes and court rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Defendant\u2019s prior offense occurred over 24 years ago. The wisdom of imposing a limitation on the use of a prior conviction as old as the one in the instant case, in determining the penalty for a repetitious offense, is a matter of legislative policy. The trial court was obliged under the circumstances to enforce the mandatory sentence as expressed in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50, and it is not within the province of this court to determine otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
