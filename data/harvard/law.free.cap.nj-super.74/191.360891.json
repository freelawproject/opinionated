A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AG\">Plaintiff insurance company brought a declaratory judgment proceeding in the Superior Court, Law Division, in which it sought a determination as to its legal liability under the terms of an aircraft liability insurance policy issued by it to insure Raritan River Garage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Company, trade name ior Louis LaBruzzo, owner of the private airplane covered by the policy. Plaintiff joined as parties defendant Santa LaBruzzo, administratrix of the estate of Louis LaBruzzo, and Charlotte B. Bifulco, general administratrix and administratrix <em>ad prosequendum </em>of the Estates of William A. Bradley, Jr., deceased, and George Bradley, deceased, because of suits pending by them to recover damages for which the plaintiff might ultimately be liable on the aforesaid insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">LaBruzzo and the Bradleys lost their lives and LaBruzzo\u2019s plane was destroyed during the course of a flight on October 31, 1959, when the plane crashed into a mountain at or near Greenville, New York. LaBruzzo, who held only a student pilot certificate, was then and there operating the plane and the Bradleys were aboard for the ride.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a summary judgment of nonliability on the policy was denied, and defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the policy covered this accident was granted. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The main issue on this appeal is whether the policy issued by the plaintiff covered the loss of or damage to LaBruzzo\u2019s aircraft while in flight, and the loss of the lives of the two Bradleys. Coverage under the policy depends upon the meaning of the word \"passengers\u201d in the following exclusionary provision of the policy, upon which plaintiff relies essentially to support its contention of noncoverage :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\u201cThis policy applies when the aircraft is in flight only while being operated by the following pilot(s) : Louis LaBruzzo, student pilot <em>(except while carrying passengers under a student permit) </em>or any pilot holding a valid and effective private or commercial pilot\u2019s certificate and seaplane rating if the aircraft insured is a seaplane.\u201d (Emphasis ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">As noted above, the insured aircraft was in flight and was being operated by Louis LaBruzzo, a student pilot holding only a certificate as such, and there was no other pilot aboard at the time of the fatal crash. Was LaBruzzo carrying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201cpassengers\u201d so as to make coverage under the policy inapplicable ?</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Plaintiff contends that the word \u201cpassengers\u201d in the foregoing exclusionary provision was intended by the plaintiff and the insured to mean all occupants of the plane other than the pilot. Defendants maintain that, in the absence of any definition of the word \u201cpassengers\u201d in the policy, the trial court properly interpreted the word in its restricted legal meaning as referable only to fare-paying passengers and not to be applicable to mere \u201cguest occupants.\u201d While the plaintiff\u2019s attorney refused to concede on oral argument that the Bradleys were \u201cguest occupants\u201d and not fare-paying passengers, the interpretation of the policy by the trial court is based upon the assumption that the Bradleys were merely \u201cguest occupants,\u201d and our review of the correctness of that determination is necessarily based upon the same assumption. It is conceded that if the Bradlej\u2019s were fare-paying passengers, the exclusionary provision of the policy noted above would obviously bar coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The word \u201cpassenger\u201d has various meanings, depending upon the circumstances under which and the context in which the word is used. Sometimes it is construed in a restricted legal sense as referring to \u201cone who is being carried by another for hire.\u201d <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 490, <em>comment </em>(a). On other occasions, the word is interpreted as meaning any occupant of a vehicle other than the person operating it. As the court stated in <em>Vogrin v. Hedstrom, </em>220 <em>F. 2d, </em>863, 865, 866 (8 <em>Cir. </em>1955) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cCertainly the term \u2018passenger\u2019 does not universally connote that the person is designated as a compensating passenger. Whatever its technical legal significance may he, in common parlance it means an occupant of a motor vehicle other than the person operating it and describes a physical status rather than a technical legal status, # * }\u00a1t \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">As aptly noted in <em>Emerson v. Carolina Cas. Ins. Co., </em>206 <em>F. 2d, </em>13, 16 (8 <em>Cir. </em>1953), \u201cit would be difficult, if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>impossible, to state a general rule or definition of a passenger which would embrace all essential elements under all circumstances.\u201d Keference, therefore, to other cases in which the word \u201cpassenger\u201d has been construed is not too helpful because the connotation of the word must bo determined in the particular factual context under consideration by the court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201cIn the quest for the common intention of the parties to a contract the court must consider the relations of the parties, the attendant circumstances and the objects they were trying to attain. An agreement must be construed in the context of the circumstances under which it was entered into and it must be accorded a rational meaning in keeping with the express general purpose.\u201d <em>Tessmar v. Grosner, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>193, 201 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\"> There is a well settled doctrine applicable to the construction of an insurance policy, \u201cif the controlling language will support two meanings, one favorable to the insurer, and the other favorable to the insured, the interpretation sustaining coverage must be applied. Courts are bound to protect the insured to the full extent that any fair interpretation will allow.\u201d <em>Mazzilli v. Accident &amp; Casualty Insurance Co. of Winterthur, </em>35 <em>N. J. </em>1, 7 (1961). This does not mean, however, that the courts will make a different contract from that which the parties themselves have made.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201cWhen the terms of an insurance contract arc clear, it is the function of a court to enforce it as written and not to make a better contract for either of the parties. * * * Absent stated prohibitions, an insurance company has the right to impose whatever conditions it desires prior to assuming its obligations and such provision should be construed in accordance with the language used.\u201d <em>Kampf v. Franklin Life Insurance Co., </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>36, 48 (1960).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">\u201c[W | here the policy provision under examination relates to the inclusion of persons other than the named insured within the protection afforded, a broad and liberal view is taken of the coverage extended. But, if the clause in question is one of exclusion or exception, designed to limit the protection, a strict interpretation is applied.\u201d <em>Mazzilli, supra </em>(35 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>8).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>However, all rules of interpretation are subordinated to the\u2019 requirement that \u201cour courts will broadly search for the probable common intent of the parties, will consider their relations, the attendant circumstances and the objectives they were trying to obtain and will endeavor to find a reasonable meaning fin keeping with the express general purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Robert, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>561 (1962). Our task, therefore, is to determine what the parties to this insurance contract intended by the use of the word \u201cpassengers\u201d in the policy provision noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The policy in question was issued on September 16, 1959, effective August 12, 1959, and was based on LaBruzzo\u2019s written application therefor. LaBruzzo knew prior thereto that the holder of a student pilot certificate was prohibited from carrying passengers. His application of April 2, 1959 to the UI. S. Department of Commerce, Civil Aeronautics Administration, for a student pilot certificate contained this written certification stamped prominently thereon and signed separately by LaBruzzo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">\u201cI certify that I am aware that the holder of a student pilot certificate is prohibited from carrying passengers * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The student pilot certificate itself, also dated April 2, 1959 and bearing LaBruzzo\u2019s signature, set forth plainly on its face this express limitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">\u201cPassenger Carrying Prohibited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">This limitation was pursuant to <em>Civil Air Regulation </em>43.52 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">\u201cNo student pilot shall pilot aircraft carrying a passenger or on an international flight or for compensation or hire or in furtherance of a business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">The use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in the above regulation indicates that the prohibition against carrying passengers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>was not limited to those who paid compensation for the ride, but covered passengers generally. This conclusion is supported by <em>Safety Bulletin No. </em>177-47 issued by the Safety Bureau of the Civil Aeronautics Board and entitled \u201cStudents . . . Don\u2019t Fly Passengers.\u201d Therein, student pilots are reminded of the above regulation and warned of the danger \u201cto student and passenger.\u201d Certainly, this danger would not depend upon whether the passenger paid or rode free as a guest. We note these excerpts from this safety bulletin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\u201cStudent pilots are forbidden to carry passengers and have been since 1927 when the Federal Air Laws went into effect. And yet they continue to do so, often with personal harm or death to themselves and their unsuspecting passengers. * * * The situation is very much like riding in an automobile with an inexperienced driver who has no license, or is under age, or is in some way outside the law * * *. Hour for hour flown, students with passengers are far more apt to get into serious trouble than students without passengers. This can be shown readily by crash records on file with the Civil Aeronautics Board. There\u2019s little doubt that it is caused by the resulting lack of attention to the job at hand by the student while showing off to his passenger or taking him on a personally conducted\u2014but very amateurish'\u2014-air tour. * * * A few students even had accidents while trying to get into out-of-way landing spots to pick up some friend for a ride\u2014-the outcome of the \u2018ride\u2019 often being as lethal as the underworld method of liquidating someone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">This strong language makes it clear that the governmental regulations prohibiting student pilots from carrying passengers make no distinction between a fare-paying passenger and a guest occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The Uniform Aeronautics Law, adopted in New Jersey as <em>L. </em>1929, <em>c. </em>311, now <em>R. S. </em>6 :2-l <em>et </em>seq., defines \u201cpassenger\u201d in <em>R. S. </em>6 :2-l as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-11\">\u201c \u2018Passenger\u2019 includes any person riding in an aircraft but having no part in its operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">This definition includes guest occupants as well as fare-paying passengers. Compare the California Air Navigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Act which distinguishes between a \u201cpassenger\u201d and a \u201cguest,\u201d as pointed out in <em>Whittemore v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 51 Cal. App. 2d </em>605, 125 <em>P. 2d </em>531 (Ct. <em>App. </em>1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Parties to a contract are presumed to have entered into it in compliance with the law. Compare <em>Gunther v. Metropolitan Cas. Ins. Co., </em>33 <em>N. J. Super. </em>101, 111-114 <em>(Law Div. </em>1954), approved in <em>Bauman v. Royal Indemnity Co., </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>12, 21 (1961). When the plaintiff and LaBruzzo entered into this insurance contract and the policy expressly excluded coverage while LaBruzzo, the student pilot, was \u201ccarrying passengers under a student permit,\u201d it is fair to assume that the parties to the agreement did not intend to insure a risk which they knew was contrary to law. While under some circumstances the word \u201cpassengers\u201d might be ambiguous and require under established principles a construction against the insurance company which prepared the policy, we do not find such ambiguity in the instant policy under the circumstances of this case. We conclude that the intention of the parties in this case was that coverage would not exist under the policy if the plane was being operated by LaBruzzo, while still holding only a student pilot certificate and carrying riders, whether fare-paying or as guests.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Defendants point out that the application for insurance showed that LaBruzzo indicated \u201cIndustrial Aid\u201d as the purpose for which he intended to use the aircraft being insured, and that he sought coverage for bodily injury liability to \u201coccupants\u201d and for property damage liability. Item 6 of the policy notes that the purpose for which the aircraft is to be used is \u201cIndustrial Aid,\u201d which is defined in the policy as \u201cPersonal, Pleasure, Family and Business uses, including transportation of executives, employees, <em>guests </em>and customers * * * but excluding any operation for which a charge is made.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) The policy also specifies among its coverages \u201cAircraft occupant bodily injury liability,\u201d and under its definitions states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u201cThe word \u2018occupant\u2019 means any person in, on or boarding the aircraft for the purpose of riding therein or alighting therefrom following a flight or attempted flight therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">From the foregoing, defendants argue that coverage of \u201cguests\u201d and \u201coccupants,\u201d other than persons for whom a charge was made, was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">We agree that \u201cguests\u201d and \u201coccupants\u201d for whose transportation no charge was made would have been covered by this policy, if the aircraft were being operated by a regularly licensed pilot, as contrasted with a mere student pilot. The policy did not limit operation of the plane to LaBruzzo alone. As noted above, the limitation on carrying passengers applied only to the operation by a student pilot, LaBruzzo. This exception did not apply when the plane was being operated by \u201cany pilot holding a valid and effective private or commercial pilot certificate.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u201cIn seeking the intention of the parties, the instrument as a whole is considered; whenever possible, effect is given to all of its parts and a construction which gives a reasonable meaning to all its provisions is preferred to one which leaves it or some of its parts useless or inexplicable.\u201d <em>Heake v. Atlantic Casualty Ins. Co., </em>29 <em>N. J. Super. </em>242, 262 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Guided by that rule, it seems clear that the insured enjoyed coverage under this policy when it was being used for any of the purposes defined under the classification \u201cIndustrial Aid,\u201d and such coverage included bodily injury liability to guests and occupants and property damage liability, provided the plane was being operated by a \u201cpilot holding a valid and effective private or commercial pilot certificate.\u201d The policy also covered specified losses when the plane was being operated hv LaBruzzo, a student pilot, provided ho was not carrying passengers, meaning any person other than the operator. Therefore, under the express condition of this policy, there was no coverage for this accident, because LaBruzzo was carrying the Bradleys as passengers, even if they were non-paying riders.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Under the circumstances, we need not decide plaintiffs further contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The summary judgment in favor of the defendants is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for entry of judgment of nonliability on the policy in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
