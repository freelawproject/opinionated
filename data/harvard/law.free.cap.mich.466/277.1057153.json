Allstate Insurance Company seeks a determination of its obligation to indemnify its insureds in connection with an underlying wrongful death suit stemming from the shooting death of Kevin LaBelle.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>We hold that the shooting death of Kevin LaBelle was \u201caccidental\u201d and, thus, an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined in the insurance policy at issue. Consequently, an \u201coccurrence\u201d gives rise to Allstate\u2019s liability under the policy. Therefore, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand to the Court of Appeals to decide whether the criminal acts exception in this policy excludes coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">This case arises out of the death of sixteen-year-old Kevin LaBelle on December 15, 1995, at the home of defendants Ernest and Patricia McCarn, where their grandson, then sixteen-year-old defendant Robert McCarn, also resided. On that day, Robert removed from under Ernest\u2019s bed a shotgun Robert\u2019s father had given him the year before. The gun was always stored under Ernest\u2019s bed and was not normally loaded. Both Robert and Kevin handled the gun, which Robert believed to be unloaded. When Robert was handling the gun, he pointed it at Kevin\u2019s face from approximately one foot away. Robert pulled back the hammer and pulled the trigger and the gun fired, killing Kevin.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Nancy LaBelle, representing Kevin\u2019s estate, brought the underlying action against Robert and his grandparents, Ernest and Patricia McCarn, who had a homeowners insurance policy with plaintiff Allstate. Allstate brought the present action, seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to indemnify defendants Robert, Ernest, or Patricia McCarn.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Plaintiff and defendants moved for summary disposition in the declaratory action. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>granted defendants\u2019 motions for summary disposition and denied plaintiff\u2019s, holding that the events constituted an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of Allstate\u2019s policy. The trial court also held that Robert McCam\u2019s conduct was not intentional or criminal within the meaning of Allstate\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Allstate appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed the trial court in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court attempted to apply our recent decisions in <em>Nabozny v Burkhardt</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v </em>Masters<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and concluded that \u201cRobert\u2019s intentional actions created a direct risk of harm that precludes coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Defendant LaBelle sought leave to appeal. We granted leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">In determining whether Allstate must indemnify the McCams, we examine the language of the insurance policies and interpret their terms pursuant to well-established Michigan principles of construction. <em>Masters </em>at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">An insurance policy must be enforced in accordance with its terms. <em>Id. </em>If not defined in the policy, however, we will interpret the terms of the policy in accordance with their \u201ccommonly used meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">The McCams\u2019 homeowners insurance policy provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this policy, Allstate will pay damages which an insured person becomes legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury or property damage arising from an occurrence to which this policy applies, and is covered by this part of the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">According to the plain meaning of the policy, liability coverage for damages arises from an \u201coccurrence.\u201d The term \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined in the insurance policy as: \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions during the policy period, resulting in bodily injury or property damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Our task, therefore, is to determine whether the case before us involved an \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">In the instant case, the policy defines an occurrence as an accident, but does not define what constitutes an accident. In similar cases where the respective policies defined an occurrence as an accident, without defining accident, we have examined the common meaning of the term. In such cases, we have repeatedly stated that \u201c \u2018an accident is an undesigned contingency, a casualty, a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated and not naturally to be expected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Masters </em>at 114, quoting <em>Arco Ind Corp v American Motorists Ins Co, </em>448 Mich 395, 404-405; 531 NW2d 168 (1995) (opinion of Mallett, J.); <em>Auto Club Group Ins Co v Marzonie, </em>447 Mich 624, 631; 527 NW2d 760 (1994); <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>432 Mich 656, 670; 443 NW2d 734 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Accidents axe evaluated from the standpoint of the insured, not the injured party. <em>Masters </em>at 114, n 6. In <em>Masters, </em>we held that \u201cthe appropriate focus of the term \u2018accident\u2019 must be on both \u2018the injury-causing <em>act </em>or <em>event </em>and its relation to the resulting property damage or personal injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, quoting <em>Marzonie </em>at 648 (Griffin, J., concurring) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We also stated that \u201c \u2018an insured need not act unintentionally\u2019 in order for the act to constitute an \u2018accident\u2019 and therefore an \u2018occurrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Where an insured does act intentionally, \u201ca problem arises \u2018in attempting to distinguish between intentional acts that can be classified as \u201caccidents\u201d and those that cannot.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In <em>Masters </em>at 115-116, we applied the following standard from Justice Griffin\u2019s concurrence in <em>Marzonie </em>at 648-649.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">[A] determination must be made whether the consequences of the insured\u2019s intentional act \u201ceither were intended by the insured or reasonably should have been expected because of the direct risk of harm intentionally created by the insured\u2019s actions. When an insured acts intending to cause property damage or personal injury, liability coverage should be denied, irrespective of whether the resulting injury is different from the injury intended. Similarly, . . . when an insured\u2019s intentional actions create a direct risk of harm, there can be no liability coverage for <em>any </em>resulting damage or injury, despite the lack of an actual intent to damage or injure.\u201d [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">What this essentially boils down to is that, if both the act and the consequences were intended by the insured, the act does not constitute an accident. On the other hand, if the act was intended by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>insured, but the consequences were not, the act does constitute an accident, unless the intended act created a direct risk of harm from which the consequences should reasonably have been expected by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">As to the perspective from which the analysis should be made, the question is not whether a <em>reasonable person </em>would have expected the consequences, but whether the <em>insured </em>reasonably should have expected the consequences. Accordingly, an objective foreseeability test should not be used in the present context. Rather, the analysis must be that, to avoid coverage, the consequence of the intended act, which created a direct risk of harm, reasonably should have been expected by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The policy language dictates whether a subjective or objective standard is to be used.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the policy language here does not indicate whether a subjective or objective standard is to be used. Because \u201c[t]he definition of accident should be framed from the standpoint of the insured . . . ,\u201d <em>Masters </em>at 114, and because, where there is doubt, the policy should be construed in favor of the insured, <em>id. </em>at 111, we conclude that a subjective standard should be used here. Further, in <em>Masters, </em>this Court, faced with similar policy language, concluded that there is no coverage where the insured intended his action, and the consequences of this intended action \u201ceither were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>intended <em>by the insured </em>or reasonably should have been expected because of the direct risk of harm intentionally created by the insured\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In our judgment, the language \u201cby the insured\u201d modifies both \u201cintended\u201d and \u201cexpected.\u201d Therefore, there is no coverage where the consequences of the insured\u2019s act were either \u201cintended by the insured\u201d or \u201creasonably should have been expected <em>by the </em>insured.\u201d The language, \u201cby the insured,\u201d indicates that a subjective standard should be used here. <em>Fire Ins Exchange v Diehl, </em>450 Mich 678, 685; 545 NW2d 602 (1996). Although, \u201c[n]egligence alone is not sufficient to prevent the death from being an accident within the meaning of the policy,\u201d <em>Collins v Nationwide Life Ins Co, </em>409 Mich 271, 277; 294 NW2d 194 (1980), when the acts of the insured rise to the level of a \u201cdirect risk of harm intentionally created\u201d\u2014a level of culpability only slightly lower than intentionally acting to produce an intended harm\u2014coverage is precluded, where the insured reasonably should have expected the harm, as the situation is virtually indistinguishable from intentionally causing the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Further, the \u201cdirect risk of harm\u201d must have been \u201cintentionally created by the insured\u2019s actions.\u201d This language shows that the <em>Masters </em>test is not objective. On the contrary, the inquiry is entirely subjective-did the insured <em>intentionally </em>create a direct risk of harm? In this case, there was no intentional creation of a direct risk of harm because of the undisputed evidence that Robert McCam believed he was pulling the trigger of an unloaded gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The dissent is incorrect in concluding that this Court adopted an <em>objective </em>test in <em>Masters. </em>As previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ously stated, in our judgment, the language \u201cby the insured\u201d modifies both \u201cintended\u201d and \u201cexpected,\u201d indicating a subjective test. A subjective test is not only consistent with <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny, </em>it is the required test, based on the language the <em>Masters </em>Court adopted from <em>Marzonie. </em>Accordingly, we are not abandoning the rule established in <em>Masters, </em>as the dissent contends; rather, we are simply adhering to this rule. See <em>post </em>at 298, n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Applying these principles to the present case, viewed from the standpoint of the insured, we hold that Kevin LaBelle\u2019s death was an \u201caccident,\u201d thus an \u201coccurrence,\u201d covered under the insurance policy. We agree with plaintiff that Robert intended to point the gun at Kevin and pull the trigger. However, Robert believed the gun was not loaded. Robert had no intention of firing a loaded weapon. No bodily injury would have been caused by Robert\u2019s intended act of pulling the trigger of an unloaded gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The dissent states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">What is the direct risk of harm consonant with pulling the trigger of a firearm? The obvious risk is that the weapon, if loaded, might discharge and cause an injury. In my view, the evidence adduced at the summary disposition stage warrants the conclusion that the insured should have reasonably expected the consequences of his intentional act. <em>[Post </em>at 301.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">We agree that this case does not present a question of fact. The fact that Robert believed the gun was unloaded is a matter about which there is no genuine issue of material fact. This is because there is nothing in the record to reasonably support a conclusion that, contrary to Robert\u2019s testimony that he believed the gun was unloaded, he consciously believed the gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>was loaded, or even contemplated that there was any possibility that it was loaded when he pulled the trigger. Even plaintiff, the insurer, acknowledged that Robert believed the firearm was unloaded when he pulled the trigger:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\"><em>McCam\u2019s subjective, </em>although erroneous, belief that the firearm was not loaded does not alter the fact that he picked up the gun, pointed it, pulled back the hammer and pulled the trigger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Further, Robert made statements at his deposition to support his belief that the gun was not loaded: Robert and Kevin were \u201chorsing around\u201d with the gun as they had done on previous occasions; Robert was surprised when the gun actually fired; and, immediately following the discharge of the gun, Robert called 911. Thus, there is nothing to reasonably indicate that Robert entertained knowledge that the gun might have been loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">In short, it would be speculation to suggest that Robert intentionally shot his friend or was conscious of a nontheoretical possibility that a shell was in the gun when he pulled the trigger. Clearly, such speculation cannot suffice to establish even a genuine issue of material fact, let alone to conclude that Robert\u2019s intended act of pulling the trigger of an unloaded gun intentionally created a direct risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The dissent goes to great lengths to show that under an objective standard, the insured should have reasonably expected the consequences. We simply cannot agree because the language of the test adopted in <em>Masters </em>requires us to <em>subjectively </em>analyze what Robert thought when he pulled the trigger. Rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ert thought he was pulling the trigger of an Reloaded gun.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Robert McCarn may have been negligent in failing to see if the gun was loaded before he pulled the trigger, particularly because he was the last person to use the gun weeks earlier for target practice. However, the issue of negligence is not before us. As we stated in <em>Collins, </em>the negligence of the insured in acting as he did is not enough to prevent an incident from being an accident if the consequence of the action (e.g., shot coming from a gun) should not have reasonably been expected by the insured.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">While it may be considered quite obvious that Robert\u2019s conduct was careless and foolish, it was negligence that simply did not rise to the level that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>should have <em>expected </em>to result in harm. Otherwise, liability insurance coverage for negligence would seem to become illusory. We must be careful not to take the expectation of harm test so far that we eviscerate the ability of parties to insure against their own negligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The problem, as we see it, with the dissent\u2019s opinion is that it undermines the ability of insureds to protect themselves against their own foolish or negligent acts. If courts are to review the acts of insureds for \u201cobjective reasonableness,\u201d as the dissent proposes, the very purpose of insurance would be compromised as insureds would find it increasingly difficult to recover on claims arising from injuries set in motion by foolhardy conduct on their own part or on the part of their families. However, the impetus for insurance is not merely, or even principally, to insure oneself for well thought out and reasoned actions that go wrong, but to insure oneself for foolish or negligent actions that go wrong. Indeed, it is obviously the latter that are more likely to go astray and to precipitate the desire for insurance. Under the dissent\u2019s approach, however, only the former actions would be clearly covered \u201caccidents,\u201d or, at least, would clearly avoid disputes over coverage with insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Further, under the dissent\u2019s approach, only occurrences that were truly unexplainable would be covered \u201caccidents.\u201d For, in retrospect, a sufficiently diligent insurer could almost always determine the physical cause of an accident, tracing it back to <em>some </em>prior conduct by the insured that should have been performed differently. Actions have consequences, and with sufficient effort, a connection between an occurrence and a prior action on the part of the insured can invariably be identified. However, merely because, in retrospect, an insurer is able to identify such a connection, does not mean that what took place was not an \u201caccident.\u201d If one is driving too fast on a highway, not intending to but nonetheless causing an accident, it can hardly be denied that what has resulted is an accident despite the fact that it might be traceable to \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d conduct by the insured, i.e. driving too fast on a highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Contrary to what our dissenting colleagues state, we are not abandoning or calling into question the rule from <em>Masters </em>in any way. The facts of this case are distinguishable from <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny, </em>where we held that specific acts failed to qualify as accidents under the respective insurance policies. In <em>Nabozny, </em>the plaintiff broke his ankle during a fight when the insured tripped him. The insured, while not intending to break the plaintiff\u2019s ankle, did intend to fight with him. This and the effort to trip during the fight was the creation of a direct risk of physical harm that should have caused the insured to reasonably expect the consequences that ensued. Thus, we concluded that the injury was not an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>In <em>Masters, </em>the insured and his son intentionally set a fire, intending to cause damage in their clothing store only, but that ultimately destroyed not just their store, but also a neighboring building. We held that the applicable insurance policy, which precluded coverage for intentional acts, did not provide coverage under the circumstances. Our reason was that, when the insured acted by starting a fire, it is irrelevant that the consequence, which was burning property, was different in magnitude from that intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The difference between this case and <em>Nabozny </em>and <em>Masters, </em>however, is that here, while the act was intended, the result was not.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, unlike in <em>Nabozny, </em>Robert should not have reasonably expected the consequences that ensued from his act because his intended act was merely to pull the trigger of an unloaded gun. Similarly, unlike <em>Masters, </em>where the consequence of the act was intended, here the consequence\u2014shot leaving the gun\u2014was not intended. Furthermore, even if one used some variation on a foreseeability test, no bodily harm could have been foreseen from Robert\u2019s intended act, because he intended to pull the trigger of an unloaded gun, and, thus, it was not foreseeable, indeed it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>impossible, under the facts as Robert believed them to be, that shot would be discharged. Therefore, we cannot say Robert should have expected the unfortunate consequences of his act. The discharge of the shot was an accident and entitled to coverage unless a policy exclusion applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Allstate maintains that Robert McCam\u2019s actions constitute a criminal act that, under the policy\u2019s criminal acts exclusion, negates Allstate\u2019s duty to indemnify the insureds. The Court of Appeals did not reach this issue because it concluded that Robert\u2019s actions created a direct risk of harm that precluded coverage. We remand this case to the Court of Appeals to decide this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">We hold today that Kevin LaBelle\u2019s death was an \u201caccident,\u201d and thus an \u201coccurrence,\u201d covered under the policy because Robert did not intend or reasonably expect that his actions, pointing and pulling a trigger of an <em>unloaded </em>gun, would cause any bodily injury to Kevin LaBelle. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to the Court of Appeals to decide whether the criminal-acts exception in this policy excludes coverage.</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-9\">Kelly, Taylor, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\"> Issued October 3, 2000 (Docket No. 213041).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A4A\"> 461 Mich 471; 606 NW2d 639 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A_M\"> 460 Mich 105; 595 NW2d 832 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\"> For example, a policy that excludes coverage of bodily injury that is expected \u201cfrom the standpoint of the insured,\u201d dictates a subjective standard, <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>companion case to <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, </em>432 Mich 656, 709; 443 NW2d 734 (1989), just as a policy that covers bodily injury not expected \u201cby the insured,\u201d also dictates a subjective standard, <em>Fire Ins Exchange v Diehl, </em>450 Mich 678, 685; 545 NW2d 602 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b413-6\"> The dissent asserts that this opinion makes \u201cthe insured\u2019s subjective belief regarding the status of the gun definitive.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 300. While this is not inaccurate, this should not be confused with making the insured\u2019s own <em>assertions </em>of his subjective belief definitive. A subjective test does not require courts to simply accept uncritically the insured\u2019s own assertions regarding his subjective belief. Instead, courts must examine the totality of the circumstances, including the reasonableness or credibility of the insured\u2019s assertions, evidence of \u201cother acts,\u201d evidence concerning the faculties or the maturity of the insured, evidence concerning relationships between an insured and a victim of an h\\jmy, and so forth. In this case, there is simply no evidence to suggest that the insured intended shot to be discharged from <em>this </em>gun when he pulled its trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Further, that the insured can <em>now </em>logically explain how the accidental shooting most likely occurred, i.e., that the insured forgot to unload the gun the last time he used it, does not transform an otherwise accidental shooting into an intentional creation of a direct risk of harm. Merely because one can explain, after the fact, how an insured\u2019s actions inexorably led to certain consequences does not mean that that insured reasonably should have expected those consequences. If that were true, the only covered occurrences would be inexplicable ones.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> The dissent asserts that Robert\u2019s prior use of the gun should be considered in deciding whether Robert should have reasonably anticipated the harm caused. However, at most, the prior use of the gun would establish Robert was negligent. In Michigan, the test is not whether the insured was negligent, but whether the insured should have reasonably expected the consequence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\"> The dissent refers to Robert\u2019s nolo contendere plea to manslaughter. <em>Post </em>at 293. However, given that such a no-contest plea does not have the effect of an admission for any other proceeding than the one in which it is entered, MCR 2.111(E)(3), that plea has no legal relevance to this case. Regardless, even if we assume Robert\u2019s guilt of manslaughter in connection with this case, that does not change the fact that the shooting was an accident. Similarly, the dissent refers to Robert having smoked marijuana, <em>post </em>at 293, n 3, but this has no serious relevance to the issues at hand. Smoking marijuana did not affect the establishment of intent by Robert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\"> The dissent contends that \u201c[t]here is no such \u2018difference\u2019 among these three cases. Rather, in <em>both Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny, </em>the insureds made precisely the same claim as presented here\u2014that they did not intend <em>the result </em>of their deliberate acts.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 297 (emphasis in original). What the dissent is missing is that the insureds in <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny did </em>intend the results of their deliberate acts\u2014the fire and the tripping; they just did not intend the magnitude of those results\u2014the burning down of the neighboring building and the broken ankle. So, again, this case <em>is </em>different from <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny </em>because there the insureds <em>did </em>intend the results of their deliberate acts, while here the insured did <em>not </em>intend the result\u2014the firing of shot\u2014of his deliberate act\u2014the shooting of a gun that he believed to be unloaded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b417-10\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsS\"><em>(dissenting in part). </em>I agree with the majority that this case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals so that the applicability of the inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>tional act and criminal act policy exclusions can be decided. However, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion that concludes that the policy provides indemnity coverage because the majority finds that the shooting incident here constituted an \u201caccident\u201d and thus an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy.

The majority\u2019s effort to distinguish the facts of this case from <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny </em>are hollow and simply debases the clear standard set forth in those opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">I believe that the application of the definition of the term \u201caccident\u201d we recently announced in <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny, </em>in which we construed identical policy language, requires an objective view of the insured\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Under the facts of this case, the insured should have reasonably expected the consequences created by pointing a gun at another and pulling the trigger without checking to verify that it was unloaded. Accordingly, I would affirm summary disposition in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">I. ADDITIONAL FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">According to Robert McCam\u2019s deposition testimony, he and Kevin LaBelle went to McCam\u2019s house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>after school. At some point in the afternoon,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> McCam retrieved his .410 shotgun from under his grandfather\u2019s bed. Both boys handled the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">LaBelle and McCam argued over crackers; LaBelle had the crackers and refused to share them with McCam when asked to do so. Attempting to frighten LaBelle into sharing the crackers,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> McCam intentionally pointed the shotgun at LaBelle with the barrel being approximately one foot away from LaBelle\u2019s face. McCam again asked LaBelle for the crackers, but LaBelle declined to share them. McCam pulled the hammer back, pretended to pull the trigger \u201ca couple\u201d times, and then actually pulled the trigger. The weapon discharged and LaBelle was killed. As a result of the death, McCam pleaded nolo contendere to manslaughter, MCL 750.321.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In both his statement to the police and his deposition testimony, McCam stated that he thought the gun was unloaded and would simply \u201cclick\u201d when the trigger was pulled. McCam acknowledged, however, that he did not check the gun to verify that it was unloaded before pulling the trigger. McCam stated that he had owned the gun \u201cfor at least a year\u201d before the shooting and had successfully completed a gun safety course. He also admitted that he had last used the gun without his grandparent\u2019s permission for tar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>get practice weeks before the shooting. On this prior occasion, McCam was \u201cin a hurry\u201d to put the gun away because he did not want his grandparents to catch him using the weapon without their supervision. McCam could not recall if he had unloaded the shotgun in his hurry to put the weapon away.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">II. <em>MASTERS </em>AND <em>NABOZNY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The policy language in this case and in <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny </em>are <em>identical. </em>Each policy provided coverage for an \u201coccurrence,\u201d which was later defined as an \u201caccident.\u201d Accident was not further defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">A. <em>MASTERS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\"><em>Masters </em>involved an intentionally set fire that had the unintended result of destroying nearly a block of business establishments. As in this case, the policy in <em>Masters </em>provided coverage for an \u201coccurrence,\u201d which was later defined in the policy as \u201can accident.\u201d 460 Mich 113. The insureds claimed that the event was an accident because, although the fire in their business premises was deliberately set, they did not intend to damage the adjoining buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The Court of Appeals applied a subjective standard in assessing whether the insured arsonists expected or intended to bum properties other than their own. This Court reversed. We first gave \u201caccident\u201d its customary, ordinary meaning as an \u201cundesigned contingency, a casualty, a happening by chance, something not anticipated, . . . and not naturally to be expected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114. Having defined accident, we nevertheless recognized the difficulty of categorizing cases in which the action giving rise to the harm was intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>even though the consequences were not. We <em>unanimously </em>held that an insured\u2019s intentional actions precluded coverage <em>even though </em>the insureds claimed not to have intended the consequences of their actions where the insured <em>\u201creasonably should have expected\u201d </em>the harm the insured\u2019s acts created. We adopted this objective standard from Justice Griffin\u2019s concurrence in <em>Auto Club Group Ins Co v Marzonie, </em>447 Mich 624, 648-649; 527 NW2d 760 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">In such cases, a determination must be made whether the consequences of the insured\u2019s intentional act either were intended by the insured or <em>reasonably should have been expected </em>because of the direct risk of harm intentionally created by the insured\u2019s actions. When an insured acts intending to cause property damage or personal injury, liability coverage should be denied, irrespective of whether the resulting injury is different from the injury intended. <em>Similarly, . . . when an insured\u2019s intentional actions create a direct risk of harm, there can be no liability coverage for any resulting damage or injury, despite the lack of an actual intent to damage or injure. [Masters, </em>460 Mich at 115-116 (Emphasis added.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Granting summary disposition to the insurer, this Court held that, because the Masters intended to cause harm, \u201c [i]t is irrelevant whether the harm that resulted, damage to the clothing store and surrounding businesses, was different from or exceeded the harm intended, minor damage to the clothing inventory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116-117. We later applied this same objective test in <em>Nabozny.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">B. <em>NABOZNY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Similarly, in <em>Nabozny, </em>the plaintiff was injured in a fight with the insured. The policy at issue was identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>cal to the one in <em>Masters </em>and this case, and provided coverage for an \u201coccurrence,\u201d which, in turn, was defined as \u201can accident.\u201d 461 Mich 474. As in the present case, the insured claimed that the injury he caused was a covered occurrence because he did not intend to break the plaintiffs ankle. We unanimously rejected that argument, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">In this case, Mr. Burkhardt apparently did not intend to break Mr. Nabozny\u2019s ankle. However, it is plain that in tripping someone to the ground in the course of a fight, <em>Mr. Burkhardt reasonably should have expected the consequences of his acts because of the direct risk of harm created. </em>This precludes a finding of liability coverage under the terms of this policy. In other words, the injury did not result from an \u201caccident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">Moreover, Mr. Burkhardt\u2019s testimony that he did not intend to \u201cbreak any bones\u201d does not assist him. In our quote from <em>Marzonie, </em>Justice Griffin cited <em>Piccard, </em>which explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\u201c[W]here a direct risk of harm is intentionally created, and property damage or personal injury results, there is no liability coverage even if the specific result was unintended. It is irrelevant that the character of the harm that actually results is different from the character of the harm intended by the insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">It is clear from the facts, as stated by the insured, that injury reasonably should have been expected. Therefore, it is irrelevant that the broken ankle was not the specific harm intended by the insured. <em>[Id. </em>at 480-481 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">It is worth reemphasizing that in both <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny </em>the policy language we construed was <em>identical </em>to the policy language contained in the present case. Here, like <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny, </em>the insured engaged in a deliberate act but claimed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>resulting unintended consequences rendered the event an accident. In both <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny, </em>this Court rejected this argument and held that there was no covered \u201coccurrence\u201d because the insured <em>reasonably should have expected </em>the consequences of his intentional actions\u2014even when the insured himself did not anticipate such consequences. Thus, in <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny </em>we declined to view the expectation of the injury from the subjective perspective of the insureds in making the determination whether an accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">C. THE MAJORITY\u2019S MISAPPLICATION OF <em>MASTERS </em>AND <em>NABOZNY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The majority erroneously states that the \u201cdifference\u201d between the present case and <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny </em>\u201cis that here, while the act was intended, the result was not.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 290. There is no such \u201cdifference\u201d among these three cases. Rather, in <em>both Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny, </em>the insureds made precisely the same claim as presented here\u2014that they did not intend <em>the result </em>of their deliberate acts. Robert intended to pull the trigger of his shotgun, but he testified that he did not intend to cause any physical injury to his friend. The question for the purpose of coverage is whether the shooting can be considered an accident because Robert should <em>not </em>have <em>reasonably expected </em>the consequences when he intentionally aimed his shotgun at the head of his friend, cocked the hammer, and pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The purported difference between this case and <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny </em>has been <em>created </em>by the majority, which has imposed a different construction of the phrase \u201cintentional act.\u201d As stated in <em>Masters, </em>this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Court unanimously adopted an <em>objective </em>test of intentionality: an intentional act causing injury is not an accident if the insured actually intended the harm or if the harm should <em>reasonably </em>have been expected.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Here, the majority fails to apply the objective <em>Masters </em>test of intentionality, instead substituting a subjective one.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority states that \u201c[w]e agree with plaintiff that Robert intended to point the gun at Kevin and pull the trigger.<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> <em>However, Robert believed that the gun was not loaded. Robert had no intention of firing a loaded weapon. </em>No bodily injury would have been caused by Robert\u2019s intended act of pulling the trigger of an unloaded gun.\u201d Ante at 285 (emphasis added). What the majority must justify, but cannot, is why we must consider his act of pointing a shotgun at another person and pulling the trigger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>from Robert\u2019s subjective perspective.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the <em>Masters </em>test, the question is whether the insured \u201creasonably\u201d should have expected the consequence because of the direct risk of harm he intentionally created. However, the majority tautologically concludes as a matter of law that \u201cRobert should not have reasonably expected the consequences that ensued from his act because his intended act was merely to pull the trigger of an <em>unloaded </em>gun.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ante at 290 (emphasis added). However, what Robert\u2019s reasonable expectations <em>should have </em>been, not what his actual subjective beliefs may or may not have been, are the focus of the <em>Masters </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The majority erroneously maintains that the test we articulated in <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny </em>is a subjective one. However, the majority fails to explain our objective application of the test in both cases. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the term \u201creasonably\u201d has consistently been construed as indicating an objective rather than a subjective standard. In <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, </em>432 Mich 656; 443 NW2d 734 (1989), six justices, including the author of the current majority opinion, agreed that \u201c \u2018reasonably be expected\u2019 is unambiguous\u201d and \u201crequires application of an objective standard of expectation.\u201d 432 Mich 688. In <em>Fire Ins Exchange v Diehl, </em>450 Mich 678, 685; 545 NW2d 602 (1996), the Court held that injury \u201c \u2018neither expected nor intended by the insured\u2019 \u201d required a subjective standard of expectation where the policy language did <em>\u201cnot </em>employ the term \u2018reasonably.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority simply refuses to acknowledge that the test adopted in <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny </em>utilizes the same language that has been construed by this Court as requiring an <em>objective </em>standard of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Without offering any rationale for doing so, the majority makes the insured\u2019s subjective belief regarding the status of the gun definitive, as though no contrary conclusion were possible. The issue is whether, in intentionally creating a direct risk of harm\u2014pulling the trigger of a shotgun without ascertaining if it was loaded\u2014the insured should have <em>reasonably </em>expected the consequences. Given that the applicable standard is <em>objective, </em>the insured\u2019s subjective belief is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Inexplicably, under the standard adopted by the majority, neither the holding nor the outcome in <em>Masters </em>or <em>Nabozny </em>could be sustained today.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">III. APPLICATION OF <em>MASTERS </em>AND <em>NABOZNY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">In the present case, it is uncontested that Robert McCam intentionally aimed the weapon at the victim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>engaged the hammer, and pulled the trigger.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because he denied intending the actual injury, the event is an \u201coccurrence\u201d only if he should not have <em>reasonably </em>expected the consequences in light of the direct risk of harm intentionally created.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The scope of the direct risk of harm created by an insured\u2019s act is necessarily dependent upon the nature of the intentional act and the facts and circumstances surrounding the event. The direct risk of harm created by intentionally throwing knives, for example, is far greater than the direct risk of harm created by intentionally throwing cotton balls. In each instance, the natural result of the voluntary act must be considered. See 9 Couch, Insurance, 3d, \u00a7 126:27, p 126-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">What is the direct risk of harm consonant with pulling the trigger of a firearm? The obvious risk is that the weapon, if loaded, might discharge and cause an injury. In my view, the evidence adduced at the summary disposition stage warrants the conclusion that the insured should have reasonably expected the consequences of his intentional act.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In his deposition testimony, McCarn testified that he consumed marijuana before taking the weapon out of storage. He also testified that he believed that the gun was unloaded and that he was \u201cjust playing\u201d when he pulled the trigger of the weapon. However, he later admitted that he intended to frighten LaBelle into parting with crackers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>In addition, McCarn admitted that he did not check the status of the gun before pulling the trigger. He also testified that the last time he used the gun, he put it away hurriedly and could not recall whether he unloaded the weapon before putting it away. Further, the insured admitted that he deliberately aimed the weapon one foot away from the victim\u2019s face, engaged the hammer, and pulled the trigger in an effort to <em>assault </em>the victim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">As we noted in <em>Nabozny, </em>\u201cit can be in the interest of an insured defendant to provide testimony that will allow an injured plaintiff to recover from the insurer rather than directly from the defendant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 479, n 10. As stated, I do not believe that reasonable jurors could conclude that Robert\u2019s stated beliefs about the harm he was creating were reasonable. Inasmuch as the reasonableness of Robert\u2019s expectations about the harm he created is <em>the </em>critical issue for the purpose of coverage under this policy, summary disposition in favor of plaintiff is appropriate. Therefore, I believe that the majority errs in holding that the event was an accident as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Because I believe that Robert reasonably should have expected the consequences of his actions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>light of the direct risk of harm he created, I would affirm summary disposition in favor of plaintiff.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b429-5\">Corrigan, C.J., and Weaver, J., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Masters, </em>460 Mich 105; 595 NW2d 832 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\"> <em>Nabozny v Burkhardt, </em>461 Mich 471; 606 NW2d 639 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b419-7\"> Before retrieving the shotgun, McCam testified that he and LaBelle got something to eat after school, went to a friend\u2019s house for ten minutes, smoked \u201c[o]ne joint and a bowl\u201d of marijuana, watched videos, and played with a guinea pig and a hedgehog.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\"> While earlier in his testimony, McCarn denied pointing the gun at LaBelle with the intention of frightening him, stating that he was \u201cjust playing,\u201d he also admitted that he thought the anticipated clicking sound \u201cwould\" be frightening\u201d to LaBelle. Later on in his testimony, McCam admitted that he was \u201cattempting to frighten\u201d LaBelle \u201cinto giving [him] the crackers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b424-5\"> To reiterate, the Masters standard is as follows: \u201c[A] determination must be made whether the consequences of the insured\u2019s intentional act \u2018either were intended by the insured or <em>reasonably should have been expected </em>because of the direct risk of harm intentionally created by the insured\u2019s actions.\u2019 \u201d The majority attempts to avoid applying an objective standard, urging that, in the <em>Masters </em>standard, \u201cby the insured\u201d modifies both \u201cintended\u201d and \u201cexpected.\u201d This is grammatically incorrect. In fact, grammatically speaking, the phrases \u201cintended by the insured\u201d and \u201creasonably should have expected\u201d modify \u201cconsequences.\u201d Therefore, the <em>Masters </em>standard unqualifiedly and grammatically requires an inquiry into the reasonableness of the insured\u2019s expectations concerning the consequences of his intentional acts. This is an objective inquiry, not, as the majority contends, a subjective one.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">It appears to me that this Court wisely chose to use an objective definition of accident in <em>Masters </em>because it creates a disincentive for collusion between an insured and a plaintiff. See <em>Nabozny, supra </em>at 479, n 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\"> This Court is free to abandon for sufficient reason its own precedent. When it does so, it should do it openly and provide justification. Here the majority abandons the rule it established in <em>Masters </em>after years of contradictory precedent without acknowledging (1) that it has done so or (2) why it is justified in doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[7]\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\">7 I note that the majority would have no factual or legal basis for concluding otherwise, because defendant admitted that he intentionally aimed the gun, engaged the hammer, and pulled the trigger in order to frighten his friend during their dispute over crackers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> This insistence on viewing Robert\u2019s act from his subjective perspective represents a critical flaw in the majority opinion. The majority declares that it must employ a subjective standard because this, as opposed to an objective standard, aids in construing the policy in favor of coverage. \u201c[W]here there is doubt, the policy should be construed in favor of the insured . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">This is contrary to the rules of contract interpretation. Contracts, even insurance contracts, are construed according to their unambiguous terms. It is only when there is an ambiguity in the policy language that provides a basis for using a rule of construction favoring coverage. <em>Masters, supra </em>at 111. Because we considered the very contract term at issue here, \u201caccident,\u201d in <em>Masters </em>and <em>Nabozny </em>and found no ambiguity, the majority has no warrant to \u201cconstrue\u201d that term in any different fashion in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\"> Yet another flaw in the majority opinion is that it attempts to divide the \u201cintentional act\u201d into components. Rather than view the act from the required perspective\u2014the consequences <em>reasonably </em>expected when a direct risk of harm is created\u2014the majority focuses on whether the insured intended to pull the trigger of an <em>unloaded </em>gun. Without basis, the majority subdivides the intentional act into two components, the voluntary act and the chain of events that the volitional act sets into motion\u2014 the consequences. The intentional act committed by Robert was that of pulling the trigger of a gun. That the gun was or was not loaded does not transform the nature of the insured\u2019s volitional act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b427-8\"> As such, the acts admitted by the insured constitute felonious assault, MCL 750.82.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\"> The majority would prefer to minimize the insured\u2019s <em>admitted </em>intent to cause harm\u2014to commit a felonious assault. I do not. As we stated in <em>Nabozny, </em>\u201c \u2018where a direct risk of harm is intentionally created, and property damage or personal injury results, there is no liability coverage <em>even if the specific result was unintended. </em>It is irrelevant that the <em>character </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the harm that actually results Is different from the <em>character </em>of the harm intended by the insured.\u2019 \u201d 461 Mich 481, quoting <em>Marzonie.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"><em> </em>The majority attempts to explain why Robert\u2019s later testimony about his prior use of the shotgun is not dispositive. However, I cannot think of a single reason why all the defendant\u2019s admissions should not be considered in deciding whether Robert should have reasonably anticipated the harm he caused in using his weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\"> As to the issue of how direct a harm the insured\u2019s actions created, this would be a much closer question\u2014and one requiring a trial\u2014if evidence were presented that the insured had checked the gun and mistakenly (or negligently) determined that it was unloaded before pulling the trigger.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
