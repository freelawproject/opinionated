Kinderbook Knitted Cap Co., </em>295 NYS 940 (1937) interpreting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the instant statutes, we are bound to follow <em>Alexander </em>and conclude that the suit was properly dismissed since the corporation had ceased to exist at the time of the motion, more than three years having elapsed since its dissolution.
