Olson\u201d. The report states \"(F)allowing notice to Harry Olson only, a motion to attach the 'real estate of the defendant, Harry Olson, or specially standing in the name of Shirley F.

Further, the report states \"the attachment was The defendant defaulted and execution issued on May 9, 1975 indicating the plaintiff recovered \"judgment against Harry Olson of Peabody, County of Essex, and the real estate at 2 Kingdom Court, Peabody, whether standing in his name or specially standing in the name of Shirley F.

The plaintiff filed requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">As a result of the hearing the justice by order (marked \"G\u201d)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">1.

A copy of this order be served upon the Essex County Deputy Sheriff and be recorded in the Registry of Deeds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">On January 14,1976 the justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-14\">1. again allowed Shirley to intervene</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-15\">2. denied the defendant\u2019s motion to correct a clerical error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-16\">3. granted relief under Rule 60(b) to Shirley by finding there was no judgment against her, and by quashing the execution against her and the property at 2 Kingdom Court, Peabody standing in her name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-17\">With this ruling, he filed findings wherein he found that Shirley purchased the property in October, 1973 for consideration of $28,900.00; that she was the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>mortgagor to a bank for $23,000.00; and that no fraud existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The plaintiff claims to be aggrieved by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">1. the court\u2019s orders, above referred to as \"F\u201d and \"G\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">2. the denial of its requests for rulings numbered 1, 2 and 3 as to Shirley\u2019s motion for relief of judgment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">3. the vacating of the execution against Shirley</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\"><em>4. </em>the dismissal of \"the attachment previously made\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">5. and \"by other rulings made in arriving at the decision on Shirley F. Olson\u2019s Motion for Relief of Judgment\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">The three requests from the denial of which the plaintiff claims to be aggrieved are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">1. \"The evidence and law requires a finding that this court has no jurisdiction to restrain the plaintiff or sheriff from proceeding with levy on the execution now well along in progress; this can be done only by a Superior Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-13\">2. \"The defendant, Shirley Olson, has set forth no grounds recognized at law (and in the District Court for permitting relief from judgment (after execution and levy).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-14\">3. \"The <em>Bay State </em>Case specifically exempted 'special attachments\u2019 (G.L.c. 223, \u00a767) from notice requirements (the plaintiff would suggest, because the interest of the defendant is being attached in property standing in another\u2019s name, not the interest of the true owner of record); therefore, the absence of notice to Shirley F. Olson has caused her no harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">After the report was established and forwarded to this Appellate Division, the plaintiff filed a motion with this Division, to amend the report to include additional exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number> Dist./Mun. Cts. R. Civ. P. 64(c)(5) states: \u201cAfter the report is allowed ... all motions shall be filed with the Clerk of the trial court. ..\", which was not followed in this instance. The motion is denied for the additional reason that allegations or documents cannot be added to a report, even if the parties so agree, if the trial justice has not assented. <em>Staples v. Collins, </em>321 Mass. 449, 450 (1947). The report, as distinguished from the draft report, is the report of the trial justice. <em>Perry v. Hanover, </em>314 Mass. 167, 168 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"> On the motion to interevene, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Dist./Mun. Cts. R. Civ. P. 24(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201cUpon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action .... (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property . . . which is the subject of the action and he is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant\u2019s interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The action was commenced against the defendant <em>and </em>the real estate at 2 Kingdom Court, Peabody whether standing \u201cin the defendant\u2019s name or specially standing in the name of\u201d Shirley.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">At the hearing on the motions, upon evidence submitted, the justice found that Shirley was the purchaser for #28,900.00, the sole mortgagor for $23,000.00 and that no fraud existed. \u201cFindings of fact by a trial judge in an action of law cannot be reversed unless they cannot be supported on any rational view of the evidence.\u201d <em>Abele v. Dietz, </em>312 Mass. 685, 690 (1942). Even if it was discretionary to allow Shirley to intervene, the justice\u2019s decision to allow the intervention will not be reversed unless it clearly appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>that there has been an abuse of such discretion. <em>Dillaway v. Burton, </em>256 Mass. 568, 576-577 (1926). We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"> There was no error in the allowance of Shirley\u2019s motion for relief pursuant to Dist./Mun. Cts. R. Civ. P. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The appellant argues that Shirley was an intervener and not a party, and therefore has no standing to seek relief under Rule 60(b). Permission was granted for Shirley to intervene as a party defendant and as such is afforded all rights as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\"> Rule 60(b)(6) authorizes a justice to \"relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, ordered or proceeding for the following reason: . . . (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">According to the report, the court, after notice to the defendant only, allowed a motion to attach real estate of the defendant or specially standing in the name of Shirley. The allowance of said motion was pursuant to G.L.c. 223, \u00a767. However, when the court examined the evidence submitted by Shirley after intervening as a party defendant, the justice found there was no fraud in the conveyances of title, and therefore G.L.c. 223 \u00a767, dealing with attachments for fraudulently conveyed property, did not apply; and he corrected his earlier action by dismissing that part of the attachment against the specific land at 2 Kingdom Court, Peabody standing in the name of Shirley.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Therefore there were no errors in the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s three requests for rulings, nor by the rulings of the court. Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
