J.</author>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Defendants are charged with a number of drug related offenses, including manufacture of a controlled substance, marijuana. ORS 475.992(1). The state appeals pretrial orders suppressing evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant. The issue is whether the information in the affidavit, submitted to obtain the warrant, established probable cause to believe that the evidence would be at defendants\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Officer Paul, the affiant, swore in the affidavit that he had spoken to a \u201cconfidential reliable informant,\u201d referred to as \u201cA\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">\u201c \u2018A\u2019 told me a person by the name of \u2018Cliff lives on Nonpareil Road, Sutherlin and is growing marijuana. \u2018A\u2019 observed, in the back of the garage building, a room set up for a marijuana grow, it has marijuana stalks without leaves in it, and marijuana is being dried in the garage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">\u201cIn the house, \u2018A\u2019 observed a closet converted over to drying marijuana. Observed by \u2018A\u2019 were several ounces to pounds of marijuana being dried. \u2018A\u2019 stated that \u2018A\u2019 observed all of this approximately two months ago.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The balance of the affidavit describes the affiant\u2019s experience with and knowledge about illegal drug operations, facts about \u201cA\u2019\u201ds credibility and reliability as an informant and a table showing the monthly electric power usage of defendants\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The trial court held that there were two deficiencies in the affidavit and, therefore, that it did not establish probable cause to support a warrant. The court first concluded that the recitation of the electric power consumption was \u201cuseless,\u201d because there was no information about whether it was high, low or average for a residence of the size indicated. Second, the court concluded that the information from \u201cA\u201d was \u201cstale.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Defendants characterize the trial court\u2019s determination as findings of fact that we must accept if there is evidence to support them. The scope of our review is the same as that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the trial court. We review the facts averred in the affidavit to determine if the issuing magistrate could reasonably have drawn inferences from the data in the affidavit to find probable cause to issue a search warrant. If the affidavit is not controverted, there is no fact-finding involved in a review of the magistrate\u2019s decision to issue the warrant. <em>State v. Young, </em>108 Or App 196, 816 P2d 612 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">We share the trial court\u2019s concern about the usefulness of the data on electric power consumption. The affiant stated in the affidavit that the data showed \u201chigh power usage.\u201d However, there is no information, other than that conclusion, to demonstrate any basis of comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Even disregarding the power use information, there are sufficient facts recited to support the magistrate\u2019s issuance of the warrant. The informant told the officer that there was a setup for a marijuana growing operation in defendants\u2019 residence and that a closet in the house had been converted for drying marijuana. \u201cA\u201d had made those observations in defendants\u2019 house about two months before the warrant was issued. That information, from a concededly reliable informant, ORS 133.545(4), is sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that evidence of a marijuana growing operation would be in the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u201cA\u201d \u2019s recitation to the officer was in conclusory form. The activity that \u201cA\u201d observed was described as a \u201croom set up for a marijuana grow\u201d and \u201ca closet converted over to drying marijuana.\u201d The statements are an acceptable shorthand method of describing what was seen by \u201cA.\u201d <em>State v. Lichty, </em>313 Or 579, 835 P2d 904 (1992). The affidavit disclosed that \u201cA,\u201d because of his background, would recognize a marijuana growing operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">We disagree with the trial court\u2019s determination and the defendants\u2019 argument that, because of the time between \u201cA\u201d \u2019s observation and the issuance of the warrant, there is no basis for an inference that evidence would still be in the house. The information was not about a quantity of marijuana that may be consumed or moved, but about a marijuana growing operation. The evidence sought was not only marijuana, like that seen by the informant, but other more durable evidence of an on-going drug manufacturing operation. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>is reasonable to believe that that operation would continue for a considerable period of time. <em>State v. Young, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The court erred by granting the motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-11\"> The court concluded that \u201cA\u201d was credible and the information given by \u201cA\u201d was reliable. Defendants do not challenge that conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
