Hamilton and a search team searched Box\u2019s house and found methamphetamine. Defendants were indicted for possession of a controlled substance. ORS 475.992(4). The affidavit supporting the warrant application was based, in part, on observations that officers had previously made during a warrantless search of the house. The court ruled that that information should be excised from the affidavit, because the state failed to establish that the person who consented to the warrantless search had actual authority to grant consent. It then ruled that, without that information, the affidavit did not establish probable cause to search Box\u2019s house, and it granted defendants\u2019 motions to suppress. The state appeals. ORS 138.060(3). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"> In his affidavit, Hamilton said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cDetective Welty said that on September 20, 1990 at approximately 1:00 pm, he and two other detectives gained consent [to] search Roger Box\u2019s residence by Richard Arnold who was in control of the residence, as they were searching for a wanted person. * * * Welty further stated that while he and other detectives were searching the residence he observed paraphernalia and packaging material associated with the sales and use of methamphetamines. Detective Welty said that he observed Arnold pick up a piece of plastic that Arnold put in his mouth. Detective Welty said that he recognized this piece of plastic as part of a package used to contain methamphetamine, as Detective Welty has worked in [an] undercover capacity and purchased methamphetamines on more than thirty (30) separate occasions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The trial court ruled that Welty\u2019s statements about what he saw in Box\u2019s house should be stricken from the affidavit, because the state failed to establish that Arnold had actual authority to consent to a search. The state bears the burden of proving the lawfulness of a warrantless search. ORS 133.693(4); Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 9; <em>State v. </em>Stevens, 311 Or 119, 126, 806 P2d 92 (1991); <em>State v. Davis, </em>295 Or 227, 237, 666 P2d 802 (1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Voluntary consent is a recognized exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>to the warrant requirement. Article I, section 9, requires that the person granting consent have actual authority. <em>State v. Lynch, </em>94 Or App 168, 171-72, 764 P2d 957 (1988).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Hamilton\u2019s affidavit contains the conclusory statement that Arnold \u201cwas in control of the [Box] residence.\u201d A more artfully drafted affidavit might have articulated <em>facts </em>that would establish that Arnold was in control of the house, but \u201c[p]eople often speak in the shorthand of opinions or conclusions, not in the form of a recitation of pure fact. \u2019 \u2019 <em>State v. Lichty, </em>313 Or 579, 585, 835 P2d 904 (1992). Hamilton\u2019s conclusory statement that Arnold was in control of the residence, taken at face value, is sufficient to establish that Arnold had actual authority to consent to a search. Defendants brought that authority into issue by filing their motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Welty testified at the hearing on their motions. He said that he and two other detectives went to Box\u2019s house on September 20,1990. Richard Arnold, Sr., answered the door. The detectives identified themselves, because they were not wearing uniforms. Welty \u201casked him at that time whether or not he was in control of the residence because [the detectives] knew that the residence belonged to Roger Box.\u201d Welty testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201c[Arnold said that] he was watching the place while Roger was in jail; and we knew at that time that Roger Box was in jail. He further indicated that nobody came to the residence \u2014inside the residence without his okay. He then allowed us to search the residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Welty\u2019s testimony, if believed, is sufficient to establish that Box had granted Arnold actual authority to consent to a search of his house. Defendants offered no evidence to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>contrary. The trial court made no finding on Welty\u2019s credibility, and he is, therefore, presumed to be truthful. ORS 44.370. The state satisfied its burden of proving that the consent search was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In its oral ruling on defendants\u2019 motions to suppress, the trial court indicated that Hamilton\u2019s affidavit could not have established probable cause to search, even if the earlier consent search had been lawful. We disagree. The affidavit states that, on October 1, 1990, Hamilton spoke with Welty, who said that he and Sergeant Nelson had watched Box\u2019s residence for two and a half hours on September 19. During that time,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201cseven (7) separate vehicles came to the residence. Detective Welty described the visitors to the residence as \u2018short term\u2019 meaning only one of the occupants would leave the vehicle, the passenger would walk to the residence and then immediately return to the vehicle and leave. One of the vehicles parked around the corner from the residence and dropped a passenger off, the passenger walked to the residence, and then immediately returned to the waiting vehicle after making contact with an individual at the residence. Based on my training and experience and Detective Welty\u2019s training and experience this type of short term traffic is consistent with narcotic sales.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">On September 29,1990, Hamilton spoke with Drennan, who \u201cwas currently under arrest [and was] in possession of methamphetamine.\u201d Drennan told him that, 18 hours earlier, he had been at Box\u2019s house \u201ccutting up\u201d three pounds of methamphetamine with Gunn, Arnold, Metzger and Smokey.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In its order granting defendants\u2019 motions to suppress, the trial court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">\u201cThe information provided by the named informant on the 29th of September, 1990, was not adequately corroborated * * *. The information derived from the September 19th surveillance and the September 20th consent search was stale by the time that the named informant provided the additional information on September 29th.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The court correctly recognized that information provided by a named informant who is criminally involved must be corroborated. <em>State v. Carlile, </em>290 Or 161, 168, 619 P2d 1280 (1980). Welty\u2019s and Nelson\u2019s observations did corroborate Drennan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>statements. The activity that they observed at Box\u2019s house on September 19 was consistent with narcotics trafficking. On September 20, Welty saw \u201cparaphernalia and packaging material associated with the sales and use of methamphetamines\u201d in Box\u2019s residence. The information gained by surveillance and the consent search was not stale when the magistrate issued the warrant, because Drennan indicated that he had seen three pounds of methamphetamine in Box\u2019s house, less than a day earlier. The magistrate was entitled to conclude that evidence of controlled substances would probably still be located in Box\u2019s house. The search warrant was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Defendants Gunn, Thomas and Carter argue that, even if the warrant was valid, the trial court\u2019s decision should be affirmed, because the officers who conducted the search violated the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will affirm the judgment of the trial court if it reached the correct result, even if for the wrong reason. Or Const, Art VII, \u00a7 3; <em>State v. Affeld, </em>307 Or 125, 128, 764 P2d 220 (1988).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hamilton testified at the suppression hearing that, on October 2, he and five other officers arrived at Box\u2019s house with a search team in an unmarked van. They parked the van 20 to 25 feet from the front door. The officers crossed the yard \u201cat a dead run.\u201d The front door was open, but the screen door was closed. Hamilton testified: \u2018 \u2018And from the instant we exited the van, crossed the front yard and entered the front door, we were yelling, \u2018police, search warrant.\u2019 \u201d They did not stop and knock. Instead, they \u201copened up the screen door [and] entered the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">ORS 133.575 does not specifically require that officers knock before entering \u2014 it requires-that they provide \u201cappropriate notice.\u201d The issue is whether running across the lawn while shouting \u201cpolice, search warrant\u201d is appropriate notice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>State v. Valentine/Darroch, </em>264 Or 54, 60, 504 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>P2d 84 (1972), <em>cert den </em>412 US 948 (1973), the Supreme Court recognized that the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule encompasses a privacy interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">\u201cIt must be remembered that the police officers have the right to enter after they announce their presence and purpose and, <em>if entry is denied, they have the right to force entry. </em>The only right of privacy protected by the announcement requirement is the right to know who is entering, why he is entering, and <em>a few seconds to prepare for his entry.\u201d </em>264 Or at 60. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In <em>State v. Bost, </em>114 Or App 519, 837 P2d 536 (1992), the defendants were brothers. One lived in a house with their mother. The other lived in a trailer behind the house. The officers arrived and parked 7 to 10 feet from the front door. As they ran toward the door, they could see one of the defendants and his mother sitting at the kitchen table. The defendant and his mother looked at the officers, who announced their identity and that they had a search warrant. As the mother reached for the door knob, the officers kicked in the door, breaking her thumb in the process. The other defendant and a friend were sleeping in the trailer. The police kicked in the trailer door after announcing their presence. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the officers \u201cdid not allow adequate time for [the] defendants to respond.\u201d We reasoned: \u201cIf the officers may only break in if necessary, after making their announcement, something more than announcing is required.\u201d 114 Or App at 524. <em>See also United States v. Johnson, </em>643 F Supp 1465, 1471 (D Or), <em>aff'd </em>822 F2d 62 (9th Cir 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Here, the trial court concluded that the officers did not violate the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule. In its oral ruling, the court explained:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">\u201cThe purpose of the knock and announce rule is a requirement that officers announce their presence, their purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>and their intent of entry. And I think that the evidence as I viewed it establishes that that was done. So I find no violation of [the rule].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">That ruling reveals that the court did not consider whether the occupants of Box\u2019s house had \u201ca few seconds to prepare\u201d for the officers\u2019 entry, and there is no evidence indicating that the officers paused, even momentarily, before entering. <em>Compare State v. Stalbert, </em>99 Or App 582, 783 P2d 1005 (1989) (no violation of ORS 133.575(2) when officers paused \u201cno more than two seconds\u201d between knocking and breaking through the door). Hamilton and his search team violated ORS 133.575(2), because they gave the occupants no time at all to prepare for their entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Nonetheless, the evidence seized during the search is subject to suppression only if the violation of ORS 133.575(2) was \u201caggravated.\u201d <em>Cf. State v. Bishop, </em>288 Or 349, 605 P2d 642 (1979) (knock and announce rule for executing an arrest); <em>State v. Arce, supra </em>n 5, 83 Or App at 189 n 4. The legislature intended ORS 133.575(2) to codify the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, a violation of the statute must rise to constitutional proportions before it will require suppression. <em>State v. Valentine/Darroch, supra, </em>264 Or at 66-69; <em>State v. Schultz, </em>109 Or App 407, 409-10, 819 P2d 762 (1991), <em>rev den </em>313 Or 211 (1992); <em>State v. Tweed, </em>62 Or App 711, 716, 663 P2d 38 (1983).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">We have held that violations of ORS 133.575(2) were aggravated and required suppression in only three cases: <em>State v. Bost, supra; State v. Ford, </em>99 Or App 1, 780 P2d 1192 (1989), <em>rev\u2019d </em>310 Or 623, 801 P2d 754 (1990); <em>State v. Tweed, supra. </em>In <em>Tweed, </em>three plainclothes officers had consumed a six-pack of beer before executing a warrant at 12:15 A.M. They were joined by five other officers, only one of whom wore a uniform. One of the plainclothes officers knocked on the door. When the defendant opened the door slightly, the officer stepped in, flashed his badge, pulled an automatic weapon from underneath his coat and pointed it at the defendant. The gun was shaking and the officer smelled of alcohol. Both of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>occupants testified that they thought they were being robbed. In <em>Bost, supra, </em>the defendants\u2019 mother was reaching for the door knob when the officers kicked in the door and broke her thumb.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">None of the aggravating circumstances that were present in <em>Tweed </em>or <em>Bost, </em>occurred here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The officers arrived around 11:30 in the morning. They were not wearing uniforms, but they were wearing flak jackets with either \u201csheriff\u2019 or \u201cpolice\u201d printed in large letters. The front door was open, and the occupants could see the officers approaching. The officers opened the screen door. They did not kick or break anything. No one was injured. Nobody was in bed when the police entered. The officers were not intoxicated. They had their guns drawn, but that alone is not sufficient to invalidate a search pursuant to a lawful warrant. <em>See State v. Berardinelli, </em>95 Or App 364, 769 P2d 235, <em>rev den </em>308 Or 79 (1989). The violation of ORS 133.575(2) does not require suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\"> The state cannot shift the burden to the defendant simply by putting the evidence gleaned from a warrantless search into an affidavit in support of an application for a warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\"> In <em>State v. Carsey, </em>295 Or 32, 44-46, 664 P2d 1085 (1983), our Supreme Court held that, under the Fourth Amendment, a person who consents to a search must have actual authority to consent. In <em>State v. Lynch, supra, </em>we addressed the issue of third-party consent under Article I, section 9. We found <em>Carsey </em>to be persuasive, and we held that the Oregon Constitution requires that a person who consents to a search have actual authority to consent. Subsequently, the United States Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment does not require actual authority. <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 US 177, 110 S Ct 2793, 111 L Ed 2d 148 (1990). That decision does not change our interpretation of Article I, section 9. We adhere to our conclusion that it requires actual authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\"> ORS 133.575(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u201cThe executing officer shall, before entering the premises [to be searched], give appropriate notice of the identity, authority and purpose of the officer * * * to the person in apparent control of the premises to be searched[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\"> Defendant Phillips did not address the issue in his brief. Defendants Richard Arnold, Sr., .and Richard Arnold, Jr., did not file briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b296-10\"> Hamilton did not testify that the police anticipated that this particular search might be dangerous or that the occupants might destroy evidence or attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>escape if the officers stopped to knock. Accordingly, the officers executing the warrant were required to comply with ORS 133.575(2). <em>State v. Ford, </em>310 Or 623, 637, 801 P2d 754 (1990); <em>State v. Arce, </em>83 Or App 185, 188, 730 P2d 1260 (1986), <em>rev den </em>303 Or 322 (1987). In <em>Arce, </em>we observed that the \u201cknock and announce\u201d statute does not expressly articulate any exceptions and concluded that the magistrate therefore had no authority to issue a warrant containing an exception. However, <em>Ford </em>indicates that the three common law exceptions to the rule may be invoked by officers executing a warrant. 310 Or at 637 n 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\"> The constitutional \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule is intended to \u201cprotect persons who might be injured by violent resistance to unannounced entries and to protect the householder\u2019s right to privacy.\u201d <em>State v. Schultz, supra, </em>109 Or App at 409. Suppression is required if both of those interests are violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b299-6\"> <em>State v. Ford, supra, </em>provides no guidance, because the Supreme Court held that the officers reasonably apprehended peril and were therefore excused from complying with ORS 133.575(2). 310 Or at 638-39.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
