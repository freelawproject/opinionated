This amount represented money expended by Dan Boone for the benefit of these creditors before the initiation of the bankruptcy proexeding. The appeal having been docketed in this court, motion was made by the appellants for diminution of the record. Upon the hearing of this motion, this court, deeming its jurisdiction doubtful, requested counsel to file briefs upon the question of whether or not the allowance of appeal by the district judge gave this court jurisdiction of the appeal. It is conceded in these briefs that the question depends upon whether the order appealed from was made in a proceeding in bankruptcy or whether it was made in a controversy in bankruptcy. 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 47, 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-22\">The order of the referee approved by the court merely gave effect to the consent of the creditors that certain moneys payable to them in due course from the funds of the bankrupt estate should be distributed to Dan Boone instead of to them because of their assignment pro tanto to him. This method of recognizing an assignment was in conformity with General Order No. 21, subd. 3, 11 U.S.C.A. following \u00a7 53 (see Remington on Bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ruptcy, \u00a7 737, \u00a7 900, note 6), requiring such recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">It is clear, then, that this is a rout\u00edhe proceeding in bankruptcy and is not a controversy therein. The allowance of appeal from the order by the District Court does not give this court jurisdiction of the appeal. 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 47, 48. Not having jurisdiction, we of course express no opinion on the merits of the - appeal nor on the right of claimants to make an assignment of a part of their respective claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
