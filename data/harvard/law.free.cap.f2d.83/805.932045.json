His sentence began August 12, 1933. His \u201cgood time\u201d allowance under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 710, for faithful observance of rules was 252 days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 11, 1934, petitioner was transferred to the United States Hospital for Defective Delinquents at Springfield, Missouri. On December 6, 1934, he was charged by the superintendent of that institution with an attempt to escape and the following administrative finding was made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVg\">\u201c12-6-1934 AtUSHDD:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-11\">\u201cViolation of prison rules: Attempt to escape; at 5:30 PM 12-6-34. Tom Griffin and Ed Steelman, No. 224-PCS had cut the three barbed guard wires above the wrought iron fence at the first post south of the power house &amp; above prisoners were climbing over fence. They had leaned a railroad tie against fence to climb upon (R. B. McGhee, Guard).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-12\">\u201cAction: Forfeit all statutory good time &amp; all accumulated Camp good time to date. (D. A. Remer, Asst. Supt. Prison Camp).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2c\">Petitioner was placed in solitary confinement for twenty-two days and then was returned to the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">On August 26,1935, petitioner was charged by indictment returned in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Missouri with attempt to escape. On October 14, 1935, the criminal charge was dismissed on motion of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-16\">On December 19, 1935, petitioner applied to the warden of the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth for restoration of his \u201cgood time\u201d allowance and was advised by the warden it would not be restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-17\">On January 8, 1936, petitioner filed his complaint for a writ of habeas corpus, based on the proposition that he was unlawfully deprived of his \u201cgood time\u201d allowance and therefore illegally restrained of his liberty. He did not allege or offer to prove that the administrative finding was arbitrary, capricious or fraudulent, or that he did not in fact attempt to escape from the hospital at Springfield, but asserted the dismissal of the criminal charge refuted the truth of the administrative finding. We do not agree. Other reasons than want of guilt may have prompted the United States to dismiss the charge. The Attorney General or his representative, on full consideration of the facts, may have regarded the loss of \u201cgood time\u201d and the solitary confinement, sufficient punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-18\">Furthermore, petitioner has an administrative remedy under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 711, by applying to the Attorney General for restoration of his \u201cgood time\u201d allowance, which he has not exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-19\">In his reply brief counsel for petitioner asserts the \u201cgood time\u201d was not ordered forfeited by the \u201cgood time board,\u201d but the assertion is not supported either by averment or proof in the record and the order of forfeiture is presumptively regular. In re Terrill (C.C.A.8) 144 F. 616, 622; Lewis v. U.S., 279 U.S. 63, 73, 49 S.Ct. 257, 73 L.Ed. 615; U.S. v. Royer, 268 U.S. 394, 398, 45 S.Ct. 519, 69 L.Ed. 1011; Nofire v. U.S., 164 U.S. 657, 660, 17 S.Ct. 212, 41 L.Ed. 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-20\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-14\"> Section 710, supra, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2s\">\u201cEach prisoner who has been or shall hereafter be convicted of any offense against the laws of the United States, and is confined, in execution of the judgment or sentence upon any such conviction, in any United States penitentiary or jail, or in any penitentiary, prison, or jail . of any State or-Territory, for a definite term, .other than for life, whose record of conduct shows that he has faithfully observed all the rules and has not been subjected to punishment, shall be entitled to a deduction from the term of his sentence to be estimated as follows, commencing on the first day of his arrival at the penitentiary, prison, or jail: * * * Upon a sentence of not less than three years and less than five years, seven days for each month.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
