A jury was waived and the cause was tried to the court. After hearing the evidence the court determined the transaction covered by such contract was not a lease of such machinery but a sale thereof and permitted plaintiff to file the amended complaint asking for a reformation of the contract. The cause, at plaintiff\u2019s request, was then transferred to the equity side of the docket. The court thereupon found the City was without power to incur the debt created by the contract under the constitution and laws of Oklahoma and entered a decree dismissing the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">From such decree, plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">The evidence disclosed these facts. The City Council, on January 7, 1929, authorized the water committee of the City to dispose of certain old equipment for not less than $1000 and apply the proceeds as a down payment on the new machinery described in the contract and authorized the mayor to buy such machinery. No election was held on the question of incurring the indebtedness created by the contract. The waterworks department of the City collected $266,966.03 from 1921 to 1931 and warrants were issued during such period totalling $224,792.55 leaving a surplus of $42,173.48. The City was unable to pay its ordinary governmental expenses without the aid of the money received from the water department.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">A memorandum statement was submitted by the City as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">Total Assessed Valuation of 1928</p>\n<p id=\"b477-17\">Personal property ..... .....$ 924.380.00</p>\n<p id=\"AE7\">Real property ......... 217.770.00</p>\n<p id=\"A4q\">Pub.

City of Sapulpa, 145 Okl. 164, 292 P. 15; City of Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil &amp; Gas Co., 118 Okl. 201, 248 P. 336; State v. Short, 113 Okl. 187, 240 P. 700); and an indebtedness' when so assented to, must not with existing indebtedness, exceed the 5% limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Section 27, art. 10, supra, is a special grant of power to incorporated cities and towns, to incur debts for public utilities to be owned exclusively by such cities and towns, in excess of the limitations prescribed in section 26, supra. State v. Short, supra; City of Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil &amp; Gas Co., supra; Faught v. City of Sapulpa, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Debts incurred under such special grant are excluded from any computation made to determine whether the debt limit prescribed by section 26 has been exceeded. State v. Short, supra; City of Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil &amp; Gas Co., supra; Faught v. City of Sapulpa, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">No election was held respecting the incurring of the indebtedness under the contract. It was not submitted to the tax paying voters of the City under section 27, nor to the voters of the City under section 26, Plaintiff does not seriously contend that the indebtedness under the contract was within the income and revenue of the City provided for the year 1929, but asserts the contract did not create a debt within the meaning of section 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s theory is that the debt created by the' contract is valid for the reason that the City, acting in a proprietary capacity as the owner of its waterworks, is not limited in its expenditures for waterworks repairs or replacements by any debt limitation. It also relies on the Special Fund Doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\"> We cannot subscribe to that theory. The waterworks was acquired by the City by means of capital raised by the. sal% of' bonds. Such bonds ar\u00e9 general obligati\u00f3ns of the City. See section 6063, Okla.Stat. 1931. The interest and amount required to be set aside annually for the retirement of such bonds are recurring obligations of the \u25a0 City and must be provided for out of the annual income and revenue of the City. Likewise, the revenue from the waterworks is revenue to the City and must be taken into consideration in computing its annual income and revenue. In re Bliss, 142 Okl. 1, 285 P. 73, 78. Debts created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>by the City, whether for strictly government purposes or for waterworks purposes, if within the annual .income and revenue provided by the City are valid, but if in excess of such annual income and revenue, they are void under the limitation provision of section 26, supra. See Zachary v. City of Wagoner, 146 Okl. 268, 292 P. 345. This conclusion is further strengthened by the fact that section 27, supra, provides a way in which an indebtedness in excess of the annual income and revenue of the City with the assent of the tax paying voters of the City, may be validly incurred for repairs or replacements of the waterworks system.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Furthermore, the waterworks system was acquired through general obligation bonds which are a direct burden upon the taxpayers of the City. See Perrine v. Bonaparte, 140 Okl. 165, 282 P. 332, 334. Debts created in excess of the annual income and revenue of the City, although payable solely from revenue of the waterworks, would cast an incidental burden on the taxpayers of the City and would be within the limitation of section 26, supra. Fairbanks, Morse &amp; Co. v. City of Wagoner (C.C.A.10) 81 F.(2d) 209, 219; City of Campbell v. Arkansas-Missouri P. Co. (C.C.A.8) 55 F.(2d) 560, 563 See, also, In re Bliss, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In a great many jurisdictions, including Oklahoma (Baker v. Carter, 165 Okl. 116, 25 P.(2d) 747), a special fund doctrine has grown up to the effect that where a contract to purchase property provides for payment solely out of net earnings of the property purchased, a debt within the meaning of constitutional provisions such as sections 26 and 27, is not created. See Fairbanks, Morse &amp; Co. v. City of Wagoner (C.C.A.10) 81 F.(2d) 209, 216, and cases there cited. This contract contains no such provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Whether the City could validly create a debt for repairs, replacements or extensions of the waterworks system to be paid for solely out of waterworks revenues (see In re Bliss, 142 Okl. 1, 285 P. 73, 78) we need not decide. The contract here was a general obligation of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">We conclude the contract is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The contract being void, plaintiffs are not entitled to recover the property or the value of its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">In Board of Commissioners v. Western Bank &amp; Office Supply Co., 122 Okl. 244, 254 P. 741, 746, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">\u201cThe repeated decisions of this court had held such contracts void. There is no decision of this court on the law since statehood that even intimates that the property can be returned, and the statute on its face provides that their remedy is a suit against the officers entering into such an agreement. If it had brought such a suit and recovered judgment, we would not in the least be reluctant to affirm the same; but it has sued the municipality and not resorted to the remedy which the law gives it, and prayed for a return of the property, which could have no other effect except an indirect evasion by forcing a tax levy in a subsequent year to pay for this property, purchased in a previous year. To sanction this would be to strike down the plain intent and purpose of the provisions of the Constitution and the statutes above quoted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">\u201cThe judgment of the trial court is reversed, in so far as it granted judgment to the plaintiff for return of the property, with direction to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">Furthermore, neither plaintiff nor its predecessor, has tendered back what it received in part payment on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> \u201cProposal and Agreement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">\u201c(Pump)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">\u201cUnited Iron Works, Inc.
