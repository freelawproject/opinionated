Whether these acts were sufficient to constitute the offenses charged in the indictment is the question, and the only question, raised on this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-20\">This, obviously, is merely a question of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the judgment. No such question was rais<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>ed in the trial court. In that court, appellant did not, by demurrer to the evidence, motion for judgment, motion for new trial, or otherwise, question the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant a conviction. Not having been raised in the trial court, this question will not be considered on appeal. Love v. United States (C.C.A. 9) 74 F.(2d) 988; Turluk v. United States (C.C.A. 9) 39 F.(2d) 75; Murphy v.
