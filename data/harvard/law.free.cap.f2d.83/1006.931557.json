After hearing the witnesses of both sides, the court entered a decree against the Barwick and referred the case to a master to ascertain damages, who heard testimony and reported the same. On hearing exceptions thereto, the court entered a final decree dismissing such exceptions and confirming his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-15\">The proofs and all questions raised have had full consideration and, finding no reversible error, we limit ourselves, in view of the pressure of work of this court, to affirming the decree below without discussing the proofs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
