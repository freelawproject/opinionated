The plaintiff recovered a verdict, and defendant took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-19\">On final analysis, the decisive question is a narrow one and is correctly stated in the plaintiff\u2019s counter statement of questions involved, as follows: \u201cFirst: Where, at the close of the evidence, both parties move for a directed verdict without reservation, and the court finds the issues in favor of the plaintiff, \u2014 may the defendant, on appeal, impugn the court\u2019s findings, where there is substantial evidence to support the verdict?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">At the conclusion of the proofs, both parties asked for binding instructions, and thus the facts were left to the court to decide and its findings are conclusive. Beuttell v. Magone, 157 U.S. 154, .15 S.Ct. 566, 39 L.Ed. 654. In deciding the case the court stated: \u201cCounsel in this case have taken from you the burden of determining the issues, and have placed them upon the Court. The Court will therefore instruct you to return a verdict for the plaintiff and against the defendant in the sum of $3,854.99.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-23\">The evidence adduced has been duly considered, and as there was evidence from which the court could so find for the plaintiff, it follows that the exception taken by defendant, \u201cMay I have an exception to the instruction of the court,\u201d charged no assignable error for review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-24\">So regarding, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
