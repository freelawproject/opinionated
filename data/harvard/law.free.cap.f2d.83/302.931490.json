Trott, and holding that appellant was not entitled to the registration of the words \u201cFloating Power\u201d as a trade-mark, for use on engine mountings, on the ground that the alleged trademark was merely descriptive of the goods on which it was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">In its application, appellant alleged that it had continuously used its trade-mark on engine mountings since June 3, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">In his notice of opposition, opposer alleged that he had used the notation \u201cFloating Engine\u201d as a trade-mark \u201cin connection with both the installation and sale\u201d of engine mountings, long prior to June 3, 1931, the date of alleged first use by applicant of its trade-mark; that his engine mountings were so designated and known during that period of time; that the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties; that, prior to its first use of its trade-mark, applicant was aware of op-poser\u2019s use of the notation \u201cFloating Engine\u201d on opposer\u2019s engine .mountings; that opposer has continuously used the notation \u201cFloating Engine * * * <em>as a trademark </em>since a date prior to the alleged use of applicant\u2019s trade-mark, which is June 3, 1931\u201d; that the marks are confusingly similar; that their concurrent use by the parties would be likely to cause confusion of origin and ownership of the goods to which they were applied; and that opposer would be damaged -by the registration to appellant of its trade-mark. (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">Opposer further alleged in his notice of opposition that \u201cattached to this petition are photographs showing how opposer\u2019s trade-mark \u2018Floating Engine\u2019 has been, and is, used on automotive engine mountings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">In its answer to the notice of opposition, appellant stated that, to its knowledge, opposer had never used the trademark \u201cFloating Engine\u201d on engine mountings. Appellant denied that the photographs attached to the notice of opposition actually disclosed any use by the opposer of the term \u201cFloating Engine\u201d as a trademark on engine mountings, prior to appellant\u2019s first use of its trade-mark, and alleged that the opposer would not be damaged by the registration of appellant\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">The record discloses but one photograph, dated March 31, 1932, attached to opposer\u2019s notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">It appears from the testimony of the opposer, Rolland S. Trott, that the notation \u201cFloating Engine\u201d had never been applied to his engine mountings, or parts thereof, prior to March 31, 1932, although he had used the term in connection with such mountings in \u201cconversation, in promotion of the business, [and] in sale arguments and talks\u201d prior to 1929, \u201carid in letters written to * * * automobile concerns\u201d as early as some time in the summer of 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">In his decision, the Examiner of TradeMark Interferences stated that the notice of opposition raised only the question of the confusing similarity of the marks; 'that it was clear from the record that the opposer had not used its alleged trademark \u201cFloating Engine\u201d as such prior to the first use by appellant of its trade-mark; that, therefore, the opposer was not in a position to oppose the registration, and, accordingly, dismissed the notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-18\">However, the' Examiner considered the 'application ex parte, and held that the words \u201cFloating Power,\u201d when used o'n engine mountings, were merely descriptive of the character or quality of the goods on which they were used; that appellant was not entitled to the exclusive use of its al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>leged trade-mark; and that, therefore, it was not entitled to register the same under the provisions of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, as amended (15 U.S.C.A. .\u00a7 81 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Appellant appealed from the decision of the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences to the Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The opposer did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">When the cause was submitted to the Commissioner of Patents, appellant questioned the right of the opposer and his counsel to appear and be heard on the issues presented by appellant\u2019s appeal, and further movepl to \u201cstrike the brief\u201d of counsel for the opposer.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Although conceding the proceeding to be ex parte, the commissioner, nevertheless, held that, due to the fact that counsel for appellant had made certain stipulations with counsel for the opposer relative to the filing of briefs and the postponement of the hearing, and the fact that certain charges of fraud were made in the brief of counsel for appellant, he would receive and consider the brief of counsel for the opposer, regardless of the <em>right of the op-poser to appear as a party to the proceeding. </em>In other words, as we understand it, the commissioner permitted counsel for the opposer to file a brief and argue the cause as amicus curia.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The next question presented to the commissioner was stated by him as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">\u201c * * * Is the opposer so guilty of fraud and misrepresentation in filing his opposition as to vitiate the proceeding entirely and render it void ab initio [as claimed by counsel for appellant] ? Careful consideration has been given to this question with the result that it is concluded, notwithstanding the strong language .employed by the applicant in referring to the opposer, that nothing appears in the record which justifies the view that the op-poser was either deceitful or fraudulent in filing the opposition. Indeed, it seems that the opposer is guilty only of a variance, of a difference between pleading and proof. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">The commissioner concluded that the opposition proceeding was not void ab initio, and that he had jurisdiction to decide the case on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">1 In his decision, holding that the mark was merely descriptive of the goods on which it was used, the commissioner stated that prior to the first use by appellant of the notation \u201cFloating Power\u201d as a trade-mark on engine mountings\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-13\">\u201c * * * it was common practice to refer to the engine as a floating one [in issued patents where mountings of the type used by appellant were involved]. For example, United States Letters Patent No. 1,701,396, applied for nearly five years before the applicant\u2019s alleged date of first use and granted more than two years before, refers to \u2018floating the engine\u2019, to a \u2018floated mass\u2019, to the \u2018engine floating elements\u2019, and to the \u2018engine being floated\u2019. Patent No. 1,729,394, both applied for and granted long before applicant\u2019s first use, speaks of a \u2018floating engine\u2019, the \u2018floating body\u2019, etc., in describing a resilient engine mounting. Also, Patent No. 1,761,584, applied for and granted before the applicant\u2019s use of the notation, repeatedly refers to the action as being a \u2018floating action\u2019, the mount as being a \u2018floating mount\u2019, the engine as being a \u2018floating engine\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-15\">\u201cIt seems obvious, <em>if a pozver unit or source of power </em>is mounted in resilient mountings of this character, and <em>referred to as \u2018floating power1, </em>the <em>term is merely descriptive of the assemblage. </em>The term \u2018floating\u2019 when so applied is clearly and, as indicated by the patents or records, obviously descriptive. The addition thereto of the term \u2018power\u2019 does not save the notation and render it non-descriptive. <em>\u2018Power\u2019 in this sense is the equivalent of \u2018engine\u2019 and the compound term \u2018floating power\u2019 would accordingly seem to indicate nothing more than a floating power unit. </em>To concede that the applicant is entitled to the exclusive use of the words \u2018floating power\u2019 in <em>describing a unit resiliently mounted </em>would be to deprive other manufacturers of their natural right to the free and unrestrained use of descriptive terms, more specifically of their right to <em>refer to such a unit as a \u2018floating pozver unit\u2019.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-16\">It clearly appears from the record that the opposer used the notation \u201cFloating Engine\u201d in conversation and in correspondence, including correspondence with appellant, prior to the first use by appellant of its mark, in an effort to interest appellant and others in- his invention relating to engine mountings, and that the patents'cited by the commissioner in his decision refer to \u201ca floating engine,\u201d \u201cfloating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>engine,\u201d and \u201cengine-floating elastic elements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Although the commissioner stated in his decision that in patent No. 1,729,394, issued September 24, 1929, to R. K. Lee, the patentee described his resilient engine mountings by the terms \u201cfloating engine\u201d and \u201cfloating body,\u201d we are unable to find that those terms were used to <em>describe </em>the patentee\u2019s resilient <em>engine mountings. </em>The commissioner also stated in his decision that the patentee R. II. Prosser, in patent No. 1,761,584, relating to resilient engine mountings, issued June 3, 1930, repeatedly referred to \u201cthe action as being a \u2018floating action,\u2019 \u201d and to the \u201cmount as being a \u2018floating mount.\u2019 \u201d We have carefully examined that patent, and are unable to find any reference therein to \u201cthe action as being a \u2018floating action,\u2019 \u201d or to the \u201cmount as being a \u2018floating mount.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">It appears from the testimony of the cpposcr that he never referred to his invention as \u201cfloating motor,\u201d and that he made no distinction between the terms \u201cfloating engine,\u201d \u201cfloating motor,\u201d and \u201cfloating power.\u201d We quote from his testimony :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">\u201cQ. 20. Then do you interpret \u2018power\u2019 to mean engine, motor, or is it some intangible thing in your opinion as used with \u2018floating\u2019 in the notation \u2018floating power.\u2019 * * * A. It is a shortening of \u2018power plant.\u2019 For years practically all of the automobile industry advertised \u2018unit power plant\u2019 when they first began to attach the transmission to the engine to form a unit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Opposer further stated that he demonstrated his invention to appellant prior to appellant\u2019s first use of its alleged trademark \u201cFloating Power\u201d; that, in April, 1930, he entered into an agreement with the Borg-Warner Corporation, whereby that corporation was empowered to manufacture opposer\u2019s engine mountings and to enter into contracts for their use by others. We quote from his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">\u201cX-Q. 117.

Conversation, in promotion of the business, in selling arguments and talks, and in letters written to and received from automobile concerns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZz\">' It is clear from the testimony of the opposer, hereinbefore quoted, that neither he nor the Borg-Warner Corporation, licensee, had ever physically applied the notation \u201cFloating Engine\u201d to. engine mountings prior to March 31, 1932, and that it was then so applied, as stated by the witness, \u201cTo establish our right to use it beyond what we had already _ established by my verbal use and my use in letters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVd\">Just what interest or rights the .opposer had in his pat\u00e9nts, or the trade-marks and trade-names to be used thereon, is not clear from opposer\u2019s own testimony. He stated, as hereinbefore noted, that he was not certain of his rights under his so-called \u201clicensing arrangement\u201d with the Borg-Warner Corporation, and did not know whether he had the right to manufacture or sell his engine mountings under the notation \u201cFloating Engine\u201d; that, subsequent to April, 1930, all of his efforts to commercialize his inventions were made through the Borg-Warner. Corporation; that he was not employed by that concern; and that he had never constructed or sold any of his patented engine mountings.</p>\n<p id=\"ARW\">It is contended by counsel for appellant that the material allegations contained in</p>\n<p id=\"A97\">the notice of opposition were fraudulently made by the opposer; that it clearly appears from the testimony of the opposer that he had not used the notation \"Float-infl Engine\u201d on engine mountings prior to the alleged and established date of appelHnt\u2019s use of the trade-mark \u201cFloating Power\u201d; that, although opposer alleged in bis \u00b0fn\u00b0pp\u00b0sit\u00cd?n tbe. phot\u00b0' Srapb\u2019 da*ed March 31&gt; 1932, which \u2022was attached thereto, showed how he had been, a\u00bbd was al,that ^me&gt; usln? bls trade-mark Floatm^ En^f \u00b0n eng,me, mountmg?J * appears from the opposer s testimony that ne\u00a1tiler nor the Borg-Warner Corporation had eVer applied the term \u201cFloating jrngine\u201d t0 engine mountings prior to the tjme photograph was taken, which was tjle date notice 0f opposition was signed and verified. that opposer was a patent attorney at the time he filed his notice of opposition, and, therefore, was not only in a position to Jcnow, but that he did know that the statements contained in his notice of opposition were false; that he cannot be excused on the ground that there was a mere variance between the allegations contained in the notice of opposition and his testimony relative to the facts, as held by the Commissioner of Patents; that oppos,er\u2019s notice of opposition was false fraudu!ent&gt; and deceptive; that it was void ab mitl\u00b0. and papable of setting the judicial \u201cachmejy of the appellate tribunals of the Patent Office m motion\u2019; and that those tribunals were and this court is, without Jurisdiction to review and decide \u00ab parte ^sues which might be considered m a <em>law-instituted proceedmg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ApmX\">It may be said at this point that counsel for opposer alleged in his brief that the opposer is not a lawyer and never pre^ded to be. He is a _ college-trained (Cornell graduate) mechanical engineer of Jfe originality, skill and ingenuity, However, m his testimony, the opposer stated tbat be bad been an ab\u00b0ut years&gt; and tbat he was a Patent a orney-</p>\n<p id=\"AxXs\">[i] We have examined the record with the care which the charge of fraud necessarily requires. It appears that the opposer\u2019s testimony flatly contradicts the allegations contained in his notice of opposition that he had used the notation \u201cFloating Engine\u201d as a trade-mark on engine mountings prior to June 3, 1931, and that the photograph attached to the notice of opposition showed how his trade-mark <em>had </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>been </em>used by him. It further appears that the photograph, above referred to, was taken on March 31, 1932, the date the notice of opposition was signed and verified by opposer, and that neither the opposer nor the Borg-Warner Corporation, licensee, had ever applied the notation \u201cFloating Engine\u201d to engine mountings, either as a trade-mark or otherwise, prior to March 31, 1932. Nevertheless, there is nothing of record to substantiate the charge that the opposer acted with any fraudulent intent, or that his conduct was \u201cwillful\u201d or \u201cmorally reprehensible.\u201d See 21 C.J. pp. 180 to 184, \u00a7\u00a7 163 to 166, inclusive. The opposer frankly disclosed the facts in his testimony, including the use of the notation \u201cFloating Engine\u201d <em>in connection with </em>his efforts to secure the use by manufacturers of his patented engine mountings, and, although he was cross-examined at considerable length by counsel for appellant, he was never asked to explain the reasons for, nor does the record contain any explanation of, the misstatements of fact contained in his notice of opposition. We are of opinion that, although there was a material variance between the material averments of the notice of opposition and the evidence introduced by the opposer, the tribunals of the Patent Office had jurisdiction in the case at bar to dispose of any question that might properly be presented in an ex parte case, including the question of the descriptiveness of appellant\u2019s mark. See California Cyanide Co. v. American Cyanamid Co., 40 F.(2d) 1003, 17 C.C.P.A.(Patents) 1198; Bookman v. Oakland Chemical Co., 40 F.(2d) 1006, 17 C.C.P.A.(Patents) 1213; Skookura Packers\u2019 Asso. v. Pacific Northwest Canning Co., 45 F.(2d) 912, 18 C.C.P.A.

We do not mean to be understood as holding that, in view of the statute, our conclusion would have been different had the opposer been guilty of the offense charged by counsel for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In their brief, counsel for appellant stated that as the opposer had not appealed from the decision of the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences dismissing his notice of opposition, he was not a proper party to this appeal, and that if a brief were filed on his behalf, a \u201cmotion to strike * * * [would] be presented.\u201d At the time of the oral arguments in this court, counsel for appellant stated that a motion for that purpose would be filed. Thereafter, on January 18, 1936, such a motion was filed by counsel for appellant. It was not limited, however, to the reasons assigned in their brief, but contained two additional reasons, namely: First, that the brief of counsel for opposer contained statements and arguments relative to alleged facts not appearing of record, and, second, that it contained \u201cbaseless, but malicious, vituperative and scandalous accusations leveled at appellant and his counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In his brief, counsel for opposer, contrary to well-established rules of practice, repeatedly and vigorously attacked the character of appellant, largely, if not entirely, regarding alleged misconduct relating to matters not appearing of record nor germane to the issues involved. See 3 C.J. pp. 1432, 1433, \u00a7 1595. (The charges so made by counsel for opposer were probably occasioned by the charge of fraudulent conduct on the part of opposer by counsel for appellant, hereinbefore discussed and determined.) Furthermore, counsel for opposer has made statements in his brief regarding alleged facts not appearing of record, and of which this court has no authority to take judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">In view of the fact that the opposer did not appeal from the decision of the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences dismissing his notice of opposition, and as the proceeding relative to the question of the descriptiveness of appellant\u2019s mark before the tribunals of the Patent Office was ex parte, the opposer is not a proper party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">The issues before us concern only appellant on the one hand, and the Patent Office tribunals, representing the public, on the other. Obviously then, counsel for op-poser had no authority to appear in this court and file a brief on behalf of the op-poser, and, without leave of the court, had no right to appear at all. Accordingly, the brief of counsel for opposer might well be stricken from the files of this court. However, due to the facts hereinafter stated, we are not disposed to follow that course.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Counsel for opposer was permitted to appear before the tribunals of the Patent Office, apparently as amicus curias, and had filed his brief and participated in the oral arguments in this court, prior to the filing of appellant\u2019s motion. The vital issue in the case \u2014 the question of the descriptiveness of appellant\u2019s mark- \u2014 has been well presented by opposer\u2019s counsel. We shall, therefore, accept his brief with the understanding that the use of the abusive statements contained therein relative to the character of appellant, which statements are neither supported by the record nor germane to the issues in the case, deserves and receives the disapprobation of this court, and with the further understanding that all such statements, and others regarding alleged facts not found in the record have been, and will be, disregarded in our consideration and determination of the involved issues. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s motion to strike the brief of counsel for the opposer is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The next question requiring our consideration is whether appellant\u2019s mark \u201cFloating Power\u201d is merely descriptive of the goods on which it is used, or of the character or quality of such goods, as held by the tribunals of the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">It should be observed at the outset, although it is a matter of no great importance, that appellant\u2019s mark is not used on \u201cengines,\u201d \u201cpower units,\u201d \u201cpower plants,\u201d or \u201cunit power plants,\u201d as held in substance by the commissioner, but is used only on \u201cvehicle engine mountings.\u201d It is clear from the record, although there is some testimony to the contrary, that such mountings are not integral parts of the \u201cengine,\u201d \u201cframe,\u201d or \u201cpower plant\u201d of an automobile, but are separate and independent commercial entities and serve merely to resiliently connect or attach the \u201cpower plant\u201d to the frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In opposer\u2019s patent No. 1,834,907, issued December 1, 1931, relating to engine mountings, the patentee stated that the rubber mountings \u201ccarry the weight of the engine, and generally of the entire power plant unit.\u201d He further stated, relative to the proposition that his engine mountings absorbed the forces developed in the operation of the engine, that he accomplished that object \u201cby providing pivotally resilient mounting means <em>betiveen the engine or power plant unit and its support\"; </em>that his power plant unit consisted of the \u201cusual engine Ia having the crank-shaft 7 connected with the fly-wheel lc and a flywheel casing Ia, and to which is fixed the transmission <em>le\u201d; </em>and that the mountings were \u201cadapted to carry substantially the <em>entire weight of the power plant unit </em>and are to be strong enough and reliable enough so that the power plant unit will be securely attached to the support at these two points in such a manner as to permit pivotal movement of the unit of an approximately orbital nature with respect to the support without any question arising as to the security and safety of the mounting.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">In opposer\u2019s patent No. 1,890,871, issued December 13, 1932, relating to engine or power plant mountings for automotive vehicles, the patentee stated that the engine' and the transmission formed a \u201cunit power plant, the parts of which are fixed together for unitary movement with a housing <em>2a </em>between the engine 1 and transmission 2 and enclosing the usual-engine fly wheel <em>2b.\u201d </em>The patentee further stated: \u201cThe normal operation of the engine unit tends to oscillate the engine unit on its longitudinal axis in response to the impulses incident to the operation of the engine. <em>My mounting permits the engine unit to oscillate on said axis </em>but at the same time it allows the axis of oscillation to move relative to the vehicle or the frame and likewise move the engine unit.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Furthermore, it is clear from the record that appellant\u2019s engine mountings do not oscillate with the engine or power plant, but are so constructed that they, together with the method of mounting the power plant (hereinafter referred to), permit the \u201centire power plant to rock freely\u201d on its \u201cnatural axis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">It is unnecessary to describe appellant\u2019s mountings upon which it uses its trademark, other than to say that they are substantially triangular in shape, and have substantially triangular interior openings, and that they are of metal construction, except for some _ resilient material at or near the top.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">In his decision, as hereinbefore noted, the Commissioner of Patents stated that \u201cif a power unit or source of power is mounted in resilient mountings of this character, and referred to as \u2018floating power,\u2019 the term is merely descriptive of the assemblage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">The commissioner further stated that the word \u201cpower,\u201d in the sense in which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>is used in the trade-mark \u201cFloating Power,\u201d is the \u201cequivalent of \u2018engine/ \u201d and that the trade-mark would \u201cindicate nothing more than a floating power unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Counsel for the opposer contends that the views expressed by the commissioner are in accordance with the facts and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">As contended by counsel for appellant, and as clearly appears from the affidavits of record and from the dictionary definitions of the word, \u201cpower\u201d is an intangible thing. Generally speaking, it means: \u201c * * * Ability, whether physical, mental, or moral, to act; the faculty of doing or performing something; capacity for action or performance or for receiving external action or force; capability of producing or undergoing an effect, whether physical, mental, or moral. * * * \u201d (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Mechanically, it is: \u201c * * * The rate at which mechanical energy is exerted or mechanical work performed, as by an engine or other machine, or an animal. The units most commonly used are the <em>horse power </em>and the <em>watt. </em>The <em>power </em>of a direct electric current is the product of the voltage and current. The <em>true power </em>of an alternating current is the product of voltage, current, and power factor.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">\u201c * * * Any form of energy available for doing any kind of work; as, <em>steam-power; water-power; </em>specif., mechanical energy, as distinguished from work done by hand; as, a machine run by <em>power. </em>(2) Capability o-f performing mechanical work, as measured by the rate at which it is or can be done; capacity; as, the <em>power </em>of the engine .was overstated.\u201d (Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">Eminent authorities on the subject state in affidavits of record that the word \u201cpower\u201d does not describe an engine, power plant, engine mountings, or any other part of an automobile, and that if it were used to describe any such parts, further explanation would be required in order that it might be understood what was meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">An engine is \u201c * * * a machine by which power is applied to the doing of work, particularly one that converts some motive energy, especially heat, into mechanical power.\u201d (Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">From what has been said, it would seem to be clear that the term \u201cpower,\u201d as used in appellant\u2019s trade-mark, is not the equivalent of the terms \u201cengine\u201d or \u201cpower plant,\u201d nor is it, standing alone or in combination with the word \u201cfloating,\u201d descriptive of either. The terms \u201cfloating engine\u201d and \u201cfloating power plant\u201d are descriptive of certain physical units, and those units may be assembled or disassembled. That is not true of the term \u201cfloating power.\u201d As hereinbefore noted, \u201cpower\u201d is an intangible thing, and merely combining the words \u201cfloating\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d does not make the combination tangible or descriptive of anything that is tangible. Furthermore, although the expressions \u201cfloating engine,\u201d \u201cfloating the engine,\u201d and \u201cengine-floating elastic elements\u201d were old at the time appellant adopted and first used its trade-mark, and started its extensive advertising campaign, in which, from July, 1931, to February, 1933, it expended the sum of $4,306,077, and in which advertising its mark \u201cFloating Power\u201d was prominently featured, we venture to say that no engineer or other person skilled in the art or otherwise would have known what was meant had it been suggested that \u201cfloating power\u201d be assembled or disassembled, nor would it occur to any such person that an \u201cengine\u201d or a \u201cpower plant\u201d should be torn down were it suggested that \u201cfloating power\u201d be disassembled.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">Is appellant\u2019s mark descriptive of engine mountings, or of any characteristic or quality possessed by them? We think the answer to that query must be in the negative. Engine mountings do not float. They are not \u201cpower.\u201d They do not even develop or transmit power, as do \u201cengines.\u201d Furthermore, they, in and of themselves, are not responsible for that particular rocking feature of the \u201cpower plant,\u201d which might be characterized by the term \u201cfloating.\u201d That feature is brought about, in part, by the method employed in mounting the \u201cpower plant,\u201d which method consists of the use of two mountings only, instead of the three or four ordinarily used, and is known as a \u201ctwo-point motor suspension.\u201d Accordingly, it is the method of mounting, together with the structure of the mountings used, which permits the' \u201cpower plant to rock freely\u201d on its \u201cnatural axis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>It is true that appellant\u2019s trade-mark is suggestive, but, in our opinion, nothing more, of one of the characteristics of appellant\u2019s power plants. Suggestiveness, however, is a permissible attribute of a technical trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">In the case of Van Camp Sea Food Co., (Inc.) v. Alexander B. Stewart Organizations, 50 F.(2d) 976, 979, 18 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1415, where we had the trademark \u201cChicken of the Sea,\u201d for' use on tuna fish, under consideration, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">\u201cIt is well settled in adjudicated cases that a \"valid trade-mark may be highly suggestive (in our opinion ofttimes the best ones are), without being offensively descriptive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">See Le Blume Import Co. v. Coty (C.C.A.) 293 F. 344, 351; Orange Crush Co. v. California Crushed Fruit Co., 54 App. D.C. 313, 297 F. 892; United Lace &amp; Braid Mfg. Co. v. Barthels Mfg. Co. (D.C.) 221 F. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">, We must hold, therefore, that, although appellant\u2019s trade-mark is <em>suggestive </em>of one of the characteristics of appellant\u2019s power plants, it does not <em>describe </em>its engines, power plants, or engine mountings, or any characteristic or quality possessed by them, but, on the contrary,' is merely indicative of origin to the purchasing public, and serves to distinguish appellant\u2019s engine mountings from those manufactured or sold by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">There is a suggestion in the brief of counsel for the opposer that at the time\u2014 March 31, 1932 \u2014 the opposer or the Borg-Warner Corporation applied the mark \u201cFloating Engine\u201d to opposer\u2019s engine mountings, appellant had practically abandoned its tr\u00e1de-mark and did not use it for a period of a year, and that, for that reason if for no other, appellant is not entitled to have its mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">It clearly appears from the record that merely through inadvertence appellant\u2019s mark was not applied to the engine mountings used in its automobiles of the so-called \u201cP. B. model,\u201d produced in 1932. Appellant\u2019s chassis designing engineer stated that he had positive instructions from his superiors to apply the trademark to the engine mountings used in those models, and that failure to do so was due to a draftsman\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">The testimony of record clearly negatives any intention on the part of appellant to abandon its trade-mark, and, in the absence of proof of such intention, the charge of abandonment cannot be sustained. See Saxlehner v. Eisner &amp; Mendelson Co., 179 U.S. 19, 31, 21 S.Ct. 7, 45 L.Ed. 60; Blackwood Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Co., 58 F.(2d) 440, 19 C.C.P.A.(Patents) 1227. Furthermore, the evidence clearly establishes that, although through inadvertence appellant\u2019s trade-mark was not applied to engine mountings used in automobiles of the \u201cP. B. model,\u201d produced in 1932, it had been applied to engine mountings used in appellant\u2019s so-called \u201cP. A. model\u201d during the preceding year; that sales were made of several thousand cars of that model from January to October of the year 1932; and that during that year, sales having been made each month, 1306 engine mountings bearing the ' trade-mark \u201cBloating Power\u201d were sold as separate and independent commercial. entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">For the reasons herein stated, we are of opinion that appellant is entitled to have its mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-16\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b342-17\">GRAHAM, Presiding Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Akq\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-18\">I have been unable to bring my mind to the point where I can agree with the conclusion reached by the majority in this case. I shall not attempt any lengthy discussion of the many points which have been incidentally brought up and discussed by counsel and by the majority, but shall state briefly my views on what I consider to be the principal point involved in the case, namely, whether the notation \u201cfloating power\u201d is or' is not descriptive, as here used. I am of opinion that it is descriptive, and ought not to be registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-19\">The term \u201cfloating,\u201d while usually applied to something which is sustained by and resting upon a fluid, applies equally, in my mind, to something which is movable. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary gives several meanings to the word, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-20\">\u201cFloating, p. a. 1. Buoyed upon or in a fluid; as the floating timbers of a wreck; floating motes in the air.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-21\">\u201c2. Free or loose from the usual attachment; as, the floating ribs in man and some other animals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>\u201c3. Shifting from place to place; having no permanent home; as, the floating population.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">\u201c4. Shifting or variable in its form, its incidence, or the subject matter to which it applies; hence, not fixed; not funded; not invested; not determined; as, floating capital, floating anchor. Naut. \u2014 Sea Anchor. \u2014 f. axle, Vehicles, a live axle for a self-propelled vehicle, in which the revolving part serves' only to turn the wheels, the dead weight of the vehicle being carried on the ends of a fixed axle housing or casing. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We hear the expression used quite commonly in the ordinary language of the people, and as applied to the anatomy of man, such as \u201cfloating rib\u201d or \u201cfloating kidney.\u201d When so used, it has always the meaning of something which is movable, and not fixed and attached in the ordinary way.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">That it was well known in the automotive art is indicated by three patents which are incorporated into the record in connection with the letter of the Examiner of August 5, 1931, namely, Summers, No. 1,-701,396, Prosser, No. 1,761,584, and Lee, No. 1,729,394. In the Summers patent, which was issued February 5, 1929, before the appellant here began using the designation \u201cfloating power,\u201d the patentee spoke of \u201cfloating the engine\u201d and described the manner of \u201cfloating.\u201d The patentee repeatedly, in his specification and in his claims, repeated this language as applied to an engine which was movable upon insulated mountings. The patentee Prosser likewise spoke of a \u201cfloating engine and associated hanger,\u201d and described his method of flotation. This patent was granted on June 3, 1930. The patentee Lee, in a patent granted September 24, 1929, described his engine as being \u201cfloatingly suspended,\u201d and as a \u201cfloating engine,\u201d and described means to \u201cfloatingly carry the engine weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">In its common meaning, therefore, as well as in the technical language of the art in which the parties hereto were working, \u201cfloating\u201d had a distinctive meaning as to the power plant of an automobile, and there could be no reason for misunderstanding on the part of one to' whom the information was conveyed, that the power of an automobile was \u201cfloating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">A very involved and ingenious argument is made as to the meaning of the term \u201cpower\u201d; that this designation \u201cfloating power\u201d cannot be descriptive because it does not describe the device to which it is applied. Power, it is said, is an intangible thing, and is entirely distinct and separate from an engine or power plant, and that, therefore, these mountings upon which appellant\u2019s designation of \u201cfloating power\u201d is placed, do not describe either the device or its functions. It is argued that the engine may create the power, but the power itself does not float.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">I am unable to agree with this conclusion which seems to me entirely too technical, in view of the object which is sought to be attained by the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, as amended (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 81 et seq.). I cannot believe that any one would misunderstand what is meant by \u201cfloating power.\u201d Power, as I take it, is the energy which animates the vehicle, and includes in its meaning not only the actual automotive power, but the plant which creates it as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">This conception is borne out by the same lexicographical authority above cited, Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">\u201cPower *. * * 11. Mech.'a The rate at which mechanical energy is exerted or mechanical work performed, as by an engine or other machine, or an animal. The units most commonly used are the horse power and the watt. The power of a direct electric current is the product of the voltage and current. The true power of an alternating current is the product of voltage, current, and power factor. The apparent power (volt amperes) of an alternating current is the product of voltage and current. See ENERGY COMPONENT. b Capacity for operating; as, the power of an engine governor, c Applied force; as, the power applied at one end of a lever to overcome a \u25a0 \u201cresistance\u201d at the other end. d A source of useful mechanical energy; as, water power; hand power, etc. Specif., a mechanical source, as opposed to human power, e A mechanism by which energy is applied; as, a dog power; the mechanical powers. Obsoles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">The assistant commissioner makes a very pertinent observation which I quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-15\">\u201cIt seems obvious, if a power unit or source of power is mounted in resilient mountings of this character, and referred to as \u2018floating power\u2019, the term is merely descriptive of the assemblage. The term \u2018floating\u2019 when so applied is clearly and, as indicated by the patents or records, obvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ously descriptive. The addition thereto of the term \u2018power\u2019 does not save the notation and render it non-descriptive. \u2018Power\u2019 in this sense is the equivalent of \u2018engine\u2019 and the compound term \u2018floating power\u2019 would accordingly seem to indicate nothing more than a floating power unit. To concede that the applicant is entitled to the exclusive use of the words \u2018floating power\u2019 in describing a unit resiliently mounted would be to deprive other manufacturers of their natural right to the free and unrestrained use of descriptive terms, more specifically of their right to refer to such a unit as a \u2018floating power unit.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">I agree with the suggestions made above.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">There are several authorities which I deem in point, and which seem to point to a different conclusion than that arrived at by the majority herein:</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co. v. Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., 39 F.(2d) 684, 687, 17 C.C.P.A.(Patents) 962, we were considering the trade-name \u201chicycle\u201d used as a trade-mark for portable power tools, including electrical tools and devices. We held the mark should be canceled, and affirmed the decision of the Patent Office tribunals in that respect, holding the term to be descriptive, as used. In doing so, we made this pertinent observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">\u201cIt seems to us that to hold with appellant in this case would require the application of a higher degree of technical refinement than we think the Trade-Mark Registration Act contemplates. We cannot doubt that whatever distinction those having highly specialized learning as to electrical technique might be able to draw .by strict construction of electrical terms, the phrase \u2018High Cycle,\u2019 as applied to these motor-driven tools, does convey to the public generally a definite meaning distinctly descriptive of the tools. The relation between the cycle of the current and the revolution or operation of the tool or mechanism is too direct and immediate, in our view, to admit of any other conclusion. We think it is more than suggestive and amounts to descriptiveness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In that case, it will be noted, the word \u201chicycle\u201d or the words \u201chigh cycle\u201d did not describe the tools, but rather described their method of operation. However, it was such a description as was intelligible to and understood by those who heard it used, and the same is true of the expression here, \u201cfloating power.\u201d The hearer instinctively knows that the source of power, or engine, or power plant, is movable, and shifts, as the occasion requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Two decisions of the Commissioner of Patents are instructive and in point. One is in Ex parte Warner Gear Company, decided August 16, 1932, 156 Ms.Dec. 925, in which the term under consideration was the words \u201cfree wheeling,\u201d the assistant commissioner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">\u201cIt seems to follow that if the applicant were given the right to the exclusive use of the term \u2018free wheeling\u2019 as a trademark for transmissions, the manufacturers of the transmissions disclosed in the above noted patents would be excluded from the right to use such term, or its equivalent in describing this characteristic of their respective devices. Nor would other manufacturers of free wheeling vehicles be entitled to use this term as descriptive thereof, without infringing the applicant\u2019s trade-mark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">Again, in Ex parte William Wesley Flicks, decided March 20, 1931, 156 Ms. Dec. 608, Assistant Commissioner Kinnan held the words \u201cwired heat\u201d as a trademark for electric heaters to be descriptive, and made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">\u201cIt may be said either of the two words of the notation used alone in connection with goods of the character here under consideration would, beyond any question, be merely descriptive. \u2018Heat\u2019 as applied to a heater is obviously descriptive and \u2018wired\u2019 as applied to an electric heater would as clearly be descriptive. It may be also noted that \u2018wire heat\u2019 would be merely descriptive because the heat is produced by the heating of the wire and so the wire gives off the heat and the heat would be correctly described as wire heat. No question could be raised as to the fact that the words \u2018wired heater\u2019 are merely descriptive. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">I am of opinion that the decision of the Commissioner of Patents should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">LENROOT, Associate Judge,</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">I concur in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
