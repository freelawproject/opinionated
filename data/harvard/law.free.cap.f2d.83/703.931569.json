As particularly shown by Fig. 5 of the Hausman drawings, the auxiliary ribbon - 38 is positioned in printing position in front of platen 12 and hence it and its frame are associated with said platen. Said frame, 35, upon which this ribbon is strung is by the stop means shown in Figs. 8, 9, and 10 coordinated relative to, which is to say, adjusted for action with the general typewriter structure, so that the ribbon and frame may be positioned in an upper and a lower printing position, and thus within a limited range. Since Hochman, in his patent, defines the term \u2018peripherally\u2019 as\u2014 up and down \u2014 it is plain that this term describes the positioning of the Hausman ribbon 38 and its carrying frame as shown in Fig. 8. It is held that Hausman can make the present count.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">In its decision reversing the decision of the examiner, and holding that appellant could not make the claim constituting the count in issue, the Board of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-15\">\u201cThe contention that Hausman has no right to make the count is treated by Hochman under four distinct heads, designated A, B, C and D. A and D appear, however, to be substantially the same. Under A it is urged that, inasmuch as Hausman\u2019s ribbon supporting frame moves in a straight line generally tangential to the surface of the platen which is in cylindrical form, it cannot be properly said that its movement is peripheral, as required by the count. The Examiner of Interferences in deciding that Hausman was entitled to make the claim says that Hochman in his patent defines the term \u2018peripherally\u2019 as \u2014 up and down. On page 4 of the Hochman specification he says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-16\">\u201c \u2018Another feature is the loose mount by simple superposition of the frame upon the platen, to assure limited shift either longitudinally of the platen or up and down in direction peripherally of the platen or both.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-17\">\u201cOn page 7 reference is made to \u2018displacement of the frame in a peripheral or up-and-down direction.\u2019 On page 9 reference is made to shifting \u2018peripherally of the platen or up and down between the limits imposed by the sides of notches 31.\u2019 While the language used is alternative in form, it does not seem to us that the expression \u2018up and down\u2019 may be treated as a definition of the meaning of \u2018peripheral\u2019 so long as the actual movement given the ribbon holder- is aptly described as peripheral and the movement up and down only approximate. Obviously, in the peripheral shifting of the carrier the ribbon does move to different levels. In a broad and general sense this is an up-and-down movement, although brought about by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>strictly peripheral movement. It might be urged that an up-and-down movement is an equivalent of the peripheral movement sei forth in the count but in determining the right of a party to make claims, the actual language must be considered and not the question of equivalents. We fully appreciate the general rule that the language used in a count should be given the broadest reasonable interpretation. This rule is always subject to the qualification that apt terms chosen by a patentee to define his structure should not be ignored to his detriment. It seems to us that the term peripherally is an apt and definite term as applied to the structure of Hochman that it cannot be construed to mean a tangential movement in an up-and-down direction and that, unless so construed, the language will not read upon Hausman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">It is contended by counsel for appellant that the board in its decision considered the involved count as though it called \u201cfor a peripheral <em>movement </em>of the auxiliary ribbon with respect to the platen\u201d; that the count does not call for such a movement, but, on the contrary, calls for \u201ca limited range of positioning of the frame with its ribbon peripherally of the platen\u201d; that as appellant\u2019s frame and ribbon occupy a position adjacent the platen and are capable of being shifted to different positions, they necessarily have a range of position peripherally of the platen; and that had appellee intended to cover a movement of his frame and ribbon peripherally of the platen, he should have included in the claim constituting the count in issue such a statement as a \u201climited range of <em>movement </em>of the frame with its ribbon <em>conforming to the periphery </em>of the platen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Appellant does not contend, as indeed he could not, that his frame and ribbon are positioned so as to conform to the periphery of the platen. His contention is, however, that the count in issue does not contain any such limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">As will be observed, the last clause of the count in issue provides for \u201cstop means coordinating said frame relative to the machine structure <em>to permit of a limited range of positioning of the frame with its ribbon peripherally of the </em>platen(Ital ics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Webster\u2019s New Standard Dictionary defines \u201cperiphery\u201d as: \u201c1. The line bounding a rounded surface; more generally, the external boundary or superficial parts of any body; the surface; loosely, the surrounding space. 2. Geom. The circumference or perimeter of a circle, ellipse,- or other closed curvilinear figure; also, the perimeter of a polygonal figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">In view of the divergent views of the tribunals of the Patent Office and of counsel for the parties, when considered in the light of the definition of the word \u201cperiphery,\u201d it is evident that the language \u201cperipherally of the platen\u201d is ambiguous and susceptible of more than one construction. That being so, the construction to be placed upon it must be in conformity with the meaning given it in the specification in which the count originated. Neumair v. Malocsay, 77 F.(2d) 622, 22 C.C.P.A.(Patents) 1349, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">It is obvious from a consideration of appellee\u2019s patent specification, as stated in substance by the Board of Appeals, that the language \u201ca limited range -of positioning of the frame with its ribbon peripherally of the platen,\u201d contained in the count, in issue, does not mean that appellee\u2019s frame and ribbon are positioned merely adjacent the periphery of the platen, but, on the contrary, the language \u201cperipherally of the platen\u201d means that they are so positioned as to conform to the periphery of the platen. There can .be no other reasonable explanation of that language.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">In view of the fact, therefore, that appellant\u2019s frame and ribbon are not positioned so as to conform to the periphery of the platen, he is not entitled to make the claim constituting the count in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the Board of Appeals reached the right conclusion. Accordingly, its decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
