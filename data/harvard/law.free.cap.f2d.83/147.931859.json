Defendant thereupon demurred to the complaint so supplemented; the trial court sustained the demurrer and, plaintiff declining to plead further, judgment was entered for the defendant. This appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-29\">By the clause in question, for a separate premium, defendant agreed to pay an additional $5,000 if death resulted solely from bodily injuries caused directly by accidental means, \u201cand shall not be the result of or be caused directly or indirectly * * * by engaging as a passenger or otherwise in submarine or aeronautic expeditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-30\">If insured\u2019s death was caused by bis engaging in an aeronautic expedition, there is no liability; if not, there is. The facts alleged arc:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-31\">\u201cThe insured was a passenger in an aeroplane in the City and County of Denver, State of Colorado, and that during said flight said aeroplane accidentally crashed to earth and as a result of which the said insured met his instantaneous death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-32\">The bill of particulars discloses that one Reed, a friend of Day\u2019s, brought a privately owned plane to Denver some ten days before the accident; neither the plane nor Reed wss licensed to carry passengers for hire; plaintiff does not know whether Reed was licensed to carry any passengers, hut alleges that he had had fifty hours of flying experience. The plane was airworthy. Reed took Day up for a pleasure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>flight over the airport and the outskirts of Denver when there were no -unfavorable weather conditions. Day was a guest only and had no part in handling the plane. Reed did a simple loop and the ship had straightened out when it went into the fatal spin.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">As words are ordinarily used, can it fairly be said that a pleasure trip over an airport on a pleasant day is an \u201cexpedition\u201d? The majority of the court believe not. It is difficult for us to believe that the ordinary man, in speaking of such a flight, would say that he had gone on an \u201cexpedition.\u201d None of us has ever heard any one use that expression when speaking of an ordinary trip in a plane. It must be borne in mind that the language of a policy is read when the policy is bought as well as when there is a loss. The mythical average man when offered this policy would not, as we see ' it, think that an ordinary airplane trip was excluded by the formidable words \u201csubmarine or aeronautic expeditions.\u201d On the contrary, the words carry an implication of a military exploit or of an exploration into remote regions or over new routes. If it were intended, when the policy was drafted and offered for sale, to exclude from coverage every loss resulting from an airplane trip or flight, it is believed that counsel drafting the clause could have found language less apt to mislead the buying public than such a redoubtable phrase as this. Judge Gardner\u2019s language in Gregory v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York (C.C.A.8) 78 F.(2d) 522, 524, is apposite :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">\u201cNearly a million passengers were carried by airplane last year. Insurance companies know that the public to which they are selling insurance is to a greater or less extent so traveling. These companies either intend to insure against accident resulting from the use of the airplane as a means of transportation, or they do not, and it is only fair .that if they do not intend to include such hazards that it should be made so clear that a person of ordinary intelligence on reading the contract offered will readily understand that such hazard is not covered. The expression, being doubtful and ambiguous, must be construed most strongly against the insurance company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">If, when this policy was purchased, Mr. Day had looked at the dictionaries to ascertain whether an ordinary ride in an airplane was excluded from his coverage by the menacing expression \u201csubmarine or aeronautic expeditions,\u201d he would readily have concluded that a short or casual pleasure trip was not excluded. Webster\u2019s International defines expedition as \u201cAn important journey or excursion for a specific purpose.\u201d Funk &amp; Wagnall\u2019s \u201cA journey, march, or voyage, generally of several or many persons, for a definite purpose.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary as \u201cA journey, voyage, or excursion made for some definite purpose.\u201d The Century as \u201cAn excursion, journey, or voyage made by a company or body of persons for a specific purpose.\u201d Webster\u2019s example is \u201cas, a military or exploring expedition\u201d; the Century as \u201cWilke\u2019s exploring expedition; a trading expedition to the African Coast.\u201d In no dictionary have we found a definition which fairly embraces the fatal trip taken here.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The rising tide of airplane travel and the efforts of life and accident companies to avoid too great a hazard without curtailing too seriously their underwriting have brought the general question before the courts many times. Our own court, in Head v. New York Life Ins. Co., 43 F.(2d) 517, 520, said: \u201cThe word \u2018engage\u2019 connotes more than a single act or a single transaction; it involves some continuity of action.\u201d No such continuity is herd alleged. In Gits v. New York Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.7) 32 F.(2d) 7, it was held that the clause \u201cengaging in submarine or aeronautic operations\u201d did not embrace a passenger on a pleasure flight. In Pittman v. Lamar Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.5) 17 F.(2d) 370, .the insured was walking slowly around a plane in which he owned a half interest and which was out of repair so the motor could not be cut off when he landed;. it was held that he was killed as a result of \u201cparticipation in * * <em>* </em>aeronautic activity.\u201d In First Nat. Bank of Chattanooga v. Ph\u0153nix Mut. Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.6) 62 F.(2d) 681, the insured was the president, active manager, and principal stockholder of an airplane company. The insured frequently used planes in his business and had had some instruction as an aviator. Over the objection of the pilot to going up under existing weather conditions, a trip was started which ended fatally. It was held that insured was \u201cparticipating in aeronautic operations\u201d since he, as president and manager of the company, interposed and enforced his judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>ment on the pilot in the vital matter of suitable flying weather. In Mayer v. New York Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.6) 74 F.(2d) 118, 119, 99 A.L.R. 155, a passenger was held to be one who was \u201cengaging as a passenger or otherwise in * * * aeronautic operations.\u201d In Goldsmith v. New York Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.8) 69 F.(2d) 273, 275, certiorari denied 292 U.S. 650, 54 S.Ct. 860, 78 L.Ed. 1500, it was held, Judge Stone dissenting, that a passenger in a plane was not covered by a policy excepting those \u201cengaging, as a passenger or otherwise, in submarine or aeronautic operations.\u201d In the later case of Gregory v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York (C.C.A.8) 78 F.(2d) 522, 524, certiorari denied 56 S.Ct. 157, 80 L.Ed. -, the same court held without dissent that a father who had bought a plane for his son and who had been up a few times before, and who was killed while riding with his son as a guest, was not \u201cparticipating in aeronautics.\u201d There are a number of state cases on the general subj ect<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we do not take time to analyze. Two cases from state courts of the highest standing involve this particular clause and arrive at diametrically opposed conclusions. They are Gibbs v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., 256 N.Y. 208, 176 N.E. 144, 145, holding the company not liable to a passenger; and Provident Trust Co. v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc. (1934) 316 Pa. 121, 172 A. 701, holding the company is liable to a passenger. The New York court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">\u201cFor all that, a voyage either under the sea or in the air was not customary for the average individual. It was an extraordinary event and was thought to be and was accompanied by unusual hazards. A very small proportion of all people now living have ever been subjected to either experience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Even if an ordinary airplane trip is an event fraught with hazard, it does not seem to follow that it is necessarily an expedition. All expeditions may be hazardous events, but all hazardous events are not expeditions. If a novitiate boarded an unbroken mustang, it would doubtless prove to be a hazardous event, but would not be accurately spoken of as an expedition. The New York court assumed that passengers never went on expeditions; that in order to reconcile the use by the insurance company of \u201cpassenger\u201d and \u201cexpedition\u201d in the same clause, some meaning should be given to \u201cexpedition\u201d which will reconcile it with the word \u201cpassenger.\u201d We doubt the assumption of fact. Wiley Post\u2019s lamented exploratory trip to the remote regions of the north was an expedition in its accepted sense, and Will Rogers was, as we understand, a passenger. Expeditions are sometimes accompanied by those who have no part in planning or executing the exploration, but who go as passengers or guests simply for the adventure. But even if there be a conflict in the ordinary meaning of these two words selected by the insurance company in writing its policy, the rule in this jurisdiction is to resolve the ambiguity against the party selecting the words. Graham v. Business Men\u2019s Assur. Co. of America (C.C.A.10) 43 F.(2d) 673; East &amp; West Ins. Co. v. Fidel (C.C.A.10) 49 F.(2d) 35; Chase v. Business Men\u2019s Assur. Co. of America (C.C.A.10) 51 F.(2d) 34; Aschenbrenner v. U. S. F. &amp; G. Co., 292 U.S. 80, 54 S.Ct. 590, 593, 78 L.Ed. 1137. Although entertaining the highest respect for the Court of Appeals of New York, we do not agree that there is a necessary ambiguity or conflict in a clause embracing passengers on expeditions; but if there were, the rule in this jurisdiction would be to resolve that conflict against the insurer rather than to extend the meaning of \u201cexpedition\u201d to reconcile it with the word \u201cpassenger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">In the Aschenbrenner Case, supra, the Supreme Court again adhered to the established and wholesome rule that in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>struing contracts words \u201cwill be given the meaning that common speech imports.\u201d We do not believe any one, in common speech, would ever refer to an ordinary short trip in a plane as an \u201cexpedition.\u201d In any event, reasonable men might differ on the point; and if so, then the ambiguous phrase should be resolved in favor of the customer who purchased the policy and not in favor of the company which drafted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\"> Benefit Ass\u2019n v.

Believing that the doctrine enunciated in that case has application and is controlling here, I am constrained to dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
