(Mrs. Evans was employed as a solicitor by defendants Branham and Williams \u201coperating as the Selby on the Bay Company.\u201d) Thereafter one of the defendants\u2019 salesmen (Looper) conveyed plaintiff to Selby, a real estate development near Annapolis on Chesapeake Bay. Defendant Branham there made representations to plaintiff and1 others as to the value of the lots as an investment. Plaintiff became enthused and \u201cthought there was a good chance to make some money.\u201d The salesman showed her lot 144 and \u201crepresented that if Mrs. Saunders would buy they would resell that summer for a profit of at least $100.00.\u201d \u201cShe had been told that Mr. Looper [the salesman] was trustworthy, and she put confidence in him.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>As a result of his representations, plaintiff on April 5, 1932, signed a contract for the purchase of lot 144 for $725, making a cash payment of $217.50, the balance to be in deferred monthly payments of $10.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The following week Looper took the plaintiff \u201cdown again.\u201d Another of defendants\u2019 salesmen (Eppling) showed her three lots adjoining lot 144, \u201cand told her if she would buy those additional three lots that they would divide them into five lots and sell each one at a profit of at least $100.00; that they could sell at least a couple of them by the end of the summer at a good profit, and not less than $100.00 on each.\u201d Relying on these representations plaintiff on April 14, 1932, signed a second contract for the purchase of lots 142, 143, and 145, for a total of $2,100, making a cash payment of $630 and agreeing to pay the balance monthly at $15. Plaintiff knew that the contracts provided for monthly payments, but had been told that it would not be necessary to make deferred payments as they would be taken care of out of the resale price of the lots. Plaintiff visited the development at Selby about seven times during the summer of 1932. \u201cThe defendants made no efforts to sell her [plaintiff\u2019s] lots.\u201d She had seen defendant Branham a number of times during the summer, \u201con each of which occasions he told her that he was going to sell her lots.\u201d During the summer of 1932 she (plaintiff) \u201cbecame suspicious that they were not going to resell; that she knew they were not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In September, 1932, plaintiff \u201cwent in to see Mr. Branham [defendant]\u201d because \u201cshe had' received notices that payments of $10.00 and $15.00 monthly were due on her contracts; that she told him that she was working on a small salary and' could not afford to make those payments\u201d of $25 monthly; and defendants \u201chad promised thai; she would not need to make deferred payments.\u201d She went to see him \u201cfor the purpose of demanding her money back.\u201d Branham \u201cstated that to help her meet the payments he would take back two of the lots and make the payments only $10.00 per month.\u201d \u201clie reiterated' his agreement to sell the two lots and stated that as it was fall they would not be able to resell until the following summer.\u201d Thereupon plaintiff on September 27, 1932,. signed a contract for the purchase of lots 144 and 145 (in lieu of the two April contracts). The purchase price of these lots under the third contract was $1,425, the contract reciting the payment of $861.34 cash (total of cash payments on April contracts, plus one installment payment under one of those contracts), the balance payable in $10 monthly installments. \u201cThe reason for the contract of September 27, 1932, being entered into was she could not keep up her payments on the other contracts.\u201d \u201cOn the occasion of signing the contract of September 27, 1932, she was told by Mr. Branham that he was going to resell the two lots but <em>probably </em>would not be able to resell them until the spring or summer of 1933; that she need not worry about deferred payments as they were going to sell the lots; that she believed his statement and had confidence in him because he was the head of the concern; that she signed\u2019 the agreement acting upon said statement.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Five other ladies, each of whom had purchased property at Selby from defendants at about the same time as plaintiff\u2019s transaction, \u201ctestified that the defendants as an inducement to them to buy represented that they [defendants] would resell the properties within a short time at a substantial profit; that each of the ladies relied on the representations in making the purchases; that no effort had been made to carry them out, and that suit had been filed against the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, the court \u201cexpressed the opinion that a case of fraud had been proved against the defendants, but that by signing the contract of September 27, 1932, the plaintiff had waived the fraud, and therefore [the court] found in favor of the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Prior to entering into the third contract, plaintiff, in answer to notices that the monthly payments were due on the first and second contracts, went to see Branham because defendants \u201chad promised that she would not need to make deferred payments\u201d; her purpose being to demand \u201cher money back.\u201d The demand for monthly payments naturally put in question defendants\u2019 good faith in making the representation .that plaintiff would not be obliged to make monthly payments. Although plaintiff had visited the development several times during the summer and had' been promised by Branham a number of times during that period that \u201che was going to sell her [plaintiff\u2019s] lots,\u201d the defendants\u2019 failure to resell likewise brought into question defendants\u2019 good faith in representing that they would resell at a profit. That this lack of good faith was brought home to plaintiff is apparent, for she testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>that she had become \u201csuspicious they were not going to resell; that she knew they were not\u201d; and that they had \u201cmade no efforts to sell her [plaintiff\u2019s] lots.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s suspicions had crystallized into conviction when she determined to demand \u201cher money back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Under these circumstances, it can hardly be said that plaintiff was ignorant of the falsity of similar inducements employed to get her to sign the third' contract and that she reasonably believed them to be true. Thus, since one of the conditions essential to warrant the setting aside of a contract in equity (i. e., the complainant must have been ignorant of the falsity of the representation, and reasonably believed it to be true. Southern Development Co. v. Silva, 125 U.S. 247, 8 S.Ct. 881, 31 L.Ed. 678), has not been established, the lower court was right in dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
