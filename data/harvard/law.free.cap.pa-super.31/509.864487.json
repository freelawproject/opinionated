At a tax sale the property was knocked down to Ada E. Wills. She, however, failed to pay the purchase money, and the property was again sold on an alias levari facias to Charles M. Richards and Ada E. Wills. The purchase price was $1,320. Fifteen hundred dollars was borrowed upon the property, and the purchase money was paid out of the proceeds. It appeared that P. T. Trimble, Esq., a member of the bar, attempted to make some arrangement to purchase the property on behalf of the daughters of William J. Richards, the plaintiff. This plan was acquiesced in by the plaintiff, but the plan was not carried out. Neither Mr. Trimble nor the plaintiff interfered in any way at the second sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-6\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-7\">[You have, then, not only the fact, if you so find, that he refused to join in the sale, but if you find from the clear force of the testimony \u2014 that is, by testimony clear, precise and indubitable \u2014 that he not only refused to join in this joint effort to save the property, but did something more than that\u2014 attempted adversely to get the property in the name of the children, which would have'taken the property entirely from the other parties \u2014 if that were his sole effort in refusing to join the other people to save it, and his effort was to divert it into the possession of his children, so that they would get the full, round benefit of the whole property, and thereby, as a matter of law, depriving the other people of any possible interest, or any chance of getting any interest in the property; if you find that was his purpose and effort, if the testimony satisfies you it was that, then there ought to be a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-8\">If the plaintiff, by a line of conduct which did not bear the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>impress of good faith, but showed a disposition upon his part not to act in good faith, for the common benefit or joint benefit of the other heirs, who were jointly interested, but adverse to them attempted to wreck that situation, to strike it down, to carry the property away and put it in his children, by conduct of that sort, he is estopped from coming in at this point and attempting to get from the other people what they had a right to get under the circumstances, because they had the right to save it. If he had agreed to join them in buying that, and helping them, clearly, then, he would be entitled to a verdict; but if his conduct was just the reverse of that, not attempting to save it for the joint benefit, but attempting to wreck it and take it away from that joint interest, and pass it down to his children, so that they would have it, and all the other interests would be stricken down, then it was a line of conduct that is not considered fair and right in law, and would bar him from a recovery in this case.] [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-3\">[As we have said to you, if his line of conduct does not bear the impress of good faith, fairness to his cotenants; if his whole effort was not in that common direction, to help the joint purpose'of the cotenants, but to strike down that interest, to carry the property away and put it in his children, and get it out of the way in that sense, then there ought to be a straight verdict for the defendant.] [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-4\">Mr. Wright: You have stated Mr. Trimble said he was representing the plaintiff.

It is for you to take what you remember the testimony to be. I think his testimony was \u2014 but you will correct it if we are mistaken \u2014 that he was consulted in a joint way, not merely by the children. Of course he met one child and then another, but he was consulted by the children, and by the father, the plaintiff in this case. So that, if the common purpose was well known, to direct this property from the line of the joint saving for all, to his own personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>interest in the children, then there ought to be a straight verdict for the defendant.] [10]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-3\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

The law does not permit one to acquire an adverse title and set it up against his cotenant. The presumption is that each joint owner acts for all where a common interest is involved. The relationship of the parties forbids that one act in antagonism to another with reference to such interest. This rule was said, in Chorpenning\u2019s Appeal, 32 Pa. 315, to be \u201c inflexible, without regard to the consideration paid or the honesty of the intent.\u201d Nor is the situation different if the adverse title be acquired through a sheriff\u2019s sale for taxes or a municipal lien. In such a case default is made by all of the owners, and the obligation rests upon all of them to relieve the property. Under such circumstances the interests remain and the possession is constructively in all as tenants in common, notwithstanding the legal title in the purchaser. A joint tenant upon whom is cast the burden of protecting the common property because of the unwillingness or inability of his co-tenants to contribute is not without means of reimbursement for the outlay incurred. The amount necessary for the preservation of the property is chargeable against it and such charge may be enforced in an equitable proceeding. Weaver v. Wible, 25 Pa. 270; Chorpenning\u2019s Appeal, 32 Pa. 315; Gibson v. Winslow, 46 Pa. 380; Dickey\u2019s Appeal, 73 Pa. 218; Tanney et al. v. Tanney, 159 Pa. 277, and Enyard v. Enyard, 190 Pa. 114, are some of the cases in which the rule above stated is discussed and illustrated. The appellees contend that their case is not under the operation of this rule because the plaintiff, when called upon to contribute to the discharge of the municipal claim, refused or neglected so to do; and not only that, but was a party to an attempt of his daughters to acquire the title at sheriff\u2019s sale adversely to all of the owners. It does not appear from the evidence that the plaintiff was consulted by either of the defendants before the sale. The evidence shows that Mr. Trimble, a member of the bar,'at the solicitation of his mother tendered his neighborly good offices to the plaintiff\u2019s daughters when the property was about to be sold by the sheriff, with a view of securing it for them. The plan seems to have been in a general way that Mr. Trimble would bid iii the property for the plaintiff\u2019s daughters and that they would earn money with which to discharge the obligation so .incurred. The plaintiff consented to this arrangement. Noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>ing came of it, however, and the property was bid off by Mrs. Wills, one of the defendants. Because she failed to pay her bid that sale was set aside and a new writ issued upon which the property was finally sold. It may well be doubted whether Mr. Trimble was in any sense the attorney of the plaintiff. He does not state that the plaintiff employed him. It appears from his testimony that the parties could not raise the money to pay the claim and that he thereupon declined to have anything more to do with the matter. Mrs. Wills\u2019 conversations were with Mr. Trimble and not with the plaintiff. It does not appear that Mr. Trimble reported to the plaintiff what took place between him and Mrs. Wills. The interviews between Mrs. Wills and Mr. Trimble occurred before the second sheriff\u2019s sale. Mrs. Wills then understood that Mr. Trimble was acting for the plaintiff and his mother. No plan was proposed to the plaintiff by the defendants by which the property might be purchased by means of a loan to be placed upon it; nor was the plaintiff personally requested to unite with the defendants in an effort to avoid a sheriff\u2019s sale. No attempt was made at the second sale to secure the property for the plaintiff\u2019s daughters. The court submitted to the jury the question whether the plaintiff acted in bad faith towards his cotenants and whether he attempted to take the property away from the joint owners and pass- it over to his children, and the jury was instructed that if he so acted such conduct was not fair and right in law and would estop the plaintiff from asserting a title afterwards. This instruction is made the subject of the 8th, 9th and 10th assignments of error. The title acquired by a joint owner adversely to his cotenants is not absolutely void. It may be ratified by those whose interests are affected and thereby become a Valid title. Under some circumstances the conduct of a joint owner before a sheriff\u2019s sale might be evidence of a waiver -of his right, but clear and satisfactory evidence should be required of such waiver. We do not find evidence from which an estoppel could be sustained against the plaintiff.' If he had been able to provide funds and secure a title to his daughters through a sheriff\u2019s sale the property would thereby have been relieved in the interest of all of the owners, but the plaintiff would have been entitled to reimbursement from his cotenants. It is not a fraud, either actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>or constructive, for a joint owner to purchase real estate sold \u2018at sheriff\u2019s sale to enforce payment of taxes or a municipal claim. The duty rested upon each of the owners to discharge the liability, and payment by one is presumed to have been in behalf of all. The defendants had notice before the first sheriff\u2019s sale of the design of Mr. Trimble to bid in the property for the plaintiff\u2019s daughters and also knew that this plan had not been carried out. The project failed before the sale at which the defendants acquired title. The acquiescence of the plaintiff in this plan would not estop him from asserting\u2019his right under a sale which he did not attend and with which he did not interfere. The evidence at most bears upon a 'question of waiver by the plaintiff and an election to permit the defendants to acquire title. What the plaintiff, appears to have done was to consent to Mr. Trimble\u2019s plan to buy in the property for the girls, and in the event that it was so acquired to execute a quit-claim deed for his interest therein. Whether he would have done so if he had understood that an arrangement could be made by which the money necessary to discharge the liens could be obtained on the credit of the property, as was subsequently. done by the defendants, is not disclosed by the testimony. We think it does not clearly appear from the evidence presented that the plaintiff, either before or after the sale, waived his right to call for his share of the property remaining after the defendants were reimbursed for their outlay. Facts may exist which were not disclosed at the trial which would throw additional light upon this question. If unfairness and bad faith are to be imputed to the plaintiff because he was willing that Mr. Trimble should provide the money to acquire the title for his daughters, the defendants would be under the same imputation in having bought the property and asserting a title against their cotenants. We think the case does not turn upon the question of estoppel or fraud, and that the 8th, 9 th and 10th assignments of error should, therefore, be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\">It is not clearly shown that the plaintiff understood that he was paying rent to the defendants. His title, if otherwise good, could not be defeated by the testimony offered upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">The judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
