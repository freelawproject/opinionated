Whereupon, on May 21, 1902, at No. 419, July Term, 1902, in the court of common pleas No. 2 of Allegheny county, suit in assumpsit was brought by plaintiff against defendant on said contract to recover the purchase money with interest. In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>suit, the only defense made by defendant was the statute of frauds, defendant claiming that the agreement of sale was not sufficiently evidenced by writing. The lower court held that there was a sufficient writing to satisfy the requirements of the statute and judgment was entered for plaintiff, for the amount claimed, with interest. Upon appeal by defendant to the Supreme Court this was affirmed. Defendant thereupon accepted the deed previously tendered by plaintiff and paid the judgment with interest and costs. After suit had been begun by plaintiff in the lower court, namely, after May, 1902, certain county and borough taxes upon the lots which were the subject of the suit, fell due. Plaintiff, thereupon, to protect the lots and to preserve the title clear and unencumbered, paid them, without, however, any demand having been made of plaintiff for their payment by the county or borough or by defendant, and without any demand having been made of defendant by plaintiff, or any notice having been given to defendant by plaintiff. The amount of these taxes paid by plaintiff on these lots, all of which were taxes falling due after the commencement of suit by plaintiff against defendant, was $32.55. Of this amount, $21.97 was paid before the trial of that suit, and $10.58 was paid after the trial and before decision reached by the Supreme Court on appeal. Plaintiff, when the Supreme Court had affirmed the decision of the lower court, and at the time of delivery of deed to defendant, demanded of the defendant that it reimburse plaintiff for the taxes thus paid by plaintiff while suit was pending, but this defendant refused to do, claiming that plaintiff had paid the taxes voluntarily, without demand having been made therefor by the borough or county, and without being requested by defendant to pay them. Defendant also claimed that this matter was res judicata, by reason of the suit brought by plaintiff against defendant at No. 419, July Term, 1902, and the judgment recovered therein by plaintiff. These taxes all fell due after that suit was. brought, and were not claimed or considered in that suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-4\">The lots, which were the subject of this suit, are and always have been vacant and unproductive of rental, and no income has ever been received from the same of any kind whatsoever.

He was the holder of the legal title and the assessment was a charge against him, personally, for payment of which his goods and chattels were subject to seizure, and in case sufficient goods and chattels were not found he was subject to arrest and imprisonment. The warrant of the tax collector required him to demand and receive from every person named in his duplicate the sum with which such person stood charged and such warrant was effectual to authorize the collection of the taxes assessed against the appellant. The assessment being regular and unappealed from, the tax authorities were not only not bound but had not power to look beyond the assessment roll. The appellant was also interested in the land as security for the payment of the purchase money due him. He was not limited to the individual responsibility of the defendant, but could also hold the title until payment of the purchase money was made. He was directly interested, therefore, in preventing a sale of the land for taxes, an occurrence which would have swept away both the title of the defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s security. Such being the situation the appellant paid the taxes. That an obligation for the payment of them rested on the defendant does not seem to be controverted. It acquired an equitable title by articles of agreement and should have paid the taxes assessed after its purchase: Gheen v. Harris, 170 Pa. 644. The defendant having denied the validity of the contract of sale and having refused to be bound thereby, no other course was open to the plaintiff to relieve himself from personal liability and to avoid a sale of his security except to pay the charge against him and the land. It is unquestionably true that an action of assumpsit will not lie for the mere voluntary payment of the debt of another. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>request and promise to pay are not implied by such an act. But this principle applies to intrusive payments. It has no application where one either by compulsion of law or to relieve himself from liability or to save himself from damage pays money which the defendant ought to have paid: 2 Greenleaf\u2019s Evidence, sec. 114; Hogg v. Longstreth, 97 Pa. 255; Iron City Tool Works v. Long, 4 Sadler\u2019s Pa. Supreme Ct. Cases, 57. The contention of the appellee that this principle does not apply to the case under consideration because no demand was made upon the defendant to pay the taxes and no seizure was made by the collector to enforce payment thereof, \u2022 is not well founded. A demand upon the defendant would have been a vain act in view of its attitude toward the contract. At the very time the taxes were assessed and afterward it was insisting that it was not the owner of the land and denying all responsibility on account of the contract. Nor can we hold that the payment was voluntary because the plaintiff did not wait until his property or person was threatened by the tax collector. It would be unreasonable to require him to submit to the seizure of his goods or to a personal arrest before he acquired the right to pay the charge and have an action for repayment against the defendant. Such a course would result in annoyance and perhaps humiliation to the plaintiff and the accumulation of costs and expenses, but would not increase his liability or in any way benefit the defendant. It was expressly held in Iron City Tool Works v. Long, above cited, that it was immaterial that no legal proceedings had been commenced to enforce the payment of the taxes and that it was not necessary for the plaintiffs in that case to wait until process was issued against them or their property before they paid the taxes which ought to have been paid by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\">Out of the facts presented in the case stated an implied assumpsit arose in favor of the plaintiff upon which he was entitled to judgment. His right to judgment on part of his claim is denied, however, because $21.97 of the taxes due was paid while the action was pending on the contract between the parties, as to which payment it is said the principle of res judicata applies. The plaintiff\u2019s claim in the present case, however, does not arise out of the written agreement, but out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>implied contract resulting from the payment of the taxes by him. It is an independent cause of action arising upon a new contract which came into existence after the original action was brought. At that time the present claim had no existence. The first action was on the contract in writing for a specific sum in the contract stated. No claim for taxes was then made or could then have been made, and as to the new cause of action we have no doubt that it may be now maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The judgment is therefore reversed and judgment is now entered against the defendant in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim with interest and costs, the amount of the judgment to be liquidated by the prothonotary of the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
