It is objected that the petition did not set forth that the division of the borough into wards was necessary \u201c to.suit the convenience of the inhabitants thereof,\u201d but only represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>that the petitioners\u2019 \u201c interests and that of the citizens and taxpayers of the said borough would be promoted by a division of the borough into wards.\u201d This objection was not raised until after the commissioners made their report,, and' at the worst is not a substantial or a jurisdictional defect. The Act of May 14, 1874, P. L. 159, under which the proceedings were had, does not declare what the petition shall contain. It simply provides,, in the first section, that the several courts of quarter sessions shall have authority to divide boroughs into wards, \u201c so as to suit the convenience of the inhabitants thereof,\u201d and in the second section, that \u201c upon application by petition of at least twenty freeholders resident in the borough .... for the purpose of dividing any borough into wards, .... the said court shall appoint three impartial men to inquire into the propriety of granting the prayer of the petition,\u201d etc. The petition in the present case was signed by the required number of petitioners and averred substantial reasons for the division. It was sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to appoint commissioners, and to divide the borough into wards \u201cso as to suit the convenience of the inhabitants thereof,\u201d if the subsequent proceedings were in conformity to law, and the court was convinced that the convenience of the inhabitants would be promoted thereby. The petition in In re Gettysburg, 90 Pa. 855, was in the form objected to here, and while this feature of it was not discussed, the fair inference from the decision is that such a petition was deemed sufficient to give jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">2. After setting forth the reasons for the division into wards the petition proceeds, \u201c and to that end they do respectfully pray the court to appoint three impartial men to inquire into the propriety and expediency of granting the prayer of the petitioners and to report their opinion on such propriety and expediency, .... and to return a plot of the borough with, lines and boundaries of the wards if they recommend any,\u201d etc. This quotation from the petition is a conclusive answer to the objection that a division of 'the borough into vfards was not prayed for. The petition could not be construed otherwise without resorting to hypercriticism. /</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">3. The remaining objection urged by the appellants is that there is no finding by the commissioners that)' the division recommended will-\u201c suit the convenience of the inhabitants.\u201d But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>that this was the opinion of the commissioners, and that they were governed in the performance of their duties by the principles declared in Brown v. Fowzer, 114 Pa. 446, we think is necessarily implied in their report, that after inquiring into the propriety and expediency of dividing the borough into wards, and fully considering the testimony offered on both sides and the arguments of counsel, they were of opinion \u201c that it is desirable and proper that the prayer of the petitioners should be granted, and that the interests of the citizens and inhabitants of the borough \u201d will be best subserved by the division thereof into wards, according to the boundaries set forth in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">All the assignments of error are overruled and the proceedings are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
