During the year 1905 two large modern brick hotels were completed and equipped for hotel purposes within the said borough, and to these two hotels licenses were granted in 1905 by the said court, and licenses have been granted to the last mentioned two hotels for the present year; and in addition to these hotels there are a number of good restaurants within the limits of the said borough. By a covenant running with the land upon which the town of Ambridge proper is located, the keeping and sale of liquors is prohibited, and all three of said hotels are located in a part of the said borough where the population does not exceed 2,000 people, and the evidence taken at the hearing in hehalf of the applicant is not very strong on the question of the necessity for the said Old Economy Hotel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-5\">In granting licenses to hotels, we think the court should steadily keep in view the interests of the traveling public, and to grant no more licenses than are necessary for their accommodation, and to grant the licenses to the hotels which afford the best accommodation in the shape of modern structures and equipment. In passing upon the applications in the borough of Ambridge, we were 'clearly satisfied from the evidence before us (having due regard to -the number and character of those for and against the granting of the same), that two hotels were all that were necessary to meet the demands of the public. Having found this fact, we then granted the licenses to the new modern hotels, which, in our judgment, would afford better accommodations to the public than one new house and the old one could afford.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-6\"><em>Jno.

Where more licenses are applied for than under all of the facts and circumstances are necessary for the accommodation of the public, the quarter sessions must necessarily determine between them. This is as much and as plainly within the discretion of that court as the determination of the question whether any license is necessary in the township, borough or city. The presumption, as .has been repeatedly said, that the action of the court was judicial and not arbitrary cannot be rebutted by an argument from evidence that the court ought to have reached a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
