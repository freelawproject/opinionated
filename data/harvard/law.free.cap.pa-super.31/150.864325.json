The testimony of the plaintiff in her examination in chief, emphasized in the cross-examination, was that the boardwalk was old and in bad condition from the time she came to live in the neighborhood \u2014 three years before the accident. A neighbor, Mrs. Curtis, testified that the walk was broken and rotten- and had been so a year before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">It may be well to remark that the question of contributory negligence is not raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">If the jury believed the testimony, of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, they were justified in finding that defendant had constructive notice of the defect in the sidewalk and, under such evidence, as was said in McClosky v. Dubois Boro., 4 Pa. Superior Ct. 181, \u201cit would have been error to withdraw the question of notice from the jury.\u201d The facts in that case, as in this, clearly distinguish both from Lohr v. Boro. of Philipsburg, 165 Pa. 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">The assignments of error are all overruled. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
