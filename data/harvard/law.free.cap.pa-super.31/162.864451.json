Shoup was insolvent and utterly unsuccessful in business and entirely incapable of making a living for himself; /all of this to his father\u2019s knowledge at the time the will was] made.\u201d To this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>offer objection was made and the objection sustained by the auditing judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">It would have been of but little avail for the legislature to require that a will ab origine should be in writing, or fence the testator around with a guard of attesting witnesses, if, when the writing failed to make a full and explicit disclosure of his scheme of disposition, its deficiencies might be supplied or its inaccuracies be corrected from extrinsic sources : 1 Jarman on Wills, p. *409, ch. 13. In cases of doubtful construction, the circumstances in which a will was made are, it is true, admissible in aid of the ascertainment of intent; but the will itself must give rise to the question. Stambaugh\u2019s Estate, 135 Pa. 585, upon which exceptant relies, carried this rule of extrinsic evidence to the verge ; and in view of the fact that there were, as the court finds, no creditors claiming, it is difficult to see how the question of spendthrift trust could have arisen; but even there the face of the will showed the improvident character of the donee and suggested the reason for the creation of the trust \u2014 the son ai^pearing as the testator\u2019s debtor, and impliedly unable to pay, for his debt is deducted from his share of the estate and the residue placed beyond the hazard of his improvidence. The court did not undertake to inject a new condition of enjoyment into the gift, but said that the intent must be \u201c gathered from the will itself,\u201d and \u201c the light of circumstances.\u201d The will as the essential basis of construction was distinctly recognized. That case, then, is clearly distinguishable from the present. There is nothing on the face of this will importing an intent to create a spendthrift trust. It contains a simple direction to pay, without any suggestion of exclusive enjoyment, and therefore without any intent of exclusion. But it is said that the creation of every trust implies disability, and the proposed evidence of donee\u2019s improvidence shows a necessity, and therefore an intent, to protect. It may be conceded that the creation of a trust does imply disability of some kind, but it does not necessarily imply disability of improvidence; it may mean lack of business experience in the\\donee, and is entirely consistent with the absolute use of the benefit intended, as a multitude of similar cases in the books sho\\V; or the purpose of the trust may have been to preserve the remainder and leave the cestui que vie free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>use his bounty as he pleases \u2014\u201c learning by his griefs.\u201d Absolute, vesting is always favored; and when there are neither express nor implied restrictions on the use in the will itself, incidental liability for the donee\u2019s debts follows, as of course. The statute of wills makes the wri ting the source of every testamentary right, and the courts have said again and again that wills must be construed by their four corners ; and where there is a gift absolute on its face the presumption is that it was intended to be absolute in its use. Why this particular trust was created the will fails to disclose, and there is consequently no occasion for construction and no reason for the aid of extrinsic evidence. There being then no suggestion of restriction in the use of the income on the face of the will, the presumption is that it was intended to be the subject of assignment or attachment as incidents of absolute ownership. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-4\">The exceptions must therefore be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-6\"><em>It.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">It was said in Mehaffey\u2019s Estate, 139 Pa. 276, that it is well settled by an unbroken line of cases, commencing with Fisher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>v. Taylor, 2 Rawle, 33, that, \u201c by using apt words \u201d a parent may create a special trust for the benefit of an unfortunate or a spendthrift child, without exposing his bounty to liability for any debts, contracts, or engagements of the beneficiary. No \u201c apt words \u201d for the creation of such special trust appear in the will; but it has been declared that a specific provision -that the income shall not be subject to the debts or liabilities of the beneficiary is not absolutely essential to the accomplishment of this object, but that the trust will be construed to be a spendthrift trust, if the terms of the instrument creating it show that the donor\u2019s intention would be frustrated by the subjection of the income to the claims of creditors: Winthrop Co. v. Clinton, 196 Pa. 472. But while under the law of this commonwealth spendthrift trusts are not regarded with disfavor, yet they are not looked upon with such special favor as warrants the courts in construing a trust to pay the income of a fund to the testator\u2019s son for life, without more, to be a spendthrift trust, or, in case of such a gift, departing from the general rule that when the language of a will is clear and unambiguous a doubt 'suggested by extrinsic evidence cannot be permitted to affect the construction of the instrument. But it is argued that, the mere creation of the trust for a son, while reposing confidence in others \u201c contrary to the usual order of things,\u201d is enough in itself -to raise a doubt as to the intention of the testator, thus taking such a case out of the general rule last stated. This argument, as applied to this case, is based largely on the distinction which the testator made between his only son and his married daughter. But assuming for a moment, as the learned counsel contends, that this indicates that the testator had less confidence in the former than in the latter, it seems to us a non sequitur to say that it also gives rise to doubt whether the language of the gift of $10,000 in trust to pay the income to the son for life fully expresses the testator\u2019s intention as to the right of the son to subject the same to liability for his debts and engagements. The language of the gift to the son being clear and unambiguous is not rendered doubtful in meaning by the mere fact that the gift to the daughter was not restricted to the income. Why the testator made this difference is matter of speculation; but inability to discover from a perusal of the will the reasons which influenced him to make the distinction is one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>thing, while to doubt whether the will fully expresses his intention is another and quite different thing. The former, standing alone, is no ground for resorting to extrinsic evidence. Presumably, withholding the principal from the son, and giving him the income only, constituted the full measure of restriction upon the son\u2019s possession and enjoyment of that part of the estate which the testator deemed wise under the circumstances. If parol evidence was admissible in this case to sustain a construction whereby the trust as to the fund in question would be converted into a spendthrift trust, it is difficult to see why such evidence should not be admitted in -every case, no matter how clear and unambiguous the terms of the will, where a testator has given a share of his estate to one child absolutely, and has restricted his gift to another child to the income of another share which he has put in trust. This would be in plain contravention of the general rule that extrinsic evidence will not be admitted to create a doubt, and thus affect the construction of a will which on its face is clear and free from doubt and needs no construction. We all concur in the conclusion reached by the court below, and in the reasons assigned therefor in the opinion filed by its learned president. His discussion of the questions involved, and of the distinctions between Stambaugh\u2019s Estate, 135 Pa. 585 (which in Winthrop Co. v. Clinton, 196 Pa. 472, was conceded to be an extreme case) and the case at bar, renders further elaboration by us unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The decree is affirmed, the appellant to pay the costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
