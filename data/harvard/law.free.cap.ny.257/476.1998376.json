In that view, the decision is not unanimous, and an appeal may be taken by the plaintiff as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The testimony as to the second assault, if submitted to the jury, would sustain a finding that the door of the defendant\u2019s dwelling was closed with sudden violence; that this was done with the design to strike the plaintiff who was peaceably approaching; that the force was unreasonable and dangerous; and that the plaintiff in trying to ward off the threatened blow struck his hand against the glass and was seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The judgment, so far as appealed from by the plaintiff, should be reversed, the causes of action stated in the complaint should be deemed to be severed, and a new trial granted as to the second, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Cardozo, Ch. J., Pound, Crane, Lehman, Kellogg, O\u2019Brien and Hubbs, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
