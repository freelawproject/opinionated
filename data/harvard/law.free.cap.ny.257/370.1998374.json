(Penal Law, \u00a7 1120.) Whether he was insane in such a sense or in such a degree as to render the imposition of the death penalty unjust or inexpedient is a question that will merit consideration if an application is made for executive clemency.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Cardozo, Ch. J., Pound, Crane, O\u2019Brien and Hubbs, JJ., concur; Lehman, J., dissents upon the ground that the trial judge did not properly submit to the jury the question whether the homicide was from a deliberate and premediated design to kill, and Kellogg, J., dissents upon the ground that the verdict is against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
