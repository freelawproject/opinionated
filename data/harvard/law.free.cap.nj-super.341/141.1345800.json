Defendant was sentenced to an aggregate term of five years-nine months\u2019 imprisonment. She appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">During his trial, Ejaz testified on his own behalf and implicated defendant as Imelda\u2019s assailant. During defendant\u2019s trial, when called as a witness on behalf of the State, Ejaz sought to invoke his spousal privilege, and after being compelled to testify, recanted his earlier statement and exculpated defendant. He then claimed that a statement he had given to a friend immediately after discovering Imelda\u2019s body inculpating defendant was also false. Defendant challenges a number of the trial judge\u2019s rulings. While disposing of her various claims, we specifically address the scope and waiver of the spousal privilege, as well as the admissibility, as substantive evidence, of prior inconsistent statements proffered by a party\u2019s witness at an earlier plenary trial. As to these two primary issues, as well as the remaining claims asserted by defendant, we conclude that the trial judge did not <em>commit </em>reversible error, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>/.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The scope of asserted error and the complex history of this case necessitates an expansive, detailed recitation of both the procedural and factual background.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\n<em>A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In the morning hours of March 13, 1996, the State Police discovered Imelda\u2019s clothed body bound in twine and dark plastic garbage bags on the shoulder of Burlington County Road 542 in the Pinelands. She was easily identified, as her name had been written on the inside of her slacks. Further investigation revealed that she was twenty-eight years old, and that she had emigrated from the Philippines to the United States on October 6, 1994, ostensibly to work under the sponsorship of the Fitzpatrick Hotel in Manhattan, where Ejaz served as comptroller, and under whose auspices Ejaz had filed Imelda\u2019s false work-visa application without the hotel\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The Baluchs admitted that they actually brought Imelda directly to the United States to become their housekeeper and live-in nanny to their two young children after defendant resumed employment as a registered nurse in the Intensive Care Unit of Newark Beth Israel Hospital. In addition to her childcare and housekeeping duties, Imelda also gave Ejaz regular evening massages for \u201ctips.\u201d Imelda\u2019s employment with the Baluchs was arranged with the aid of defendant\u2019s sister from the Philippines, Lolita Sagadraca, who, according to Ejaz, filed false documents concerning Imelda\u2019s work credentials in that country at his behest.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Imelda\u2019s seventeen-month stay with the Baluchs was an unpleasant one, as both Ejaz and defendant admitted that they verbally abused and \u201cslapped\u201d her occasionally for various housekeeping and childcare errors. Imelda\u2019s stay apparently became decidedly less comfortable when Lolita arrived as a tourist five months later and remained on a fraudulently obtained work visa. Lolita displaced Imelda from her bedroom to a sofa-bed in the basement, and commuted with Ejaz to Manhattan daily, where she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>worked in the Fitzpatrick Hotel as a chambermaid. According to the Baluchs, Lolita was \u201cvery critical\u201d of Imelda, \u201ctende[d] to slap her right and left\u201d herself, and encouraged the Baluchs to be less kind to her because she was only \u201ca maid.\u201d By early 1996, the Baluchs had decided to send Imelda back to the Philippines and to import her replacement, again on false papers to be submitted by Ejaz and Lolita.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">On her last regular day off, Sunday March 10, 1996, Imelda went to New York to visit friends and St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. She returned to the Baluchs\u2019 home that evening at approximately 6:00 to 7:00 p.m., tired, but un-bruised and seemingly healthy. After she ate dinner with the family, Ejaz asked her for a massage, and defendant and Lolita then both went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">On Monday, March 11, Lolita and Ejaz left for work together at approximately 8:15 a.m., and did not return home until approximately 9:00 p.m. Defendant was at home with Imelda for at least part of the day, and claimed to have given Imelda the day off because she was not feeling well.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">By 9:30 that evening, Imelda was dead in the basement laundry room. The immediate cause of death was anoxia. She also had five broken ribs, multiple contusions, and fat globules and bron-chopneumonia in her lungs. Bather than reporting her death, the Baluchs bound her body in a sheet, garbage bags, twine, and a rug, loaded it into a rented van, and, on March 12,1996, dumped it by the side of the road in the Pinelands. Ejaz subsequently disposed of the rug and the remainder of Imelda\u2019s clothing. The Baluchs then disseminated the fabrication that Imelda had voluntarily left their employ to visit friends or relatives on March 3, when they drove her to the Metuchen train station and placed her on a train for parts unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">The Baluchs were arrested after a year-long State Police investigation, including numerous interviews with defendant, Ejaz, and Lolita, as well as with Ejaz\u2019 and defendant\u2019s friends and co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>workers. They were jointly indicted for purposeful or knowing murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3a(l), (2), second-degree aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-lb(l), third-degree criminal restraint, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-2, and third- and fourth-degree hindering apprehension or prosecution of themselves and each other, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-3b, -3a.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Due to \u201cdifferently admissible\u201d proofs, the Baluchs were tried separately. Ejaz and defendant each proceeded on the theories that pneumonia, an accidental fall down the stairs, or fat emboli resulting from assault-related injuries caused by each other had induced Imelda\u2019s death. Each also contended that the other was the dominant marital partner who had promoted disposing of Imelda\u2019s body and lying to the police in order to hinder their apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Ejaz testified on his own behalf at his trial. His defense was based, in part, on the theory that defendant had beaten Imelda on the day of her death, that Imelda had fallen down the stairs in the course of that beating, and that, against his express wishes to notify authorities of Imelda\u2019s death, the Baluchs had agreed to dispose of her body because defendant had \u201ccried and begged him not to call the police.\u201d At trial, Ejaz described the sequence of events in which he then placed a telephone call to enlist the aid of his friend, Mian Hussain, to dispose of the body. He stated that he called Hussain at approximately 10:15 p.m., while still \u201cin complete shock,\u201d and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">AI told [Hussain] that I just got home and I found that my babysitter is dead and obviously she had died with some natural causes which I don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t know what they are, but she did have bruise and my wife did beat her up today or she hit her or whatever and during the course when that happened she also fell from stairs, so I said to him I don\u2019t know what to do, X asked him if he could tell me. He said to call the police. I told him I call the police they\u2019re going to arrest my wife, I can\u2019t let police arrest my wife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Ejaz later acknowledged that his strategy of \u201cshift[ing] the blame\u201d for Imelda\u2019s death and disposal to defendant \u201cto gain the sympathy of the jury\u201d was largely successful. He was acquitted of all homicide charges, convicted only of the aggravated assault and hindering charges, and sentenced to a probationary term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>conditioned upon his payment of Imelda\u2019s funeral expenses and 364 days in the county jail. By his own account, he \u201cwon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\"><em>Alter </em>his tidal, Ejaz\u2019 factual contentions changed. He joined in defendant\u2019s defense at her subsequent trial asserting that he was the \u201ccontroller\u201d in the family, that defendant was but a \u201cdutiful, obedient\u201d wife, that he had lied to Hussain about defendant beating Imelda in order to induce his aid, and that he had actually instigated the disposal of Imelda\u2019s body himself to hinder the Baluchs\u2019 apprehension for making the fraudulent visa applications for Imelda, Lolita, and Imelda\u2019s intended replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Defendant moved in limine to exclude: (1) Ejaz\u2019 testimony, claiming spousal privilege, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>501(2)(a); and (2) defendant\u2019s co-workers\u2019 anticipated prior bad acts testimony, as irrelevant and unduly prejudicial, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>402, 403(a), 404(b). The judge denied the motions, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">With regards to the spousal immunity ... [t]he old Rule 23 read, if you look at it, counselors, to the effect that both parties, the spouse and the defendant, had to consent in order for testimony to come in. That\u2019s not applicable any more. The rule was changed and the rule now clearly, clearly gives that privilege to the spouse witness ... In this case that would be Ejaz Baluch, the husband. He holds the privilege. He does not want to testify, he does not consent to testify; therefore, if the State is going to be able to call him as a witness I would have to find ... that there has been a waiver of that privilege. Now, we all know, it is quite clear from the law ... that the reason for the privilege, the spousal privilege, is the harmony or the maintenance of harmony in the marriage, in the relationship as husband and wife of the family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">In this particular case Ejaz Baluch in his ease took the stand voluntarily, intelligently, without any pressure of any kind and he testified at length. He disclosed all of the information which is now sought to be excluded by the wife from her trial. He has in fact published all the information that would have been privileged, that would have not ever seen the light of day had he not testified and answered the questions of his lawyer. It is quite clear that under . . <em>N.J.R.E. </em>530, Ejaz Baluch has in fact waived his 501(2) privilege by testifying in his own behalf and by offering or giving the information to the jury in that case and actually to the public at large, it was widely publicized at the time of trial, so that in effect the policy considerations of the State have already been defeated by Mr. Baluch himself by volunteering the information. The information has been disclosed. Any damage that was going to occur, that was going to happen to the marriage, should have already happened. Obviously it has not had an effect and obviously he has in fact waived his spousal privilege; therefore, the motion ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>with respect to spousal privilege is denied. I find specifically that Ejaz Balueh has waived that privilege and that he is in fact the holder of the privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">With regards to the statements [of] the co-workers, those statements are all admissions. No one argues differently. We have <em>State versus Cofield, State versus Nance </em>and <em>other </em>\u2014 State <em>versus Brown, Conway, </em>other cases, and it\u2019s quite clear that in order for the evidence to be admissible it has to be relevant to a material issue, it must be similar in kind and reasonably close in time to the offense charged. The evidence of the other crime must be clear and convincing and the probative value of the evidence must not be outweighed by its prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">The State\u2019s argument quite clearly is that that evidence comes in under 404(b) in order to establish intent, identification and motive. It is quite clear that the evidence is admissible for those purposes ... under 404(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">I find that all of that evidence would in fact be material and relevant to the issues before this Court and I also find that the probative value ... of that evidence is not substantially outweighed by any prejudicial effect that it might have. The rule is that the evidence will only be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice. I find that this evidence, its probative value, is not substantially outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice. The Court obviously will have to charge the jury appropriately so that they do not misuse the evidence and draw the inference that ... this defendant would have a propensity to commit an act because of the prior history. Obviously that type of charge ... will be necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The judge subsequently denied Ejaz\u2019 motion to quash the State\u2019s subpoena on Fifth Amendment privilege grounds, noting that under <em>State v. DeCola, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>335, 164 A.2d 729 (1960), the court\u2019s compulsion of his testimony would confer automatic immunity against Ejaz\u2019 prosecution for any perjury he may have committed while testifying at his own March trial. Defendant\u2019s trial proceeded accordingly, with both parties relying heavily upon the witnesses\u2019 prior statements and the transcript of Ejaz\u2019 trial to impeach witness credibility at defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The manner of Imelda\u2019s death was placed squarely at issue by defendant prior to any substantive medical testimony, as defense counsel explored the qualifications of the State\u2019s expert, Burlington County Medical Examiner Dante A. Ragasa, M.D., on voir dire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">Q One of the things a forensic pathologist does is determine a manner of death, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">Q And there\u2019s five manners of death, correct? There\u2019s natural death, accidental death, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">Q Homicide, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">Q And one of the things a forensic pathologist does is determine the manner of death, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">Q Okay. Now in determining the manner of death homicide is a medical definition that you use, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-11\">A Actually it\u2019s a legal term, terminology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-12\">Q Well, what homicide means in determining manner of death, determine that it\u2019s a homicide, you mean it was caused by a human agency, correct, another human being? Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-13\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">Ragasa was deemed qualified to testify as a pathology expert, and set forth his findings and opinion as to the cause and manner of Imelda\u2019s death. We reiterate those detailed findings, as the cause of Imelda\u2019s death was in significant dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">Ragasa described multiple contusions on Imelda\u2019s body, including extensive bruises of varying ages, ranging from one day to two weeks old, on her back, buttocks, and the back of her legs. He noted a bruise above Imelda\u2019s right breast determined to be less than one week old, an older bruise above her left breast, and bruising estimated to be one to two days old below her right eye and on the right side of her pubis, lower abdomen, and various areas of the front and side portions of both legs. He also noted a dimpled area on Imelda\u2019s center forehead at the hairline, bulging in the left parietal temporal area under her hair, lacerations or abrasions on the top of her left ear, nose, and upper lip, as well as dried blood on her toes and left ear, and foot edema, indicating that Imelda had suffered those injuries and heart failure before her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">His internal examination revealed two right- and three left-rib fractures in the breast areas with recent adjacent soft-tissue hemorrhages indicating that the fractures were likely one day, but perhaps up to one week old. The exam also revealed extensive hemorrhaging in Imelda\u2019s scalp indicating multiple blunt-force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>traumas pre-dating the rib injuries, heart failure and related lung congestion, and scattered areas of inflammation in normal weight lungs indicating early-stage bronchopneumonia pre-dating the rib fractures. Notably, he observed several fat emboli in her lungs caused by her soft tissue injuries or rib fractures. Based on these findings, Ragasa opined that Imelda died of anoxia caused by \u201cfat embolism secondary to the multiple contusions and rib fractures with bronchopneumonia.\u201d When asked what that meant, Ragasa replied, \u201cIt means it\u2019s a case of homicide,\u201d and explained that considering her age, Imelda would not have died from the pneumonia alone. Defendant did not object to Ragasa\u2019s characterization or conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">On Ragasa\u2019s cross examination, in addition to advancing the notion that Imelda\u2019s injuries and fatal anoxia had been caused by pneumonia rather than assault-related fat emboli, defendant also attempted to adduce proofs that Imelda\u2019s rib fractures and scalp injuries might have resulted if the pneumonia had caused Imelda to fall down a flight of stairs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">Q The decedent could have fallen down the steps because of the pneumonia and sustained a rib fracture and head bruises in the manner that she displayed them on your examination, couldn\u2019t she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">Q My question is that that\u2019s consistent with the decedent falling down steps because of pneumonia, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">A It can happen. The decedent can fall down the steps even without the pneumonia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">Q Right. And get those types of injuries, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">A Well, it\u2019s possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Defendant\u2019s pathology expert, John E. Adams, M.D., opined that Imelda died of diffuse pneumonia. He further opined that the onset of pneumonia predated Imelda\u2019s injuries, and predated her death by at least two days. He agreed that Imelda had sustained bruises on both sides and the back of her scalp, under her right eye, and on her shins and chest before her death, but attributed the remaining discoloration of her body to post-mortem insect activity and lividity, or pooling of the blood due to gravity.. He attributed the ear laceration to post-mortem mouse activity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>He estimated that Imelda\u2019s rib fractures and scalp injuries had occurred at approximately the same time, eighteen to twenty-four hours before death, or on Sunday, March 11, and that her visible bruises were two days old or less. Finally, he opined that because the pneumonia predated her injuries, \u201cone possible scenario\u201d was that \u201c[they] all could have been sustained in one or more falls down the steps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">On cross examination, Adams conceded that as to manner of death, Imelda\u2019s contusions and broken ribs \u201ccould be the result of repetitive striking by someone else,\u201d that it was \u201centirely possible\u201d that the rib fractures may have contributed to her death by impairing her pneumonia-compromised breathing, and that \u201cif the broken ribs were inflicted by someone else then that would make it ... a homicidal death,\u201d \u201cbecause that\u2019s the definition of homicide. It\u2019s the death of someone at the hands of someone else.\u201d Defense counsel neither objected to the line of questioning nor moved to strike Adams\u2019 responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Ejaz claimed that he \u201clied\u201d at his own trial and falsely \u201cshifted the blame\u201d for Imelda\u2019s death and hindering the Baluchs\u2019 apprehension to defendant in order to \u201cgain the sympathy of the jury\u201d and secure his acquittal on the criminal homicide charges. After being declared a hostile witness, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>611(c), he admitted that he called his friend Hussain after discovering Imelda\u2019s body. He claimed that Hussain hated defendant, and that his statement to Hussain that defendant had beaten Imelda was merely a fabrication calculated to induce Hussain\u2019s aid in disposing of the body by evoking his sympathy for Ejaz and the predicament defendant had created:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">Q You testified at your trial you were going to call the police, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">A That\u2019s correct, but I lied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">Q You testified at your trial that your wife cried and begged you not to call the police, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">A It was a lie, yes. I had to shift the burden at that time to defend myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">Q And you didn\u2019t do anything to Imelda, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-14\">A No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Q And you called a man by the name of Mian Hussain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">A Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">Q And the reason that you called Mian Hussain was to help you dispose of the body?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">A Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">Q You and your wife decided that time you were going to dispose of the body so the body couldn\u2019t be traced back to your family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">A That\u2019s not correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">Q You planned it by yourself? It was your idea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">A That\u2019s my idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">Q And the reason that you wanted to dispose of the body was because your wife beat up Imelda?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-13\">A That\u2019s notcorreet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-14\">Q And the reason you wanted to dispose of the body was because you wanted to protect your wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-15\">A That\u2019s not correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-16\">Q Do you recall telling Mian Hussain that the reason you wanted him to help you dispose of the body is because your wife beat up Imelda?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-17\">A Yes, I told him because I wanted to earn his sympathy because he hates my wife. If I tell him anything with me he\u2019s not going to do anything for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-18\">Q You told Mian Hussain the reason you wanted him to dispose of the body you were afraid the police were going to arrest your wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-19\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-20\">Q You told Mian Hussain the reason you wanted him to dispose of the body with you you wanted him to protect your wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-21\">A That is not correct. I did tell him, but that\u2019s not correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-22\">THE COURT: The question is did you tell him that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-23\">A Yes, I did tell him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-24\">Q And you did tell him that your wife beat up Imelda, right\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-25\">AI did tell him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-26\">Q \u2014and that\u2019s the reason she died? Did you tell that to Mian Hussain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-27\">A I told Mian Hussain she died some natural causes and we have no clue about it. We didn\u2019t know at that time she died of pneumonia. That came until after [sic] we found out in discovery when the doctor did the proper work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-28\">Ejaz was then confronted with a transcript of his prior testimony. It was only at this point that defendant, belatedly, objected to these questions. She moved for a mistrial on the ground that \u201c[tjhere is no hearsay exception that allows [Ejaz] to testify to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>anything he said that is incriminating of his wife outside his wife\u2019s presence.\u201d The judge noted that the statements had not been offered substantively for their truth, and overruled the objection. Counsel\u2019s request for an immediate cautionary jury instruction was denied, and Ejaz\u2019 prior testimony from his own trial concerning his telephone call to Hussain was read aloud and affirmed by Ejaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Ejaz then stated that he and defendant \u201cdump[ed] the body\u201d after he, defendant, and Lolita had all agreed to do so, but he repudiated his prior testimony that he intended to protect defendant. Instead, he claimed that he promoted disposing of Imelda\u2019s body against defendant\u2019s wishes to protect himself because he had brought Imelda to the United States illegally. Contrary to his own trial testimony that he and defendant had jointly developed the story that Imelda voluntarily left the Baluchs\u2019 employ on March 3, Ejaz also claimed that he alone \u201ccooked up that story,\u201d and that defendant and Lolita had dutifully followed his instructions to lie to the police in order to maintain the ruse: \u201cMy wife lied. Lolita lied. Everybody lied.\u201d Despite his further admission that he attempted to suborn the perjury of a co-worker who later learned of the circumstances of Imelda\u2019s death from Lolita, and that he advised his co-worker \u201cnot to worry\u201d because \u201cperjury is only a small crime,\u201d Ejaz steadfastly maintained that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d whether he himself would lie to protect defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Ejaz also maintained that although defendant had a \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cshort\u201d temper, and yelled at Imelda \u201c[o]nce in a while if she d[id] something stupid,\u201d defendant\u2019s temper was \u201c[n]ot as bad\u201d as his own. He admitted that he \u201cslapped\u201d Imelda twice and saw defendant slap Imelda on two separate occasions for housekeeping and childcare errors, but insisted that Lolita slapped Imelda more frequently than either of them, \u201cfor anything [Imelda did] wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">On cross-examination, defense counsel pursued a line of questioning which intimated that Ejaz had a sexual relationship with Imelda, and that Imelda might have thwarted his advances on the evening before her death. Ejaz denied the suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>At the close of Ejaz\u2019 testimony, defendant renewed her application for a mistrial or an immediate curative instruction limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of the content of Ejaz\u2019 telephone call to Hussain for impeachment purposes only. The judge reserved decision, initially indicating that he would probably give such a limiting instruction, but upon further consideration, determined that Ejaz\u2019 prior inconsistent statement was also admissible substantively for its truth. Although defense counsel made no immediate objection or comment on the ruling, he renewed defendant\u2019s mistrial application four days later. The judge again denied the application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:____This t\u00edme I have an application for a mistrial ... based upon the admission of the testimony of Ejaz Baluch to Mian Hussain. The Rule 803 regarding prior statements of witnesses being admissible says that such statements are admissible provided it would have been admissible if made by the declarant while testifying. Well, one of the reasons\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">THE COURT: We\u2019re talking about the statement made by Ejaz Baluch to Mian Hussain\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">THE COURT: \u2014 and Ejaz Baluch is the gentleman who was the witness here who testified under oath who was subject to cross examination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, 803(c)(25) ... states that the statement has be contrary to the declarant\u2019s interest, not to anybody else\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-12\">THE COURT: At the time the statement was made [it] was certainly against his penal interest because he was involved in a conspiracy to hinder his own apprehension .... [and] the apprehension of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: There\u2019s no charge of conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-14\">THE COURT: ... [Yjou\u2019re technically correct, there is no charge of a conspiracy, but at the time he was involved in a course of action to hinder his apprehension ... [and that] of his wife ... when he made those statements. The other argument ... is [that] these could have been excited utterances. He had just discovered that the maid was dead ... and he makes these phone calls ... almost immediately or within a very short period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, so that the record is clear, it has to be contrary to his interest. Incriminating somebody else is not contrary to the declarant\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-16\">THE COURT: How about hindering his apprehension ... isn\u2019t that against his penal interest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>I\u2019m going to deny your application, counselor____TF]irst of all, I\u2019ve already ruled that the statements were admissible. This gentleman ... was here. He was a witness prior. He was subject to cross examination both times. He was under oath both times and I see no reason to declare a mistrial at this particular point____I do not find any violation of Rule 803 or any other rule for that matter with respect to his testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Lolita noted that defendant had \u201ca high temper and a loud voice,\u201d and was \u201calways upset with ... and ... hurting Imelda.\u201d She stated that she witnessed defendant strike Imelda many times, including in Ejaz\u2019 presence, and that Ejaz made no attempt to intervene. She also observed that Imelda was \u201cnot so'healthy\u201d in the two days preceding her death, and that Imelda was \u201csad and ha[d] a lot of scratches.\u201d Lolita contended that the Baluchs disposed of Imelda\u2019s body while Lolita cared for their children, and agreed that she had previously testified at Ejaz\u2019 trial that she witnessed Ejaz hit Imelda perhaps on ten or more occasions, and that he \u201cpush[ed] Imelda and ... Imelda got hurt.\u201d She claimed that she was not involved in any conversation or planning to dispose of Imelda\u2019s body, but also claimed that defendant had suggested they bury the body in the back yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Five of defendant\u2019s co-workers from the Intensive Care Unit at Newark Beth Israel Hospital testified for the State. The first noted that defendant \u201chad a temper,\u201d and that when she was angry, she spoke loudly and banged clipboards and patients\u2019 charts. She indicated that defendant frequently spoke of Imelda at work, referring to her as \u201cSLB,\u201d for \u201cstupid lazy bum,\u201d and that defendant admitted that she slapped Imelda on occasion, that she \u201chit\u201d Imelda whenever Imelda tried to \u201canswer back\u201d to reprimands, and that she once \u201cbanged [Imelda\u2019s] head on the wall\u201d when she was angry with her. When defendant returned to work after Imelda\u2019s death, she told this co-worker that Imelda left her employ after an argument, and that defendant had delivered her to the train station.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">After this direct testimony, the judge immediately gave a cautionary instruction to the jury on defendant\u2019s co-workers\u2019 prior bad acts testimony, and explained that the testimony concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>defendant\u2019s prior physical abuses of Imelda was only to be considered as it related to the motive, intent, or identity of a person who might have caused Imelda\u2019s death, and not to be used as propensity evidence against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Another co-worker then reported that after Imelda\u2019s death, defendant announced that she \u201cfinally got rid of\u2019 Imelda and had taken her to the Metuchen train station. A third corroborated the other co-workers\u2019 testimony, and added that she once heard defendant \u201cscream\u201d and \u201ccurse\u201d loudly over the nurses\u2019 station telephone, declaring \u201cyou\u2019re going to get it tomorrow when I see you.\u201d Defendant had later explained that her youngest child had sustained a head bump while under Imelda\u2019s care, and that defendant had instructed Imelda to \u201cbang her head on the wall so she would know how it feels.\u201d Defendant reported that Imelda obeyed, and had banged her own head against the wall. This coworker also stated that defendant did not get along well with some of the other nurses, and that they would occasionally argue with or scream at each other. Two other co-workers corroborated the earlier testimony, and one added that defendant admitted she had pulled Imelda\u2019s hair, in addition to slapping her.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Defendant testified on her own behalf. Although Imelda was \u201cslow and forgetful,\u201d defendant \u201clike[d]\u201d her, gave her various gifts, and always brought her along on family vacations. She denied ever having fought with Imelda, hitting Imelda\u2019s head against a wall or commanding her to do so, hitting her in the ribs, or pushing her down the stairs. She also denied ever having thrown or banged charts at work or having yelled at her fellow nurses. She claimed that one of her co-workers had coined the nickname \u201cSLB\u201d for Imelda after defendant complained about Imelda\u2019s performance, and that three of the co-workers who had testified against her were simply not fond of her because of her \u201cfilthy rich ... Pakistani Muslim husband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">According to defendant, after Imelda ate dinner with the family at approximately 8:30 p.m. on Sunday March 10, Ejaz asked Imelda for a massage, and defendant went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Defendant noted that after she fixed breakfast for Ejaz and Lolita the following morning, Imelda entered the kitchen as Ejaz and Lolita were departing for work, and asked defendant for the day off. Imelda had \u201ca bruise on her right eye and a bump [on her head],\u201d and defendant gave her some Tylenol and the day off. Imelda was in the family room watching television both when defendant and her child left the house at approximately 11:00 a.m., and when they returned home at 4:00 p.m. Defendant then ascertained that Imelda \u201cwas catching flu\u201d and that she was coughing \u201c[a] little bit,\u201d but noted that Imelda was having no trouble breathing. Defendant gave Imelda more medication and the rest of the day off, and Imelda went down to the basement to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">During dinner, at approximately 9:30 p.m., defendant informed Ejaz that Imelda had the flu and had not yet eaten. Ejaz went to the basement and discovered Imelda\u2019s body. After defendant determined that Imelda was dead, she went back upstairs and picked up the telephone to dial 911, but was dissuaded by Ejaz and Lolita:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">AI went up and they followed me. I took the telephone. I was going to call 911. And Ejaz said .... no, she died in my house, you\u2019re Philippino, I\u2019m Pakistani, .. they\u2019re going to blame us. I said no, they\u2019re not. He said she\u2019s illegal here, I brought her here illegally, if my company finds out I\u2019m going to lose my job. Your sister is here illegally, he said they\u2019ll arrest her and deport her. I was so confused. I didn\u2019t know what to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">Q Did you look to your sister at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">A Yes. She was begging she cannot go home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">Q Did you pick up the phone to call again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">A No. Ejaz said he\u2019s going to take care of it, to trust him, ... that she\u2019s already dead, nobody else can do anything for her any more, that her shell is just there but her spirit is gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-11\">Q As a result of what Lolita said to you and as a result of what Ejaz said to you what happened? What was done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">A We did not bury her in the back yard. We \u2014 Ejaz said that he\u2019s going to call his friend and his friend is going to help him drop \u2014 put the body in some place where she could be found and she could be buried.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">Q And did Ejaz make a call from your house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>A Yes. He called his friend and they spoke in his Pakistani language. I did not understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">Q And then did he leave the house to make another call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">A Yes. He has to use the outside phone and call his friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">Q After leaving the house did there come a time when he came back to the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">A Yes. After a while he came back and he said his friend cannot help him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">Q And as a result of what he said what did you and Lolita and Ejaz do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">A We help him. We went down to the basement, we said a prayer and we wrap her in a sheet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">Q And was she brought anywhere?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">A The three of us help him. We brought her to the garage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-13\">Q And after bringing her to the garage where did you all three go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-14\">A We went to bed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">Three of defendant\u2019s co-workers and two of her friends testified on her behalf. One described defendant as a professional, very competent nurse who was compassionate toward patients. She found defendant\u2019s temperament to be \u201cfrank and assertive,\u201d but not mean-spirited. She had never seen defendant throw or bang charts or abuse her co-workers in any fashion, and had only heard of such conduct through the allegations of other co-workers during the course of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-16\">Two other co-workers agreed that neither of them knew defendant to have a bad temper, and that they had never seen defendant verbally or physically abuse patients or co-workers or bang or throw charts. One co-worker stated that she had heard defendant refer to Imelda as \u201cSLB.\u201d The other noted that defendant got along well with some nurses but not others, that two of the State\u2019s witnesses were part of a clique that \u201cdidn\u2019t like\u201d defendant, and that during the investigation, she had overheard them saying they were going to call the prosecutor and \u201ctell them what she had did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-17\">Another defense witness, a classmate from the Philippines, began socializing with defendant in 1995, and \u201cnever saw her very angry----[or] upset.\u201d She observed Imelda at defendant\u2019s home on at least three occasions, and found her to be shy, neat, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>healthy, and not injured or upset in any way. Another friend and classmate corroborated that description of Imelda, and described defendant as a \u201cvery loving,\u201d \u201chard-working,\u201d and \u201cdevoted\u201d mother and wife who had a \u201cvery objective\u201d temper and \u201cnever raised her fists or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\n<em>c.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">At the close of the State\u2019s evidence, juror 10 reported to the judge that juror 13 had been \u201cdiscussing the case with an attorney.\u201d In the presence of counsel and defendant, the judge conducted a voir dire of each juror. The voir dire revealed that juror 3 had overheard an unidentified juror say that she had a friend who was an attorney, and that the attorney said the jury was \u201cprobably being recorded.\u201d Juror 10 revealed that she had overheard juror 13 stating to jurors 2,11, and another unidentified juror that juror 13 had spoken about the case with a friend who was an attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">JUROR [10]: ... [W]hat she said was I spoke to my friend who\u2019s a lawyer and she said that the ease is going to go this way or that way, and exactly what she said as far as this way or that way I don\u2019t remember, but when she said that she was speaking to her friend and her Mend was a lawyer it was almost as if she was speaking and trying to make herself an authority.. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">THE COURT: Was it like procedure, how long are you going to be there, the ease is almost over, or was it about the outcome itself, what the decision would be or what the decision should be or ought to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-10\">JUROR [10]: It was more what the decision should be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-11\">THE COURT: It was more what the decision should be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-12\">JUROR [10]: And the fact that she had \u2014 she doesn\u2019t particularly care for one of the attorneys and that was one of the issues that she was speaking about with her friend, the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Was she more specific?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-14\">JUROR [10]: She wants very little to do with you, the prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: When you say about the case going this way or that way did she say anything? Was there something more specific about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>JUROR [10]: In my opinion it\u2019s more like she\u2019s trying to get people to agree with her on what her thoughts are along the case lines and where she thinks the case should be and the progression of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did she say where she thinks the case should be or express what her thoughts were to these other jurors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">JUROR [10]: To her \u2014 to the few that she talks to I\u2019m sure, but I don\u2019t know exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You don\u2019t know exactly what she said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">JUROR [10\u00cd: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Have any of the other jurors responded to her comments that heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">JUROR [10]: No one\u2019s really buying into what she\u2019s saying, but it\u2019s just the point that I feel that she\u2019s trying to be forceful and pushing people to think along her lines. There\u2019s a few people that I think are kind of \u2014 that would follow her if given the chance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did she say how she thought the case should be decided? Did she ever say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-12\">JUROR [10]: Not exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Were you with any of the other jurors that you can remember when you overheard the conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-14\">JUROR [10]: Let\u2019s see. Number one was there and also ... number 12 ... [a]nd I think the woman that sits here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Was there any comment among those other jurors, the ones you were with, about oh, gee, I just heard what she said and did you hear what she said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-16\">JUROR [10]: Well, first comment [sic] was I can\u2019t believe she said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-17\">THE COURT: Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-18\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s all I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-19\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I just want to say I think we should keep juror 13 now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-20\">Juror 13 admitted that she had a close personal friend who was a lawyer, but denied that she had any discussion with that friend concerning the case or its outcome, had told any member of the jury she had done so, or had any discussions with other jurors about \u201cwhat the outcome should be.\u201d She admitted that she had expressed a preference for one of the attorneys in the case. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>remaining jurors admitted that there had been general discussions about the personalities of the attorneys and the dynamics of their interaction with the judge, but stated that they had not heard any conversations indicating that a fellow juror had been discussing the case with a friend who was an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Following the voir dire, the prosecutor noted that he found juror 10 to be credible in light of her accurate knowledge that juror 13 had a close personal friend who was a lawyer. Although he was \u201cvery seriously concerned\u201d that the alleged discussions concerning the outcome of the case might have taken place, and that the jurors were thus not only tainted, but unwilling to be forthright about what they had heard, he left the matter to the judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Defendant elected to proceed with the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:.... Well, Judge, I think it\u2019s either all or nothing at all at this point. The only thing definite that came out in terms of what was discussed was that apparently supposedly juror number 13 doesn\u2019t care for the prosecutor. For all I know there may be other jurors on there that don\u2019t care for me ... so I don\u2019t think what the jurors may think of the personalities of the judge or ihe prosecutor or the defense attorney is grounds to excuse any juror, so I don\u2019t think that anything else beyond that actually has been established____I know that if you go by what [juror 10] said and you believe that there were discussions about the ease this way or that that may have affected other jurors then, you know, juror number two has to go, juror number 11 has to go because they were involved allegedly according to [juror 10] in these discussions with Tjuror 13]. Juror number 12 was there when she overheard it. Juror number one was there. Juror number seven was there. They all denied overhearing anything or anything improper going on, so if you believe her and not them then those jurors have to go, so you don\u2019t have a jury left, so it\u2019s either everybody stays or everybody goes at this point as I see it because if you\u2019re going to excuse [juror 13] just on the say \u2014 so of [juror 10] then based upon her say \u2014 so a lot of other people have to be excused and probably she has to be excused because she may have been adversely affected against us based upon the efforts of [juror 10] as she claims they were to influence jurors in some vague unspecified way. I mean she mentioned this way or that way, but she didn\u2019t mention anything about something specific as to what it should be, so I\u2019m going to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-11\">THE COURT: Are you telling me then that I should not excuse any of these jurors and that you are as a defense attorney satisfied that this jury can still reach a verdict, a fair and impartial, a just verdict based on the evidence and not on any extraneous or outside influences?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yeah. I believe based upon what I have heard that there was nothing specific to indicate that that couldn\u2019t be done. The only thing that I heard definitely was that there were discussions about the people involved in the case and I don\u2019t find that to be unusual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The judge agreed that despite juror 10\u2019s \u201cpretty credible\u201d allegation that some of the jurors may have overheard conversations to the effect that juror 13 had spoken to a \u201clawyer friend,\u201d there was no specific indication that juror 13\u2019s conversations with the lawyer or other jurors had focused upon what the outcome of the case should be rather than merely upon how the case was going and what was going to happen next. The judge found that the jury could and would reach a fair verdict based upon the evidence and no other considerations. He declined to declare a mistrial or to excuse any juror, but gave an immediate instruction when the jury reconvened emphasizing and expanding upon the routine instructions he had already delivered daily throughout the course of the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">Once again I want to remind you that you are not to discuss this matter amongst yourselves, you\u2019re not to discuss this matter with anyone else, anyone else, members of your family, friends, relatives or anyone else. You are to decide this matter based on the evidence that is presented in this courtroom and you are to decide this matter based on the law as I give it to you, as I dictate it to you. You\u2019ve taken an oath to do that. You\u2019ve all taken an oath to do that and I want to remind you in the strongest possible terms that you are not to discuss the matter with anyone, you are not to allow anyone else to discuss the matter with you. You are to decide the matter based on what you\u2019ve heard and seen in this courtroom and you are to decide the matter based on these exhibits that are about to be shown to you and nothing else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">At the close of all the evidence, defendant submitted a request that the jury be charged on the testimony of character witnesses to emphasize that the positive testimony of defendant\u2019s friends and co-workers to the effect that she was a calm, compassionate, and caring professional might counterbalance her co-workers\u2019 testimony to the effect that defendant had a bad temper and a penchant for banging and throwing things at work. The judge denied the application, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">There was no proper character testimony. There could have been, but there was none offered in this particular case. The defense witnesses that were produced did testify that this lady never got angry, that she never \u2014 they never saw her throwing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>anything down or some of the other things that the nurses testified. Certainly you can argue that to the jury, but that\u2019s not character evidence as is contemplated by the rule or by the law. Certainly you can argue that the State\u2019s witnesses should not be believed in the balance of things because you have people who say she never got angry, never threw anything, was even-tempered, other people said she got angry, she cursed, she hollered, and it\u2019s a credibility issue and I think in my credibility charge I\u2019ll deal with that. Certainly you can argue it in your summation, but it\u2019s not character testimony, so I will not be charging the character model charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The jury returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Defendant raises the following points on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN COMPELLING MR.

Ospina, supra, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>645, 571 A.2d 1373, guides our analysis. In <em>Ospina, </em>decided prior to the adoption of the present rule, we held that a defendant who was co-indicted and tried with his wife on drug-related charges had waived his privilege to preclude her testimony by waiting until the close of the State\u2019s evidence to assert it. <em>Id. </em>at 652-54, 571 A.2d 1373. We observed that although \u201c[t]he realistic prospect that a co-indicted spouse would choose to testify on [his or] her own behalf is sufficient reason to order severance of trial,\u201d neither co-defendant ever indicated that one might testify adversely to the other. <em>Id. </em>at 652-53, 571 A.2d 1373 (citing <em>State v. Infinito, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 79, 433 A.2d 816 (App.Div.1981) (Joelson, J., concurring); <em>State v. White, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 460, 480 A.2d 230 (Law Div.1984)). The wife\u2019s denied pretrial severance motion had been advanced on the theory that her husband would testify and exculpate her if he was tried first. <em>Ibid. </em>Defendant\u2019s mistrial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>severance motions after his wife\u2019s counsel forecast defendant\u2019s exculpatory testimony in his opening statement were likewise denied. <em>Id. </em>at 652-53, 571 A.2d 1373. Again, there was no mention of the possibility that either spouse intended to inculpate the other. <em>Ibid. </em>When the trial judge denied defendant\u2019s belated motion to bar the wife\u2019s testimony at the close of the State\u2019s case on the ground that defendant had waived the privilege by waiting too long to assert it, we did not hesitate to conclude that \u201c[w]hat-ever the reason\u201d for defendant\u2019s delay, including defense counsel\u2019s failed strategy or mere delayed recognition of the issue, \u201cthe lateness of the hour was sufficient cause to bar assertion of the privilege, and ... [to] visit[ ] on defendant the outcome of the game plan, where the outcome is the admission of highly relevant testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653-54, 571 A.2d 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Here, as in <em>Ospina, </em>despite their much-belated claims to the contrary, the record is devoid of any suggestion that Ejaz and defendant moved for severed trials in anticipation of testifying in their own interest and against one another. We conclude that the Baluchs\u2019 trials were severed due to <em>Bruton</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>concerns, because \u201call parties perceived that some evidence admissible as to one defendant would be inadmissible as to the other\u201d and \u201c[t]hese \u2018differently admissible\u2019 proofs were perceived as being too numerous and too significant for a joint trial.\u201d Neither Ejaz nor defendant \u201cunequivocally made [the requisite] pretrial motion for severance based upon the marital privilege and ... proffered to the court the exact nature of the expected testimony.\u201d <em>Infinito, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 80, 433 A.2d 816 (Joelson, J., concurring), <em>White, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 460, 480 A.2d 230. To the contrary, they simply miscalculated the purpose, scope, and magnitude of the spousal privilege in relation to other privileges, as well as the effect that an unexpressed or undeveloped \u201cgame plan\u201d of excul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>pating Ejaz by inculpating defendant would have upon the latter\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Ejaz had already waived the spousal privilege when on direct examination at his own trial, he inculpated defendant and testified that she verbally and physically abused Imelda. This occurred before the possibility that he might be called to testify at defendant\u2019s trial was even recognized by Ejaz. Even then, he only belatedly weighed the advantages of characterizing defendant\u2019s incriminating statements as inadmissible hearsay in order to preserve the confidential marital communications privilege, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>509,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> not at issue here, <em>cf.

The rule favors the \u201cbroad admissibility\u201d of prior inconsistent statements offered by an adverse party, and thus imposes no \u201cspecial reliability\u201d requirement in addition to the core admissibility requirements of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1) that the prior statement be inconsistent with the witness\u2019 trial testimony, offered in compliance with <em>N.J.R.E. </em>613, and independently admissible under a hearsay exception. <em>See, e.g., State v. Leopardi, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>70, 81-82, 701 A.2d 952 (App.Div.1997), <em>certif. denied, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>48, 707 A.2d 152 (1998); <em>State v.

However, where the proponent of the witness offers the witness\u2019 prior inconsistent out-of-court statement for any purpose, the admissibility of the statement is further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>limited by the additional requirement of a threshold showing that the statement was given \u201cin a form and under circumstances importing special reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107, 701 A.2d 952 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1)(A), (B); Biunno, <em>supra, </em>comment 2 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>607 (noting that a prior inconsistent statement offered for impeachment purposes must also comply with the requirements of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1)). It is well established that a propounding party witness\u2019 out-of-court written or recorded statement sought to be admitted under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1)(A) (formerly <em>Evid. R. </em>63(l)(a)(i)) must be evaluated by the trial judge at an <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 or <em>\u201cGross\u201d </em>hearing outside of the jury\u2019s presence considering a number of factors \u201cto determine whether the statement was made or signed under circumstances establishing sufficient reliability that the factfinder may fairly consider it as substantive evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Spruell, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>32, 46, 577 A.2d 821 (1990) (quoting <em>State v.

R. </em>63(1)(a)(ii)), no antecedent reliability hearing is required. This is so because such statements are already considered to be sufficiently reliable as substantive evidence of the matter asserted by virtue of the inherent trustworthiness of testimony given under oath before a fact finder while subject to contemporaneous cross-examination. <em>See State v. Mancine, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>232, 246, 590 A.2d 1107 (1991); <em>State v. Caraballo, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>545, 554-55, 750 A.2d 177 (App.Div.2000); <em>State v.

Gross, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10-15, 577 A.2d 806 (1990). <em>But see State v. Johnson, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247, 261, 670 A.2d 1100 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>587, 677 A.2d 759 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>(1996) (affirming the trial judge\u2019s <em>Gross </em>hearing reliability finding of a recalcitrant murder trial witness\u2019 prior inconsistent <em>grand jury </em>testimony inculpating defendants). To require a reliability hearing to test Ejaz\u2019s statement from his plenary jury trial would, in essence, amount to a retrial of Ejaz and call into question the jury\u2019s fact-finding. Such a result creates an untenable anomaly. We are satisfied that the inherent reliability requirement of prior sworn testimony under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1)(B) was met given Ejaz\u2019 voluntary testimony at his own trial, and note that the judge fully instructed defendant\u2019s jury on the factors he considered to be relevant in assessing the reliability of Ejaz\u2019 prior statement. As such, we need not delve into the further reliability of Ejaz\u2019 testimony under the <em>\u201cMancine </em>factors\u201d to be considered under an <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1)(A) proffer as urged by defendant, <em>see Mancine, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 248, 590 A.2d 1107, before turning directly to the issue of the admissibility of Ejaz\u2019 <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1)(B) prior inconsistent statement as an independent exception to the rule against hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Defendant concedes that the portion of Ejaz\u2019 prior testimony to the effect that he sought Hussein\u2019s aid to dispose of Imelda\u2019s body was admissible as a statement against his interest under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(25). She only contends that Ejaz\u2019 related self-exculpatory statement that he told Hussein defendant had beaten Imelda on the day of her death should have been redacted or the entire statement barred pursuant to <em>State v. Gomez, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 215, 587 A.2d 272 (App.Div.1991), because that allegation was incompetent and inadmissible under the personal knowledge requirement of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>602 and any hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>602 provides, in relevant part, that \u201ca witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the testimony of the witness himself.\u201d This rule poses no barrier to the admissibility of Ejaz\u2019 statement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>defendant beat Imelda on March 11, 1996 and that Imelda fell down the stairs during the course of the beating. Both experts\u2019 testimony established that Imelda could have sustained consistent injuries had she fallen down a flight of stairs. Moreover, both Ejaz\u2019 and defendant\u2019s testimony established not only that Ejaz discovered Imelda\u2019s body immediately after a conversation with defendant, but that they decided to \u201cdump\u201d Imelda\u2019s body as a result of their subsequent conversation. This all occurred prior to Ejaz\u2019 call to Hussain. Such corroborative evidence was sufficient for a factfinder to conclude that Ejaz\u2019 statement to Hussein was based on personal knowledge gained through his conversations with defendant immediately before and after the discovery of Imelda\u2019s body. Whether Ejaz\u2019 or defendant\u2019s versions of what those conversations encompassed was a fabrication went to the weight of their testimony, and not to its admissibility. <em>State v. Feaster, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>1, 78-80, 716 A.2d 395 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>_ U.S. _, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>1380, 149 L.Ed.2d 306 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Although we agree with defendant that the portion of Ejaz\u2019 statement inculpating her was inadmissible as that of a party-opponent under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1) or as against defendant\u2019s interest under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(25) because the statement was not made by defendant, we also agree with the trial judge that the statement was independently admissible both as an excited utterance under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(2) and as that of a co-conspirator under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(2) provides that \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition and without opportunity to deliberate or fabricate\u201d is not excluded by the rule against hearsay. Factors to be considered in determining whether the declarant\u2019s statement was truly spontaneous and made solely under the stress of excitement, rather than the product of an opportunity for deliberation and fabrication, include the circumstances of the event, the amount of time that transpired between the declarant\u2019s perception of the event and the utterance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>the declarant\u2019s mental or physical condition, including the degree of shock produced, and the nature of the statement itself, including whether it was against the declarant\u2019s interest and whether it was volunteered or given in response to a question. <em>Truchan v. Sayreville Bar and Restaurant, Inc., </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>40, 48-49, 731 A.2d 1218 (App.Div.1999); <em>State v.

Our recent explorations of the issue demonstrate that the determinative element is not the precise amount of time which elapsed between the event and the statement, but rather whether the facts and circumstances reasonably warrant the inference that the declarant was still under the stress of excitement caused by the event. <em>Truchan, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 49, 731 A.2d 1218; <em>Lazarchick, supra, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 522, 715 A.2d 365. The passage of one hour or more between the event and an excited utterance is well within the parameters of prior decisions admitting such statements, <em>Truchan, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 49-50, 731 A.2d 1218 (collecting cases); <em>Lazarchick, supra, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 522-23, 715 A.2d 365 (same), and testimony that the declarant was still in a state of \u201cshock\u201d at the time of the utterance is virtually dispositive of its admissibility, <em>see State v. Swint, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236, 255 n. 4, 745 A.2d 570 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>492, 758 A.2d 651 (2000); <em>State v.

Although the trial judge correctly noted his concern that Ejaz might have contemplated \u201csetting up\u201d a defense by inculpating defendant prior to calling Hussain, he ultimately concluded that the circumstance of \u201cjust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>[having] discovered that the maid was dead\u201d coupled with \u201ca very-short period of time\u201d between that discovery and Ejaz\u2019 phone call to Hussain was sufficient to establish the spontaneity and admissibility of Ejaz\u2019 statement as an excited utterance. We find no abuse of discretion in that regard, particularly in light of the untenable logic that Ejaz inculpated defendant to induce Hussain\u2019s aid because Hussain hated her, rather than because Ejaz was still laboring under the stress of excitement. We also note that Ejaz\u2019 prior elicited testimony on direct examination at his own trial that he was still \u201cin shock .... complete shock\u201d in the five minutes preceding his statement to Hussain precluded his implicit claim to the contrary at defendant\u2019s trial. <em>See </em>Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 13.5 on <em>R. </em>4:5-4 (2001) (discussing the doctrine of judicial estoppel); <em>Country-Wide Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins.

New Jersey Transit Bus Operations, Inc., </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 311-12, 762 A.2d 297 (App.Div.2000) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Even if we were to exclude Ejaz\u2019 statement as inadmissible under the excited utterance exception to the rule against hearsay, there is an additional basis supporting admissibility. Ejaz\u2019 statements to Hussain are also admissible under the co-conspirator hearsay exception, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(5), which provides that \u201cstatement[s] made at the time the party and the declarant were participating in a plan to commit a crime or civil wrong ... made in furtherance of that plan\u201d are not excluded by the rule against hearsay. That is, a co-conspirator\u2019s statement is admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(5) provided the statement was made in furtherance and during the course of the conspiracy and evidence independent of the hearsay itself establishes the existence of the conspiracy and the defendant\u2019s relationship to it. <em>State v. Phelps, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>500, 510, 476 A.2d 1199 (1984); <em>State v.

There is no requirement that defendants be charged with conspiracy in order for the rule to apply. <em>State v.

Carbone, </em>10 <em>N.J. </em>329, 338-39, 91 A.2d 571 (1952). We conclude that Ejaz\u2019 and defendant\u2019s testimony plainly demonstrated that Ejaz\u2019 statement to Hussain was made in furtherance of a conspiracy to hinder either Ejaz\u2019 or defendant\u2019s apprehension by seeking to induce Hussain\u2019s aid in disposing of Imelda\u2019s body, that the statement was made during the course of that conspiracy, and, as corroborated by the statement itself, that the Baluchs\u2019 plan to hinder their apprehension existed and that defendant participated in the plan. <em>See State v.

This argument warrants little discussion. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Defendant failed to object to such testimony not only on Ragasa\u2019s direct examination, but also to her own expert\u2019s similar testimony on cross-examination. Indeed, she invited both experts\u2019 explicit use of the term \u201chomicide\u201d by actively proposing it in the course of Ragasa\u2019s voir dire not only to ascertain his credentials, but to undermine his credibility as a forensic expert. <em>Cf. State v. Jamerson, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>318, 340, 708 A.2d 1183 (1998). Under the plain error rule, we disregard alleged trial errors or omissions not \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result,\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2, and generally decline to consider issues not raised below. Pressler, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>supra, </em>comments <em>on R 2:6-2 </em>and <em>R. </em>2:10-2 (2001); <em>State v.

His opinion that this was \u201ca case of homicide,\u201d although bluntly articulated, was the functional equivalent of ruling out the possibility that Imelda\u2019s multiple injuries were self-inflicted or sustained as a result of mere inadvertence (i.e., accident). Moreover, the characterization was immediately qualified by his further expert opinion that Imelda did not die of natural causes because the pneumonia preceded her most severe injuries and, alone, would have been insufficient to cause her death. That testimony was neither the expression of a forbidden lay opinion unnecessary to the determination of a fact in issue within the ken of an average juror, nor a prohibited direct opinion that defendant was guilty of any form of homicide. Rather, it was a legitimate expert opinion that the instrumentality and manner of Imelda\u2019s death, were, in the words of defense counsel, \u201ca human agency, [and] ... another human being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">As the judge properly charged the jury on expert testimony and witness credibility, defendant raised the issue on Ragasa\u2019s voir dire, and the defense expert also testified as to the possibility of homicide, we perceive no error requiring our intervention. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">\n<em>D.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">Defendant also contends that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying her motion in limine to exclude Lolita\u2019s and defendant\u2019s co-workers\u2019 testimony concerning defendant\u2019s temperament and abusive conduct toward Imelda, and in admitting this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>and Ejaz\u2019 similar testimony, without her objection, as evidence of defendant\u2019s motive, intent, and identity for the murder charge under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). She claims that the testimony concerning defendant\u2019s distaste for and prior physical abuse of Imelda was inadmissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) because motive, intent, and identity were never in dispute and because defendant did not \u201copen the door\u201d to propensity character evidence under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(a)(1). Specifically, defendant contends that the judge erred by failing to exclude, sua sponte: (1) Ejaz\u2019 testimony that defendant \u201cslapped Imelda on two prior occasions, and ... had a bad temper and often yelled at Imelda\u201d; (2) Lolita\u2019s testimony that defendant \u201cwas always upset with Imelda and hit her \u2018lots of times\u2019 \u201d; and (3) defendant\u2019s co-workers\u2019 statements that defendant banged patients\u2019 charts and spoke loudly at work when she was angry, referred to Imelda as \u201cSLB\u201d in conversation, and told them that she had slapped Imelda and pulled her hair, banged Imelda\u2019s head against a wall, and ordered Imelda to bang her own head against a wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">As a threshold matter, we observe that defendant offered no objection to this testimony by Ejaz and Lolita at trial, and that her only objections to the co-workers\u2019 testimony challenged the statements as to relevancy, leading, and personal knowledge, and were interposed only with respect to defendant\u2019s acronym for Imelda, her temperament at work, and a telephone call. We also note that although <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404 was never offered as a ground for any objection, and no immediate limiting instruction was requested, the judge nevertheless properly gave a \u201cprior bad acts\u201d limiting instruction after the first of defendant\u2019s co-workers testified for the State. <em>See State v. Angoy, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 89-90, 746 A.2d 1046 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>138, 754 A.2d 1214 (2000) (noting that \u201ca prompt delivery of limiting instructions, either before, simultaneously with, or immediately after, the admission of other crimes evidence is preferable, and ... should be standard procedure\u201d). Finally, while defendant requested a character witness charge, defendant did not request a specific prior bad acts jury charge or challenge the judge\u2019s final limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>instructions that the testimony of defendant\u2019s co-workers could not be considered as propensity evidence, but rather only as: (1) evidence of defendant\u2019s motive, intent, state of mind, knowledge or purpose under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) on the murder charge; (2) substantively as admissions against interest, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(25); and (3) as direct evidence of the second-degree aggravated assault charge, provided the jurors found the co-workers\u2019 testimony that defendant made those statements to be credible. Absent an objection, we address these issues under the plain error rule, <em>R. </em>2:10-2, and necessarily infer that counsel perceived the alleged errors to be of no moment at the time of trial, <em>State v. Eatman, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 298-99, 774 A.2d 571 (App.Div.2001); <em>State v.

We conclude that the evidence of defendant\u2019s temperament toward and prior physical abuse of Imelda was properly admitted under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) as evidence of defendant\u2019s motive, state of mind, and identity, and was properly submitted to the jury as evidence of her motive, intent, state of mind, knowledge or purpose as to the murder and lesser included charges of aggravated and reckless manslaughter. Her statements to her co-workers were properly admitted as statements against interest and as direct evidence of the second-degree aggravated assault and lesser included charges of third-degree aggravated assault and simple assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Even if that evidence had been improperly admitted as to the greater charges of murder and second-degree assault, the error would be harmless. The evidence was clearly admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>402, 403, 404(b), and 803(c)(25), as to those issues on the lesser included reckless manslaughter and assault charges. Moreover, the judge conveyed the \u201cessential point\u201d both in his immediate and final limiting instructions that the evidence was to be considered solely for those purposes as to the homicide and assault charges and not as proof of defendant\u2019s predisposition to commit the charged offenses. <em>State v.

Lolita\u2019s and defendant\u2019s co-workers\u2019 subsequent testimony concerning defendant\u2019s ill will and temper toward Imelda was properly admitted as rebuttal evidence to establish the contrary under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(a)(1). <em>See, e.g., State v.

The issues of defendant\u2019s motive, intent, and state of mind, as well as the identity of Imelda\u2019s assailant, were in serious dispute. Indeed, defendant maintained that she liked Imelda and had never caused her injury, and that Imelda\u2019s injuries \u201cwere caused either accidentally or at the hand of someone else\u201d \u2014 presumably, as suggested by defense counsel, \u201ca five-foot-nine inch, 165 pound man who gets massages as part of this nanny\u2019s duties.\u201d Moreover, despite Ejaz\u2019 claim that he lied to Hussain about Imelda having fallen down the stairs during the course of a beating delivered by defendant, that testimony also raised a genuine issue as to whether Imelda\u2019s fall down a flight of stairs, if any, was caused by her pneumonia or recklessly or intentionally caused by defendant. Defendant\u2019s prior physical abuses of Imelda were similar in kind and consistent with the head and facial injuries Imelda sustained before her death. Defendant\u2019s co-workers described incidents that were part of an ongoing course of conduct during Imelda\u2019s seventeen-month stay with the Baluchs, and all were reasonably close in time to the events at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We are satisfied that the probative value of this evidence was not outweighed by its potential for prejudice. As recently noted in a different context, acts of domestic violence \u201coccur in the refuge of a home shielded from public view,\u201d where \u201c[t]oo often the only people who know what occurred are the abuser and the abused.\u201d <em>Sanders, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 590, 727 A.2d 1063 (Steinberg, J., dissenting in part). \u201cAs a result, frequently other-crime evidence is necessary as the only means of proof of a genuine issue of contested fact.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the evidence was clearly relevant and admissible to establish defendant\u2019s motive, state of mind, and intent to harm Imelda, and to negate the defense theory that Imelda\u2019s injuries had been caused by Ejaz or an accidental fall down the stairs due to her pneumonia. Because the evidence was offered for these purposes, and not for the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>purpose of establishing defendant\u2019s propensity of violence toward Imelda, we conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting this critical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We also reject defendant\u2019s contention that the judge abused his discretion in admitting her co-workers\u2019 statements as direct proof of the second-degree (and lesser included) aggravated assault charges, which encompassed the entire period of time Imelda lived in defendant\u2019s home. Defendant asserts that proof that she \u201cslapped\u201d Imelda and \u201cpulled her hair\u201d was irrelevant to the greater charge that defendant purposely, knowingly, or recklessly caused Imelda\u2019s rib fractures, which defendant deems \u201cthe <em>only </em>serious bodily injury\u201d alleged during that time frame. Defendant does not address the evidence of \u201chead banging,\u201d or explain why Imelda\u2019s described head injuries \u2014 dimpling, bulging, and extensive hemorrhaging \u2014 might not also have constituted serious bodily injury, other than that the judge did not specifically discuss her head injuries, as he did the rib fractures. Athough the judge read the definition of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d to the jury, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-la, he did not specify which of Imelda\u2019s injuries would satisfy that standard. The issue was for the jury to decide. <em>State v. Sloane, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>293, 298-99, 544 A.2d 826 (1988). We note that Dr. Ragasa opined that Imelda\u2019s fat emboli might have been caused as a result of the rib fractures or <em>any </em>of her soft-tissue injuries, including her multiple blunt-force trauma head injuries. Given Imelda\u2019s head injuries, the evidence of headbanging was clearly relevant to the charge of second-degree aggravated assault, the testimony concerning hair pulling and slapping was admissible as an integral part of the mosaic of defendant\u2019s course of conduct toward Imelda during the time frame specified in the assault indictment, and the alleged error, if any, was harmless in any event in light of the jury\u2019s verdict that defendant was guilty of third-, and not second-degree aggravated assault. <em>See State v. Cherry, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>503, 522, 674 A.2d 589 (App.Div.1995) (\u201c[e]vidence of events that take place during the same time frame as the crime charged in the indictment will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>not be excluded if the evidence establishes the context of the criminal event, explains the nature of, or presents the full picture of the crime to the jury\u201d); <em>Krivacska, supra, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 40, 775 A.2d 6 (discussing harmless error in light of jury\u2019s failure to convict on greatest charged offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>E.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the trial judge erred by refusing to charge the jury on evidence of defendant\u2019s good character as offered by her co-workers and friends is clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). As previously noted, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(a)(1) and 405(a) require that evidence of good character must concern a character trait pertinent to the charged offenses and must be in the form of reputation or opinion testimony. Defendant\u2019s friends\u2019 and coworkers\u2019 comments that she was \u201ca hard-working nurse and devoted wife and mother\u201d was wholly irrelevant to any pertinent character trait tending to show that she had no propensity to abuse household help, and the requested charge was thus properly denied. <em>See e.g., State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 466-69, 236 A.2d 385 (1967) (affirming trial court\u2019s refusal to charge jury on murder defendant\u2019s own \u201cgood character\u201d testimony of, essentially, no prior convictions); <em>Steensen, supra, </em>35 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 106-07, 113 A.2d 203 (noting that reputation or opinion evidence of good character must relate to a pertinent character trait).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\n<em>F.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Defendant also contends, for the first time on appeal, that the trial judge erred by failing to either declare a mistrial or excuse juror number 13 sua sponte. We conclude that this issue is without merit, <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2), and does not warrant an extensive discussion. Suffice it to say that defendant not only failed to raise the issue at trial, <em>R. </em>2:10-2, but affirmatively waived it by persuasively arguing outright both that juror number 13 should be retained and that the jury could still reach a fair and impartial verdict based solely upon the evidence and not upon any extra\u00f1e<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ous influences. \u201cThe defendant cannot beseech and request the trial court to take a certain course of action, and upon adoption by the court, take his chance on the outcome of the trial, and if unfavorable, then condemn the very procedure [s]he sought and urged, claiming it to be error and prejudicial.\u201d <em>State v.

Absent any testimony from defendant concerning the stairs in her home, and any offer of proof to the contrary, the judge surmised, as do we from the record, that counsel was merely continuing the sexual assault line of questioning despite the judge\u2019s admonition that the testimony sought to be elicited was \u201ctotally irrelevant and immaterial to the issues before the jury.\u201d <em>See e.g., Duffy v.
