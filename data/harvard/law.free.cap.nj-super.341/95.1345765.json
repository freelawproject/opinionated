Upon reviewing the earlier specimen, Zinterhofer revised his apparent misdiagnosis to \u201cfocally ulcerated malignant melanoma.\u201d Although Keller underwent additional surgeries and treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital to remove and control subsequent metastasises, the cancer ultimately spread throughout her body. She died in April 1995, at the age of forty-seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Plaintiff, while alive, filed an action against the hospital, Zinter-hofer, and Cyril Arvantis, M.D., the surgeon who removed the lesion, seeking damages based on alleged medical negligence. After, Keller\u2019s death, multiple amendments to the complaint were filed to substitute plaintiffs and join as party defendants various administrative personnel and a pathology resident, Rhona Alkana, who was present when Zinterhofer read the original slide. Zinter-hofer settled with plaintiff, and after dismissals as to Alkana and the other parties, plaintiff proceeded against the hospital. A jury found in favor of the hospital. Plaintiff appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">On appeal, plaintiff raises a number of issues and contends that the trial judge erred by: (1) dismissing plaintiffs claims against Alkana and failing to charge the common knowledge doctrine against both Alkana and the hospital; (2) failing to shift the burden of proof to defendants to disprove negligence; (3) failing to cure prejudice caused by defendants\u2019 discovery violations and cross-examination of plaintiffs expert; (4) denying plaintiffs request to admit an undated newspaper advertisement and to charge the jury that the hospital\u2019s duty of care was that of a specialized hospital; and (5) not permitting plaintiff to proceed on a vicarious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>liability theory against the hospital despite plaintiffs settlement with Zinterhofer. Defendants Alkana and the hospital cross-appeal and assert that they were entitled to a dismissal because plaintiff failed to serve a timely expert report and to establish proximate cause and damages prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We address plaintiffs claims seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The basic theory of plaintiffs case was that the 1990 misdiagnosis of her slides resulted from the hospital\u2019s failure to have a departmental policy in place requiring a second pathologist to reread the slides as a matter of course or the employment of a slide-spacing system to separate read slides from unread slides or one patient\u2019s slides from another. Fault was attributed to Alkana for failure to ensure that Zinterhofer read and attributed the slides to the proper patient, in this case plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">There is no question that Zinterhofer misread the 1990 slides. The experts produced by both plaintiff and defendants agreed that the applicable standard of care for any hospital pathology department, whether average or specialized, would not specifically require the routine use of slide-spacing techniques or dual-pathologist readings of all pigmented nevi slides as a matter of course in order to reduce the chance of human error. The experts also established that a pathology resident then assisting a supervising pathologist generally had no duty of care to ensure that the pathologist reviewed and reported the proper patient slides. To summarize the relevant proofs as to this issue, while a resident may have read a slide in tandem with the pathologist, the resident was not responsible for double-checking the pathologist\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">At the close of plaintiffs case, Judge Chaiet granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims against the hospital\u2019s administrative personnel and Alkana. The judge concluded that plaintiff failed to present any expert testimony suggesting that Alkana had a duty of care to ensure that Zinterhofer chose and examined the correct patient slides.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The judge also rejected plaintiffs argument that the jury should have been permitted to consider defendants\u2019 culpability under the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d theory that no expert testimony was required because whether Alkana should have checked to ensure that Zinterhofer read the proper slides was within the average ken of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... plaintiff has always asserted through a common knowledge doctrine that there should have been some way where the resident says to the doctor, do we have the right slide? And in that vein we have argued a double check system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">... I think that that\u2019s within the common province of the jury to think whether or not someone should have double checked that they were looking at the right slide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">THE COURT: And we\u2019re here to, there\u2019s been no expert testimony in regard to the resident in terms of a double checking. You\u2019ve heard that testimony. And the fact that the resident did or did not check ... the slide doesn\u2019t go to the standard in this case, which your expert has established and which is the issue that the jury will have to resolve in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">We don\u2019t really know what the resident did or didn\u2019t do in this particular ease. Because she doesn\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct. The defense expert tells us what the resident should have done in the ease. And what they do at his hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">THE COURT: Right. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>But we\u2019re not making this argument as to the resident for you to bring the resident back in. This argument is strictly as to the policies and procedures that should have been in effect.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">THE COURT: And that\u2019s what the case is about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-14\">I PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-15\">THE COURT: All right. So, your motion is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: My motion is that the testimony, the plaintiff] ] should not be able to make the argument to the jury that there was negligence on the part of the resident or the hospital as far as double checking the pathologist when he picks up the slide.. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-17\">THE COURT: All right. I really think you\u2019re probably correct there. That I wouldn\u2019t allow them to argue that the standard has been violated because of what the resident did or did not do. All right? Okay____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-18\">... All right. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-19\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Nothing further, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-20\">[ (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>At the close of defendants\u2019 case, plaintiff took exception to the absence of a jury charge on common knowledge, not as applied to Alkana, but as applied to the hospital:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: And I have no problem with the charge as worded with the exception of an issue you\u2019ve already ruled out, which is our common knowledge doctrine. You know, which I understand the Court has already ruled. I just want to take an exception to that aspect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">THE COURT: Okay. All right. Common knowledge as it applies to the resident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>No, not as to the resident. I think that there\u2019s a certain aspect of the common knowledge doctrine as it applies to the hospital </em>You know, if you have an employee and there\u2019s no program in effect to cross check to see, know you have a slide number, you know you\u2019re reading off that. And that, that doesn\u2019t take an expert. That\u2019s within our common knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">THE COURT: I disagree. All right? I mean, really the issue is should a pathologist have two pathologists reading every report he does? Should there be a spacing system? And I think that that\u2019s not within the common knowledge of every day people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">[ (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">This refusal to charge \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d forms plaintiffs claim of error. In support of her multi-faceted argument that Judge Chaiet erred in dismissing Alkana from the ease, and in failing to charge the common knowledge doctrine as to both Alkana and the hospital because no expert testimony was required to establish that defendants had the duty to ensure \u201cthat the slide the pathologist view[s] is the correct one____by simple <em>communication </em>between the hospital to require it, and the resident to acknowledge and perform it,\u201d plaintiff relies on <em>Jenoff v. Gleason, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>349, 521 A.2d 1323 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">We first observe that plaintiff is estopped from arguing that the common knowledge doctrine would apply to establish Alkana\u2019s breach of any independent duty as a resident to double-check Zinterhofer\u2019s proper matching of Keller\u2019s slides and paperwork, as it appears from counsel\u2019s representations to the trial judge that plaintiff explicitly waived that argument as to Alkana, and preserved it, if at all, only as to the hospital. <em>Cf. Brett v. Great Am. Recreation, Inc., </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>479, 503-04, 677 A.2d 705 (1996) (noting that \u201c[t]he doctrine of invited error operates to bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>a disappointed litigant from arguing on appeal that an adverse decision below was the product of error, when that party urged the lower court to adopt the proposition now alleged to be error\u201d); Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 2.5 on <em>R. </em>2:10-1; comment 13.5 on <em>R. </em>4:5-4 (2001) (discussing invited error and judicial estoppel); <em>McKenney v. Jersey City Med. Ctr., </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>568, 595-96, 750 A.2d 189 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>607, 762 A.2d 221 (2000) (noting that parties must generally adhere to the theory of law pursued at trial, and will not be heard to complain of a jury instruction submitted on a theory which apparently satisfied the appellant without objection); Pressler, <em>supra, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>2:6-2 (discussing the estoppel effect of issues waived, conceded, or not raised below). Moreover, the record does not clearly indicate what portion of the jury charge, if any, plaintiff may have objected to when given the opportunity after the charge, but rather indicates that plaintiff \u201cperceived the alleged errorfs] to be of no moment,\u201d <em>State v. Swint, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236, 256-57, 745 A.2d 570 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>492, 758 A.2d 651 (2000), and that the absence of those charges now complained of was not \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result,\u201d <em>R. </em>1:7-2 and comment 3; <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Even assuming that plaintiff preserved the common knowledge argument as to both defendants and properly objected to the absence of a common knowledge charge, his reliance upon <em>Jenoff </em>is nevertheless misplaced. Ordinarily, medical practitioners\u2019 standards of care and deviations therefrom must be established by expert testimony, as average jurors lack the \u201c \u2018requisite special knowledge, technical training and background\u2019\u201d to make those determinations without an expert\u2019s assistance. <em>Kelly v. Berlin, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>256, 264, 692 A.2d 552 (App.Div.1997) (quoting <em>Rosenberg v. Cahill, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>318, 325, 492 A.2d 371 (1985)); <em>Estate of Chin v. St. Barnabas Med. Ctr., </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>454, 469-70, 734 A.2d 778 (1999). Under the common knowledge doctrine, the absence of such testimony \u201cis not invariably fatal\u201d to a medical malpractice action if there is other testimony from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the factfinder can determine the applicable standard of care and whether it was violated. <em>Jenoff, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 357-68, 521 A.2d 1323. The common knowledge doctrine is appropriately applied only in those professional malpractice cases where the common knowledge and experience of ordinary lay persons would enable a jury to conclude without expert testimony that a standard of care applied and was breached \u2014 that is, where \u201cthe mistake was obviously the result of negligence.\u201d <em>Chin, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 470, 734 A.2d 778; <em>Kelly, supra, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 265-66, 692 A.2d 552 (citing <em>Rosenberg, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 325, 492 A.2d 371; <em>Klimko v. Rose, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>496, 503-04, 422 A.2d 418 (1980)); <em>Sanzari v. Rosenfeld, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>128, 142, 167 A.2d 625 (1961); <em>Jenoff, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 357-58, 521 A.2d 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The common knowledge doctrine has been applied in cases involving uncommon and unexpected patient injuries caused by some application of physical force by the alleged tortfeasors. <em>See, e.g., Chin, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 470, 734 A.2d 778 (holding that doctrine applied where patient\u2019s death was caused by incorrect hook-up of hysteroscope which introduced gas into bloodstream causing fatal embolism); <em>Magner v. Beth Israel Hosp., </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>529, 534, 295 A.2d 363 (App.Div.1972), <em>certif. denied, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>199, 299 A.2d 733 (1973) (holding that doctrine applied where patient was burned in flash fire when spark from cauterizing tool ignited alcohol which surgeon had applied to patient\u2019s skin); <em>Becker v. Eisenstodt, </em>60 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240, 246-47, 158 A.2d 706 (App.Div.1960) (holding that doctrine applied where rhinoplasty patient\u2019s nose and upper lip were severely burned and disfigured by nostril pledget apparently soaked in a caustic liquid rather than anesthetic solution before insertion by physician); <em>Steinke v. Bell, </em>32 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 69-70, 107 A.2d 825 (App.Div.1954) (holding that doctrine applied where dentist engaged to remove patient\u2019s lower left molar also extracted or caused removal of her upper right lateral incisor).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Depending upon the identity of a defendant' and established hospital protocol or a recognized standard of care, the doctrine has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>also been applied where a failure to communicate a patient\u2019s known dangerous health condition directly to the treating physician or patient causes a delay in treatment and subsequent harm to the patient. <em>Compare, e.g., McKenney, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 591-93, 750 A.2d 189 (holding that doctrine did not obtain where incontrovertible evidence established that sonographer\u2019s conduct in recording physician\u2019s suggestion for follow-up study of defective fetus and leaving sonogram and note with unit secretary for perinatologist\u2019s review fully comported with hospital protocol and accepted standard of care for sonogram technicians, who had no duty to make certain a reading physician\u2019s suggestion was actually implemented by other physicians), <em>with Tramutola v. Bortone, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>503, 510-14, 288 A.2d 863 (App.Div.1972), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>9, 304 A.2d 197 (1973) (holding that doctrine applied where treating physician failed to inform patient that x-rays clearly showed a surgical needle had been left in her lung after a lobectomy, and the omitted communication allowed encapsulation of the needle in scar tissue, causing surrounding tissue rigidity, pain, and impossibility of later removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In <em>Jenoff, supra, </em>we held that the common knowledge doctrine obtained in the absence of expert testimony explicitly delineating a radiologist\u2019s duty of care in choosing the method by which he communicated his findings of a lung tumor to an orthopaedic patient\u2019s treating physicians where there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could determine the applicable standard and whether it had been violated. 215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 357-59, 521 A.2d 1323. We noted that defendants\u2019 non-expert witness testimony established that regardless of any radiology department protocol, the exigencies of various medical situations required different modes of communicating radiology results as a matter of course, ranging from giving notice of benign findings through regular administrative channels, to the radiologist\u2019s immediate and direct notice to the patient\u2019s primary care physician of any unusual findings. <em>Id. </em>at 355-57, 521 A.2d 1323. In that context, we concluded that \u201c[mjodes of communication are not so peculiarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>within the expertise and knowledge of the medical profession as to necessitate expert testimony,\u201d and that the trier of fact should have been permitted to decide on the non-expert testimony whether the radiologist breached his duty of care to effectively communicate the dire discovery by merely issuing an abnormal finding report which was to be affixed to the patient\u2019s hospital chart, but became \u201clost in the shuffle\u201d for several months. <em>Id. </em>at 357, 521 A.2d 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><em>Jenoff </em>does not apply here. There is no issue concerning whether the pathologist used proper means to promptly and effectively communicate a positive finding of cancerous cells to Keller\u2019s treating physicians. The pathologist\u2019s alleged error was not in his method of communicating his erroneous 1990 diagnosis of Keller\u2019s malignant lesion as a benign mole, but rather in his failure to detect the malignancy in the first place. Whether the hospital had any duty of care to establish and <em>\u201ccommunicate </em>\u201d an institutional policy whereby pathology residents would be obliged to double-check to ensure that their supervising pathologists reviewed the proper slides, or whether those residents would have an independent duty to do so regardless of hospital protocol, are separate matters entirely, and are clearly not within the ken of average jurors for determination under the common knowledge doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Moreover, although the parties\u2019 experts offered differing opinions as to the advisability of implementing \u201cquality assurance\u201d measures to reduce the chance of human error in reading pigmented nevi slides by requiring separate readings by two board-certified pathologists, plaintiffs expert agreed that no such standard of care was required in 1990, or even at the time of trial, and offered no evidence to indicate that pathology residents had any duty of care to oversee their supervising pathologists\u2019 work either in choosing slides for review or in rendering proper diagnoses. To the contrary, plaintiffs expert clearly established that supervising pathologists are responsible for double-checking their residents\u2019 work, \u201cto let them know if it was done correctly,\u201d and plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>concedes that \u201cat <em>no time ... </em>[did Alkana] have any responsibility whatsoever\u201d for ensuring that Zinterhofer reviewed the correct slides. Given this uncontroverted evidence that Alkana\u2019s conduct fully comported with the hospital\u2019s pathology laboratory protocol, and the absence of any expert opinion sufficient to create a jury issue as to whether that protocol violated an established standard of care in 1990 by failing to require double-checking of Zinterhofer\u2019s routine laboratory work by any other physician, pathologist or resident, Judge Chaiet did not err in dismissing Alkana from the case and in refusing to submit the issues of Monmouth Medical\u2019s and Alkana\u2019s liability to the jury under the common knowledge doctrine. <em>See McKenney, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 593, 750 A.2d 189; <em>Jenoff, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 357-58, 521 A.2d 1323; <em>R. </em>1:7-2; <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Plaintiff next contends that the trial judge erred by failing to shift the burden of proof from plaintiff to each of the defendants to prove their non-culpability pursuant to <em>Anderson v. Somberg, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>291, 338 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>423 <em>U.S. </em>929, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>279, 46 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>258 (1975), and <em>Chin, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>454, 734 A.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The principle of burden shifting recognized in <em>Anderson </em>is founded on the doctrine of alternative liability and a policy determination that a no cause of action verdict against all possible defendants in a medical malpractice case would work an unacceptable injustice where an unconscious or helpless patient has suffered an injury bespeaking negligence but cannot otherwise recover damages because the plaintiff cannot establish which of the defendants were culpable. <em>See Anderson, supra, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 298, 338 A.2d 1; <em>Chin, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 464, 734 A.2d 778; <em>Lyons v. Premo Pharm. Labs, Inc., </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>183, 192-93, 406 A.2d 185 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>267, 412 A.2d 774 (1979). That \u201cradical shifting of burdens ... is not undertaken lightly,\u201d and has absolutely no application where a plaintiff has already identified and recovered from a culpable defendant via settlement prior to trial. <em>Lyons, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 192-93, 406 A.2d 185. Were plaintiffs theory viable, then followed to its logical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>extreme, plaintiff could systematically settle with each defendant, eliminating their exposure to further liability, and ultimately try the case against a lone remaining defendant claiming a burden shift to defendant not only to disprove culpability, but also to prove the negligence of at least one of the settling defendants that plaintiff voluntarily elected to eliminate from the case. <em>Cf. Anderson, supra, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 312, 338 A.2d 1 (Mountain, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe absence of sufficient evidence upon which a verdict might justly rest, coupled with the compulsion to reach a verdict against <em>someone, </em>removes from the case any semblance of rationality.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Here, plaintiff concedes that Zinterhofer admitted culpability and settled prior to trial, but nevertheless insists that <em>Anderson </em>should have been applied because Zinterhofer\u2019s deposition testimony that everything associated with Keller\u2019s 1990 slide had been properly labeled and that he had simply \u201csigned out the case incorrectly\u201d was withheld from the jury to avoid confusion. Plaintiff contends that absent that testimony, the requirements of <em>Anderson </em>were met, because \u201c[t]he fact that one party settles does not mean his presence in the case ceases to remain\u201d as \u201cthe jury may still evaluate his actions in comparison to Monmouth Medical\u201d in order to allocate fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u201c[T]he law will not assist an innocent plaintiff at the expense of an innocent defendant\u201d by shifting the burden of proof under the <em>Anderson </em>doctrine absent the \u201cnarrow set of factual circumstances\u201d described in <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Chin. Chin, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 465, 734 A.2d 778; <em>Anderson, supra, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 298, 338 A.2d 1; <em>Blitz v. Hutchinson, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>580, 589, 600 A.2d 485 (App.Div.1991). To shift the burden of proof to medical malpractice defendants under <em>Anderson, </em>a plaintiff is required to show: (1) that he or she is entirely blameless for the injury complained of; (2) that the injury bespeaks negligence on the part of at least one of the defendants; and (3) that all potential defendants who participated in the chain of events causing the injury are represented before the court. <em>Chin, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 465, 734 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>778; <em>McKenney, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 597-98, 750 A.2d 189. Only if these requisites are met, is the jury to be instructed that at least one of the defendants must be found liable and that they bear the burden of exonerating themselves from liability. <em>Id. </em>at 598, 750 A.2d 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In <em>Anderson, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that the burden of proof should have shifted to the defendants, a surgeon, hospital, surgical instrument manufacturer, and supplier, to disprove their liability where the faultless plaintiff was injured when the tip of an instrument which broke off during a laminectomy was permanently deposited in the plaintiffs spinal canal, because that injury clearly bespoke negligence on the part of at least one of the defendants, either through negligent manufacture or design, or mishandling or misuse of the instrument. 67 N.J. at 294-95, 302-03, 338 A.2d 1. The Court emphasized that because \u201call parties had been joined who could reasonably have been connected with that negligence or defect, it was clear that one of those parties was liable, and at least one could not succeed in his proofs.\u201d Id. at 303, 338 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In <em>Chin, supra, </em>the Court reaffirmed application of the <em>Anderson </em>doctrine where \u201cthe fact pattern ... mirror[ed] that presented in Anderson,\u201d as the unconscious surgical patient was \u201cutterly blameless,\u201d suffered a fatal injury bespeaking negligence when the incorrect hook-up of a hysteroscope gas line caused a massive embolism, and all potential defendants were before the court, including the hysteroscope manufacturer, the hospital, the physician, and all three nurses present in the operating room at the time of the procedure. 160 <em>N.J. </em>at 460-61, 465-66, 734 A.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">By contrast, we recently held in <em>McKenney, supra, </em>that the doctrine did not apply where although <em>an </em>obstetrical patient was undoubtedly without fault, it was arguable that a failure to diagnose her unborn child\u2019s spina bifida in time to terminate the pregnancy due to alleged sonogram misdiagnoses and staff communications breakdowns did not necessarily bespeak negligence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>(thus also precluding application of the common knowledge doctrine), and that not all defendants were before the court. 330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 576-77, 590-94, 598, 750 A.2d 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Here, as in <em>McKenney, </em>although Keller was without fault, the facts of her case do not \u201cmirror\u201d those of <em>Anderson, </em>because, as previously noted, she was not precluded from all recovery absent a burden shift, the hospital\u2019s and Alkana\u2019s conduct did not bespeak negligence sufficient to warrant application of the common knowledge doctrine, and Zinterhofer, having settled prior to trial, was not truly represented before the court, except through the parties\u2019 representations for their own comparative negligence damages allocation purposes. Judge Chaiet did not err in failing to charge <em>Anderson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We briefly address plaintiffs claim regarding the hospital\u2019s vicarious liability. In disposing of this claim, we quote a portion of the pre-trial colloquy between counsel and Judge Lehrer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">THE COURT: Your whole case against the hospital is failing to have procedures in effect that would have prevented Dr. Zinterhofer from making whatever mistake he made, right? Zinterhofer is not an employee of the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, there are two \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know about that. Zinterhofer was the chairman of the department responsible for putting in the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">THE COURT: Well, then let\u2019s assume that he is an employee of the hospital. He\u2019s settled. Haven\u2019t you then settled with the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: I carved out the position that he was in to be against him individually [sic], not as an agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">THE COURT: How can you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: By specifically reserving on a new release. He has two\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-13\">THE COURT: So the only way that the hospital would be liable is by respondeat superior and if he\u2019s already paid, what did the hospital do wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, the hospital has two theories against them as it stands here. One is that Zintei\u2019hofer made a mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-15\">THE COURT: Right. They\u2019ve already paid for that mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-16\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Zinterhofer on his own, correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-17\">THE COURT: But whether he\u2019s an employee or not an employee they\u2019ve already paid for that mistake. So what\u2019s the other theory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: The other theory is that the hospital should have had policies and procedures\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u2014 in effect both before and after and that he and whoever else may have been involved in the hospital in making these decisions failed to put anything in effect. So you have two situations here. You have number one, the hospital\u2019s conduct before and then afterwards you have a hospital that had\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">THE COURT: No, the only issue here is whether the hospital had committed negligence in not having policies and procedures in effect to prohibit whatever happened here, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s try the case against Zinterhofer as an employee of the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, no, I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">THE COURT: No, listen to me. No, just for the purposes of this argument let\u2019s try the case against Zinterhofer as an employee of the hospital. All right? You have a respondeat superior case against the hospital for his negligence, correct? He\u2019s admitted his negligence. He\u2019s paid for his negligence. That case against the hospital goes away, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-14\">THE COURT: Okay. So the only thing that you possibly have left is the hospital failing to have policies and procedures prior to this and subsequent to this which would have led to somebody calling Ms. Keller and saying, hey, come back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-15\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">We need not reach the merits of plaintiffs vicarious liability claim as plaintiff conceded that the issue was not viable, failed to request any jury charge in regard to the claim and never again raised the issue or presented any relevant proofs during trial. In sum, we conclude that the issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-17\">We reach the same conclusion as to the remaining issues regarding discovery and the hospital\u2019s status as a specialized pathology services provider. We have carefully scrutinized this extensive record and conclude that both arguments are without merit and do not require further comment. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-18\">Since we affirm, we need not address the issues on the cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\"> Karen Keller is deceased, and this action was prosecuted by Joseph Lucia, individually, and as executor of the estate.
