At sentencing, the trial judge merged count two into count one and sentenced defendant on the second degree possession with intent conviction to an extended term of fifteen years with a mandatory minimum period of five years before parole eligibility. However, the judgment contains no reference to any period of parole ineligibility. Nor does it impose the sentence on a count by count basis or merge count two into count one. It merely states \u201cdefendant found guilty on [counts] 1^4 jury trial. 15 years N.J.S.P. (all counts concurrent).\u201d Further, as the State candidly points out, penalties and assessments should not have been imposed on the merged count. It requests a remand \u201cto the trial court for entry of an amended judgment of conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">In imposing sentence, the trial judge indicated that he was imposing the presumptive extended term and a mandatory minimum term in connection therewith. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6f. The mandatory minimum, as the judge noted, had to be between one-third and one-half of the specific term sentence. Defendant does not contest that his appeal may provide the basis for correction of the judgment and inclusion of a mandatory minimum parole ineligibility term on a judgment that otherwise did not provide it. In any event, the oral decision controls, <em>see State v.

The trooper testified regarding events on July 31, 1997, and Investigator Malone testified as an expert with respect to defendant\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">According to Trooper Fitzhenry, at about 7:39 p.m. on July 31, 1997, he observed a red Ford with Pennsylvania license plates on the New Jersey Turnpike in Ridgefield Park. The vehicle was \u201ctravelling southbound at around mile marker 119\u201d \u201ccoming from [Interstate] 95 towards the inner roadway southbound towards the New Jersey Turnpike.\u201d The vehicle was \u201cdirectly in front of\u2019 the trooper and \u201ctravelled over the line onto the left and then swerved over to the right line of the demarcation ... to the lane next to it and went back and forth a few different times.\u201d Fitzhenry continued to follow the vehicle which \u201cchanged lanes without using its signal.\u201d Fitzhenry then \u201cactivated [his] overhead emergency lights and stopped the vehicle ... at mile marker 117.8 on the inner roadwayt ] of the New Jersey Turnpike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">According to Fitzhenry, \u201cthe driver exited from the vehicle, ran towards the front of his car around to the right, back around his car\u201d and when ordered to stop, \u201cretrieve[d] a package from the right front portion of his pants and threw it across the highway.\u201d \u201cIt was a package ... roughly the size of a softball or so, wrapped in silver duct tape.\u201d The object \u201clanded on the right shoulder of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the outer roadway.\u201d The driver, identified as defendant, \u201ccontinued to run past [the trooper\u2019s] vehicle,\u201d and though directed to stop, he continued to push the trooper before being finally \u201csubdued\u201d by the officer after he did not \u201cvoluntarily stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In the interim, the other occupant of the vehicle \u201cfled the scene\u201d before Fitzhenry was able to place defendant in the rear of the \u201ctrooper ear.\u201d Thereafter, backup arrived and Fitzhenry \u201cretrieved the package [defendant had thrown] from the right shoulder\u201d of the Turnpike. \u201cIt was a softball sized hard chunky substance wrapped in silver duct tape.\u201d The contents were tested and found to contain 89.38 grams or 3.15 ounces of crack cocaine. The State also established that defendant lived in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Senior Investigator Malone testified that in her opinion, defendant possessed the cocaine \u201cfor intent to distribute.\u201d Her opinion was based on \u201cthe amount alone ... because it is not consistent with a personal use amount for crack cocaine\u201d together with the fact that \u201cthere was no paraphernalia for ingestion of the substance\u201d and that \u201cthe individual ... tested negative ... for a substance.\u201d She also testified that in Philadelphia, \u201cthe street level value of that amount [involved] would be approximately $8,800.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The evidence was more than sufficient to sustain the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s summation \u201cimproperly put in the mind of the jury, a burden on the Defendant to testify or present evidence.\u201d He challenges the following portion of the summation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">Ladies and gentlemen, the only evidence you heard in this case was the version by Trooper Fitzhenry. There was no evidence to directly contradict his version of events. And I would submit to you that his version[ ] of events is entirely credible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">There was no objection to the summation at the time of the statement, but after the summation was over defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">I didn\u2019t want to object during [the prosecutor\u2019s] closing, but I feel compelled to bring something to the Court\u2019s attention. During her closing argument she stated no contrary version to the events that took place. It think that that is a violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>Griffin versus California, </em>[380 <em>U.S. </em>609, 85 <em>S.Ct. 1229, </em>14 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>106 (1965),] because in effect it creates an inference to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. That\u2019s improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, and the prosecutor indicated that she did not think the remark was \u201cimproper in the context of this case where the allegations were that the trooper fabricated the story.\u201d The trial judge denied the mistrial. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">I don\u2019t feel it creates such an inference. I feel that the Prosecutor clearly stated that the defendant has no obligation to come forward; that she was making reference to the one witness that the State had that was uncontroverted by any other witnesses, be it State\u2019s witnesses or defense witnesses other than the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">It is true that the defense summation was based on Trooper Fitzhenry\u2019s lack of credibility. In any event, during colloquy with counsel the trial judge indicated that he would instruct that defendant had \u201cno responsibility\u201d to testify, and did instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">The defendant in this case chose not to be a witness. It is the constitutional right of a defendant to remain silent. That should not in any way be held against him. I charge you that you are not to consider for any purpose or any manner in arriving at your verdict the fact that the defendant did not testify, nor should that fact enter into your deliberations or discussions in any <em>manner or </em>at any <em>time. </em>The defendant is entitled to have the jury to consider all of the evidence, and he is entitled to the presumption of innocence even if he does not testify as a witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">We find no basis for reversal as a result of the single comment of the prosecutor in summation. <em>See, e.g., State v. Scherzer, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 439-42, 694 A.2d 196 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>466, 700 A.2d 878 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Finally, defendant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. He asserts that the issue of selective enforcement or \u201cracial profiling\u201d should have been raised by counsel. According to defendant (in his counselled brief):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">In this case the issue was never brought up by his counsel. The first opportunity would have been a pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence____ Another opportunity would have been [at] oral argument at the time of trial. And lastly, the questioning of the appropriate witnesses on this matter. This issue was not raised at any point in the process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">In fact, from our review of the record, the only time the issue of race arose was when Officer Fitzhenry testified on direct examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tion that when stopping the vehicle, he \u201cnoticed that there were two black males inside the vehicle.\u201d In his <em>pro se </em>supplementary brief, defendant asserts this is a \u201cracial profiling\u201d case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Through counsel, defendant asks us to remand the matter to the trial court \u201cto explore this issue [of selective enforcement (racial profiling)] and allow for discovery on the matter.\u201d He asserts that this is appropriate because of \u201cthe similarity of facts\u201d in <em>State v. Soto, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 734 A.2d 350 (Law Div.1996). However, unlike <em>Soto, </em>this case involves no record in support of a claim of racial profiling or selective enforcement, and no such issue was raised in the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">In <em>State v. Ross, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>536, 763 A.2d 281 (App.Div.2000), we permitted defendant to raise an issue of \u201cracial profiling\u201d on direct appeal because the issue \u201cwas raised\u201d at trial, \u201calthough defendant failed to present any evidence of selective enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541, 763 A.2d 281. Defendant had argued at the motion to suppress that counsel \u201cbelieved\u201d that racial profiling existed and was involved in the case. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">In <em>State v. Williamson, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>544, 763 A.2d 285 (App.Div.2000), we permitted a defendant to raise an issue of racial profiling by motion for new trial \u201cwhile his direct appeal was pending,\u201d where defendant had raised issues \u201cduring a pretrial motion to suppress sufficient to establish a colorable basis for a claim of selective enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545, 763 A.2d 285. We ruled that \u201csince this case was still subject to direct appeal at the time defendant raised his claim of selective enforcement, the claimed infringements on his constitutional rights, if proven, were clearly capable of producing an unjust result and may be asserted as constituting the equivalent of \u2018plain error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 763 A.2d 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Velez, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 763 A.2d 290 (App.Div.2000), we concluded that defendant\u2019s guilty plea following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the denial of his motion to suppress did not constitute a waiver of a claim of \u201cselective enforcement\u201d or \u201cracial profiling\u201d raised for the first time on appeal, when defendant sufficiently raised the issue or what could be perceived as a claim of \u201cracial profiling\u201d in advancing the motion to suppress, the denial of which was preserved for appeal under the plea-preservation rule, <em>R. </em>3:5-7(d). <em>Id. </em>at 557-58, 763 A.2d 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In <em>Ross, Williamson </em>and <em>Velez, </em>we remanded to the judge designated by the Supreme Court to consider issues regarding discovery in cases involving claims of \u201cracial profiling\u201d by the State Police. After proceedings before him, the motions to suppress are to be reconsidered by the motion judge, together with claims specifically directed to the issues of \u201cselective enforcement\u201d or \u201cracial profiling.\u201d <em>See State v. Velez, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 558-60, 763 A.2d 290. <em>See also State v. Williamson, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 551, 763 A.2d 285; <em>State v. Ross, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 541, 543, 763 A.2d 281. Unlike those cases, however, here there was no motion to suppress to be reconsidered on the basis of the discovery being sought. We nevertheless remand for further proceedings before the designated judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In <em>State v. Ballard, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>529, 752 A.2d 735 (App.Div. 2000), we examined a claim relating to a request for discovery in a Bergen County case based on the April 1999 <em>Interim Report of the State Police Review Team Regarding Racial Profiling Allegations </em>(hereinafter \u201cthe Interim Report\u201d). The State argued that the trial judge employed the wrong standard for finding that the threshold for discovery had been satisfied and that, in any event, \u201cthe lower court erred in concluding that the <em>Interim Report </em>established a colorable basis for granting discovery of the patrol records and radio logs pertaining to individual troopers in the absence of any proffer whatsoever that their behavior was racially motivated.\u201d <em>Ballard, supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 536, 752 A.2d 735. The State also contended \u201cthat the defendants in Bergen ... [C]ount[y] have not satisfied a \u2018threshold\u2019 requirement entitling them to discovery in support of their selective enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 752 A.2d 735. In remanding for consideration of the scope of discovery by the designated judge, we held that the Bergen defendants, as well as the others before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFt\">have satisfied the \u201cthreshold\u201d necessary for purposes of obtaining discovery in these cases.... The decision of the Law Division in [State <em>v. Soto, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 734 A.2d 350 (Law Div.1996)], the <em>Interim Report, </em>and the lack of any presentation of facts that indicated a change in the policy or practice of the State Police between the <em>Soto </em>decision of March 1996 and the <em>Interim Report </em>of April 1999, leads us to conclude that the threshold has been satisfied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 542-43, 752 A.2d 735.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Despite the lack of motion to suppress and any argument in the record to support suppression on \u201cprofiling\u201d grounds, we cannot reconcile the lack of remand in this case with our disposition in <em>Ballard, </em>even though that decision involved claims of \u201cracial profiling\u201d raised pretrial. Stated differently, if the <em>Soto </em>opinion and <em>Interim Report </em>were sufficient to permit the remand in <em>Ballard, </em>we cannot conclude that the opinion and report would not require the same in this case. As in <em>Ballard, </em>this State Police stop in Bergen County occurred in 1997, between the time of the <em>Soto </em>decision and the filing of the <em>Interim Report, id. </em>at 548, 752 A.2d 735, and as in <em>Ballard, </em>\u201c[t]he decision of the Law Division in <em>Soto, supra, </em>the <em>Interim Report, </em>and the lack of any presentation of facts that indicated a change in the policy or practice of the State Police between the <em>Soto </em>decision of March 1996 and the <em>Interim Report </em>of April 1999, [must] lead[ ] us to conclude that the threshold has been satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542-43, 752 A.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">To hold that defendant is entitled only to a hearing on a petition for post-conviction relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel would traditionally require this defendant who now asserts he is the victim of racial profiling to prove the two prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test, <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); see <em>also State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992); <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 519 A.2d 336 (1987), even though he asserts on a timely direct appeal a contention we have permitted to be raised as \u201cplain error\u201d on direct appeal. As a claim of selective enforcement should properly be raised on a motion to dismiss pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:10-2(c), <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>Velez, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 557-58, 763 A.2d 290, and while the failure to make such a motion generally \u201cconstitutes a waiver thereof,\u201d \u201cthe court for good cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:10-2(c). <em>See also R. </em>1:1-2 (relaxation of rules). We hold that this case, involving a direct appeal from a judgment entered following a trial, before the <em>Interim Report </em>was published, warrants a remand to the designated judge and subsequent proceedings on defendant\u2019s application to the trial judge for further relief if the discovery warrants such application. <em>See Velez, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 560, 763 A.2d 290; <em>Williamson, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 551, 763 A.2d 285; <em>Ross, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 543, 763 A.2d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction and the presumptive sentence and minimum parole ineligibility term imposed thereon and remand for further proceedings before the designated judge and for an amended judgment of conviction by the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\"> In its supplementary responding brief, the State says a motion was made and later withdrawn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-10\"> In defendant's <em>pro se </em>supplementary brief, defendant argues \"this case should be remanded for a new trial or the indictment dismissed.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
